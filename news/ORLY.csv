15,ORLY,"The $13.7 billion Amazon (AMZN) acquisition of natural foods grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM) Friday stunned the market, clobbered grocery stocks, and spurred jokes and jibes in Twitterverse. One wag tweeted ""@jeffbezos this wasn't exactly the wealth redistribution we had in mind when you'd asked yesterday.""Bezos to Alexa: ""I need some groceries.""Alexa: ""I bought you Whole Foods.""🙃😋🍏🍎🍐🍊🍋🍕📈📊— Samppa Lahtinen (@SamppaSOS) June 16, 2017So where could Amazon go next? Here are five potential industries for the e-commerce giant.XAmazon already was said to be considering an entry into the pharmaceuticals market. While speculation had centered on online drug deliveries, Amazon also could conceivably add pharmacies to Whole Foods locations, several analysts noted Friday, creating further synergies between food and drugs and online orders and in-store purchases.If Amazon enters the field, it could send tremors across the pharmaceutical food chain, from drugstore chains such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS) to pharmacy benefit managers such as Express Scripts (ESRX) and distributors such as Amerisource Bergen (ABC).Amazon did have a finger in this pie once. It backed Drugstore.com before that online retail pharmacy was acquired by Walgreens, which then shut it down.Walgreens shares fell 5% and CVS Health 3.8%, though that reflected at least in part the immediate investor concern about the impact on their food sales. Express Scripts and Amerisource Bergen also were lower.Amazon Business, its B2B or business-to-business unit launched in 2015, sold over $1 billion worth of lab equipment, deep fryers and other gear sought by business owners in the first year of operations.If the division continues to grow at such a torrid pace, it could eat the lunch of W.W. Grainger (GWW), HD Supply (HDS) and other firms in the industrial supplies sector. That market is extremely fragmented, with some 5,000 estimated players and a value of about $75 billion per year. Amazon could disrupt it with a streamlined marketplace.While HD Supply fell 1% Friday, Grainger rose 2%.Meanwhile home improvement stores Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and Floor & Decor (FND) have been Amazon-proof so far, but that may not always stay true.Amazon has automotive ambitions too. That is, it is rumored to want to move aggressively auto parts, carving out a slice of the $50 billion DIY aftermarket parts market.News that it is eyeing the auto-parts retail sector sent brick-and-mortar retailers such as AutoZone (AZO), O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) sharply lower in January. One report at that time said the online juggernaut already has contracts with Dorman Products (DORM) and other parts makers.Shares of auto-parts retailers are still mired near 52-week lows, with AutoZone 3.1%, O'Reilly Auto 1.1% and Advance Auto Parts 0.75% all falling Friday.Messaging service Slack Technologies targets the corporate chat room. That is said to make the Silicon Valley startup attractive to Amazon, which is a big player in the enterprise services market alongside Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and others.Having a messaging service could help win corporate business for Amazon Web Services. Microsoft and Google, which have their own cloud-computing businesses, have Slack-like messaging features.AWS has been key to the internet giant's streak of stellar earnings. In fact, Whole Foods could switch allegiance to Amazon Web Services from its current status as a Microsoft cloud customer given Friday's news.Slack is said to have a value of at least $9 billion, so it would be the biggest-ever acquisition for Amazon, surpassing Whole Foods.Amazon issued $1 billion in small loans in the past year to merchants on its online platform, Bloomberg reported June 7. It issues loans to sellers in the United States, United Kingdom and Japan and has plans to expand to key markets such as China.As its lending business gains momentum, Amazon could weigh on online lenders such as Lending Club (LC) as well as payment processors such as PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ), who also offer credit to users. Banks that lend heavily to small businesses could also take a hit.The lending program could also keep customers loyal to Amazon, which is seeing rivals such as eBay (EBAY) and Wal-Mart (WMT) step up their e-commerce strategy.Amazon's lending program, launched in 2011, allows it to profit both directly and indirectly — through interest rates and from more transaction fees as merchants grow sales.Shares of Amazon were rising 2.4% to 987.71 on the stock market today. Whole Foods rose 29.1% to 42.68, slightly above Amazon's 42 offer price.RELATED:What Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailAmazon-Whole Foods Merger Could Be 'Category Killer' For Food, EateriesNew Flooring Retailer Manages To Sidestep The Amazon Squeeze

Analysts had forecast earnings per share of $12 on net sales of $2.71 billion.

18,ORLY,"X The market ended May with a dull thud, running losses of 0.1% across the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average.It was the Nasdaq's seventh straight monthly advance, ending up 2.4% for May. The S&P 500 managed a 1.1% gain, while the Dow industrials eked out only the thinnest of fractional advances.Data played a key role in Wednesday's action, with the Dow industrials, Nasdaq and S&P 500 opening higher, then reversing sharply after the release of the Chicago Purchasing Manager Index for May at 9:45 a.m. ET, although a corrected version of the PMI showed a much stronger report.The first release of the Chicago PMI showed a reading of 55.2, down hard from the prior month's 58.3 tally and below the consensus view for 57.5. The corrected version showed a May reading of 59.4, its highest mark in 2-1/2 years and well above forecasts.Overnight data out of China showed better-than-expected manufacturing growth in May, but the steel, equipment and mining stocks that would normally react positively to such news came under pressure early in the session. In addition, claims from Libya that production had recovered to above its long-term ceiling of 800,900 barrels helped send crude prices down almost 3%, to $48.32 a barrel, leaving it down 2% for the month.Stocks fell, then gradually regained ground after the release of the Federal Reserve's May Beige Book, which showed continued modest growth, but increasing signs that optimism could be flagging. The report was closely watched because it's the last Beige Book report ahead of the Fed's meeting on interest rates in June, when a majority of investors expect another increase in rates.Pfizer (PFE) led the Dow industrials, up 1.6% after announcing that both the Food & Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency had accepted its submissions to expand the approved use of Sutent to include treatment for recurrent renal cell carcinoma in patients following kidney surgery. Pfizer shares are working on their first weekly advance since late April.Pressure on the S&P 500 came from Michael Kors (KORS), Tenet Healthcare (THC), Southwestern Energy (SWN) and Goldman Sachs (GS).Goldman and JPMorgan (JPM) drove the downside among Dow stocks.  Goldman tumbled 3% and JPMorgan 2% following the revelation by JPMorgan's CFO Marianne Lake, speaking at an investor conference, that the firm's trading revenue was down 15% year over year.Losses were more subdued on the Nasdaq, with O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) and Baidu (BIDU) hardest hit, down 2% apiece. At the top of the Nasdaq 100, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) rose 2.7%, taking a new high.Analog Devices (ADI) thrashed 7% higher at the open, then backtracked to close 1% higher in big trade.

19,ORLY,"The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite hit record highs on Thursday, completing a quick recovery from the May 17 market plunge as FANG stocks Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) led the way. Oil prices, which had been steadily rising ahead of OPEC's key meeting, tumbled after the cartel extended production cuts. Meanwhile, Best Buy (BBY) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) were among the few retailers to defy the sector sell-off with strong earnings and share gains. Ford (F) ousted its CEO amid woes for the auto sector.The S&P 500 rose 1.4% and the Nasdaq 2.1%, both hitting record highs. The Dow advanced 1.3% Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) rose strongly to new highs, with Amazon and Alphabet nearly hitting the 1,000 price level. Oil prices retreated after OPEC extended but didn't deepen production curbs, leaving intact a status quo that encourages shale producers. Best Buy (BBY) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) soared to record highs as they prove to be Amazon-resilient, while Lowe's (LOW) and Tiffany (TIF) struggled. Red-hot Chinese social media and live-streaming video app Momo (MOMO) cooled off despite crushing views.At its meeting Thursday, OPEC extended production cuts through March 2018 but didn't deepen output curbs as some had speculated, while keeping Libya and Nigeria exempt for the foreseeable future even as their output rises. Oil prices tumbled 4.8% that day, wiping out gains made in the weeks leading up to the meeting. On Wednesday, EIA data showed U.S. oil inventories fell for the seventh consecutive week, while production rebounded from its first dip in three months. After a Friday rebound, U.S. crude futures closed the week down 1.8% to $49.80 a barrel.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) posted a beat-and-raise Q1 that surpassed expectations, sending shares jumping to an all-time high Friday. The specialty beauty retailer's same-store sales growth of 14.3% defied conventional wisdom about traditional sellers and beat consensus for 11% comps. Profit rose 32% to $1.91 a share on 22.5% revenue growth to $1.31 billion. E-commerce sales popped 70.9%.Costco (COST) beat on both the top and bottom lines as same-store sales rose 5%, sending shares upward Friday morning. The membership warehouse is upping its annual fee next week. Dollar Tree (DLTR) fell short of views by a penny with 98 cents EPS and met sales forecasts for $5.29 billion. Comps edged up 0.5%. Outlook for Q2 was light. Burlington Stores (BURL) EPS beat by 9 cents though sales of $1.35 billion were just a hair short of estimates. The midpoint of full-year profit guidance exceeded current estimates. Burlington's shares rose Thursday but erased those gains Friday.Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) and video game vendor GameStop (GME) each reported April quarter results that beat views. But while Best Buy guided Wall Street higher for the current quarter, GameStop gave an in-line outlook. Best Buy stock soared to a record high, while GameStop sank below its 50-day moving average.The China-based social media and live-video streaming app on Tuesday reported adjusted first-quarter earnings that skyrocketed 630% vs. a year a year ago, with revenue rising 421% to $265.2 million. Those were well above estimates. But Momo (MOMO), which had reversed lower from a record high on Monday, kept falling, losing 10% as of Friday afternoon, though it did find support at its 50-day line.Video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) galloped 14% to a record high stock price after delivering better-than-expected March-quarter results. Investors shrugged off the news that Take-Two is delaying its highly anticipated Wild West shooter game ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" to spring 2018 from this fall. The focus at Take-Two has shifted from big game releases to long-term recurring revenue from major game properties like ""Grand Theft Auto Online"" and ""NBA 2K"" through downloadable content and online services.Ford (F) dumped Mark Fields after the stock and earnings had fallen sharply, lagging peers. New CEO Jim Hackett, who had run Ford's autonomous driving unit, is seen as a turnaround specialist. Meanwhile, the Justice Department sued Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), accused it of cheating on emission tests on many diesel pickup trucks. General Motors faced a new private lawsuit for allegedly installed software 'defeat devices' for various diesels as well. The diesel emissions saga took off in 2015, when Volkswagen (VLKAY) came under scrutiny.Toll Bros. (TOL) topped fiscal second-quarter earnings estimates, helped by demand for ""affordable"" luxury homes. But shares of Toll and other builders retreated as U.S. new-home sales for April fell to a level well below expectations. Existing-home sales also sank more than expected. Home-improvement retailer Lowe's (LOW) Q1 results missed.Investors punished suppliers of automotive replacement parts for big earnings misses. AutoZone (AZO) gapped down 12% Tuesday to its lowest level in more than two years. Advance Auto Parts (AAP) sank nearly 5% Tuesday, then fell 5% Wednesday after its own miss. O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), which tumbled below its 50-day line after its April 27 earnings report, fell 1.1% for the week, well off weekly lows. Their weak results and stock performances come as Amazon (AMZN) reportedly mulls breaking into the auto parts market.Adjusted profit per share advanced 47% while revenue grew 32% to $157.9 million, both comfortably topping Wall Street estimates. The cloud-based software maker for the life sciences industry also gave guidance above the Wall Street consensus. Veeva (VEEV) shares jumped 8.2% to a new record high Friday.Dycom said its adjusted Q3 earnings were $1.30 a share, up 20% from a year earlier, with revenue rising 18% to $786.3 million for the period ended April 29. Both topped views. But the telecom installer forecast EPS in a range of $1.35 to $1.50 and revenue in a range of $789 million to $810 million vs. consensus estimates of $1.79 and $849.4 million. Dycom shares plunged more than 22% for the week.Upscale jeweler Tiffany (TIF) reported better-than-expected Q1 earnings Wednesday, but revenue fell short and same-store sales unexpectedly declined. Signet Jewelers (SIG), parent of mall-based Kay Jewelers, Zales, and Jared The Galleria of Jewelry, missed on earnings. Shares of both retailers tumbled.NetApp (NTAP) topped earnings and sales views, but gave weak guidance. Shares, which fell late Wednesday, rallied 3.5% in Thursday's regular session, retaking its 50-day line. But NetApp gave up some of those gains Friday.Splunk (SPLK) reported a smaller-than-expected Q1 adjusted per-share loss while revenue topped views, but shares fell 7% Friday, dropping back below a buy point. The data analytics firm gave in-line guidance.

25,ORLY,"An ax can be either a useful tool or a dangerous weapon. In stock charts, the 50-day moving average has a similar dual nature.XThe 50-day moving average takes a stock's prior 50 daily price closes and averages them. Do this every day in an upward-trending stock, and you'll get a line on a chart that runs below the stock's price bars while smoothing out the jumps and buckles.The line serves a startling number of uses. When a stock is basing, a cup base with more than half its bulk above rather than below the line is a sign of health. Another sign of a stock's strength: a flat base that finds ""support"" at its 50-day line.What is support? Institutional investors often use the 50-day or 10-week line as a reference point, stepping in to add shares to their positions when a stock pulls back to the moving average. This buying creates upward pressure — or price support — to help keep the stock's prices above that moving average.This is why rising stocks often rebound from their 50-day lines, turning brief pullbacks into follow-on buying opportunities. It is also why 50-day and 10-week moving averages tend to cradle advances that can run across many months.On the dangerous side, a rallying stock that collapses below 50-day support in heavy volume is often sending a sell signal. Once below that line, institutional investors may use the 50-day line to mark a sell level. Short sellers may use the line as a level at which to sell shares short.These forces create a level of resistance. Stocks often need a large boost of buying power to muscle back above their 50-day lines after losing that level of support.There are other, similar moving averages. Most common is the 10-week moving average. This line tracks a stock's weekly closes over the prior 10 weeks. It generally tracks fairly close to the 50-day line. So if you are reading a daily chart, use the 50-day line. If you're analyzing a weekly chart, use the 10-week.There is a similar relationship between the long-term 200-day and 40-week averages. On a daily chart, use the 200-day. On a weekly chart, it's the 40-week line. In an uptrending stock, the 200-day and 40-week averages will generally track well below the 50-day and 10-week lines, respectively.When a stock consolidates its gains for an extended period, the 50-day or 10-week line will sometimes cross and pass below the longer-term averages.O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) broke out of a nine-week flat base at 94.98 in the week ended Feb. 8, 2013. The base formed near or above its 10-week moving average.The auto parts chain climbed 64% through February 2014. It ran up neatly and followed the rules of 10-week line etiquette.The stock found support near or at the line (1) twice within several months of the breakout, offering entry points for holders to buy more shares.O'Reilly slipped below the line in light trade in September 2014, but it was not a sell signal. The rally continued through the fall of 2015.

29,ORLY,"Think you've got the post-election stock-market winners' sorted out? Well, have you considered consumer discretionary or companies likely to gain an edge as new tax rules are applied? Award-winner Hennessy Focus Fund (HFCSX) sees stocks like CarMax (KMX), Charles Schwab (SCHW), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) doing well as a Trump administration ushers in corporate tax cuts and interest-rate hikes.Schwab and Fox also stand to benefit from demographic trends and the rising prospects of media-content winners.And despite issues weighing on Alphabet, Macauley expects the internet giant to nearly double earnings in the next five years.The $2.4 billion Hennessy Focus Fund (HFCSX) is a Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner. To learn more about its managers' visions of likely stock-market leaders in the months and years ahead, IBD turned to Brian Macauley, one of the fund's three managers. Macauley, who is 42 years old, shared insights on those and other stocks he thinks will do well as corporate America adapts to life under new political leadership. He spoke from his office in Arlington, Va.IBD: Your fund's low turnover rate makes it look static. But the fund is flexible in other ways. Is that its real secret sauce?Macauley: Right, we don't manage to a style box or by market-capitalization size.This is a go-anywhere portfolio with an emphasis on finding long-term compounders — businesses with the competitive position, growth, and management to create outsized value over an extended period of time. We most often find business with these characteristics in the mid cap space, but sometimes small- or large-cap companies will fit our model.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month Leaders We try to build a portfolio with attractive expected returns and low risk of loss. We do not want artificial capitalization limitations or style boxes to constrain us.IBD: You recently told me your usual turnover rate is slightly higher. Why is that?Macauley: On average our turnover is about 15%. This past year is one of the lower years. The reason is that in general we've not had a lot of market volatility, so we haven't seen a lot of mispricing to take advantage of.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceIBD: Whether 4% or 15%, this fund differs from its Hennessy stablemates, which rebalance just once a year, right?Macauley: We buy and sell when it is appropriate in the marketplace. We have a very different approach from our stablemates.IBD: Your turnover rate is a fraction of the 66% pace for U.S diversified stock mutual funds on average, according to Morningstar Inc.Macauley: Right.IBD: Tell me more about the traits you seek in stocks.Macauley: We're looking for businesses with a wide competitive moat, durable competitive advantages that can earn outsized returns on capital even if competitors come into their market. We look for businesses that have a different mousetrap that can gain a lot of market share over time, or that have a secular tailwind that benefits them or their whole industry.We look for high quality management that thinks and acts like long-term owners. We look for a low risk of catastrophic outcome. We try to stay away from situations where there's rapidly changing technology or a fad or a fashion risk.And we try to meld growth with valuation. We will pay for quality, but we want to make sure we get in at a discount. Warren Buffett says that a lot of accounting vagaries obscure the true economics of a business. We try to look through vagaries and understand a business's true economics.IBD: I know this is unlikely, but has the fund done anything to take advantage of the Trump election?Macauley: We don't make directional bets based on individual economic influences. We had a number of REITs and yield-sensitive positions do poorly (amid election results), but those have been offset by strength in our more consumer discretionary and yield beneficiary names.Names that benefited were CarMax, Charles Schwab and Encore Capital Group (ECPG).CarMax is the largest used-car retailer in the U.S. It has a differentiated consumer proposition — it is a no-haggle-on-price dealer. And it offers a wide selection of late-model used cars, making them easy to use to purchase a car.IBD'S TAKE: To get a handle on whether no-haggle pricing helps car-sellers like CarMax, read this IBD report.They've grown to 170 stores and should be able to about double their store base as they march across the U.S. in the next 10 to 12 years.They get two benefits from the Trump election. One, if there are tax cuts, then consumers will have more discretionary dollars in their pockets. Second, they are a purely U.S. company that pays a high tax rate. To any extent that corporate tax rates change, they could see a cut.Schwab is a broker and custodian of investor assets, serving individuals, wealth planners and registered investment advisors. They benefit from brokers leaving wirehouses like (Bank of America (BAC)-owned) Merrill Lynch and becoming fee-only advisors. Schwab provides the enabling technology for advisors to do that. Also, as baby boomers retire and roll their 401(k) balances into IRAs and look for financial advice, Schwab is a solution for them.And Schwab holds a lot of cash from clients. They can lend that out and buy securities with it. As rates rise, they earn more from that.IBD'S TAKE: Schwab is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Finance-Investment Bank/Bankers industry group due to key growth metrics. It has a top-notch IBD Composite Rating. Consulting IBD's Stock Checkup is a quick way to get a handle on the traits of a stock like this.Encore Capital Group purchases charged-off credit-card receivables. Encore is a specialist in trying to get people to pay what they owe on those credit-card debts. Regulatory burden has compressed this industry to essentially two competitors that control 90% of the industry. It's difficult for new players to come back in. And it takes a large operation to collect debt efficiently.A softer regulatory environment should allow the supply of debt to come to market more quickly.IBD: Does Alphabet's recent softness reflect investors' fear that a Trump presidency will bring trade wars and an economic slump?Macauley: Our thesis is that between growth in online advertising and improved monetization of mobile search and growth at YouTube, that Google (Alphabet) should nearly double their earnings over the next five years. From the current valuation, that's a reasonable opportunity given the high quality business we believe Google is.Their competitive moat is not technology so much as it is users' habits. So there's a low risk of Google being leapfrogged.The election has done three things: One, it has caused scrutiny of low corporate tax rates. We think Google's taxes are not so low, but there still could be some increased tax burden. Second, if there is a trade war, Google and other large technology companies are high-profile places that other countries can retaliate against. Finally, there is the obtuse risk that these technology companies were biased in their presentations of (political) information during the campaign. They may receive more scrutiny from the new administration because of that.IBD: What's driving accelerating earnings per share growth at American Woodmark (AMWD), a kitchen cabinet maker?Macauley: About half of their business is driven by new home construction, which is still climbing out of a depression. We have a long way to go to get to long-term historical norms, so that cyclical uplift is a tailwind.Another thing: during this housing recession they had net cash that they used to improve their service levels and gain market share.After partnering with Home Depot (HD), then Lowe's (LOW), then large home builders in the 1980s, in the last few years they finally had the bandwidth to service the small kitchen-bath market.And they've culled out a lot of lower margin customers in the last few years, filling their capacity with higher-profit customers. So they will have much higher operating margins going forward.And they benefit from the election. Some of their competitors import products. Woodmark pays a full tax rate, so if corporate taxes go down they benefit. And if people have more discretionary income due to tax cuts, they're more likely to buy a home or remodel.IBD: Marlin Business Services (MRLN), which provides leasing for small-ticket equipment leasing, has trended higher in recent weeks. Any election cause and effect?Macauley: They are simply very good at underwriting those leases. They work with people leasing copying machines, equipment for dentists' offices, restaurant equipment. Because of the regulatory environment, regular banks have pulled back from this space. Even where banks compete, it can take weeks to get a loan from banks, but just hours from Marlin. And Marlin is working to bring this to other (business areas). That provides a good forward outlook.IBD: Why do you like 21st Century Fox among media companies?Macauley: The media world is separating into winners and losers, and 21st Century Fox will be a winner. They have must-have content. And they are included in all important over-the-top solutions like Hulu, Google Unplugged, Dish Network (DISH).IBD: Does ""over-the-top"" mean independent from a cable provider?Macauley: Yes. All you need is an internet solution. It's a more efficient means of distribution. People who want to cut the cord with their cable provider are likely to end up with a noncable solution that includes Fox content. And over-the-top is attractive to advertisers because ads can be targeted and lower advertisers' cost per thousand of reaching viewers.In addition, Fox owns 30% of Hulu, which we think will be successful.IBD: Insurance seems staid. What's the appeal of Aon (AON)?Macauley: This is a company that should be relatively a-cyclical, with a low teens growth profile.They are one of only three providers with a global insurance footprint, so there aren't many other places you can go for global coverage. And with their size, they collect a tremendous amount of data. They create information solutions that are valuable to clients and insurance companies, which enables them to grow market share. And they are available at a fairly attractive price — about 15 times forward earnings.IBD: American Tower (AMT) pulled back after the election. Do you still like it?Macauley: The stock has come under pressure as almost all REITs have because interest rates have risen and there's some expectation they might continue to rise, which would make (some) REITs worth less.In addition, there's concern that the new administration would be more amenable to a merger between Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS). Obama was strongly against the merger. If two large tenants merge, it would reduce revenue growth at American Tower for some period.Despite the risk, with its growth profile this is one of our four best ideas, which is why on one of our largest positions we (recently) could buy it cheaper than it was just days earlier.IBD: Why has O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) rallied in recent weeks?Macauley: O'Reilly is the best in their industry at getting parts to customers quickly. They've set up a distribution network that's more robust than anyone else's. And in this business, especially on the commercial side, a mechanic needs same-day parts so he can fix a car and return it to a customer in the afternoon. O'Reilly is in the best position to do that.They have 4,500 stores today. They'll have 6,500 or 7,000 stores in the U.S. over the next 10 years.They pay a full tax rate, so any tax cut should benefit them. As for possible new tariffs, they do import parts from Asia, but all of their competitors do as well. And any increase in tariffs will be passed on to their end customers.IBD: Mistras Group (MG) gapped down 13% on Oct. 7, a day after reporting a 4% decline in first-quarter EPS growth and a downward revision for the fiscal year. It has rallied since then. Do you still like the stock?Macauley: If you run an oil refinery, let's say, you deal with a very corrosive product. Mistras inspects plants to make sure it does not blow up. They are the leader in nondestructive testing for oil and gas and other infrastructure assets, like aerospace and bridges.Our thesis is that they can hold their market position and improve margins by applying some better-business practices being brought to them by the CFO they hired a few years ago. The business will be valuable to a private equity or strategic buyers. We think somebody else will own it after (current management) fixes the operations.IBD: Since you don't trade a lot, how do you spend your days?Macauley: We spend time monitoring businesses we own and industry developments. We have a watch list of 75 companies that represent our next-best ideas, and we always try to stay on top of that. It's a continual process of looking for ideas that are superior to what we already own.IBD: How do you and your co-managers divide portfolio responsibilities? Is each of you responsible for certain sectors, for example?Macauley: We're all equally responsible for names in the portfolio. Our voting on trades is one-third, one-third, one-third, majority rules. Day to day, we have a primary analyst in charge of each name. I'm the primary on CarMax, for example. My partners know my primary businesses well, but not in quite as much detail as I do.IBD: Financials are the fund's largest sector, with a 29% weighting as of Sept. 30. Why is that?Macauley: There is an important distinction for us. We're really invested in specialty companies. We do not tend to own traditional depository banks or commodity financials. Markel (MKL) is our largest. It's a specialty insurer. It's also our oldest holding. The records don't still exist, but I believe it's been in the fund since the fund opened in 1997.Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) (the fund owns A shares traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange) is an alternative asset manager. It invests in assets other than stocks and bonds. It owns office buildings, toll roads, retail real estate, hydroelectric plants, electrical transmission lines. They are infrastructure related assets.IBD: You had a 15% cash weighting as of Sept. 30, well above the industry average. Is that much cash normal?Macauley: We've averaged about 8% over the past seven years. We've had a lot of inflows. We're patient about deploying new capital.IBD: How long does it normally take you to build a full position in a stock?Macauley: Every situation is different. It may take two weeks on average.As a winner in the IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards, it outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31. Only 9% of U.S. diversified stock funds met that standard.Managers Brian Macauley, David Rainey and Ira Rothberg have been at the helm since 2009.Hennessy Focus is  up 6% this year, in line with its midcap growth peers but trailing the S&P 500. Among the fund's top-performing holdings this year are Marlin business Services, Aon and IBD 50 and Big Cap 20 member Charles Schwab.The fund's assets were focused on just 21 names as of Sept. 30, with about 40% of assets alloted to the top biggest holdings.

38,ORLY,"Stocks suffered a late-hour sell-off as most indexes ended Thursday's trading at or near session lows.The Nasdaq composite dropped more than 0.6%, sinking below its 50-day moving average, while the Dow Jones industrials and S&P 500 fell nearly 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. However, Tesla Motors (TSLA) gained nearly 1% to 204.01 after a surprising third-quarter profit of 71 cents a share, shooting well past estimates. Sales soared 145% to $2.3 billion.The stock was up as high as 213.70, spending time briefly above its 200-day moving average.Small caps sharply underperformed. The Russell 2000 lost nearly 1.1%, following Wednesday's 0.9% slide.Volume grew on both main exchanges, according to preliminary data, indicating institutional selling was heavy amid a further strengthening of the U.S. dollar and another rise in long-term interest rates. The 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield hit 1.79%, near its mid-October high of 1.80%.Some leading stocks in the medical and consumer sectors got hammered following their quarterly results, including heart pump device firm Abiomed (ABMD) and auto parts retailer O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY).Abiomed made its third straight decline in heavy trading, gapping down 7% to 103.32. Shares fell as much as 15% intraday. It finished just a tad below its 200-day moving average, two days after slicing its 50-day moving average. Volume on Thursday shot nearly 10 times its average level.Abiomed reported fiscal second-quarter earnings of 20 cents a share, up 18% but well below the Street's consensus view, as profit margins declined year over year. Revenue grew 35% to $103 million.O'Reilly tanked nearly 9% to 253 in massive volume and dived below its long-term 200-day moving average. The chain reported Q3 earnings of 2.90 a share, up 15% but slightly below Wall Street's consensus view. It also marked a second quarter in a row of slowing EPS growth. Sales rose 7%, matching its Q2 increase.In July, O'Reilly broke out and cleared a 281.75 handle entry point, but gained less than 4% before backtracking. Since then, the stock's Relative Strength Rating has also faded to a 58 out of a maximum 99 as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. Meanwhile, a poor Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D+ indicates net selling by institutional investors.After the close, internet giants Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) both reported robust Q3 results but were volatile in after-hours trading. The former was up roughly 1% while the latter sank more than 6%. Both megacap techs finished the regular session with piecemeal losses.In after-hours trading, Amazon shares dropped to as low as 779, significantly below its 50-day moving average near 799. However, shares still hold a stout gain of nearly 30% since the stock moved past a 603.34 buy point in a four-month cup with handle on April 13.Google operator Alphabet notched a 20% rise in revenue, exceeding its 13% gain in the year-ago quarter; excluding currency impact, revenue climbed 23%. Non-GAAP earnings jumped 23% to $9.06 a share. CFO Ruth Porat noted in a new release that mobile search and video services ""are powering our core advertising business.""Alphabet's net margin rose to 28.2%, up 90 basis points vs. the year-ago period.Amazon, meanwhile, posted a 49% rise in operating cash flow to $14.6 billion in the trailing 12 months, and free cash flow grew to $8.6 billion vs. $5.4 billion for the trailing 12 months ended in September 2015. Net sales rose 29% to $32.7 billion while earnings more than tripled to 52 cents a share.CEO Jeff Bezos noted in a news release that the Alexa computerized assistant ""may be Amazon's most loved invention yet — literally — with over 250,000 marriage proposals from customers and counting.""The company noted that it expects to hire 120,000 workers in seasonal positions for the upcoming holiday season. Last year, it transitioned more than 14,000 such positions into regular, full-time roles after the holidays. Amazon expects to boost that number this year.On the Amazon Web Services side, Amazon expended into the Ohio region and now operates 38 ""Availability Zones"" across 14 technology infrastructure regions globally. It plans to open nine more zones in four regions (Canada, U.K., France and a second region in China) in the coming months.Net margin at Amazon improved sharply to 0.8% vs. 0.3% in the year-ago quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon joined the Leaderboard elite list of top growth companies on March 29, when shares were trading around 593.

39,ORLY,"The stock indexes closed with gains of more than 1% Friday, solidifying a rally that began a week and a half ago.The Nasdaq jumped 1.6%, the S&P 500 added 1.5%, and the Dow Jones industrial average improved by 1.4%. All three closed near session highs, as the market applauded a strong jobs report for June. Small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 bringing home a 2.3% advance.The S&P 500 came a point away from making a new all-time closing high, falling just short of the record 2130.82 set in May of last year. The Dow reached its highest level in more than a year. The Nasdaq, which has lagged the other main indexes, is drawing closer to a key test below the 5000 level.Compared to the previous session, volume was higher on the Nasdaq and lower on the NYSE, according to early figures from the day's trading.It was a bullish day for leading stocks, with the IBD 50 indicated as having increased more than 2%.Breakouts by several top-rated stocks provided additional fuel. Some were building-related stocks such as Lowe's (LOW) and Fortune Brands (FBHS). Construction is a sector that has been leading the market, and Home Depot (HD) surged 2% in the process of forming the right side of a base.O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) topped its 278.06 buy point late in the day. It closed with a gain of 2%, but volume was below normal, which took some shine off the move. The auto-parts chain has a top EPS Rating of 97 after posting eight straight quarters of earnings gains of at least 20%.Among widely held stocks, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) climbed more than 1.5% to a new high.

43,ORLY,"What does it take to survive in a top job in a competitive, bottom-line industry? Win, baby! Long term.Larry Puglia has been at the helm of $30.7 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund (TRBCX) since mid-1993 and has been sole manager since May 1997.In that span, the fund has racked up a 9.97% average annual gain through April 29 vs. 9.02% for the S&P 500, says Morningstar Inc.Over the past three and five years through April 29, his fund's performance tops 94% and 97% of its direct rivals, respectively.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe fund captures an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, which means that its performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.And the fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, shining in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large-caps.Puglia is himself among the tops in sheer longevity. He ranks 20th out of 558 managers of U.S. stock mutual funds that have had a single skipper.But he is not immune to market volatility: Year-to-date through April 29, the fund was down 5.64%, topping just 21% of its peers.Puglia, 55, spoke with IBD from his office in Baltimore about how he invests.IBD: What types of markets does your fund struggle in, Larry?Puglia: We like to think we can perform well in most environments. When I first started to work with Tom Broadus (co-manager of Blue Chip from mid-1993 until leaving the fund on May 1, 1997), he warned me that your investment style will sometimes be out of sync (with the market). Your job, he said, is to recognize that and lose as little as possible.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Categories' PerformanceWe paid a price for having less technology during the height of the tech bubble. But we were able to offset that ... when the market clobbered tech companies with very high valuations as the tech bubble burst.But our rolling three-year performance numbers have been solid against both the growth benchmark and the S&P 500. Our rolling five-year numbers have outperformed the benchmark 93% of the time. Sometimes things that seem unpopular -- like Amazon (AMZN) in 2013 and part of 2014 -- can reward you if you're right in your long-term analysis.IBD: What does ""Blue Chip"" in your fund's name say about your overall approach?Puglia: As we've talked about before, Paul, blue chips are those with leading market positions and seasoned management, and we pay close attention to management's ability to allocate capital. We've learned over time that if you have a great business that throws off superior returns, but management doesn't know how to reinvest wisely, the business is soon ""worsified,"" as I think Warren Buffett said.Having strong returns -- returns on invested capital, returns on equity -- is another characteristic we look for. And because there are vagaries to book accounting measures, we've always looked at free cash flow as an important measure for profitability. As a result, we tend to own the leaders or No. 2 companies in industries.Home Depot (HD) is important to us, but so is Lowe's (LOW). We're willing to own the No. 1 or No. 2 names in market share, especially if both are high-quality companies and well-managed.IBD: You're fairly reluctant to own smaller stocks. What are the exceptions?Puglia: We have been willing to own midcaps or some rapidly growing companies. We've owned Amazon and O'Reilly (ORLY) over a decade and Facebook (FB) as a private placement, the only one in our fund. Some view it as an early-stage growth company, but we view it as a company with a unique leadership position in an area growing rapidly.We owned Genentech before it was acquired by Roche (RHHBY), so we're willing to own rapid growers. But we try to discern as early as we can that they will have durable growth.IBD: Is Ross Stores (ROST) a play on a slow-growth economy in which consumers are careful about their spending? Or would this be an attractive stock even if the economy were growing gangbusters?Puglia: Historically, Ross and TJX Cos. (TJX) have been dominant in off-price retail. They've done well in most economic environments. Some of that is due to the fact that they are well below their saturation points in number of stores in the U.S. and especially internationally.In a slow-growth economy, other retailers have to unload overstock. They make fashion misses. So Ross and TJX get more pack-away inventory -- they take unwanted merchandise off other retailers' hands, pack it away and sell it at good margins over time.IBD: PayPal (PYPL) is still trying to get back to where it went public. Where does this fit into your strategy?Puglia: This is an example of where we started our conversation. This is a high-quality but emerging blue chip.They are leading in their area of expertise. But because it was born (went public) early in its gestation, it has certain frailties. If certain other payment companies wanted to gang up and hurt PayPal, they could succeed somewhat.But instead, PayPal has a collaborative relationship with Visa (V), where we also have a position.And PayPal has broadened itself. They bought Venmo, a consumer-to-consumer network (that lets users transfer money to each other). It's growing rapidly. And it cornered Braintree, which can process debit and credit transactions (for many devices, and is used by online and mobile firms such as Uber and Airbnb).IBD: Which do you like more about Amazon -- what it is now, or what it has the potential to become?Puglia: In the last three to four years, they've invested heavily in building out their network of warehouses, distribution centers and related inventory management capabilities. They've also built out their free-delivery ability and more rapid delivery to attract more Prime members, who spend over twice as much as other customers and have higher retention rates.We've felt that the company should be valued on free cash flow, and that's going to move up dramatically because the third-party business (selling and distributing products for third-party sellers) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) should grow very rapidly. And both have much higher margins than their core retailing business, which is doing fine. And we feel the third-party business and AWS’ margins would improve over time.The real story is that the third-party and AWS businesses should pull their composite gross margin up very dramatically. That's happened, and we think it will continue.But predicting free cash flow for them is tricky because if they build, say, two more distribution centers, that can absorb a lot of free cash flow.Another way to think about the company is that AWS is, in our minds, worth well over half of the company based on our analysis of growth in that business. People don't appreciate that.IBD: Are you bothered by Broadcom's (AVGO) slowdown in earnings-per-share growth?Puglia: The growth rate is slowing temporarily because we're coming out of a big downturn.Now, Broadcom's acquisition of Avago is going to be accretive to earnings over time. Avago management has shown the ability to improve the profile of their product set. There's talk that they might sell parts of the business and what we'll end up with is a higher-quality business.When they're finished with restructuring, they will look like Texas Instruments (TXN) but trade at a lower multiple.Just in the last year, we came back into both of these names (Broadcom and its now-subsidiary Avago).IBD: O'Reilly Automotive is a cyclical play because people want to fix cars in a slow-growth economy rather than buy new ones. It's also a secular play because they're taking share in the repair-shop market. Is there a third element you like?Puglia: They are really extraordinarily well-managed. They key success factor is being able to distribute product to a mechanic or repair shop in a short time frame. They need parts within minutes, within the hour. And O'Reilly has distribution nodes and warehouses that can get product to repair shops in a very short time.That took a lot of investment and expertise.AutoZone (AZO) is also moving aggressively into the do-it-for-me market. They've been in the do-it-yourselfer market. Both companies have performed well and are taking market share. They're well-managed and have room to penetrate the total addressable market. And these are businesses that are less likely to be disintermediated by Amazon. Home Depot and Lowe's are the same.IBD: Does Constellation Brands' (STZ) growth come from acquisitions?Puglia: The reason it's grown in the last 12 to 24 months is their fortuitous and smart acquisition of Corona and Modelo and Pacifico and other Mexican specialty beers that were spun out as a result of mergers elsewhere in the industry.They have a wine business that has been a slower grower. But they've acquired Prisoner Wines and other specialty wines. They're smart in wines, and that business is poised to grow.IBD: Some people love to doubt Facebook (FB). You like the stock, right?Puglia: Yes, we're constructive. While it is inevitable that growth will slow, it is being sustained at a very high level.The stock has been robust because they've managed the transition to mobile devices much better than people thought they could. That will constitute their next leg of (share-price) growth: having that transition understood.Also, they've made several acquisitions in recent years that are not well understood (by many investors). Instagram now has 400 million users. What's App now has 800 million users, up from 500 million. And Messenger has a ton of users. As those businesses are monetized, they'll provide a new level of growth layered onto their core business, which is already seeing rapid growth due to video, for example.They'll earn in the $4s -- call it $4.50 per share in calendar 2017. They could be pushing a $6 number in calendar '18.IBD: Can Alaska Air (ALK) keep flying high despite the cost of the Virgin America (VA) takeover?Puglia: This is an interesting situation. Some of the most difficult decisions are when we have a high-quality company like Alaska, with the best balance sheet of any major airline, and then they make an acquisition and pay more than we would like. But they didn't have much flexibility because JetBlue (JBLU) was trying to buy Virgin too.Less appreciated is that Alaska gets important gates in Newark, LaGuardia, Kennedy and Dulles. Those are important airports, especially in relation to the West Coast.We hate strategic deals when you pay too much. But the more we look at it, the more we think it will be accretive.IBD: If you had a mentor, who was it?Puglia: I've had several. My father as a businessman who invested on his own over about 50 years. He had a growth-at-a-reasonable price style. He lived through the Depression, so he liked firms with earnings and cash flow. That influenced me.He also had an eye for new growth areas. He had seen new industries created, like TV and copying machines. And he never invested in gold. He always said, ""It can't innovate, it can't grow."" That focus on looking for companies that compound and grow has been a great influence.Jack Laporte (who ran New Horizons Fund (PRNHX) from 1987 until 2010) taught me that a few winners can make a big difference in growth investing. They can offset many losing stocks.And I mentioned Tom Broadus (who ran and co-ran Blue Chip from June 30, 1993, through May 1, 1997, with a 21.64% average annual return topping 95% of its peers, and whose Oct. 31, 1985-March 1, 1994, tenure atop Equity Income generated a 14.98% average annual gain, topping 86% of its peers) taught me to make sure that the managers of companies we're interested in really follow through on things they say they're going to do.And I learned from Brian Rogers (T. Rowe Price chairman and chief investment officer, who ran Equity Income (PRFDX) from 1985 to 2015), even though he is a value investor.Rogers once said to me that consistent thought and action were important. The most grievous mistakes he had made were trades he knew he should have made (but hadn't). He taught me to make sure my portfolio reflected my best thinking. Now, several times a week, I review why I own every single name. If I don't believe in a holding, I reduce or end it. That's especially valuable for growth investors. If a growth name is not compounding, that is dangerous.

45,ORLY,"Nasdaq futures ran well ahead of the other big benchmarks Thursday, in an uneven premarket session driven by earnings news from Facebook (FB), Visa (V), PayPal (PYPL) and others. Markets received an added boost from Labor Department data released before the open, showing U.S. unemployment claims falling to their lowest level since 1969.Nasdaq 100 futures popped 1.3% in premarket action, propelled by Facebook and PayPal. O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) also shouldered the wheel. Dow Jones industrials futures rose 0.3%, with Visa and Intel (INTC) leading. S&P 500 futures added 0.5% as Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and O'Reilly each knocked off double-digit gains.Stocks poised near buy points early Thursday included Micron Technology (MU), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and TAL Education Group (TAL).The major indexes will be looking to retake some lost ground on the stock market today.

Meanwhile, chip stocks have suffered a harder hit than the general market, leaving the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index down 2.3% through Wednesday. But chip stocks appeared poised for an early rebound Thursday.Facebook rumbled ahead 7.5% after reporting diluted earnings of $1.69 per share, topping analyst targets by 25%. Revenue of $11.97 billion also beat consensus views, and user numbers met expectations. Premarket action suggested the stock could open back above its 10-week moving average. That would set the stock up to begin climbing the right side of a possible base. Premarket moves do not always carry over into regular trade.Chip stocks gathered for a sharp early advance, with all 30 of the Philly Chip Index stocks trading flat to higher. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) led, up 10% in premarket trade. The chipmaker reported significant acceleration in earnings and revenue growth in its first-quarter results late Wednesday, and guidance pointed to further acceleration ahead. The stock has been consolidating for nine months, and has fallen below crucial levels of technical support.Among the other chip names in premarket motion, Xilinx (XLNX) jumped 5%, InterDigital (IDCC) rose 3.3% and Micron Technology rose 2.9%. Micron is looking to retake a cup base buy point at 49.99. It pulled back to nearly 8% below that entry, stopping just short of an absolute trigger of the automatic sell rule.Chipotle Mexican Grill rocketed 13.8% higher following stronger-than-expected first-quarter results, leading the S&P 500 in premarket trading. That positioned the stock for a potential breakout early Thursday. The stock ended Wednesday session just below a 330.24 buy point in a bottoming base, but shares remain deep in a year-long consolidation and should be approached with added caution.O'Reilly Automotive ran a hot second among S&P 500 stock futures, up 12% in premarket trading. Its first-quarter sales and profit narrowly beat analyst targets. The stock finished Wednesday's session 18% below its January high.Domino's Pizza spun up a 5.8% premarket advance. A 59% earnings gain and a 26% improvement in revenue trounced analyst estimates. Shares ended Wednesday trades 1% below a 236.10 buy point in a flat base.IBD 50 name TAL Education popped 5.2% in premarket trading. The China-based chain of after school tutoring centers blew past analyst expectations with a 75% earnings gain and a 59% rise in revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter. The premarket move positioned shares to open back above a 36.26 buy point, but the stock comes with a long list of cautions. Among the most important, the base is very late stage, and the stock had pulled back more than 8% below the base's entry, tripping the automatic sell rule.On the downside, airline stocks were under early pressure. American Airlines (AAL) narrowed its early loss to 2.9% as lowered full-year earnings guidance diluted strong unit revenue growth and a narrow earnings beat for the first quarter.  Southwest Airlines (LUV) dumped 3.8% following mixed first-quarter results. The mood spilled over onto Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL), but both had trimmed early losses to a bit more than 1% apiece.Treasury yields and oil prices could have some impact on how durable early gains might be across the span of Thursday's session. Early trade Thursday showed bonds rising a bit off Wednesday's settle price, sending the 10-year yield down 4 basis points to 2.99%. Crude oil prices climbed another 0.8%, putting U.S. benchmark crude near $69 a barrel and within 2% of last Thursday's 41-month high.March durable goods orders increased 2.6%, the Commerce Department said, down from February's 3.5% surge, but still well above the 1.7% gain expected by economists. Transportation powered the beat. Core orders, minus transportation were down 0.1% for the month, and below forecasts for a 0.6% increase.First-time unemployment claims slowed to 209,000 in the week ended April 21, the Labor Department estimated. That was down from an already low 233,000 claims in the prior week, falling to what was reportedly the lowest level in 48 years, and undercutting economist views for a slight decrease to 230,000 new filings.RELATED:Nasdaq Jumps As Facebook, PayPal Climb; This Retailer Poised For Gap Up Open Dow Outperforms Thanks To Boeing; Nasdaq Recovers But Growth Stocks Hit HardApple Faces 'Gloom and Doom' Ahead Of EarningsWhy Winning Stocks Are Strong Price Performers Before Big Price MovesBitcoin, Other Cryptocurrencies Slide After Wall Provider HackedThese 4 Apparel Stocks Look Fashionable As They Outperform Market

54,ORLY,"A tail wind has kicked up this calendar year behind $7.5 billion American Century Growth Fund (TWCGX). That's nice news for investors holding the fund in retirement accounts and other portfolios. The fund's 9.93% gain this year going into Thursday topped 73% of the fund's large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. That's a step up from the 67% of peers the fund outperformed over the trailing 12 months with a 16.40% return.Managers Gregory Woodhams and Justin Brown pick stocks individually and not based on sectors, but their sector weights show where they expect to find leaders. Technology was their top sector as of Jan. 31, with a 34% weighting. Consumer discretionary was next with 20%.Tech titans Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) — the fund's first, third and fifth largest holdings — illustrate that appetite. Alphabet is up 7% so far this year. Apple is up 24%. Microsoft is up 5%. Together they account for about 14% of the fund's assets.Several top new buys as of Dec. 31 also belonged to the tech sector. Among those was chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO), which is up 25% so far this year. The stock has a highest-possible Comp Rating of 99.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom is ranked No. 1 in the No. 37-rated Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. It has four quarters in a row of accelerating earnings per share growth. See how its additional easy-to-understanding fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' at IBD's Stock Checkup.Another top new buy was Activision Blizzard (ATVI), which is up 39% this year. The video game stock is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Computer Software-Gaming group, thanks in part to traits like its very strong 97 Comp Rating. In addition, the stock is on the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals.Tuesday was the stock's ex-dividend date, meaning that you had to own shares before that to be eligible for its dividend. Its dividend yield Monday was 0.6%.A negative: EPS growth has decelerated for two quarters, from 315% to 152% and 11%. Analysts see EPS falling 9% in the current quarter and 11% this year, and then rising 21% in 2018, in line with its three-year growth rate.Financials were just the fund's sixth-largest sector, with a modest 4% weighting. One of those was Citizens Financial (CFG), a top new buy whose EPS growth has accelerated for three quarters in a row.Still, the stock is down 3% this year after tumbling 13% off its March 1 high. That pullback along with the broad market reflects investors' concerns that Congress' failure to revise or kill ObamaCare is a sign that additional Trump initiatives, such as corporate and individual tax cuts and lighter regulatory burdens for banks, may not be as likely as investors had hoped.Shares of Citrix Systems (CTXS), yet another newcomer to the portfolio, surged March 13 on rumors of a company sale. The company's business software creates work spaces that provide access to desktops, apps, data and communications on any device, over networks and in the cloud.As IBD recently reported, Citrix has been pressured by activist investor Elliott Management to make changes. On Feb. 1, Citrix completed its spinoff of its GoToMeeting business, which then merged with LogMeIn (LOGM). GoToMeeting is a conferencing application that allows remote access to personal computers.Citrix shares are up 20% this year. The cloud computing company's most recent EPS report was for Q4, in January. It earned $1.61 a share on sales of $908 million. That topped consensus for EPS of $1.50 and revenue of $900.8 million. But the $1.61 was a decline of 3%.The company forecast 2017 EPS of $4.60-$4.65 and revenue of $2.81 billion to $2.84 billion. Both are well below consensus for $5.60 EPS and sales of $3.55 billion, but Citrix's guidance excludes GoToMeeting.VMware (VMW) is another new buy for the fund. The server virtualization leader is up 17% this year. EPS grew 0%, 4%, 12% and 13% the past four quarters.VMware paid $1.3 billion to buy Niciria, a software-defined networking company, three years ago. VMware said recently it expects $1 billion in sales of NSX, made possible by that acquisition. NSX lets companies update networks through software changes rather than the more costly path of replacing routers and switching hardware.NSX is a challenge to Cisco Systems' (CSCO) flagship networking software product, called Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI).In the consumer discretionary sector, bellwether Amazon (AMZN) and auto-parts chain O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) were the fund's second- and seventh-largest holdings as of Jan. 31.Amazon has been trending mostly sideways since mid-February, hanging on to a 17% gain so far this year.O'Reilly is down 1% this year. RELATED:IBD's Best Mutual Funds 2017 Awards: New Crop Of WinnersFacebook, Alphabet Among Hot Tech Stocks American Century Growth Mutual Fund Likes

57,ORLY,"Until the recent rally began, it's been a tough market. But Hennessy Focus Fund (HFCSX) -- which is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 award winner -- keeps outperforming by making big bets on its three portfolio managers' best ideas.The $2.2 billion mutual fund's 0.27% return year-to-date, going into Tuesday, tops 90% of its midcap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. That pack averaged a 3.83% loss. The S&P 500 is up 0.20%. And the fund is in the top 1% of its peer group over the past five years and top 7% over the past three years.Hennessy Focus aims to keep 60% to 80% of its assets in its top-10 holdings. The mutual fund's top 10 accounted for 63.5% of assets as of Dec. 31. And with its focused approach, the portfolio held only 21 names.The average IBD Composite Rating of the portfolio is a strong 75. Eleven of the fund's stocks have Comp Ratings of 80 or higher.Two holdings, Alphabet (GOOGL) and O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), are in the IBD 50.Car-parts store chain O'Reilly is the fund's top holding, with a 9.8% weighting. O'Reilly illustrates another one of Hennessy Focus' key traits -- sticking with its bets. O'Reilly has been in the portfolio for more than 10 years. The company had about 1,300 stores when the fund opened its current stake, says manager Brian Macauley. Now it has more than 4,400, a lineup that could expand to as many as 7,000, Macauley says.In addition, the company has a lot of buying power compared with many of its smaller competitor. Its distribution system can provide faster delivery of critical parts. Same-day delivery enables repair shops to complete repairs that day, leading to customer satisfaction and faster billing, Macauley adds.EPS had grown over 20% annually over the past 10 years as of Dec. 31, with the stock appreciating at a similar pace, he says, adding, ""We also like company management.""Macauley, David Rainey and Ira Rothberg have run the fund since about mid-2009. The fund has held its stake in American Tower (AMT) since Q2 1998.Trading around 100, now-No. 2 holding American Tower is forming a potential handle with a 103 buy point.For years it has benefited from demand for more wireless bandwidth and for improved connectivity. Demand continues to grow. ""As the largest cell tower operator, they are well-positioned to facilitate that capacity growth,"" Macauley said.Earnings per share grew 6%, 14% and 15% in the past three quarters.The fund first bought specialty insurer Markel (MKL) in April 1997, at fund inception, adding since then.Most insurers lose money on their underwriting and aim for a profit from investments. Markel also profits on its underwriting, Macauley says.""Markel is sometimes referred to as a baby Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA),"" Macauley said, referring to the diversified company run by legendary investor Warren Buffett. ""Like Berkshire, Markel invests a lot of its float (from insurance premiums) in public companies instead of just plain-vanilla fixed income. It also invests in privately owned businesses, as does Berkshire Hathaway. So the business is very thoughtfully run, and it is a fraction of the size of Berkshire, so they don't have the law of large numbers working against them. They have a lot of opportunity in front of them because of relatively small scale.""Markel EPS grew 39% and 76% in the past two quarters. The stock is forming a new base after a failed breakout. It has a 938.01 entry.Image provided by Shutterstock.

58,ORLY,"As an investor, you know the stock market is cyclical. But intellectually understanding that bull markets are followed by bears is not the same as actually living through a Wall Street crash and watching the value of your portfolio decline, sometimes sharply.That’s when a mutual fund investor’s discipline and patience can get tested -- but also rewarded over time, as the performance of the Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards recipients shows.The 2008 bear market was a prime example. Following a powerful bull cycle that began in March 2003, the financial and housing crisis triggered a downturn that saw the S&P 500 decline 58% from the peak in October 2007 to the bottom in March 2009.The top-performing stocks in the prior bull market suffered similar fates. Apple (AAPL) fell 61% from the end of December 2007 through January 2009, while Google, now known as Alphabet (GOOGL), lost 67% of its value from November 2007 until finding its footing in November 2008.When you buy and sell individual stocks, you are your own fund manager. It’s up to you to actively manage risk and reduce your exposure in a market downturn since the leaders in the prior bull cycle typically do not bounce back to lead in the next one.The cardinal rule for protecting your positions in individual stocks is to cut all losses at no more than 7%-8%.But when you invest in mutual funds, you’re relying on a professional money manager to oversee and adjust the portfolio as needed over time.So when investing in a fund to achieve a long-term goal, such as retirement or college savings for a young child, your best bet is to buy right and sit tight.As IBD founder William J. O’Neil wrote in his classic book, “How To Make Money In Stocks,"" ""a well-selected, diversified domestic growth-stock fund run by an established management organization will, in time, always recover from the steep corrections that naturally occur during bear markets. The reason mutual funds come back is that they are broadly diversified and generally participate in each recovery cycle in the U.S. economy.”The table, below, listing the 10-year returns of the top five growth funds from 2006 to 2015 proves that point.As you would expect in a severe bear market, even these long-term, top-performing funds showed a decline in 2008 –  from 25% to 46%.But look at the cumulative 10-year returns. Investors who sat tight in 2008 saw overall gains of 205% to 240% from 2006 to 2015, more than making up for the 2008 decline and more than doubling the S&P 500’s 102% rise during the same period.As a fund’s prospectus always says, past performance is not a guarantee of future results. But checking a mutual fund’s long-term track record – through both bull and bear markets – gives you insight into the management team’s ability to manage risk while also generating growth.Take for instance the Eaton Vance Atlanta Capital SMID-Cap I Fund (EISMX), which had the smallest decline in 2008 among the top 5 growth funds.Fund co-manager William Bell told IBD, “We prepare for a bear market before it happens. … Our entire process is basically built around finding companies that are going to grow at an above-average rate, but also provide a lot of downside protection when things fall apart.”Bell added that he looks for stocks like O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) that have a “counter-cyclical component” to them. Key to that is checking the company’s long-term earnings record, particularly during weak economies.“If a company is able to grow through a recession,” Bell said, “we have pretty good confidence that the stock is also going to do better than the rest of the market during a recession.”The strategy of Bell and his co-managers and their focus on so-called “steady-Eddie” companies is reminiscent of a certain legendary investor. “If you look at what we do,” Bell noted, “it’s almost exactly what Warren Buffett does, just in the small- and mid-cap space.”Dollar cost averaging – i.e., regularly investing a set amount of money in a mutual fund regardless of market conditions – can be an effective way for investors to protect themselves against market fluctuations.Rather than try to time the market and make a large investment in one lump sum at just the right moment, you increase your holdings incrementally, typically on a monthly basis.So during a bear market, you’re buying shares in the fund at a lower price, helping to hold down your average cost-per-share and increase your returns over time.Image provided by Shutterstock.

60,ORLY,"As drugstore giant Walgreens (WBA) on Tuesday helps to ring in a new earnings season, ETF investors await more than its latest quarterly results.They're hoping for insights on the retailer's proposed merger with rival Rite Aid (RAD). Signs of progress could send Walgreens stock higher.Investors in exchange traded funds have a pressing question about the broader consumer discretionary sector, too. When this S&P 500 sector is expected to show earnings growth leadership in 2016, why is it lagging in the stock market?Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) is up 2% year to date through April 1. By comparison, Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) jumped 16% in the same period.Yet in the recently concluded reporting season, the consumer discretionary sector posted an impressive 11.53% earnings-per-share growth over the year-ago quarter -- ahead of all S&P 500 sectors except telecommunications services.""This (discrepancy) may partly reflect the sector's outperformance in 2015,"" Lindsey Bell, a senior analyst with S&P Global Market Intelligence, wrote in a recent note.Indeed, that strong showing factored into Miracle Mile Advisors' decision to get out of the sector in the middle of 2015.After a strong run, consumer discretionary and retail stocks had looked fairly valued, said J.J. Feldman, portfolio manager at the Los Angeles firm, which manages roughly $500 million.Miracle Mile also expected defensively oriented sectors to hold up better if the market pulled back. The decision to tilt towards utilities and consumer staples paid off in 2016's volatile first quarter.XLY has rebounded nicely amid a broad stock rally in the last month, rising 4.4%. However, Feldman's still cautious about consumer discretionary and retail stock ETFs.""We're not looking to enter until it gets a little bit cheaper,"" said Feldman. ""It's a valuations call.""However, both recent economic data and recent policy moves are supportive of domestically oriented sectors, such as retail. These include job gains, emerging signs of wage growth and a Fed that's in no hurry to raise interest rates.""Consumers have money in their pockets to spend"" when mortgage and auto loan rates are low, said Neena Mishra, director of ETF research for Zacks Investment Research.And in an earnings recession, the consumer discretionary sector is holding up fairly well. It's expected to see a 1.4% EPS decline in first-quarter earnings and a 2.5% decline in first-quarter revenues -- better than most S&P 500 sectors and subsectors, according to Zacks estimates.""The only concern I have is that consumers have not really been spending, despite low gas prices,"" Mishra added. What Americans have been willing to spend on is leisure and entertainment activities. That helps to explain the wide dispersion in the consumer discretionary sector.For example, Market Vectors Gaming (BJK) and SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) are up 7% year to date. XRT invests in companies that own and operate big-box general merchandise, drug, grocery, department, automotive, apparel, and specialty retail stores.Besides Walgreens and Rite Aid, XRT's 98 equal-weighted stock holdings include highly rated IBD stocks such as parts supplier O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), discount retail store Five Below (FIVE) and beauty chain Ulta Beauty (ULTA). This ETF has a smaller-cap skew than XLY.Investors seeking to invest in this sector should look for stock holdings that benefit from rising consumer trends, such as online shopping and home improvement, Mishra advised.The two largest stock holdings in XLY and Vanguard Consumer Discretionary (VCR) are Amazon (AMZN) and Home Depot (HD). Amazon and Home Depot have soared 62% and 21% in the past year, respectively.Miracle Mile managers are more likely to invest in XLY than XRT when they decide to dive back into the consumer discretionary sector.""We tend to go towards more household, blue-chip names,"" Feldman said.

61,ORLY,"O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) reported better-than-expected first quarter earnings and revenue growth after the market close Wednesday, but shares fell in extended trading after the auto parts retailer gave weak guidance.Earnings per share minus one-time items rose 26% to $2.59, beating analyst consensus by 10 cents a share. That continued a string of earnings beats going back more than eight quarters. Revenue grew 10.3% to $2.096 billion, edging views for $2.059 billion. Same-store sales rose 6.1%, which O'Reilly Automotive said was their 10th straight quarter of comps rising more than 5%.But O'Reilly Auto sees Q2 diluted EPS of $2.54-$2.64, well below consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for  $2.77 EPS. President and CEO Greg Henslee said the company ""can face headwinds relating to merchandise acquisition"" and other factors that ""can create short-term pressure on our gross margin results due to reducing our inventory value.""He noted that the company expects a noncash impact from a specific new supplier contract resulting in LIFO (last-in, first-out inventory) headwinds of about $23 million in the current quarter.Shares of O'Reilly fell more than 3% to 264 in after-hours action. The stock had closed up 0.2% at 272.87 in the stock market today. Its stock has been in a first-stage consolidation for about four months, with a buy point of 277.93. But Wednesday's late action suggests that the stock could undercut its 50-day moving average, where O'Reilly has been finding support.O'Reilly is the top-rated company in the auto parts retailers group with a 94 IBD Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99.

Advanced Auto Parts (AAP) fell hard after its Q1 report. L Brands (LB), parent of the Victoria's Secret chain, tumbled 6% after an analyst downgrade.The stock market today was opening on the fence, with the S&P 500 only narrowly above its Dec. 31 close -- and even a mild slip will put it back in negative territory for the year. The Nasdaq is down more than 5% year to date and has pitched camp below its converged 50- and 200-day moving averages. The S&P 500 is struggling to hold its 50-day but remains well above its 200-day line, and the Nasdaq flashed some minor positive signals during Wednesday's action.Weekly jobless claims data fell sharply, but not as much as expected. The Labor Department reported claims of 278,000 in the week ended May 14 — down 16,000 claims. Consensus forecasts called for a decrease to 275,000 new claims. The four-week moving average rose to 275,750, a third straight increase.The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's Business Outlook Survey for May showed a minus 1.8 reading, essentially unchanged and sticking to negative territory now for eight of the past nine months.

Its shares ended Wednesday down 3% for the week so far, marking a second straight weekly decline that sent the stock below its 200-day moving average in heavy trade, interrupting a six-month advance.Cisco Systems climbed more than 5% after reporting late Wednesday, with its fiscal Q3 earnings narrowly beating and revenue declining less than consensus expectations. Management lifted its Q4 EPS guidance to just above consensus views. Cisco shares ended Wednesday fighting to hold support at their 200-day moving average, and in a 15-month consolidation.Auto parts retail stocks came under sharp pressure after two key earnings reports. Advance Auto dropped 5% after its first-quarter earnings stopped a dime short of projections, and revenue fell 1.9% -- worse than the consensus target.

94,ORLY,"If you ever need proof of how traditional market forces can get turned upside down, look no further than the auto parts retail sector, where leaders like O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) continue to churn out strong financial and share price growth despite what would normally be a big threat to business.Normally, one would think auto parts retailers would worry in the wake of last year's robust market for new car sales. In the past, a rise in new car sales would have been bad news for the aftermarket auto parts business. New cars require less maintenance and repair work than older ones, meaning there is less demand for the kind of parts and services supplied by O’Reilly, as well as rivals such as AutoZone (AZO), Advance Auto Parts (AAP) and Genuine Parts (GPC).But that dynamic no longer applies, analysts say.""The kinds of things that benefit new vehicle sales -- an improving economy, improving employment, higher income -- also benefit the auto parts sector,"" CRT Capital Group analyst Ali Faghri told IBD.The figures might seem daunting. In 2015, the U.S. auto industry posted sales of 17.5 million light vehicles, according to the Automotive News Data Center, breaking the previous record of 17.4 million set in 2000 and marking a 5.7% increase from 2014.But a rise in new car sales doesn’t necessarily mean older cars end up at the junkyard. Thanks to advances in technology, cars last much longer nowadays.So when someone buys a new car, chances are his old car will be resold instead of junked. It’s not unusual for vehicles with 120,000 miles or more to make their way onto used car lots.This trend has led to an ever-aging fleet of cars in the U.S. The average age of cars on the road is a record 11.5 years, according to industry researcher IHS Automotive. That figure is expected to creep up to 11.6 years in 2016.The obvious benefit to auto parts retailers is that as cars get older, they require more replacement parts, as well as repair and maintenance services. This feeds demand for the industry’s Do-It-Yourself (DIY) segment, which targets home mechanics; as well as the ""Do-It-For-Me"" segment that targets professional technicians and installers.The sector has also gotten a lift from the improving economy and job market, which have given many consumers more cash to spend on replacement parts and repairs.Meanwhile, O’Reilly and its peers have benefited from lower gasoline prices, which encourage people to drive more.""Low and declining gas prices are helping boost vehicles miles traveled -- leading to failure- and maintenance-related part sales -- and leading low-end DIY consumers to spend more on discretionary items for their vehicles,"" Wedbush analyst Seth Basham noted in a research report to clients.It all adds up to a robust market for O’Reilly. The company’s stock price trades near 269 and has been creeping back up toward the high of 277.96 set in late October. Shares have risen about 6% since the beginning of the year.Financially, O’Reilly is in the midst of a years-long streak of double-digit earnings growth, helped by a stock repurchase program that began more than four years ago. Revenue has risen in double digits the last four quarters.The company earned $2.19 a share during the 2015 fourth quarter. That was up 24% from the prior year and well above consensus estimates. Revenue gained 10% to $1.95 billion, slightly above views. Comparable-store sales increased 7.7% vs. a 6.3% rise during the third quarter.""Both our professional and DIY sides of the business were strong contributors to our comparable-store sales growth, with professional being slightly higher,"" O’Reilly Chief Executive Greg Henslee said on a conference call with analysts. ""For 2016, we expect to see positive tailwinds from continued modest improvements in total employment and low gas prices.""Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect O’Reilly to grow full-year EPS 16% in 2016 and another 13% in 2017.For all of 2015, O’Reilly’s comparable-store sales rose 7.5% -- the biggest annual gain since it grew comps 8.8% in 2010. O’Reilly opened 209 stores in 2015, bringing the total store count to 4,571 at year's end. It plans to open another 210 stores this year.""DIY market share gains have accelerated, and this is adding a new leg to same store-sales growth, which could lead to earnings upside,"" JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers said in a report.Many of those market share gains have come at the expense of Advance Auto, he says, especially in East Coast markets.Because the fourth quarter includes parts of the winter season -- when cars tend to undergo more wear and tear -- O’Reilly and other parts retailers benefit when the weather is severe. That wasn’t the case during much of the 2015 fourth quarter, however.""While O’Reilly noted that its retail business suffered slightly in November due to abnormally warm weather, pressuring demand for products like anti-freeze, it successfully captured this demand in December as temperatures fell,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Scot Ciccarelli noted in a report. ""Management believes winter weather has been fairly neutral to its business.""

95,ORLY,"Major averages were mixed early Thursday, as pressure from overseas markets supplemented reaction to earnings reports and a weak Q1 GDP estimate.The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.4%, the S&P 500 gave up 0.2% and the Nasdaq edged higher.The Federal Reserve's decision on Wednesday to hold interest rates unchanged appeared to be a mild positive for stocks.The stock market today received a mixed early nudge from the Labor Department, which estimated Q1 GDP growth at 0.5%. That was a sharp drop from Q4's 1.4% growth and just below consensus projections for a 0.7% gain. The GDP price index, which gauge's inflation, rose 0.7%, below views for a 0.9% increase.The Labor Department also said unemployment claims climbed to 257,000 in the week ended April 23, up from 248,000 in the prior week, but below estimates for 260,000 claims. The four-week moving average ticked lower to 256,000 --  its lowest level since 1973.Oil traded flat early Thursday after rising 3% Wednesday to leave West Texas Intermediate just above $45 a barrel. Gold gained almost 1%, to above $1,258 an ounce.  Bonds rose, sending the 10-year yield down 2 basis points to 1.83%.The dollar traded lower, particularly against the yen, which spiked sharply after the Bank of Japan surprisingly announced no change to its current stimulus program. The decision sent Tokyo's Nikkei 225 down 3.6%. China's markets closed narrowly mixed, but the losses in Japan spun out into trading in Europe. Eurozone markets traded down more than 1% in afternoon trading. London's FTSE 100 was down 0.9%.UnitedHealth (UNH) bucked the trend in the Dow, rising 0.6%.

Abbott shares slipped 7%.San Francisco-based biomed Medivation (MDVN) jumped 7% after news reports said France's Sanofi (SNY) offered to buy the company in a $9.3 billion deal.

Facebook's Q1 results easily cleared analyst forecasts, with a 52% revenue gain and an 83% advance in adjusted earnings. Facebook gapped up over a 117.09 buy point early Thursday.Losses were equally dramatic. Cybersecurity outfit Symantec (SYMC) lost 6% in early action. The Mountain View, Calif., company lowered its fiscal Q4 sales and earnings guidance, and it announced the resignation of CEO Michael Brown, who will continue to act as chief executive until a successor is found, the company said.PayPal (PYPL) added nearly 3% after a positive Q1 report late Wednesday. The stock has been fighting to get some lift from an alternate entry at 40.03.O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) fell furthest, down nearly 4%. The auto parts chain reported late Wednesday its Q1 sales and earnings topped consensus forecasts. But management guided Q2 earning below expectations.Nutritional supplement chain GNC (GNC) dived 26% after delivering a Q1 miss on its earnings, while revenue slipped slightly less than expected. Full-year EPS guidance was below prior guidance and far below consensus views. Management cited challenges in the company's vitamin lines and said the challenges would continue for the remainder of the year. GNC had managed a 54% climb off a January low through Wednesday, but remained well below an August high.

98,ORLY,"In his classic 1960 book, “How I Made $2,000,000 In The Stock Market,” Nicolas Darvas takes readers on his journey from professional dancer to savvy investor. With an honest look at his own mistakes and missteps, he also reveals how he developed the “box theory” he used to time his buys and sells as he traveled the world from gig to gig.More than five decades later, Darvas' strategy remains an effective way to reduce your risk and increase your returns.After following the conventional wisdom of Wall Street with limited success, Darvas took a deep dive into the study of stock charts, leading to an epiphany that would dramatically change his fortunes and also influence a young William J. O’Neil, future founder of IBD and creator of the CAN SLIM Investing System.“I started to realize that stock movements were not completely haphazard,” Darvas wrote. “Stocks did not fly like balloons in any direction. As if attracted by a magnet, they had a defined upward or downward trend which, once established, tended to continue. Within this trend stocks moved in a series of frames, or what I began to call ‘boxes.’”The Darvas box is based on the concept of support (the bottom of the box) and resistance (the top of the box).As Darvas wrote, the stock “could bounce between the top and bottom of the box and I was perfectly satisfied. Once I had decided on the dimensions of the box, the stock could do what it liked, but only within that frame.”In other words, as long as the stock doesn’t materially fall through the bottom of the price range, the box remains intact.Darvas would then continue to track the stock, waiting for a “pop-goes-the-weasel” moment, where the stock punches through the top of the box to signal a buying opportunity.As long as the stock stayed within the price range outlined by the box, things were normal. But if the stock jumped out of that box in volume that was well above average, that showed a change was afoot.Darvas used a colorful analogy to make that point:“If a tempestuous beauty were to jump on the table and do a wild dance, no one would be particularly astonished. That is the sort of characteristic behavior people have come to expect from her. But if a dignified matron were suddenly to do the same, this would be unusual and people would immediately say, 'There is something strange here – something has happened.'”In September and October 2014, O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) formed a Darvas box, which could also be called a flat base. The depth of the pattern was just 8%, with a decline from 158.60 to 146.22.The auto parts retailer bolted out of that box on weekly volume that spiked 89% above average, launching a 75% gain over the next 12 months while forming additional boxes (AKA, bases).E-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) is no stranger to shipping boxes and its stock has formed a few as well.From April to May 2015, the stock formed an 11-week long consolidation, also with a depth of 8%.Like Darvas' matron-gone-wild analogy, Amazon punched through the top of the box on daily volume 56% above average, followed by another up day in trading 85% higher than normal.From there, Amazon rose over 50% in less than eight months.Excerpt from IBD Extra Newsletter.

99,ORLY,"MFS Mid Cap Growth Fund (OTCIX) keeps a steely eye fixed on its prize. The $1.8 billion fund seeks stocks of companies best poised for growth several years into the future.When the market retreats, as it did in from December through early February, and investors favor defensive names rather than growthier ones, that hurts a fund like the MFS portfolio. Its three-month trailing performance going into Tuesday was mired around the middle of its midcap growth peer group of mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.That lags the pace it's more accustomed to. Over the past five years its 9.51% average annual gain topped 81% of its direct rivals, which averaged a 7.56% yearly return. The S&P 500 galloped ahead at an 11.21% yearly pace.Nvidia (NVDA) is Mid Cap Growth's type of stock. The fund increased its stake and weighting in each of its three most recent monthly disclosures, for November through January.Up 28% since a Feb. 11, the stock is nearing its 34.04 entry in a cup-shaped base.Earnings per share rose 13%, 18% and 21% the past three quarters. The company designs graphic processing units that are used in computers, mobile devices and game consoles.The stock has a Composite Rating of 99 from IBD. The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five stock-performance ratings, including EPS and RS Ratings, with 99 being the highest. The stock also has a 1.4% dividend yield.Five Below (FIVE) runs a chain of teen-targeted discount stores that sell a variety of goods, ranging from apparel to consumer electronics, games and candy.The stock, which sports a 99 Comp Rating, is up 41% since a 27.68 low on Dec. 2. The uptrend began when Five posted second-quarter earnings, showing 33% EPS growth, reversing a 13% prior-quarter decline.The company opened its first store in Miami on March 4. The stock is in the IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks.Payment processor Vantiv (VNTV), another IBD 50 name, is up 22% since a 43.20 low on Jan. 21. Accelerating, EPS rose 15%, 19%, 20% 23% the past four quarters.Trading around 52 in a cup-shaped base, the stock shows a 53.56 buy point.Vantiv has a 97 Comp Rating. The company benefits from merchants' and financial firms' switch to chip cards and their terminals. Vantiv's other cybersecurity products also help the stock's climb.Henry Schein (HSIC), with a 97 Comp Rating, is up 14% since Feb. 8.The stock's climb began a day before the company announced record fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results. The company also affirmed its EPS guidance for 2016.EPS for the global provider of health care products and medical equipment grew 8%, 8%, 16% and 7% the past four quarters.O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) has a cup-shaped base with a 278.06 entry. An alternative earlier entry is at 266.33.An early entry crops up when a stock crosses an area of price resistance within a base in unmistakably strong volume. The volume is a sign that funds are behind the stock's move.The stock is benefiting from low gasoline prices. Those encourage more driving, which leads to more maintenance. Some analysts recently raised price targets or buy-sell-hold recommendations. Last month, the company reported better-than-expected Q4 results and added $750 million to its share buyback plan.

Meanwhile, several top-rated stocks start the week in or near buying range.Vantiv (VNTV), O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Broadcom Limited (AVGO) are among highly rated stocks that are close to entry points or in a buy area right now.Check out IBD's Leaderboard for chart analysis of leading stocks near entry points.The social networking giant will begin Oculus Rift headset shipments on Monday, turning virtual reality into a reality. Facebook has been taking orders for the $599 headset since January. Samsung has already launched Gear VR, while Sony will ship its Playstation VR system later this year. While video games and entertainment will lead VR, Facebook and others see a wide range of uses.Facebook stock has been consolidating since hitting a record high on Feb. 2. Shares rose 51 cents to 113.05 on Friday, with a buy point at 117.69.Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to address the Economic Club of New York on Tuesday. Investors will be listening closely for any hints of when the central bank might raise interest rates again. Earlier this month the Fed signaled that it would raise rates just twice this year, and its dovish tone spurred markets to get ready for a move in September. That weakened the dollar, which boosted oil and commodities, which in turn lifted stocks.But several Fed officials last week argued that policymakers could act sooner, perhaps as early as the next meeting in April -- reversing the dollar-oil-stock direction.So Yellen could offer some clarity about the Fed, and set the tone for financial markets for the coming days and weeks.Drive-in fast food chain Sonic (SONC) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q2 earnings on Tuesday. Sonic is expected to have earned 16 cents a share during the three months ended Feb. 29, up 23% from a year earlier, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.

The Model 3 debut will be streamed on the company's website and Tesla will take orders after the unveiling.But that will leave some big questions. Can Tesla meet its late 2017 deadline for starting Model 3 shipments, followed by true mass production?A change to a more affordable model is a big one for Tesla Motors, whose Model S sedan is priced at $70,000 and its Model X SUV has a retail price of $80,000. A price has not yet been released for the Model 3, but it's expected to retail at $35,000, with various tax subsidies potentially lowering that to $25,000.After slumping 41% to start the year, Tesla shares have come roaring back, gaining 62% since hitting an intraday low of 141.05 on Feb. 9.President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet on Thursday while world leaders gather in Washington, D.C., for a nuclear nonproliferation summit.

Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking higher than Tuesday's levels.In the stock market today, UnitedHealth (UNH), Visa (V) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) outperformed in the Dow. Nike (NKE) lagged, falling 3% after the company reported earnings late Tuesday.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) slumped 3%.  The ETF was weak, as gold prices fell due to strength in the U.S. dollar.

118,ORLY,"AutoZone (AZO) topped quarterly earnings views early Tuesday and delivered another solid same-store sales gain as the No. 1 U.S. auto parts retailer benefited from upbeat industry trends and higher margins.Reporting before the open, AutoZone earned $7.43 a share for its fiscal second quarter, which ended in February. That was up 14% from the prior year and comfortably above consensus analyst estimates for $7.28.Net sales rose 5% to $2.26 billion, matching views. Same-store sales climbed 3.6% from a year earlier after rising 3.5% during the first quarter.Gross profit as a percentage of sales widened to 52.7% from 52.2% the prior year, driven by higher merchandise margins.AutoZone shares closed up 2.1% on the stock market today.The company continues to benefit from strength in the auto parts industry’s do-it-yourself (DIY) segment, which targets home mechanics. That segment has gotten a leg up from several favorable trends -- including lower gasoline prices and an aging fleet of cars on the road -- and helped boost business at rivals such as O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY).“Low and declining gas prices are helping boost vehicles miles traveled (leading to failure- and maintenance-related part sales) and leading low-end DIY consumers to spend more on discretionary items for their vehicles,” Wedbush analyst Seth Basham noted in a recent report.More than 80% of AutoZone’s sales are to consumers rather than professional mechanics, he says, making it the “best positioned to take advantage of the relative strength in the DIY segment.""AutoZone also has gotten a lift from a new “mega hub” distribution strategy designed to improve inventory coverage through increased shipping frequency from its distribution centers to its retail stores.The company continues to roll out the strategy to more stores. About 1,300 of its 5,200 U.S. stores were serviced by the new strategy at the end of Q2, with about 2,000 stores expected to be serviced by the end of the fiscal year.“Our results to date continue to meet or exceed our expectations, further confirming our new inventory deployment strategy,” AutoZone CEO Bill Rhodes said in a statement. “While we continue to strategically invest in our business in order to support our growth, we remain committed to our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively.”While AutoZone and O’Reilly continue to pump out robust revenue and earnings growth, other auto parts retailers have seen a recent slowdown in business.Advance Auto Parts (AAP) reported lower sales and earnings during its 2015 fourth quarter -- the first time in more than three years that both metrics dipped during a single quarter.Meanwhile, Genuine Parts (GPC) has logged three straight quarters of flat earnings and two straight quarters of lower revenue.

Year to date, the Russell 1000, which represents the biggest companies in Russell's universe, gained 1.3%, in contrast to -1.3% for the Russell 2000, the smallest companies.In the second half of the year, the outperformance is even more pronounced, with the big-cap segment gaining 0.6% since June 30 and the small-cap segment losing 5.2%.So, it's no surprise to see familiar big-cap names in prominent places in the Weekly Review.IBD ranks the 60-stock Internet content industry group No. 1 among a total of 197 groups, based on six-month performance.Big-cap leaders like Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) (both Class A and Class C, which trade separately but generally track one another) and LinkedIn (LNKD) have driven the group's advance.The group is up 21.5% for the year so far.Facebook is the top-rated group's No. 1 stock by Composite Rating.All three have reported cheery Q3 earnings. Facebook and Alphabet are extended from breakouts, while LinkedIn has set up in a deep cup-with-handle base with a 258.49 buy point.Salesforce.com (CRM) is the No. 1 stock in the enterprise software industry group, which ranks No. 6.

Strong jobs numbers last week eased concerns about a possible U.S. recession. Crude oil prices are working on their fourth consecutive week of gains. This has eased fears that job losses in the oil industry will offset any boost lower gasoline prices give to consumer spending.However, weak trade data from China thrust the Chinese economy back to the top of the worry list. Data for February showed that exports fell 25.4% from a year earlier.Oil, steel and mining stocks led the downside. In the S&P 500, Devon Energy (DVN) took the biggest hit, with the oil and natural gas explorer falling almost 9% in heavy volume, though there was no news specific to the stock.Meanwhile, semiconductor stocks also skidded. The chip groups have rallied about 20% off their February lows and were probably due for some profit-taking.Blue chips were mostly down.

The stock has a highest-possible Composite Rating of 99.Gun maker Smith & Wesson also has a 99 Composite Rating. The stock is trading 3% below a cup-base buy point of 26.64.

146,ORLY,"IBD: Like a lot of mutual funds, your portfolio endured a challenging third quarter. October's stock market rally brought relief to you. The Q3 culprits seemed to be the China correction, the Federal Reserve delaying its long-promised interest-rate hike and political bashing of drugmakers. Does that square with your account?
"
147,ORLY,"Turek: I think you hit it on the head. From a macro standpoint, the first two points are spot on. Issues in China, the devaluation, caused a lot of uncertainty in global growth and impact on emerging markets.
"
148,ORLY,"It put a lot of questions on the table, especially for U.S. exports.
"
149,ORLY,"And the Fed punting was not well taken by the marketplace.
"
150,ORLY,"From a secular standpoint, health care affected us quite a bit. It started with (Hillary) Clinton's (critical) chatter about drug pricing (being excessive). Then there was piling on by other pundits and politicians. But pricing (criticism) is not a new thing. It's been around, and it will be around. So this too shall pass.
"
151,ORLY,"IBD: You trimmed some health stocks due to the beating that segment was taking, right?
"
152,ORLY,"Turek: We weren't so concerned about the health care services area, like hospitals. Where we trimmed was in a couple of areas: therapeutics and biotech.
"
153,ORLY,"We had success in (those areas). So part of our trimming was profit-taking. Part was due to the uncertainty that the pricing risk to the industry created. We don't know how that will play out. So we more or less across the board trimmed a lot of positions.
"
154,ORLY,"IBD: And by ""therapeutics"" you mean which types of stocks?
"
155,ORLY,"Turek: Specialty pharmaceuticals and biotech. It does not include the Bristol-Myers Squibbs (BMY) of the world. They're too big. There aren't a lot of regular drugmakers in our midcap space. They're too big. We're interested in smaller versions of Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers.
"
156,ORLY,"The smaller companies we focus on are specialized in one or two areas of health care.
"
157,ORLY,"IBD: You like innovators, right?
"
158,ORLY,"Turek: Yes, we look for that whether they're in tech, health care or consumer discretionary.
"
159,ORLY,"We like companies that are doing something unique. If a company has a competitive advantage or a moat, so much the better. The advantage could be something like a new drug or software product. In consumer discretionary, it might be that the company is innovative, like Under Armour (UA), coming out with new products consistently, expanding rapidly as well. A couple of years ago, they only made apparel. Now they're coming out with footwear.
"
160,ORLY,"IBD: In what sectors are you increasing your weights?
"
161,ORLY,"Turek: In October, not much at all. We're watching. Where we're interested in doing that is in tech. And to be quite honest about it: In health care, prices have come down so much that maybe it's overdone. Prices have started to look pretty cheap in the past six to eight weeks.
"
162,ORLY,"So perhaps in the near future, we'll be at a point where interest in that area increases quite a bit.
"
163,ORLY,"We'll pass on some. But we'll get back to others based on fundamentals — companies that are doing something new and innovative, that deserve to be paid for.
"
164,ORLY,"IBD: Do you still like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) despite its recent pullback?
"
165,ORLY,"Turek: We still like it. These guys are best of breed as far as creating the next-generation firewall and security, as opposed to a single-point product provider.
"
166,ORLY,"We don't think anything has changed. And there's still a high degree of need for security spending from all kinds of enterprises and government units as well. That's not necessarily going to abate.
"
167,ORLY,"Competition is vigorous, but Palo Alto has done a good job of being innovative in designing and offering a suite of products to forestall hacking.
"
168,ORLY,"IBD: Describe the attractive innovations of Ultimate Software Group (ULTI).
"
169,ORLY,"Turek: Ultimate is a human-capital management company. Their niche is the marketplace below large companies, companies with 500 to 1,500 employees, which was their sweet spot for a long time.
"
170,ORLY,"They offer cloud-based solutions, so you get continuous updates and upgrades for a suite of products. It makes the cost of ownership affordable, especially for midsize companies that don't necessarily have IT expertise in-house.
"
171,ORLY,"What they've done in the past year is move down-market to companies with between 100 and 500 employees. They're starting at the high end of that. And they're having good success.
"
172,ORLY,"That's going to add to their top-line growth. They have a high retention rate, over 95% if I remember correctly.
"
173,ORLY,"IBD: What innovation by Avago Technologies (AVGO) interests you the most right now?
"
174,ORLY,"Turek: Avago is a fabless semiconductor (company). They outsource manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and others.
"
175,ORLY,"Their big thing is called FBAR, which stands for ""film bulk acoustic resonators."" FBARs are important, as the amount of data and signals from the expansion in the number of wireless phones causes noise. FBARs smooth out the noise and prevent dropped calls.
"
176,ORLY,"As the technology for wireless gets more complicated, more FBARs are needed in each phone.
"
177,ORLY,"But even that won't last forever, so they've bought companies to diversify their business stream.
"
178,ORLY,"IBD: What made IT hardware and software provider CDW's (CDW) earnings per share grow 9%, 19% and 21% the past three stanzas?
"
179,ORLY,"Turek: CDW is a leading distributor of all things information-related. The value they add is that customers — many of which are small or midsize and don't have a lot of in-house IT expertise — rely on CDW to solve problems. They (do that by partnering) customers with their general sales reps and with sales engineers who are experts in fields like Wi-Fi and routing.
"
180,ORLY,"IBD: If the U.S. economy is improving, and if car sales are rising, why do consumers need car parts for repairs of older cars? What's the appeal of O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY)?
"
181,ORLY,"Turek: The average age of the U.S. car fleet hasn't changed much in recent years, even as new-car sales have risen.
"
182,ORLY,"What's transforming the company is that they used to sell just to do-it-yourselfers. What the company did was start to sell parts to the professional or do-it-for-you channel. And they've had a lot of success in that. They're not necessarily selling to dealers, although they do. They're selling to mom-and-pop car-repair shops.
"
183,ORLY,"IBD: What is Signet Jewelers' (SIG) innovation?
"
184,ORLY,"Turek: We got interested when they bought a primary competitor, Zales. Signet was a better operator. So the opportunity was that Signet would overlay their management ability on Zales and improve the top and bottom lines of Zales over time.
"
185,ORLY,"They've owned it about a year and have started to have success in those areas. Unlocking the value in Zales was important (to our decision to invest).
"
186,ORLY,"Most recently, this quarter Signet plans their biggest new product introduction ever, a diamond ring called Ever Us, a high-quality diamond ring set that it will roll out across all of their stores. That's unusual. We hope it will be a big product for them in 2015 and into '16.
"
187,ORLY,"IBD: You've increased your stake in Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) in recent disclosures. Why do you like them more than other cruiselines?
"
188,ORLY,"Turek: They attract a slightly higher-end customer, who are less sensitive to price increases and economic shifts as well.
"
189,ORLY,"NCL has a high yield on their ships. They haven't added capacity at the same pace as their competitors, so they're easier to fill for cruises. And, knock on wood, they're accident free, which helps their reputation.
"
190,ORLY,"So recently we've liked their pricing power. It's a better offering than Royal Caribbean (RCL). And (low) oil prices have been a tailwind. Plus, they face new opportunities. They're eager to see what happens to Cuba. And now China is opening to cruisers. These should aid NCL and the industry.
"
191,ORLY,"IBD: Why have you boosted your stake in Alaska Air Group (ALK) rather than some other airline?
"
192,ORLY,"Turek: These guys are really good operators. They started as a West Coast airline. Now they're going transcontinental and midcontinental. They have really good financials, good return on equity, good free cash flow, good customer satisfaction levels. They're growing in the low double digits for the next couple of years. And it's a joy to listen to them talk about their business. They're having fun.
"
193,ORLY,"IBD: Why did you start a stake in Tyler Technologies (TYL) this year?
"
194,ORLY,"Turek: We started it in June or July, I think. It came from something my analyst had talked about. They're a leader in providing financial and ERP (enterprise resource planning) software to local and state governments.
"
195,ORLY,"A lot of those governments are behind in technology, compared with private enterprises, so there's a need for them to modernize a lot of their systems.
"
196,ORLY,"Tyler was a leader in the criminal justice area and has branched out into other areas like appraisal, taxes, public safety and vital records. Governments are getting that moving from legacy paper-based records to cloud-based records makes records easier to manage and makes things easier for us as consumers of public records.
"
197,ORLY,"You wouldn't think it's a great market, but it is, even with the headwind of a lack of financing.
"
198,ORLY,"IBD: Why have you been edging up your stake in Acuity Brands (AYI), a maker of lighting products?
"
199,ORLY,"Turek: This is a play on energy efficiency in nonresidential areas. It's not wholly dependent on new construction. A lot of it is retrofitting. They replace a lot of old fluorescent lights with LEDs, which save energy — money — for owners of those businesses.Best Mutual Funds 2015: October Performance ReportThe $1.2 billion Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth Fund is looking to regain the top-notch form it displayed earlier this year, before the made-in-China sell-off dragged down the overall market.The fund, run by Ken Turek for nearly 13 years, was topping 85% of its midcap growth peers over the past 12 months ended Oct. 31, with a 7.55% gain, according to Morningstar Inc.That's after the mutual fund slid 7.88% in the past three months, which included the August-September broad market tumble.Longer-term, Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth is a top performing mutual fund that has made a lot of money for its investors.Over the past five years, the fund's 13.42% average annual gain beat 71% of its direct rivals.And like many of his rivals, he got a boost by the October rally with IBD from his office in Chicago.IBD: Like a lot of mutual funds, your portfolio endured a challenging third quarter.

201,ORLY,"Auto parts retailers such as O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) have been some of the market’s strongest performers in recent years as consumers have shown a willingness to keep their cars on the road longer, rather than buying a new car.The do-it-yourself trend hasn’t exactly hurt new-car sales in the U.S., though, as auto sales hit a record high of 17.47 million in 2015, topping the old record of 17.35 million set in 2000.O’Reilly has the largest market capitalization in the auto parts group at around $25 billion. AutoZone (AZO) is next at $22 billion, followed by Advance Auto Parts (AAP) at nearly $12 billion.When O’Reilly reported Q3 results in late October, profit and sales growth accelerated sequentially from the second quarter, rising 25% and 11%, respectively. Same-store sales, which exclude sales at newly opened stores and are a key industry metric, rose an impressive 7.9%. In Q2, same-stores had risen 7.2%.Stern Agee on Tuesday upgraded O’Reilly to buy from neutral and with a 300 price target, saying O’Reilly’s recent pullback offered an attractive entry.Q4 results are due Feb. 10.

206,ORLY,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: Q3 Performance Report
"
207,ORLY,"U.S. diversified stock funds declined 3.51% in September, capping off an 8.15% decline for the third quarter overall, according to Lipper Inc. data.
"
208,ORLY,"That was the third worst Q3 decline by the group in 10 years. It was the sixth worst decline by the group in any quarter the past decade.
"
209,ORLY,"In a quarter marked by investor jitters, the top-performing U.S. diversified mutual funds were dedicated short-bias funds. They surged 16.47%.
"
210,ORLY,"That same group also led in September, advancing 4.73%.
"
211,ORLY,"Among just the major market-capitalization-and-style categories, large-cap growth did best in Q3 by losing the least for investors: 6.30%.
"
212,ORLY,"Large-cap core funds were tops in September. Their 2.93% setback for the month was smaller than any other group's loss.
"
213,ORLY,"International stock mutual funds slightly outperformed in September, losing 3.44%.
"
214,ORLY,"But they lagged U.S. diversifieds in Q3, losing 11.24%.
"
215,ORLY,"All in all, the market drubbing was a setback for any investor's retirement planning.
"
216,ORLY,"Last month and in Q3 overall, investors' anxiety was cooked up in China, with sour seasoning thrown in by the Federal Reserve.
"
217,ORLY,"""China was the No. 1 reason,"" said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist of Nuveen Asset Management. ""The Fed was No. 2. No. 3 was general concern about the pace of economic growth.""
"
218,ORLY,"Rich Weiss, senior portfolio manager of American Century's target-date One Choice Portfolios, said, ""China's growth is decelerating.""
"
219,ORLY,"No one outside the Chinese government knows the exact size and pace of the slowdown or whether it has bottomed, he said. ""That uncertainty makes the market nervous. And it creates more uncertainty about China's ability to manage the slowdown so it does not become worse than it is.""
"
220,ORLY,"How much China's ills will affect America is what investors want to know. ""How bad can it get? In September the market was very frightened by that question,"" said Jim Swanson, MFS Investment Management's chief investment strategist.
"
221,ORLY,"Vanguard 500 Index , tracking the broad market, lost 2.49% in September.
"
222,ORLY,"Q3's top-performing nonleveraged U.S. diversified stock fund with more than $100 million in assets was $555 million Polen Growth Institutional.
"
223,ORLY,"It edged up 0.7% despite losing 0.53% in September.
"
224,ORLY,"A focused large-cap growth fund holding 22 names, it has top holdings such as Starbucks (SBUX), which has IBD's Composite Rating of 99; Nike (NKE), with a Comp Rating of 97; and O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), with a Comp Rating of 98.
"
225,ORLY,"Composite Ratings range from 1-99, with 99 the best.
"
226,ORLY,"The two best performing funds with more than $1.5 billion in assets year to date are $2.2 billion Janus Forty and $1.7 billion Fidelity Small Cap Growth , up 3.95% and 3.46%, respectively.
"
227,ORLY,"Outlook
"
228,ORLY,"So what lies ahead?
"
229,ORLY,"Investors are looking for signs that China's slowdown has leveled off. Finding reliable signs is dicey.
"
230,ORLY,"Many investors believe that the Chinese government cooks its numbers for political reasons. ""Official data comes through a filter,"" said Weiss. ""And there are questions about their integrity. Is the government trying to make things look better than they might (really) be?""
"
231,ORLY,"To compensate, investors watch data that are harder for the government to fudge. ""Investors watch indicators of economic activity, such as electricity consumption, car sales and transportation industry data,"" Doll said.
"
232,ORLY,"Swanson keeps an eye on China's monthly retail sales data, which have been improving. He also watches the purchasing managers' index. ""If that keeps falling, it shows their economy is still getting worse,"" he said.
"
233,ORLY,"As for the U.S., despite the stock market's doldrums the economy is in good shape — for the moment.
"
234,ORLY,"Signs of improvement could emerge in mid-October as the third-quarter earnings report season starts. Investors are expecting mixed to good results, Doll says. Anything less would likely have a chilling effect on the market.
"
235,ORLY,"Swanson notes that the Q2 GDP estimate was revised upward in late September to a strong 3.9%.
"
236,ORLY,"""New housing starts have accelerated,"" he said. ""Retail personal consumption numbers show Americans making more money and spending it. Week by week, even through this whole period of (stock market) sell-offs, unemployment claims fell and the composite picture you get is that, so far, the U.S. hasn't missed a beat due to China.""
"
237,ORLY,"Investors generally expect the Fed to act in December, says Swanson. Investors will take additional foot dragging as a clue from the Fed that the economy is not strong enough to withstand a rate hike.
"
238,ORLY,"""The market wants (the Fed) to raise rates,"" he said. ""Like taking a patient off antibiotics, it will indicate that the patient is healthy.""
"
239,ORLY,"Mindful of macro events in China and the U.S., American Century's asset allocation team has begun adjusting its funds' holdings.
"
240,ORLY,"""We were generally 5% overweight toward growth funds and 5% underweight in value. We're now equal-weighted to 1% overweight growth,"" he said.
"
241,ORLY,"He added: ""We're not bracing for a recession. We haven't moved into utilities and financials, but we've taken some cyclical positions off the table.""
"
242,ORLY,"In sectors, his group has trimmed consumer discretionary to a market weight and trimmed its tech overweight.
"
243,ORLY,"In fixed income, his group has boosted its allocation to TIPS, especially shorter-term TIPS, ""directly in response to a rate-hike prospect,"" he said. ""We're replacing some diversified bonds with TIPS.""
"
244,ORLY,"He added: ""We've battened down the hatches.""
"
245,ORLY,"Sectors In Focus
"
246,ORLY,"Real estate funds topped sectors in September, gaining 2.22%, one of the few sectors up last month.
"
247,ORLY,"As the market sold off, many investors shifted money to REIT funds for the sake of dividend yield. Utility funds, seen by many investors as even more of a proxy for bonds, did not fare as well. They lost 1.09%.
"

261,ORLY,"Weiss' team has cut foreign stock allocations ""across the board.""Best Mutual Funds 2015: Q3 Performance ReportU.S. diversified stock funds declined 3.51% in September, capping off an 8.15% decline for the third quarter overall, according to Lipper Inc. data.That was the third worst Q3 decline by the group in 10 years. It was the sixth worst decline by the group in any quarter the past decade.In a quarter marked by investor jitters, the top-performing U.S. diversified mutual funds were dedicated short-bias funds. They surged 16.47%.That same group also led in September, advancing 4.73%.Among just the major market-capitalization-and-style categories, large-cap growth did best in Q3 by losing the least for investors: 6.30%.Large-cap core funds were tops in September. Their 2.93% setback for the month was smaller than any other group's loss.International stock mutual funds slightly outperformed in September, losing 3.44%.But they lagged U.S. diversifieds in Q3, losing 11.24%.All in all, the market drubbing was a setback for any investor's retirement planning.Last month and in Q3 overall, investors' anxiety was cooked up in China, with sour seasoning thrown in by the Federal Reserve.""China was the No. 1 reason,"" said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist of Nuveen Asset Management. ""The Fed was No. 2. No. 3 was general concern about the pace of economic growth.""Rich Weiss, senior portfolio manager of American Century's target-date One Choice Portfolios, said, ""China's growth is decelerating.""No one outside the Chinese government knows the exact size and pace of the slowdown or whether it has bottomed, he said. ""That uncertainty makes the market nervous. And it creates more uncertainty about China's ability to manage the slowdown so it does not become worse than it is.""How much China's ills will affect America is what investors want to know. ""How bad can it get? In September the market was very frightened by that question,"" said Jim Swanson, MFS Investment Management's chief investment strategist.Vanguard 500 Index , tracking the broad market, lost 2.49% in September.Q3's top-performing nonleveraged U.S. diversified stock fund with more than $100 million in assets was $555 million Polen Growth Institutional.It edged up 0.7% despite losing 0.53% in September.A focused large-cap growth fund holding 22 names, it has top holdings such as Starbucks (SBUX), which has IBD's Composite Rating of 99; Nike (NKE), with a Comp Rating of 97; and O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), with a Comp Rating of 98.Composite Ratings range from 1-99, with 99 the best.The two best performing funds with more than $1.5 billion in assets year to date are $2.2 billion Janus Forty and $1.7 billion Fidelity Small Cap Growth , up 3.95% and 3.46%, respectively.OutlookSo what lies ahead?Investors are looking for signs that China's slowdown has leveled off. Finding reliable signs is dicey.Many investors believe that the Chinese government cooks its numbers for political reasons. ""Official data comes through a filter,"" said Weiss. ""And there are questions about their integrity. Is the government trying to make things look better than they might (really) be?""To compensate, investors watch data that are harder for the government to fudge. ""Investors watch indicators of economic activity, such as electricity consumption, car sales and transportation industry data,"" Doll said.Swanson keeps an eye on China's monthly retail sales data, which have been improving. He also watches the purchasing managers' index. ""If that keeps falling, it shows their economy is still getting worse,"" he said.As for the U.S., despite the stock market's doldrums the economy is in good shape — for the moment.Signs of improvement could emerge in mid-October as the third-quarter earnings report season starts. Investors are expecting mixed to good results, Doll says. Anything less would likely have a chilling effect on the market.Swanson notes that the Q2 GDP estimate was revised upward in late September to a strong 3.9%.""New housing starts have accelerated,"" he said. ""Retail personal consumption numbers show Americans making more money and spending it. Week by week, even through this whole period of (stock market) sell-offs, unemployment claims fell and the composite picture you get is that, so far, the U.S. hasn't missed a beat due to China.""Investors generally expect the Fed to act in December, says Swanson. Investors will take additional foot dragging as a clue from the Fed that the economy is not strong enough to withstand a rate hike.""The market wants (the Fed) to raise rates,"" he said. ""Like taking a patient off antibiotics, it will indicate that the patient is healthy.""Mindful of macro events in China and the U.S., American Century's asset allocation team has begun adjusting its funds' holdings.""We were generally 5% overweight toward growth funds and 5% underweight in value. We're now equal-weighted to 1% overweight growth,"" he said.He added: ""We're not bracing for a recession. We haven't moved into utilities and financials, but we've taken some cyclical positions off the table.""In sectors, his group has trimmed consumer discretionary to a market weight and trimmed its tech overweight.In fixed income, his group has boosted its allocation to TIPS, especially shorter-term TIPS, ""directly in response to a rate-hike prospect,"" he said. ""We're replacing some diversified bonds with TIPS.""He added: ""We've battened down the hatches.""Sectors In FocusReal estate funds topped sectors in September, gaining 2.22%, one of the few sectors up last month.As the market sold off, many investors shifted money to REIT funds for the sake of dividend yield. Utility funds, seen by many investors as even more of a proxy for bonds, did not fare as well. They lost 1.09%.Weiss likes U.S. defensive sectors best, given slowing global demand.Global Market OutlookThe only happy story in foreign stock funds in September was the 1.35% gain by India region funds.All others lost ground.Latin American funds lost 6.64%, easily the worst laggards among foreign stock funds.For Q3, no nation or region gained ground.Latin American funds lost the most, 21.69%.

262,ORLY,"What a difference a week makes. Not long ago, scores of stocks saw their breakouts fizzle, if not trigger sell signals, amid the recent market downturn. Now, with the market back in a confirmed uptrend, many leaders have recovered and broken out to new highs or are setting up for potential breakouts.In fact, a few IBD 50 stocks such as Epam Systems (EPAM), Global Payments (GPN) and Universal Insurance (UVE) are already well out of reach from their buy points.Some other leaders are still within the 5% buy zone from their recent breakouts.Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK) cleared a 45.25 cup-with-handle buy point Tuesday. Note that volume was only 15% above average, short of the 40% minimum threshold that's ideal at a breakout. The base was also late stage, which carries higher risk than early-stage patterns. Ozarks reports Q3 earnings Tuesday after the close.On Thursday, Starbucks (SBUX) recrossed a 59.06 buy point that it initially climbed past Monday. It remains 1% above the entry. Turnover was below average both days. An up-down volume ratio above the neutral 1.0 level, however, indicates demand for shares.Total System Services (TSS) on Friday cleared an early 48.18 buy point of a cup with handle in average trade. The conventional entry is just ahead at 48.77. The stock has advanced in eight of the past nine sessions. Its relative strength line is in new high ground, a bullish sign.The Georgia-based company leads the credit card and payment processing group with a 99 Composite Rating. The group also includes Global Payments and Blackhawk Network (HAWK).Blackhawk rose past a 46.23 entry intraday Friday before closing slightly below the entry. Excluding the Aug. 24 flash crash, the correction in the base was 18%, normal for a proper pattern. The provider of gift cards and payment service reports Q3 results Tuesday after the close.Other IBD 50 stocks nearing their buy points and setting up potential breakouts across a broad range of sectors include Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which is 3% below a 758.71 flat-base buy point.O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) is close to a 258.25 entry, also from a flat base, and Paycom Software (PAYC) is slightly below a 41.68 buy point.All the stocks in this column were in the Oct. 5 issue. The IBD 50 index rose 2.3% for the week vs. a 3.3% gain for the S&P 500.

271,ORLY,"Pep Boys Acquired
"
272,ORLY,"The group is doing so well that even members considered to be laggards are attracting attention.
"
273,ORLY,"Case in point: Monday's news that auto parts supplier Bridgestone will acquire Pep Boys — Manny, Moe & Jack (PBY) for about $835 million. Bridgestone will pay $15 a share in cash, a 23% premium over Pep Boys' Oct. 23 closing price. The deal is expected to close early in 2016.
"
274,ORLY,"Bridgestone paid the premium even though Pep Boys has underperformed for most of this decade. The company's annual revenue has barely budged over the last three years, and it hasn't grown annual earnings since 2011. The fact that Pep Boys brought such a rich buyout offer says a lot about how much auto parts retailers are valued right now, analysts say.
"
275,ORLY,"""It certainly signifies the health and strength of the industry when you see a company pay that much for Pep Boys, which historically has been a laggard in the industry,"" Sterne Agee CRT analyst Ali-Ahmad Faghri told IBD. Faghri follows several auto parts stocks, including O'Reilly and AutoZone, but not Pep Boys.
"
276,ORLY,"The industry's strength is the result of several dynamics, analysts say. One is the average age of cars on U.S. roads: a record 11.5 years, according to research firm IHS Automotive. Older cars require more of the replacement parts, maintenance and repair work that auto parts retailers provide.
"
277,ORLY,"The aging fleet has also put more vehicles on the road — a record 250 million, according to Bloomberg. More cars lead to higher demand for auto parts and services.
"
278,ORLY,"Lower gas prices have been a boon as well. When consumers pay less for gas, they have an incentive to drive more, which increases demand for parts and services.
"
279,ORLY,"""Miles driven has been a critical growth driver — we've seen a nice uptick there,"" Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck told IBD. ""Consumers are increasing their miles driven, which increases the wear and tear on cars.""
"
280,ORLY,"Do-It-For-Me Fuels Retailers
"
281,ORLY,"Meanwhile, a growing number of consumers are outsourcing maintenance and repair to auto parts retailers rather than doing it themselves. This Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) side of the business has provided an additional revenue stream for auto parts retailers, which used to rely almost exclusively on the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) market.
"
282,ORLY,"""We continue to see growth in the Do-It-For-Me market, which has been a major growth driver for these companies,"" Fleck said.
"
283,ORLY,"Finally, auto parts retailers — unlike most other retailers — have not been hurt by Amazon and other e-commerce sites. That's mainly because when someone needs an auto part, he or she doesn't like to wait around for it to arrive by mail.
"
284,ORLY,"""Given the focus of service and speed, online retailers like Amazon haven't disrupted the auto parts retailers,"" Faghri said.
"
285,ORLY,"These favorable trends have helped offset what is normally a headwind for auto parts retailers — rising vehicle sales.
"
286,ORLY,"U.S. auto sales climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 18.2 million in September, the highest rate in more than a decade.
"
287,ORLY,"September was particularly strong because it included the full Labor Day weekend. Some experts expect the pace to slow in October, though the annual rate should still be the highest since before the Great Recession.
"
288,ORLY,"Last week, auto industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive raised their forecasts for 2015 auto sales to 17.3 million vehicles from 17.2 million.
"
289,ORLY,"And while more new cars on the road previously translated into less demand for replacement parts and maintenance services, previous conditions no longer prevail.
"
290,ORLY,"One thing that's different these days: older cars aren't being sent to the graveyard just because their owners are buying new ones. Instead, owners are trading their old cars in or selling them.

""Cars last longer than they used to, so there's a secular shift going on there.

295,ORLY,"Auto-parts stores have at least three trends working in their favor.First, low gasoline prices lead people to drive more, and that means more repairs.Second, the age of the average car and light truck is expected to rise to 11.6 years in 2016, according to research firm IHS Automotive. Old also means more repairs.Third, the number of truly old vehicles -- 12 years and older -- is expected to grow 15% by 2020.Also, currency translation, a problem for many companies now, generally isn't a problem for the auto-parts chains.The stock market seems to have baked in these realities. During the market pullback, the auto parts group retreated less than the S&P 500. Six weeks ago, the group was No. 33 of 197 groups. As of Wednesday's IBD, the group was No. 32.Two stocks in the group held up especially well.AutoZone (AZO) is only 7% off its prior high. O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) is 11% off its high. The two stocks kept their consolidations fairly shallow, making a breakout from a new pattern possible.At an early December earnings call, AutoZone CEO William Rhodes said the company added 22 net new stores in the U.S.While do-it-yourself remains the chief focus, ""Our commercial business continues to gain traction, growing sales 10%, with 55 net new programs open for the quarter,"" Rhodes said.As of November, AutoZone had 5,635 stores in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Mexico and Brazil.Among top mutual funds in Q4, Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) upped its position by 10% and Fidelity Balanced Fund (FBALX) jacked up its stake about 122%. Contrafund also cranked up its position in O'Reilly by 6% in Q4.At the Oct. 30 earnings call, CEO Gregory Henslee said the company generated same-store sales of 7.9% in Q3. Earnings grew 25%, the 27th quarter in a row of EPS growth of at least 15%.O'Reilly Automotive expects to add 210 net new stores in 2016. As of Sept. 30, the company had 4,523 stores in 43 states.Q4 results will be released Feb. 10 after the close. The Street expects 18% earnings growth on an 8% revenue pop.The charts: AutoZone is working on a 14%-deep pattern. The stock is trying to retake the 50-day moving average. Previous breakouts since October 2014 led to gains of 11%, 12%, 7% and 6%. Pullbacks were in the 4%-to-14% range.O'Reilly's pattern is 19% deep and first stage. The stock is finding resistance at its 50-day line. Previous breakouts since October 2014 led to gains of 24%, 9%, 8%, 12% and 8%. Pullbacks were in the 5% to 19% range.So, if an individual investor plans to trade the stock, the standard 20%-to-25% gain is probably unrealistic. Those who plan to buy and hold through several consolidations might get a bigger profit, if the pullbacks remain minor.

296,ORLY,"S&P 500 companies are on track for their first year-over-year earnings decline since 2009, led by energy woes and a sluggish global economy, with weak revenue a continued concern.

315,ORLY,"Facebook (FB), Visa (V) and Walt Disney (DIS) are among the big-name results on tap in the coming week.S&P 500 companies are on track for their first year-over-year earnings decline since 2009, led by energy woes and a sluggish global economy, with weak revenue a continued concern.With 341 companies already reporting, the large-cap S&P 500's earnings are seen falling 1% as revenue declines 3.6%. Earnings haven't dropped since Q3 2009, but it would be the third straight decline for sales.Energy is a huge drag. Hurt by plunging oil prices and slowing demand in China, Brazil, Russia and other nations, the energy sector is expected to notch a 59.4% earnings dive, with revenue off by 35.7%. Chevron (CVX) on Friday posted an 88% drop in earnings per share. Exxon Mobil (XOM) saw a 47% fall.But it's not just energy. Stripping out that sector, S&P 500 earnings should grow 6.3%, the fourth straight quarter of slowing — and the smallest gain since Q1 2013. Revenue should rise 1.7% after Q2's multiyear low of 1.5%.""The main theme still is 'energy is still pulling everything down,' making everything look worse than it really is,"" said Gregory Harrison, a senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters.But the weak revenue growth remains worrisome.""There's a concern that some of the growth in earnings is coming from cost cutting and share buybacks,"" Harrison said.Consumers Drive Auto GainsThe consumer discretionary sector is a bright spot, expected to deliver 13.5% earnings growth.

345,ORLY,"Third-quarter corporate profits are not looking swell. According to S&P Capital IQ, earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to fall 5.1%, hurt largely by weakness in energy. But earnings for the consumer discretionary sector are slated to jump 11.8%, the best among the 10 S&P sectors.A few industry groups in the consumer discretionary space are staying stout amid a still-rocky market environment.The apparel and shoe manufacturers' group, ranked No. 3 in Wednesday's IBD, is benefiting from the athleisure trend — the use of athletic footwear and clothing in casual settings.Earlier this year, Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at NPD Group, noted that casual and athleisure is more than a trend; it's a lifestyle that's not going away in the near future.Nike (NKE), one of the highest-rated stocks in the group, posted profit growth of 19% to 27% in the past five quarters. This is an impressive feat for a company with a market cap of more than $100 billion. The Beaverton, Ore.-based firm is seeing strength across most product categories and geographies, and remains a solid industry leader.Skechers (SKX) grew its bottom line by triple digits in two of the past four quarters. In July, the Manhattan Beach, Calif.-based footwear firm posted second-quarter earnings that surged 128% to $1.55 a share. The surge marked a second straight period of acceleration.In the first quarter, Skechers overtook Adidas as the No. 2 footwear brand in the U.S., according to NPD Group.The Internet retail group is holding steady among the top rankings.According to the Commerce Department, e-commerce sales jumped 14.1% to $83.86 billion in the second quarter from the same period a year earlier. Online sales accounted for 7.2% of total sales in Q2, up from 6.3% a year ago.In July, e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN) posted a surprising profit of 19 cents a share ex items. Prior to this, the company lost money in three of the past four quarters as it spent heavily on new businesses.While the company is expected to lose 14 cents a share in the current quarter, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see Amazon.com earning $1.60 for the full year. Profit is slated to surge 204% to $4.87 a share next year.The auto parts retail and wholesale group isn't known for stellar growth, but it pulled up to No. 13 in Wednesday's IBD, up from No. 23 three weeks ago.Cheap gas has boosted driving (and consequently the need for replacement parts). Also, IHS Automotive noted in July that the average age of cars and light trucks has risen to 11.5 years. Older cars need more replacement parts, maintenance and repairs.Last month, AutoZone (AZO) reported a profit of $12.75 a share, up 13% for its fiscal Q4. Rival O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) posted a 20% jump in its Q2 earnings to $2.29 a share in July.

The Ireland-based budget airline jumped 8% last week, sending it back above its 10-week moving average in an eight-week pattern that could become a cup base.NetEase surged 11% last week, starting up the right side of its consolidation, but it remains below its 10-week line. O'Reilly and Broadcom are in possible basing patterns that have faced challenges in rising to shape those consolidations into bases.Overseas, Europe's markets pressed firmly higher, with oil and mining stocks helping boost trade. The CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX in Frankfurt were each up 2% near midday.

360,ORLY,"Loading the player... With Q4 earnings due next week, O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) is trying to rev its engines, fueled by a mix of favorable industry trends, solid fundamentals and three promising technical indicators. As the IBD Industry Themes column noted, O’Reilly, AutoZone (AZO) and other auto parts retailers are benefiting from lower gas prices, which encourage more driving, and aging vehicles.…

361,ORLY,"The market is back in an uptrend, but the S&P 500 is still trading below its high from May. It is easy to see eight months of a struggling market reflected in IBD’s blue chip Big Cap 20 list. Fully 14 stocks on the current list qualify as defensive names.Utilities including Southern Energy (SO), Consolidated Edison (ED) and WEC Energy Group (WEC) are defensive because their prices to consumers are generally locked, and customers have little choice but to use the product. Also, the stocks typically offer healthy dividends.Another factor: Utilities are a segment into which mutual funds working to maintain minimum levels of investment rotate into during choppy markets. This demand can hold share prices steady or even drive them higher while the general market corrects.On the other hand, four stocks on the list qualify as solid growth stocks: Cognizant Technologies (CTSH),  Equinix (EQIX) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).McDonald’s (MCD) carries some combined traits of defensive and growth stocks, giving it an interesting leg up in the current market. The fast-food chain’s turnaround under new Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook has made the stock a growth contender with regard to a number of fundamental and technical attributes: earnings growth, same-store-sales, relative strength and accumulation/distribution.McDonald’s still falls short on the standard punch list of CAN SLIM elements. But the turnaround has made the stock much more attractive for investors looking for healthy dividend names and/or double-threat defensive plays.McDonald’s, which fell off the list Monday, was extended after last week’s bounce off its 10-week moving average, and from a breakout in October.Dollar General (DG) was a double-threat growth/defensive stock from its re-entry to public markets in November 2009 through July 2012. It and its now-merged competitors Family Dollar and Dollar Tree (DLTR) were grabbing market share from Wal-Mart (WMT) and buying up smaller, regional chains across the U.S. Dollar General’s EPS growth is forecast at a healthy 13% for the year ended in January, and 15% in 2017. Revenue growth has slowed to high single digits.O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) torqued up nearly 1290% from October 2008 to October 2015. During that period, when the market was choppy or in a correction, auto parts chains were seen as dual growth/defensive plays because they were consolidating and gaining market share while benefiting from consumers holding on to their cars longer than they had in the past.O’Reilly, which announces its Q4 results on Feb. 10, is forecast to remain in the camp through 2015 with full EPS growth forecasts of 24%. Revenue growth is seen slowing to 8%. For 2016, analyst consensus puts EPS growth at 14% and sales growth at 7%.Big Cap 20 stocks tend to be stable, healthy performers, but they are not a list of pick-and-play buy opportunities. Investors need to look carefully at the fundamentals and make sure they understand both the company and its value proposition. Sudden changes in market direction can generate significant changes in the companies on the list.
"
362,ORLY,"Driven by a quest for consistency in this volatile stock market and iffy economy, investors have been drawn to stable companies that boast a track record of steady profit gains.AutoZone (AZO), a retailer and distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories, hits the mark for many investors, analysts say. The company has enjoyed double-digit profit gains in all but one of the past 19 quarters and has consistently delivered sales growth -- with the exception of one quarter -- over that time frame.On top of that, AutoZone’s stock climbed 19.7% last year, easily outpacing the broader market.“AutoZone has been putting up pretty decent top-line growth in an environment where we're seeing mixed data points pertaining to the health of the consumer,” Northcoast Research analyst Nicholas Mitchell told IBD. “So investors are willing to pay a little bit more of a premium to get the consistency in top-line (growth) and earnings-per-share growth.""""When there's mixed signals about the strength of the economy, auto parts retailers are a pretty good place to hide out,"" Mitchell went on to say. ""Demand for replacement auto parts is a lot less cyclical than that for other consumer discretionary items. There's less exposure to e-commerce for this industry too. Less than 5% of overall volume is done via e-commerce. ”If analysts are on the money, AutoZone will show it kept up that streak in with double-digit earnings growth as it reports fiscal-second-quarter results on March 1. Auto parts retailers overall have benefited from low gasoline prices, a trend that has prompted people to drive more and add wear and tear on their cars, sparking demand for auto parts.Good job growth and better wage growth also have helped the industry, as has the do-it-yourself segment -- from which AutoZone gets an estimated 80% of its sales -- analysts say.“AutoZone is benefiting from a market-leading position in (do-it-yourself),” Mitchell said. “The (do-it-yourself customer) tends to be the low-to-mid-income consumer, who tends to be more sensitive to changes in the employment market and gas prices.”AutoZone and peers O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) offer their do-it-yourself and commercial customers elements of value that are difficult for online rivals, including giant Amazon.com (AMZN), to duplicate: parts, advice and services in real time and on an as-needed basis.Several other factors come into play in terms of AutoZone’s draw for investors and the rise in its stock price.“People are attracted to its high return on invested capital, the consistent growth profile of the business and the defensiveness of the business,” Stephens analyst Ben Bienvenu told IBD. “It’s a fairly fragmented industry dominated by three players -- AutoZone, O’Reilly Automotive and Advance Auto Parts. There’s a lot of market share for them to continue to take, despite the fact they’re in a dominant position. And (AutoZone) management is fantastic. They’re very disciplined in their deployment of capital, and they run the business very efficiently.”Wedbush analyst Seth Basham upgraded AutoZone’s stock to an outperform from a neutral in a report on Tuesday.“We think the near term is pretty good for these guys,” he told IBD. “Low gas prices are helping to boost sales for the (do-it-yourself) industry segment, and we think AutoZone is executing well, leading to market share gains. Lower gas prices put more spending power in the lower-income consumer's pockets and encourage people to drive their vehicles more, both of which lead to more part sales. Other drivers for DIY have been good job growth, improving wage growth and rising low-end consumer confidence.”Basham says AutoZone is also getting a lift from a new distribution strategy.AutoZone has been testing two new concepts of its supply chain strategy: increased frequency of delivery to stores and “significantly expanded parts assortments” in select stores called “mega hubs.” A mega hub carries inventory that’s approximately twice what a “hub” store carries, according to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.“AZO continues to increase the number of stores with multiple deliveries from its distribution centers,” Basham said in his report. “More frequent deliveries enable lower part depth and higher breadth.”The company currently has around 1,000 stores on multiday delivery of three to five times a week. That's around 19% of its domestic store base, with “potential to more than triple this figure,” he said. At the same time, he adds, AutoZone is adding mega hubs to select markets to “broaden on-demand part availability.”As of late November, the company had a total count of 5,635 stores, including those outside the U.S.“With strong results to date, we see potential for these distribution enhancements to enable a $1,500 (plus) per-week per-store sales lift,"" Basham says. ""This amounts to (about) a 2.8% comp lift over (around) a three-year period and based on the current rollout pace, at least (around) a 70 basis-point run-rate comp lift in (fiscal) '16.”In the first quarter, AutoZone’s earnings climbed 14% to $8.29 per share. Sales rose 5.6% to $2.4 billion. Domestic same-store sales increased a healthy 3.5% from a year earlier. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year fiscal 2015 earnings to rise 13% to $40.68 a share. They see a 12% gain in fiscal 2016 and 11% increase in 2017.They expect second-quarter earnings to be reported on March 1 to rise 12% to $7.28 a share.“My sense is AutoZone fared very well in the second quarter,” said Bienvenu. “We’re expecting strong results.”He expects the warmer winter had a “negative impact” on sales of car parts that get a lot of stress from cold weather and often require repairs, like batteries, starters and alternators. But it’s difficult to know the “extent” to which it will show up in the numbers, he adds.

403,ORLY,"A Day 5 follow-through in both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Tuesday gives IBD readers the proverbial ""green light"" to deploy capital in fresh new leaders.Question is, how bright is that ""green light?""Indeed, every IBD-style growth investor should know these two things: 1) not all follow-throughs are the same; and 2) the success and breadth of the breakouts by high-quality stocks ultimately determine the quality of a follow-through.Right off the bat, this new uptrend is hampered by a much smaller pool of stocks that are towering in both EPS and sales growth as well as price strength. The small list of stocks making Inside Your Weekly Review reflects this clearly.Nevertheless, the market's rally can heat up. Spring always follows winter. In 2016, watch to see if a comeback in crude oil prices, better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, or other positive external events help provide a spark.Keep a close eye on how this Weekly Review list changes. Does it grow in size in weeks to come? If yes, that's positive.In the Jan. 22 edition, just 36 names made the stringent screen. Only companies scoring an 85 for both EPS Rating and RS Rating and trading within 15% of their 52-week highs make the cut. The Jan. 15 list showed 37 stocks.A quick scan of today's YWR shows that quite a few different industry sectors get represented, but only by a handful of stocks or less. These companies are true leaders in their specific industry niches.You won't find many stocks hailing from the medical sector in today's list, but Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) (90 EPS, 89 RS) made the grade. It's fallen in recent days, but still trades not so far from a 580 high that it hit in a recent breakout. No one has yet come up with a better system of robotic surgery.Ross Stores (ROST) truly excels in buying excess inventory from department store chains and selling the merchandise at deep discount in a clean, well-lit atmosphere. The stock is not far from a 55.74 handle buy point. Fiserv (FISV), O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) and Public Storage (PSA) also are tops in their fields.

Still, Starbucks says it’s bullish on its expansion in China.Ulta Beauty reported better-than-expected quarterly results in early December.

Shares are looking to retake the 50-day line in Tuesday’s session. Ulta rose 2%, above its 50-day.Foot Locker is trying to retake its 200-day line, but looks to be hitting resistance there. Shares are trading 14% below a consolidation buy point. They're up 2.6% today.The shoe retailer has a 93 Composite Rating.Edwards Lifesciences has a 94 Composite Rating. When the heart valve maker issues its quarterly results next week, earnings are projected to have risen 17%.Shares were able to retake the 50-day moving average just a few sessions after finding support at the 200-day line. The stock is now just 3% below an 83.53 flat-base buy point. But the stock fell 4 cents to 80.16.O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY), Ross Stores (ROST) and Campbell Soup (CPB) are among other IBD 50 members working on bases.While breakouts provide buying opportunities, the current market environment warrants a cautious outlook.

421,ORLY,"Is O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) getting ready to shift into overdrive and rally again? Shares of the auto parts retailer, up more than 33% this year, are working on a new flat base with a potential 278.06 buy point.O'Reilly is outpacing most of its rivals. AutoZone (AZO) is up about 20%. Advance Auto Parts (AAP) is down nearly 5% since Jan. 1.And it's not just the stock that's outperforming. The Springfield, Mo.-based company sports the top Composite and Earnings Per Share ratings in its nine-stock group. Where O'Reilly and its rivals used to mostly rely on the do-it-yourself shopper, the growing DIFM business is providing an additional revenue stream.O'Reilly started the year off with a Feb. 5 breakout, an 8% gap up past a 196.90 flat-base buy point. It immediately went on to form a new flat base, which it cleared in mid-March. Since then, it's shaped and broken out of two more bases.At its Feb. 5 breakout, the stock boasted a 97 Composite Rating; 95 EPS; 92 Relative Strength; Sales+Profit Margin+ROE of A; and B- for Accumulation/Distribution.When it began to climb past a new flat-base entry on June 19, O'Reilly's ratings remained solid: 95 Composite, 96 EPS, 91 RS,SMR of A and Acc/Dis of B-.And when the stock cleared its latest buy point on Oct. 12, its Composite Rating had risen to 99. The 95 RS and B Acc/Dis ratings also showed improvement.Because O'Reilly already has cleared a series of bases over the past two years, its current pattern is late-stage, which tends to be riskier than earlier stage bases. Also, an up-down volume ratio below the neutral 1.0 level implies weak share demand. (See the ratio at IBD Stock Checkup, found under the ""Research"" tab on Investors.com).All the bases it's formed this year have been third stage, since the stock hasn't gained 20% from the breakouts.Aside from the October 2014 (1) and February breakouts (2), weekly volume has been rather tepid. Yet the chart shows numerous weeks of gains in heavy trade. Plus, O'Reilly has been finding support near its 10-week moving average as it trends higher. Despite the late-stage nature of its bases, the stock has offered investors chances to buy or add shares at breakouts and pullbacks to the 10-week line.The number of funds owning shares rose to 1,341 in Q3 from 1,118 in last year's Q4. Plenty of top-rated funds bought a stake or added to their position in Q3.

443,ORLY,"Several auto parts retailers advanced this week as two highly rated ones, O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) and auto parts provider LKQ (LKQ), delivered outsized quarterly earnings reports.O'Reilly stock hit a high of 247 Thursday following second-quarter results that beat sales and profit views late Wednesday, but closed Friday at 240.31, closer to where shares were before the earnings report.LKQ hit a high of 32.25 on Thursday after it posted forecast-topping earnings that morning. LKQ closed Friday at 31.46 — like O'Reilly, about where it was before its earnings report.LKQ ended the week up 2% and O'Reilly down 1%, while Advance Auto Parts (AAP) and AutoZone (AZO) each gained 4% for the week, with Advance hitting a new high in the stock market today.All are members of IBD's Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts industry group, which ranks No. 12 out of 197 industry groups.Continuing low gas prices, which have prompted Americans to drive more, are among the factors that have fueled a strong growth in the auto parts industry.The solid quarterly reports from O'Reilly and LKQ prompted analysts to issue upbeat reports on both companies.Stifel analyst James Albertine issued a report on LKQ on Friday, where he rated the stock a buy.""Yesterday, (Thursday) LKQ reported 2Q15 EPS of 39 cents ... ahead of our 37 cents estimate (vs. the Street's 36 cents), primarily driven by better European revenues, and improved gross margin and expense leverage vs. our model,"" he wrote in the report. ""We also note management's updated guidance, which among tightened revenue and EPS ranges, suggests a $25 (million) boost to expected net cash generated from operations.""Albertine raised some estimates, though he's still below Wall Street's forecasts. In his new model, he maintained his Q3 2015 EPS estimate of 34 cents a share vs. Wall Street's estimate of 35 cents. But he raised his full-year 2015 EPS estimate to $1.40 a share from $1.38. He noted the Street's estimate for 2015 is $1.41.Albertine raised his 2016 EPS estimate to $1.60 from $1.58, noting the Street's estimate is $1.65, and also raised his 2017 EPS estimate.RBC Capital Markets analyst Scot Ciccarelli issued a positive report on O'Reilly on Thursday.""O'Reilly continues to prove itself as a net share gainer in a favorable retail sector, posting yet another strong beat,"" he wrote. ""We remain constructive on the company's long-term growth outlook.""Ciccarelli noted the quarter's results suggest trends ""remain healthy.""He raised his 2015 EPS estimate to $8.92 from $8.75 on same-store sales growth of 6.1%.

456,ORLY,"Big-cap stocks are sometimes like the tortoise in the Aesop's fable ""The Tortoise and the Hare,"" lumbering along while rabbit-like growth stocks speed ahead. But sometimes, as in the fable, slow-and-steady really does win the race.Just look at the charts of Starbucks (SBUX), Reynolds American (RAI) and O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) in recent years.IBD's Big Cap 20 column, which appears in IBD every Tuesday, showcases stocks that have solid growth potential. They must also have a market capitalization of at least $15 billion.These behemoths often trade millions of shares a day and yet give investors a chance to reap significant capital gains with less volatility than small-cap growth stocks, which can fall much faster.Furthermore, big-cap stocks often pay dividends, which can significantly boost returns over time.Top big-cap stocks should still have fundamental and technical characteristics similar to the strongest growth stocks. High-quality big caps should show good profit and sales growth, rising mutual- and hedge-fund sponsorship column has featured Reynolds American more than a dozen times this year.Both IBD Big Cap 20 and the Dividend Leaders screen have showcased Starbucks, which has given shareholders stellar returns for those patient enough to sit through a number of bases formed over the years. The coffee seller has risen nearly 600% in the five years since it broke out past a 13.34 buy point (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split) of a cup-with-handle base in the week ended Oct. 15, 2010.At the time, Starbucks had Composite and Earnings Per Share Ratings of 87 out of 99. The annualized dividend of 64 cents a share produces a 1% yield; the long-term dividend growth rate is 24%. And with a 3-year Earnings Stability Factor of 1 on a scale of 0 (stable) to 99 (wild), investors stand a reasonable chance of continuing to reap steady stock price and dividend gains.A number of real estate investment trusts and utility stocks have also fared well in recent years, as low interest rates reduced their borrowing costs and made it easier for them to invest in new power plants or assets such as apartments and hospitals.DTE Energy (DTE) and Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI) have been a fixture in the Dividend Leaders and REIT Leaders screens.DTE, an electricity and natural gas supplier that also operates gas pipelines, has been a slow-but-steady gainer since it cleared a long consolidation with a 49.16 buy point in March 2011.The stock briefly stumbled, triggering the 8% loss rule during the steep summer correction that year. However, DTE formed a new base with a 52.92 buy point and broke out again for good in December. Through a Jan. 28, 2015, high of 92.27, it gained 74%. DTE's long-term dividend growth rate is 5% and its annual dividend of $2.92 a share currently yields 3.6%.The accompanying table shows some big caps and dividend plays that have performed well so far this year.

"
491,ORLY,"An ax can be either a useful tool or a dangerous weapon. In stock charts, the 50-day moving average has a similar dual nature. The 50-day moving average takes a stock's prior 50 closes and averages them. Do this every day in an upward-trending stock, and you'll get a line on a chart that runs below the stock's price bars while smoothing out the jumps and buckles.
"
492,ORLY,"The line serves a startling number of uses. When a stock is basing, a cup base with more than half of its bulk above rather than below the line is a sign of health. Another sign of a stock's strength: a flat base that finds ""support"" at its 50-day line.
"
493,ORLY,"What is support? Institutional investors often use the 50-day or 10-week line as a reference point, stepping in to add shares to their positions when a stock pulls back to the moving average. This buying creates upward pressure — or price support — to help keep the stock's prices above that moving average.
"
494,ORLY,"This is why rising stocks often rebound from their 50-day lines, turning brief pullbacks into follow-on buying opportunities. It is also why 50-day and 10-week moving averages tend to cradle advances that can run across many months.
"
495,ORLY,"On the dangerous side, a rallying stock that collapses below 50-day support in heavy volume is often sending a sell signal. Once below that line, institutional investors may use the 50-day line to mark a sell level. Short sellers may use the line as a level at which to sell shares short.
"
496,ORLY,"These forces create a level of resistance. Stocks often need a large boost of buying power to muscle back above their 50-day lines after losing that level of support.
"
497,ORLY,"There are other, similar moving averages. Most common is the 10-week moving average. This line tracks a stock's weekly closes over the prior 10 weeks. It generally tracks fairly close to the 50-day line. So if you are reading a daily chart, use the 50-day line. If you're analyzing a weekly chart, use the 10-week.

507,ORLY,"Auto-parts wholesalers and retailers have been stellar performers during the long economic recovery, delivering steady earnings growth and mostly solid stock appreciation.Two stocks in the group, Advance Auto Parts (AAP) and Monro Muffler Brake (MNRO), offered contrasting responses Thursday to earnings reports.Earnings from Advance Auto Parts, which operates more than 5,200 stores, missed analysts' estimates on earnings and revenue, and the company lowered fiscal 2015 guidance.""Our first quarter results were softer than we expected primarily driven by the change impacts of our integration activities,"" said CFO Mike Norona.The stock opened 3% lower, but quickly reversed and traded higher for the rest of the day. The stock is carving out a flat base. Going back to February, the chart shows several ominous, red-volume spikes that denote institutional selling, but in recent days those have been replaced by blue spikes, signs institutions are getting interested.A buy point would be at 165.10.Monro wasn't quite so lucky with its earnings miss. The stock traded as much as 12% lower in the morning. Although it staged a comeback later in the day, it still left a gap on the daily chart. The stock did, however, find support at its 200-day line. The base it was building is now seriously damaged.In its latest report, Advanced Auto's EPS rose 6% from a year ago. Revenue rose 2%. That was the first time in four quarters that earnings weren't north of 28% and revenue wasn't above 47%. In the next report, analysts are forecasting a 12% EPS increase from a year earlier.The five-year annualized EPS growth rate is 17%.Monro's earnings rose 8%. The previous quarter's earnings were 4%, which marked a deceleration over several quarters.Revenue also rose 8%, the fifth straight quarter of year-over-year revenue increases in single digits.In the next quarter, analysts expect earnings to rise 19%. The five-year annualized EPS growth rate is 9%. Analysts are forecasting 38% growth this year and 18% growth in 2016.The auto-parts industry group is ranked No. 65 out of 197 groups. Several stocks made big moves during the economic recovery.Analysts attributed the strength to the fact that motorists are driving their cars longer and at some point need spare parts.O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) and AutoZone (AZO) are the group's top performers. Both stocks are near highs and have been riding along their 50-day moving averages.O'Reilly's EPS rose 28% in its most recent report. Analysts forecast an 18% increase in its next report. Earnings growth comes in consistently at 20%, while revenue growth is typically in the high single digits.AutoZone's earnings rose 16% in the most recent report, and analysts are looking for 12% growth in the next report.

515,ORLY,"Advance Auto's DIFM same-store sales have kept pace with peers, though the company has launched several initiatives to improve the performance. These include a loyalty program rollout and increased advertising spending.Advance Auto Parts' (AAP) recent streak of robust sales growth is expected to hit the brakes this week when it reports Q1 results, as the auto parts retailer faces tougher comparisons to the prior year, when it benefited from a major buyout.Advance Auto is due to report first-quarter results before the open on Thursday. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings of $2.49 a share, up 11% from the prior year. Sales are seen rising 3% to $3.05 billion, which would be the slowest gain in two years. It would also end a run of four straight quarters of 47%-or-better sales growth.The company's results last year got a big lift from its January 2014 buyout of Genuine Parts for $2 billion. Full-year sales in 2014 climbed 49% — well above the 5% gain reported in 2013 and the 1% increase in 2012. EPS grew 21% in 2014.Analysts expect Advance Auto to keep producing double-digit EPS growth over the next several years. The company has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 92. Its stock trades near 152 and is up about 6% since the beginning of May.The company belongs to IBD's Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts group, which ranks No. 43 out of 197 industries tracked.

562,ORLY,"Retailers hit a rough patch in March as severe winter weather, an economic speed bump and merchandise delays resulting from the West Coast port disruptions dragged down results, leading to the month's sales gains falling below views.
"
563,ORLY,"Even amid the headwinds, L Brands (LB), Stein Mart (SMRT), Cato Corp. (CATO) and PriceSmart (PSMT) came shining through with same-store sales that sailed past views, according to data out Thursday.
"
564,ORLY,"March sales at stores open at least a year rose 0.5% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. Analysts expected a 1% gain.
"
565,ORLY,"The results were weighed down by a big miss from warehouse club giant Costco Wholesale (COST), Perkins says. The company saw March same-store sales slide 2% from a year earlier, short of views for a 0.3% decline.
"
566,ORLY,"That was the typical top retail performer's first decline in monthly same-store sales since August 2009, Perkins says.
"
567,ORLY,"Fuel And The Freeze
"
568,ORLY,"Costco's core U.S. same-store sales, ex gas and the effects of foreign exchange rates, were up a ""much healthier"" 4%, said Perkins. Still, they were below views for a 5.5% gain.
"
569,ORLY,"""Costco was a huge drag on the month,"" Perkins told IBD. ""Part of that was attributable to them having lower year-over-year gas prices, and foreign currency translations also weighed on their sales.""
"
570,ORLY,"The month's results were a mixed bag.
"
571,ORLY,"Harsh winter weather conditions in parts of the U.S. such as the Northeast ""weighed on sales"" in those areas, said Perkins.
"
572,ORLY,"Consumers weren't in the mood to buy seasonal goods like patio furniture and bathing suits or apparel when they were ""freezing,"" he said.
"
573,ORLY,"But Jacksonville, Fla.-based Stein Mart and Charlotte, N.C.-based Cato, located in the South, where the weather was better, posted double-digit gains in March same-store sales, he adds.
"
574,ORLY,"""Weather clearly played a big role overall (on the March results), both positive and negative,"" Perkins said.
"
575,ORLY,"Another factor weighing on March sales was a slowdown in the economy in the first quarter, he adds. Perkins notes retailers also missed sales opportunities because of delays from late shipments due to the West Coast labor dispute.
"
576,ORLY,"""Overall I would not read too much into the March numbers,"" Perkins said. ""The jobs market stands on pretty solid footing, and with warmer temperatures I would expect May, June and July sales to show significant improvement from the first quarter.""
"
577,ORLY,"April Outlook
"
578,ORLY,"This month is apt to be weak, Perkins says, mainly because the early Easter this year, on April 5, pushed holiday-related sales into March.
"
579,ORLY,"The month's standouts are L Brands (which owns Victoria's Secret), value-priced apparel seller Cato and regional discount retail operator Stein Mart.
"
580,ORLY,"L Brands posted a 9% increase in same-store sales for March, topping views for a 5.8% gain. The company's same-store sales for the month ""were positively impacted"" by the earlier Easter this year by about 3% to 4%, it said in a press release.
"
581,ORLY,"Cato saw a 12% rise in the month's sales, sailing past estimates for a 3.8% gain. Cato also got a lift from the early Easter shift, the company said in a press release. But it expects April sales will be ""unfavorably impacted"" by the shift.

592,ORLY,"Michael Niemira, chief economist at the research firm Retail Economist, calculates March same-store sales rose 0.2% vs. a year earlier.
"
593,ORLY,"He called the month's sales performance ""dismal.""
"
594,ORLY,"Why? ""At the end of the day, the flat reading doesn't pick up any Easter lift to the numbers, and (the month) was weaker than the January and February performance,"" he told IBD.
"
595,ORLY,"He expects April same-store sales to rise 1% vs. a year earlier amid tough comparisons with last year, when April same-store sales rose 6.2%.
"
596,ORLY,"But overall, retailers should see better days, Perkins says.
"
597,ORLY,"""I don't think you can extrapolate where the consumer stands from the March results and the related speed bumps (during the month),"" said Perkins. ""Consumer confidence is near the cycle high, gas prices remain low, interest rates remain low and the labor market is on solid footing. I think those factors should bode well for better economic growth in the second and third quarters, which should lead to better retail sales.""
"
598,ORLY,"Still, he cautions that the vast majority of lower- and midincome consumers are not really seeing rising pay.
"
599,ORLY,"""The ability for consumers to spend is still tied to significant wage gains, which haven't materialized,"" he said.
"
600,ORLY,"Perkins said the high-end consumer is ""driving the lion's share of spending.""
"
601,ORLY,"And they're buying a lot of cars. Perkins says the auto segment is doing better than other retail segments. That bodes well for auto parts retailers such as O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), AutoZone (AZO) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP).
"
602,ORLY,"High-end retailers such as Tiffany & Co. (TIF) and Kate Spade (KATE) are among the luxury retailers Perkins cites as doing well. He says off-price apparel retail operators such as Ross Stores (ROST) and TJX Cos. (TJX) are also faring well.
"
603,ORLY,"Niemira, looking toward the summer, expects apparel will be one of the stronger retail categories, driven by ""pent-up demand.""
"
604,ORLY,"Overall, he sees an improvement in the pace of same-store sales growth for the broad retail industry to around 2.5% vs. a 1% to 1.5% pace in the first quarter.Retailers hit a rough patch in March as severe winter weather, an economic speed bump and merchandise delays resulting from the West Coast port disruptions dragged down results, leading to the month's sales gains falling below views.Even amid the headwinds, L Brands (LB), Stein Mart (SMRT), Cato Corp. (CATO) and PriceSmart (PSMT) came shining through with same-store sales that sailed past views, according to data out Thursday.March sales at stores open at least a year rose 0.5% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. Analysts expected a 1% gain.The results were weighed down by a big miss from warehouse club giant Costco Wholesale (COST), Perkins says. The company saw March same-store sales slide 2% from a year earlier, short of views for a 0.3% decline.That was the typical top retail performer's first decline in monthly same-store sales since August 2009, Perkins says.Fuel And The FreezeCostco's core U.S. same-store sales, ex gas and the effects of foreign exchange rates, were up a ""much healthier"" 4%, said Perkins. Still, they were below views for a 5.5% gain.""Costco was a huge drag on the month,"" Perkins told IBD. ""Part of that was attributable to them having lower year-over-year gas prices, and foreign currency translations also weighed on their sales.""The month's results were a mixed bag.Harsh winter weather conditions in parts of the U.S. such as the Northeast ""weighed on sales"" in those areas, said Perkins.Consumers weren't in the mood to buy seasonal goods like patio furniture and bathing suits or apparel when they were ""freezing,"" he said.But Jacksonville, Fla.-based Stein Mart and Charlotte, N.C.-based Cato, located in the South, where the weather was better, posted double-digit gains in March same-store sales, he adds.""Weather clearly played a big role overall (on the March results), both positive and negative,"" Perkins said.Another factor weighing on March sales was a slowdown in the economy in the first quarter, he adds. Perkins notes retailers also missed sales opportunities because of delays from late shipments due to the West Coast labor dispute.""Overall I would not read too much into the March numbers,"" Perkins said. ""The jobs market stands on pretty solid footing, and with warmer temperatures I would expect May, June and July sales to show significant improvement from the first quarter.""April OutlookThis month is apt to be weak, Perkins says, mainly because the early Easter this year, on April 5, pushed holiday-related sales into March.The month's standouts are L Brands (which owns Victoria's Secret), value-priced apparel seller Cato and regional discount retail operator Stein Mart.L Brands posted a 9% increase in same-store sales for March, topping views for a 5.8% gain. The company's same-store sales for the month ""were positively impacted"" by the earlier Easter this year by about 3% to 4%, it said in a press release.Cato saw a 12% rise in the month's sales, sailing past estimates for a 3.8% gain. Cato also got a lift from the early Easter shift, the company said in a press release. But it expects April sales will be ""unfavorably impacted"" by the shift.Old Navy Nails SalesMajor apparel retailer Gap (GPS) posted a 2% rise in March same-store sales, well ahead of an estimate for a 0.5% gain.The gain was led by its Old Navy brand, which saw a 14% rise in the month's same-store sales.Stein Mart posted an 11.2% rise in March same-store sales, well ahead of views for a 3% increase.Action-sports retail operator Zumiez (ZUMZ) reported a 5.5% increase in same-store sales for the month late Wednesday, below forecasts for a 6.5% rise.Drugstore operator Rite Aid (RAD), which reported fourth-quarter results Wednesday morning, posted a 4.3% increase in March same-store sales, ahead of views for a 4.1% gain.Perkins says that despite the miss, Zumiez did better than a lot of retailers.PriceSmart, which owns and operates U.S.-style membership shopping warehouses in Latin America and the Caribbean, saw a 7.3% rise in the month's same-store sales, topping views for a 3.6% gain.Teen retailer Buckle (BKE) saw a 0.5% decline in the month's same-store sales, short of views for a 0.1% drop.'Dismal' Retail EconomicsMichael Niemira, chief economist at the research firm Retail Economist, calculates March same-store sales rose 0.2% vs. a year earlier.He called the month's sales performance ""dismal.""Why?

When gas prices drop sharply, consumers have more discretionary dollars to spend on car maintenance projects.And though severe weather can keep customers out of car showrooms, the damage it causes on existing vehicles spurs sales of tires and parts down the road.

"
653,ORLY,"""The industry had very favorable weather last year, which helped create a lot of demand,"" said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Robert Higginbotham. ""Everyone's revenue grew nicely. Just as that tailwind seemed to fade, gas prices fell. So there was a nice handoff from weather to lower gas prices.""
"
654,ORLY,"O'Reilly and other auto parts retailers have been ""consolidating"" the industry and taking share from the mom-and-pop players, he adds, which has increased their negotiating power with a very ""fragmented"" vendor base.
"
655,ORLY,"""That has driven big gains in margin and working capital efficiency, which has also (helped) the stock performance."" he said. ""With longer and longer payment terms from their vendors — having more days to pay — players like O'Reilly have been able to fund inventory at almost zero cost, which allows them to take even more share from the mom-and-pops. (That) leads to even better negotiating leverage and so on, a dynamic which (I refer) to as the 'auto parts retail virtuous cycle.'""

""It's about parts fulfillment. I think O'Reilly has the right distribution infrastructure to get parts to consumers and repair shops when they need it.
"
663,ORLY,"""If you look at the financial metrics, (O'Reilly generates) a tremendous return on capital, it has very strong cash flow and a good (stock) buyback strategy to return capital to shareholders,"" he added.
"
664,ORLY,"What differentiates O'Reilly from the other auto parts retailers is that it has the ""strongest history and most consistent execution of a mix of retail and commercial businesses,"" adds Higginbotham.
"
665,ORLY,"He says that auto parts retailers that historically have had a retail focus are ""moving more"" into the commercial business.
"
666,ORLY,"""O'Reilly has the most dense distribution of all the players,"" he added. ""It has the most distribution centers per store. That allows them to fulfill orders more efficiently, more often, which is more crucial in the commercial business than the retail business.""
"
667,ORLY,"The commercial business, Higginbotham adds, is a ""different ball game"" in terms of having to be able to say yes to as many requests as possible. He says that having the supply of products to meet the requests means investing a lot in inventory and distribution.
"
668,ORLY,"""O'Reilly is best at doing that,"" he said.
"
669,ORLY,"Higginbotham says that several years ago, store growth was the big driver of O'Reilly's strong performance.
"
670,ORLY,"More recently, it's been a function of the company's ""superiority"" in terms of execution, which has helped it gain a lot of market share, he adds.
"

672,ORLY,"Low Gas Prices Drive Business
"
673,ORLY,"Lower gas prices should be a nice tailwind for the industry, says Higginbotham.
"
674,ORLY,"""Lower gas prices are an important driver because if gas is cheaper, people tend to drive more and it puts more wear and tear on their cars,"" he said.
"
675,ORLY,"They tend to benefit the low-income consumer — the do-it-yourself customer — the most, he adds.
"
676,ORLY,"Lower gas prices can have a ""meaningful"" impact on spending on car repairs, adds Kennison.
"
677,ORLY,"""In a tough economy people will defer spending on car repairs,"" he said. ""At some point the deferment catches up.
"
678,ORLY,"""Lower gas prices give consumers the resources to fix some deferred maintenance items.""

679,ORLY,"O'Reilly is part of IBD's Retail-Wholesale-Auto Parts industry group, which also includes Advance Auto Parts, AutoZone, Copart (CPRT), Pep Boys (PBY) and a handful of others. O'Reilly gets the highest IBD Composite Rating of those companies, a 98 out of a possible 99, factoring in metrics such as earnings growth and stock price gains.When it comes to accelerating profit, O'Reilly Automotive operates in high gear. O'Reilly (ORLY), highly rated by IBD, has logged 16 straight quarters of double-digit profit growth.Analysts see it staying in the fast lane as the specialty retailer of aftermarket auto parts continues to rev up its business by luring commercial and do-it-yourself customers with top-flight service, a deep and broad-based inventory and far-flung distribution capabilities.Lower gas prices should prompt people to drive more and put more stress on their cars, fueling demand for parts and services from O'Reilly and its large auto parts retail peers, including AutoZone (AZO) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP), analysts say.Last year, O'Reilly and other auto parts retailers got a nice jolt from the extremely cold winter, which increased wear and tear on cars, driving up demand for auto parts.DIY Does WellO'Reilly generates about 58% of its sales from do-it-yourself customers, who take on their own repairs, and the remaining 42% from professional service providers, including garages, repair shops and paint and body shops.At the end of last year it had 4,366 stores in 43 states. It has 26 regional distribution centers.O'Reilly's stock has been enjoying an impressive run. The company's share price shot up 50% in 2014. It's risen 8% so far this year.Why the investor enthusiasm?""The industry had very favorable weather last year, which helped create a lot of demand,"" said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Robert Higginbotham. ""Everyone's revenue grew nicely. Just as that tailwind seemed to fade, gas prices fell. So there was a nice handoff from weather to lower gas prices.""O'Reilly and other auto parts retailers have been ""consolidating"" the industry and taking share from the mom-and-pop players, he adds, which has increased their negotiating power with a very ""fragmented"" vendor base.""That has driven big gains in margin and working capital efficiency, which has also (helped) the stock performance."" he said. ""With longer and longer payment terms from their vendors — having more days to pay — players like O'Reilly have been able to fund inventory at almost zero cost, which allows them to take even more share from the mom-and-pops. (That) leads to even better negotiating leverage and so on, a dynamic which (I refer) to as the 'auto parts retail virtuous cycle.'""O'Reilly's stock popped around 8% on Feb. 5, following a strong fourth-quarter report late the day before.Earnings climbed 26% to $1.76 a share, ahead of the consensus view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 9% to $1.76 billion, also beating forecasts.Same-store sales rose a hefty 6.3% from a year earlier.O'Reilly management did not respond to a phone call requesting a comment for this story.The company announced that it approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under its share repurchase program by an additional $500 million, raising the aggregate authorization to $5 billion. The additional $500 million is effective for a three-year period beginning on Feb. 4.Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst Craig Kennison calls O'Reilly a ""wonderful"" company.""At the end of the day, commercial repair shops are in the business of fixing cars and the best way to serve them is to have the right part at the right time at the right price when they need it,"" he said. ""It's about parts fulfillment. I think O'Reilly has the right distribution infrastructure to get parts to consumers and repair shops when they need it.""If you look at the financial metrics, (O'Reilly generates) a tremendous return on capital, it has very strong cash flow and a good (stock) buyback strategy to return capital to shareholders,"" he added.What differentiates O'Reilly from the other auto parts retailers is that it has the ""strongest history and most consistent execution of a mix of retail and commercial businesses,"" adds Higginbotham.He says that auto parts retailers that historically have had a retail focus are ""moving more"" into the commercial business.""O'Reilly has the most dense distribution of all the players,"" he added. ""It has the most distribution centers per store. That allows them to fulfill orders more efficiently, more often, which is more crucial in the commercial business than the retail business.""The commercial business, Higginbotham adds, is a ""different ball game"" in terms of having to be able to say yes to as many requests as possible. He says that having the supply of products to meet the requests means investing a lot in inventory and distribution.""O'Reilly is best at doing that,"" he said.Higginbotham says that several years ago, store growth was the big driver of O'Reilly's strong performance.More recently, it's been a function of the company's ""superiority"" in terms of execution, which has helped it gain a lot of market share, he adds.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect O'Reilly to see a 16% rise in full-year 2015 earnings to $8.55 a share. They expect a 13% gain in 2016 and a 14% increase in 2017 — lower growth than in years past but still strong.Low Gas Prices Drive BusinessLower gas prices should be a nice tailwind for the industry, says Higginbotham.""Lower gas prices are an important driver because if gas is cheaper, people tend to drive more and it puts more wear and tear on their cars,"" he said.They tend to benefit the low-income consumer — the do-it-yourself customer — the most, he adds.Lower gas prices can have a ""meaningful"" impact on spending on car repairs, adds Kennison.""In a tough economy people will defer spending on car repairs,"" he said.

680,ORLY,"Small-cap and midcap growth mutual funds have risen smartly in the past 15 years, keeping ahead of the S&P 500's performance much of the way. But large-cap growth funds have lagged.By how much? Look what investing $10,000 on Dec. 31, 1999, in the average fund in each time would have done for you.The midcap growth mutual fund account would have ballooned to $19,963 by Feb. 23 this year, according to Morningstar Inc. data.Small-cap growth would have landed $19,710.But you'd still be underwater holding the average large-cap growth, with just $9,286 to show.What was the problem with large-cap growth? The dot-com bubble was built on fast-growing large-cap growth stocks. So large-cap growth was hurt the worst when the bubble burst in 2000.And large-cap growth's recovery was less powerful than mid- and small-cap growth in the stock market rally to the 2007 peak. The S&P 500, a proxy for the broad stock market, had a large helping of nontech stock among its components to help limit the downdraft.Large-cap growth funds have done better since the market low in September 2011. They're up about 100% since then, as is the S&P 500.Small-cap growth funds have handed investors a 99% gain, and midcap growth funds are up 96%.A standout among growth funds during this period has been large-cap growth oriented Sequoia Fund . It's produced an average annual return of 10.83% in the past 15 years vs. 4.96% for the S&P500.It has been driven this year by such stocks as Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY).

762,ORLY,"The Big Cap 20 is showing itself to be a good representation of today's market leadership, as technology, health care and consumer stocks dominate the list.A glance of the IBD Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables shows chips, medical, apparel, retail and other technology sectors make up most of the top 10 sectors. That's a fitting reflection of what you find in the Big Cap 20. Most of the 20 stocks can be categorized in one of those areas.In technology, a couple of chipmakers rank among the leading big caps, along with some business-service tech companies.Analog Devices (ADI) is one of the more interesting charts. The stock broke out of a cup-shaped base on Feb. 17 and has risen 3% from that entry.The chipmaker earned 63 cents a share excluding items for the January-ended quarter, beating expectations. Sales rose 23%, as the top line continued an accelerating trend of growth.Analysts noted strength in its industrial and automotive markets.Apple (AAPL), a tech leader that could be viewed as a consumer stock too, is another high-tech stock that's found a home in the Big Cap 20. The stock is near new highs, extended from its breakout past 119.85 last month.In the medical sector, drugmakers Biogen Idec (BIIB), Pharmacyclics (PCYC) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) have rallied in recent weeks and account for some of the best percentage gains in the Big Cap 20 over the past couple of weeks.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Cigna (CI) are part of a broad rally in HMO stocks.While those medical leaders are extended, Mylan (MYL) is setting up in a base with a 59.70 buy point.However, its shares fell moderately after the close Monday, when the company reported Q4 earnings of $1.05 a share, an increase of 35%. Sales rose 18% to $2.08 billion.Mylan forecast 2015 revenues of $9.6 billion to $10.1 billion.In consumer stocks, the big cap leaders run the gamut of auto-parts chain O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), Starbucks (SBUX) and discount retailer Ross Stores (ROST).Ross Stores shined Friday as its earnings report sent shares gapping up to a 7% gain and a record high.For the first two months of 2015, the Big Cap 20 has acquitted itself quite satisfactorily. It rose 6.9%, far better than the 2.2% gain for the S&P 500, which is a broad gauge of big-capitalization stocks.Qorvo (QRVO) may be an unfamiliar name on a list filled with familiar brands.

763,ORLY,"IBD 50 companies of all kinds are expected to report solid quarterly results in the coming week, potentially an indication that the gears driving our tech, retail, auto, medical and defense sectors are moving more freely. Here's a look at what analysts expect.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) — the security chipmaker that helps keep your Apple Pay transactions safe — reports fourth-quarter results after the close on Wednesday.The Netherlands-based company, which recently introduced technology allowing drivers to lock and unlock their cars via their phones, owes much of its success to the immense popularity of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 6, of which NXP is a supplier.Analysts expect NXP's EPS to springboard up 33% to $1.32 — the strongest gain of any of the IBD 50 stocks reviewed here. Revenue is seen increasing 17% to $1.51 billion.NXP shares emerged from a first-stage flat base this month but have rattled around near their 50-day line, where investors will often buy shares if they have faith in the company. The stock has ascended 82% since 2014.Shares slipped 0.7% on the stock market Friday but are still holding above a buy point and are in buy range.Medical-device maker Edwards Lifesciences (EW) reports on Tuesday. The company's artificial heart valve, Sapien, has helped keep gains aloft in recent quarters.Analysts expect earnings per share to rise 4% from a year earlier to 95 cents. Revenue is expected to rise 14% to $610.5 million.Edwards' Q3 results in October indicated to analysts that growth in the global transcatheter aortic valve replacement market continues to exceed expectations.The stock is up about 86% in the last year but in recent weeks has converged with its 50-day line. Shares fell 3% Friday to below that key level of support.As more business adapts to so-called omnichannel retailing — in which customers might use a combination of online and in-store outlets to buy products — Manhattan Associates' (MANH) supply-chain-management software helps them keep track of the orders.When the company reports Q4 results on Tuesday, analysts expect to see EPS rise 16% to 28 cents and revenue elevate 10% to $118.9 million.Since July 2012, the last time the stock spent any extended time below its 200-day line, Manhattan shares have risen more than 300%.Shares tripped up last November after trying to clear a cup-with-handle base begun in March. But they ricocheted up off their 50-day line in early January and have remained above it since.Car-dealer operator Asbury Auto (ABG) has thrived in recent years on the auto industry's rebound. Analysts expect the company, which reports Q4 results on Wednesday, to grow EPS by 15% to $1.01, though that would mark the slowest growth since Q3 2011. Sales are seen increasing 8% to $1.48 billion.Shares entered into a sixth-stage consolidation from July through November and have been seeking support at their 50-day line for most of January. The later the stage, the greater a stock's chance of topping out, IBD research finds. Still, shares are up 48% since 2014.O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) also reports Q4 results Wednesday. With more cars lasting longer, the company has benefited from part replacements. As the months get colder, O'Reilly could also see sales pick up from repairs to winter-ravaged cars.Spirit Aerosystems (SPR) — a company whose propulsion, fuselage and wing systems go into military aircraft and passenger jets — reports Q4 results Tuesday. Analysts see EPS increasing 17% to 76 cents. Revenue is expected to rise 12% to $1.674 billion.Spirit serves such companies as defense contractor General Dynamics (GD) and aerospace giant Boeing (BA), which this week both reported estimate-topping Q4 results.Spirit shares cleared a flat base and have found support at their 50-day line.Apparel retailer Under Armour (UA), whose 'athleisure' wear continues to attract the athletic and the leisured alike, reports Q4 results Wednesday after the close.Analysts see EPS escalating 30% to 39 cents and revenue rising 24% to $849.63 million, which would continue a slight deceleration in sales gains over the past three quarters.Citigroup this month upgraded Under Armour to buy, citing the company's domestic and international prospects. But that upgrade came a day after Jefferies downgraded the stock, citing ""few near-term catalysts and valuation that accurately reflects the company's long-term growth prospects.""Under Armour stock cleared a fourth-stage cup-with-handle base on Thursday but struggled for momentum Friday as they slipped 1%.

853,ORLY,"When auto-parts retail stocks like Advanced Auto Parts (AAP) start to do well, their rise sometimes unfurls a red flag.
"
854,ORLY,"These stocks often excel when the economy is weak and consumers are under pressure. At such times, owners coddle their aging cars rather than spend to buy new vehicles. This tendency made parts-retail stocks particularly resilient during the 2007-08 market collapse.
"
855,ORLY,"But this year, Advance Auto Parts (AAP) has outgrown that pigeonhole, rising 27% year-to-date. The stock is up 6% over the past three sessions, taking out a new high and clearing a 139.68 buy point in a third-stage flat base.
"
856,ORLY,"Parts retailers AutoZone (AZO) and O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) have traded all but flat since February, but Advance Auto looped higher through three consecutive bases. Because none of those stocks rose more than 20% above their prior bases' high, they were all third-stage patterns.

"
921,ORLY,"While falling oil prices obviously have had a negative impact on oil and gas stocks — eight of the nine lowest rated IBD industry groups are now in that sector — declining prices also have had a ripple effect on other industries: some for the better, others not so much.
"
922,ORLY,"Following are four other industries that have seen an immediate impact from lower prices at the wellhead and gasoline pump. Three are enjoying the trend, while one of them is not.
"
923,ORLY," Airlines: Considering that fuel is one of the biggest expenses in the airline industry, it's no surprise that falling gasoline prices have been a boon to companies that make their living in the air.
"
924,ORLY,"IBD's Transportation-Airline group is trading at record highs and ranks No. 2 among 197 industries tracked. That's up from No. 116 as recently as eight weeks ago.
"
925,ORLY,"Stocks that have set multiyear highs in recent days include pretty much every airline you can think of. These include large commercial carriers such as Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Continental (UAL) as well as discount carriers Southwest Airlines (LUV), JetBlue Airways (JBLU) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and regional operations like Alaska Air Group (ALK) and Hawaiian Holdings (HA).
"
926,ORLY,"The top rated stocks in the group are Spirit and Southwest, which have IBD Composite Ratings of 99 and 97, respectively.
"
927,ORLY,"But airline stocks weren't winners on Tuesday morning. Spirit shares plunged 15.5% after reporting November traffic figures late Monday. United fell nearly 4% intraday after reporting a traffic dip. Other carriers also retreated.
"
928,ORLY," Truckers: Similar to airlines, freight trucking companies spend a lot of money on fuel. When fuel prices fall, costs go down and margins go up.
"
929,ORLY,"IBD's Transportation-Truck ranks No. 7 of all the industries tracked and has been steadily rising for the past eight weeks. The group touched a record high on Friday and is up 23% since Oct. 13.
"
930,ORLY,"Stocks that have set new highs in recent weeks include group leaders such as Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL), which has an IBD Composite Rating of 99; Knight Transportation (KNX), which has a Composite Rating of 98; and Heartland Express (HTLD), which has a Composite Rating of 97.
"
931,ORLY," Auto parts retailers: When gas prices go down, people drive more. When they drive more, they put more wear and tear on the cars. When that happens, there's a rise in demand for replacement parts, maintenance and vehicle services.
"

935,ORLY," Railroads: Here's a group that has been going in the wrong direction amid falling oil prices — mainly because rail operators have gotten a big chunk of their business in recent years from the North American oil and gas industry. Any threat to oil and gas producers will likely hurt railroad companies.

936,ORLY,"IBD's Transportation-Rail group ranks No. 141 — a big and swift drop from eight weeks ago, when it ranked No. 11. Shares of the group have declined 11% since setting a record high on Nov. 25.

937,ORLY,"You can still find at least one very good stock in the group, however. Union Pacific (UNP) has an IBD Composite Rating of 95 and regularly delivers double-digit EPS growth. CSX (CSX) ranks second with a Composite Rating of 80.While falling oil prices obviously have had a negative impact on oil and gas stocks — eight of the nine lowest rated IBD industry groups are now in that sector — declining prices also have had a ripple effect on other industries: some for the better, others not so much.Following are four other industries that have seen an immediate impact from lower prices at the wellhead and gasoline pump. Three are enjoying the trend, while one of them is not. Airlines: Considering that fuel is one of the biggest expenses in the airline industry, it's no surprise that falling gasoline prices have been a boon to companies that make their living in the air.IBD's Transportation-Airline group is trading at record highs and ranks No. 2 among 197 industries tracked. That's up from No. 116 as recently as eight weeks ago.Stocks that have set multiyear highs in recent days include pretty much every airline you can think of. These include large commercial carriers such as Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Continental (UAL) as well as discount carriers Southwest Airlines (LUV), JetBlue Airways (JBLU) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and regional operations like Alaska Air Group (ALK) and Hawaiian Holdings (HA).The top rated stocks in the group are Spirit and Southwest, which have IBD Composite Ratings of 99 and 97, respectively.But airline stocks weren't winners on Tuesday morning. Spirit shares plunged 15.5% after reporting November traffic figures late Monday. United fell nearly 4% intraday after reporting a traffic dip. Other carriers also retreated. Truckers: Similar to airlines, freight trucking companies spend a lot of money on fuel. When fuel prices fall, costs go down and margins go up.IBD's Transportation-Truck ranks No. 7 of all the industries tracked and has been steadily rising for the past eight weeks. The group touched a record high on Friday and is up 23% since Oct. 13.Stocks that have set new highs in recent weeks include group leaders such as Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL), which has an IBD Composite Rating of 99; Knight Transportation (KNX), which has a Composite Rating of 98; and Heartland Express (HTLD), which has a Composite Rating of 97. Auto parts retailers: When gas prices go down, people drive more. When they drive more, they put more wear and tear on the cars. When that happens, there's a rise in demand for replacement parts, maintenance and vehicle services.That helps explain why IBD's Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts group has been steadily rising up the group rankings the past few months.

1092,ORLY,"Handling A Choppy Uptrend: Third In A SeriesChoppy markets are hard — even on the best stocks. But savvy investors know that some companies manage to rack up strong gains during periods of volatility.Such was the case last summer and fall, when IBD's Market Pulse (which accompanies the Big Picture column) seesawed from ""Confirmed Uptrend"" to ""Uptrend Under Pressure"" to ""Market In Correction.""It's easy to decide what to do when the market is in a strong uptrend or downtrend. But when the market is choppy it's best to lower your expectations and tighten up your sell rules.O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) began forming a long saucer with handle in December 2010 with a buy point of 61.39. It broke out above that buy point on June 17, 2011, in volume that was 76% above average 1.O'Reilly was benefiting as consumers looked to save money by doing their own repairs or by taking their vehicles to independent mechanics, who tend to buy less expensive aftermarket parts from the likes of O'Reilly.The stock ran up 8% after the breakout to a peak of 66.52 on July 1 before it started to roll over along with the market. 2 IBD's Market Pulse switched to ""Uptrend Under Pressure"" on July 11, which may have prompted investors to exit the stock and pocket a gain of about 6%.Those who held on were in for a rough ride. By July 27, when the market went into correction, the stock had given up almost all of its gains. By early August, the stock had fallen 8% below its buy point, forcing IBD-style investors to sell. 3But strong stocks in choppy markets typically offer a number of chances to buy and sell, and O'Reilly rewarded those who kept an eye on the stock after being shaken out.The stock began climbing back, finally jumping above its 10-week moving average line in strong volume on Aug. 23. 4 On that day, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq recorded a follow-through, putting the market back into a confirmed uptrend.Those who jumped back and held on endured a bumpy but ultimately rewarding ride as the Market Pulse flipped back and forth between correction and confirmed uptrend.O'Reilly pulled back to its rising 50-day moving-average line several times, but it never gave off a sell signal. It never closed below its 50-day line. Volume in each pullback was tame.O'Reilly went on to a peak of 107.13 on May 4, 2012, before crashing below its 50-day line in high volume. The profit from the original buy point at 61.39 was 75%. It was about 70% for those who bought when the stock crossed its 50-day line as the new market uptrend began Aug. 23.

1094,ORLY,"Unlike other major retailers hit by the harsh winter season, auto-parts retailers continue to perform strongly, with AutoZone (AZO) reporting Tuesday that its third-quarter earnings climbed 16.4%.AutoZone's Q3 EPS of $8.46 beat estimates by a penny and marked the company's 31st consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.Sales rose 6.2% to $2.34 billion, just past estimates of $2.3 billion. The company's gross-profit margin rose to 52% compared with 51.8% in the year-earlier quarter.A tough winter season contributed to higher industrywide sales of replacement parts, and AutoZone is not alone in its growth. Advance Auto Parts (AAP) and O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) also had quarterly earnings that beat projections. Advance Auto Parts' EPS jumped 36.4% and O'Reilly's rose 18.4% in their latest reports.AutoZone's same-store sales climbed 4% in the quarter. It opened 30 new stores in the U.S. and seven new stores in Mexico, bringing its tally to 5,279 stores total.""I would say that our sales performed a little bit better in the third quarter than our expectations, particularly when the winter subsided and the taxes refunds were flowing, we had some tremendous weeks in that period of time,"" said CEO Bill Rhodes in a post-earnings conference call with analysts. ""It rebounded quicker, and we've been encouraged by the deferrable maintenance categories and how they've continued to perform within the quarter.""As detailed in an IBD Industry Snapshot, the demand for replacement batteries, starters and alternators rises seasonally as snow and ice affect driving conditions. While sales of new cars are rising slowly, consumers are reluctant to sell, with the average age of light vehicles at 11.4 years, according to research firm Polk.JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers said in a research note that ""today's AZO report reinforces the view that the category remains strong as the lag effect of the winter on pent-up maintenance drives demand.""While shares rose initially in the morning, AutoZone dropped 2% in the stock market today.Advance Auto Parts and O'Reilly each fell about 1%.

1099,ORLY,"On Jun 15, we issued an updated research report on O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (ORLY  -  Free Report).This automotive aftermarket parts’ specialty retailer is set to gain from the opening of stores and the expansion of the distribution network. This will help it penetrate in existing markets, and expand in new and contiguous ones. In 2017, O’Reilly opened 198 new stores. In first-quarter 2018, the company opened 78 stores.Also, the company pursues an aggressive share-repurchase policy, which continues to boost earnings per share. In 2017, O’Reilly invested $2.17 billion to repurchase 9.3 million shares. Further, in February 2018, the company raised the share-repurchase authorization amount by an additional $1 billion, making the total amount to $10.75 billion. In first-quarter 2018, O’Reilly repurchased 2.2 million shares for $549 million, reflecting an average price of $251.08 per share. Subsequently, at the end of the quarter, the company purchased additional 0.4 million shares for $87 million.For second-quarter 2018, O’Reilly projects diluted earnings per share of $3.95-$4.05. The company expects consolidated comparable store sales to climb 2-4%.For full-year 2018, O’Reilly raised its earnings per share outlook to $15.3-$15.4 from $15.1-$15.2. The company, however, reiterated total revenue guidance at $9.4-$9.6 billion for the year.However, the company’s presence — only in the United States, majorly in Texas and California — makes its business sensitive to the economic and weather conditions of those regions. Bad weather condition discourages customers, majorly DIY customers, from visiting the company stores.In the past three months, shares of O’Reilly have outperformed the industry it belongs to. During the period, its stock has witnessed a rise of 13.8% in comparison with the industry’s gain of 12%. O’Reilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the auto space are Oshkosh Corporation (OSK  -  Free Report), Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. (ALSN  -  Free Report) and Ferrari N.V. (RACE  -  Free Report).  While both Oshkosh and Allison Transmission Holdings sport a Zacks Rank # 1 (Strong Buy), Ferrari carries a Zacks Rank # 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Oshkosh has an expected long-term growth rate of 18.3%. Shares of the company have risen 3.6% over the past year.Allison Transmission Holdings has an expected long-term growth rate of 10%. Over the past year, shares of the company have gained 10.6%.Ferrari has an expected long-term growth rate of 17.3%. Over the past year, shares of the company have gained 65.9%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6% and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

1103,ORLY,"March shone bright on renewed consumer spending, reversing the three-quarter spell of declines with a sharp uptick in retail sales. The Commerce Department said that U.S. retail and food services sales advanced 0.6% to $494.6 billion last month, following a respective decline of 0.1% and 0.2% in February and January. Consumer outlays rose on the back of a strengthening labor market, tax reform and rising income.This definitely brings good tidings for investors who closely track the Retail-Wholesale sector. Analysts pointed that the sales pickup may not enhance retailers’ first-quarter performance much but it definitely indicates that Americans are more confident now. Certainly, this positive sentiment is likely to translate into higher consumer spending — one of the pivotal factors driving the economy.Given the favorable backdrop, the sector is likely to catch investors’ attention this reporting cycle. Markedly, the sector is anticipated to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 12%, per the latest Earnings Outlook. This shows a significant improvement from the previous quarter’s earnings growth of 3%. The top line is also projected to increase 7.6% compared with 9.7% in the preceding quarter.So, picking stocks that are likely to trump estimates can fetch handsome returns for investors. This is because a stock generally picks up steam on an earnings beat. On the flip side, not all retail companies are going to beat or meet expectations. There will be some slow coaches. Apparently, dodging stocks with lower earnings beat predictability will definitely minimize the risks to your portfolio.We can identify the probable underperformers before they report by combining our proprietary Zack Rank and Earnings ESP system. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) along with a negative Earnings ESP have a very slim chance of outperforming estimates.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Give These 4 Stocks a MissO'Reilly Automotive, Inc.

1104,ORLY,"On Apr 9, we issued an updated research report on O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (ORLY  -  Free Report).This automotive aftermarket parts’ specialty retailer is poised to gain from the opening of new stores and expansion of the distribution network. This will help it to penetrate in existing markets and expand in new and contiguous ones. In 2017, O'Reilly opened 198 new stores while planning to open 200 more outlets in 2018.Further, the company boasts a competitive edge due to the dual-market strategy by serving both Do-it-Yourself (DIY) and Do-it-for-Me (DIFM) customers. Its dual-market stores allow to expanding into large markets by offering professional knowledge for DIFM customers, including commercial service providers. It also caters to the scarcely populated areas that attract less competition by its well-known portfolio brands.O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Price and Consensus O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Price and Consensus | O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. QuoteIn fourth-quarter 2017, O'Reilly witnessed 4% year-over-year rise in sales to $2.19 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, the adjusted earnings were $2.9 per share, beating the same. The bottom line was $2.59 in the prior-year quarter.The company anticipates earnings per share of $3.55-$3.65 for first-quarter 2018, which is expected to release on Apr 25, while the figure for full-year 2018 is expected to be $15.1-$15.2 compared with $12.67 in 2017.The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly and annual earnings being revised 0.3% downward and 1% upward, respectively, over the last 60 days.However, continuous rise in expenses, due to the payment of incentive compensation, professional service fees and additional capital expenditure, are hurting O'Reilly’s profit margins. Also, much of its cash is locked in inventories, hampering a significant part of current assets that can affect the short-term liquidity of the company in periods of low sales.Moreover, the company’s presence only in the United States, majorly in Texas and California, makes its business sensitive to the economic and weather conditions of these regions. Bad weather condition discourages customers, majorly DIY customers, from visiting company stores.Price PerformanceIn the last three months, shares of O'Reilly have outperformed the industry it belongs to. During the period, its stock has edged down 10.6% in comparison with the industry’s decline of 12.9%. Zacks Rank & Key PicksO'Reilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1105,ORLY,"Automotive, Inc. (ORLY  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because O'Reilly Automotiveis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat.

The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in one of the trailing four quarters, with a negative average surprise of 2.3%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for the forthcoming announcement.Factors Influencing this QuarterO’Reilly’s stores are concentrated in certain locations in the U.S. Thus, its business is exposed to the economic and weather conditions of these regions.

1109,ORLY,"O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) is one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment, and accessories in the US, serving both professional service providers and do-it-yourself customers.Founded in 1957, the company IPO’d in April 1993. As of March 31, 2017, they operated 4,888 stores in 47 states.Shares Plunge After Weak Sales ResultsOn July 5, the company reported its Q2 comparable store sales results, which were much weaker-than-expected.  The stock fell almost 20% and is down about 34% year-to-date.“After exiting the first quarter and entering April on an improved sales trend, we faced a more challenging sales environment than we expected for the remainder of the quarter. Our second quarter comparable store sales results of 1.7% represent an improvement over our first quarter, but fell below our guidance of 3% to 5%, due to what we believe were continued headwinds from a second consecutive mild winter and overall weak consumer demand,” said the CEO.The company reports second quarter earnings on July 26.Falling EstimatesAnalysts have slashed their estimates for the company after weak guidance.  Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and next fiscal year have fallen to $11.83 per share and $13.10 per share from $12.26 and $13.73 respectively, 30 days back.The company has missed in three out of past four quartere. The average negative quarterly surprise for the past four quarters is 2.3%.The Bottom LineAuto parts suppliers are facing increasing headwinds due to rising competition from Amazon. But there are several other factors that have resulted in bearish outlook for the industry. In addition to two consecutive mild winters, better vehicle quality, a smaller number of older cars and weak consumer demand from certain demographic groups have resulted in weak demand for auto parts.The industry “Automotive - Retail and Wholesale - Parts” is currently ranked 249 out of 265 Zacks industries (bottom 6%), suggesting potential underperformance in the short-to-medium term. With the fundamental shift in the auto industry towards smart cars with more digital features, traditional auto suppliers will face rising challenges ahead.It would be better for investors to stay away from this stock and the industry as of now. There is no Zacks #1 stock in this industry.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies                                                                                                                                                                                                              It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1110,ORLY,"The retail sector is on transformation mode, with store-based retailers now ditching their longstanding business approach for the young and attractive omni-channel concept that promises to provide a seamless shopping experience, both online and in-stores. So, when it comes to shopping, customers are now spoiled with choices.Consumers can make purchases through a computer, smartphones, tablets, or in person. At the same time, retailers may save on some cost of serving by encouraging consumers to pick up bulky items from a store instead of shipping it to their home. This way, it works well for both.In general, retail is a seasonal business with nearly 20% of sales in the U.S. generated during the holiday season in December. Further, being a consumer-centric business, the state of the economy plays a major role in the ascertaining the health of this sector.With respect to seasonal shopping periods, it is that time of the year when retailers are getting ready for a major spending event: Back-to-School and Back-to-College. This is a crucial time for retailers as American households stock up on school and college supplies.The key categories of sales during this season are apparel & accessories, books & music, computers & consumer electronics, office equipment & supplies, toys & hobbies and sporting goods, to name a few. Some close contenders for the Back-to-School market are Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), Best Buy Co. Inc. BBY, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Office Depot Inc. (ODP  -  Free Report), Staples Inc. SPLS and J.C. Penney Company Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report).National Retail Federation (NRF), the nation's largest retail trade group, projects retail industry sales for 2017 to grow in the range of 3.7% to 4.2% over 2016. Further, online and other non-store sales are expected to register 8% to 12% growth.Long-Term Trends that Rule the SectorWith the increasing influence of technology on the buying patterns of consumers, the general retail sector trends set to rule the future are below:Omni-channel Eliminates Retail Pure-Plays: Omni-channel, which emerged as an option to offer more touch points and multiple channels to customers, has gone beyond this simple definition. The cross-channel sales mantra now requires every retailer, whether online or brick and mortar, to bring together both physical and digital systems to serve omni-customers.As a result, retail pure-plays, both online and offline, are now turning omni-channel. This means online retailers are coming up with physical stores or pop-up shops to satisfy customers and vice versa.Here, the prime objective is to bridge the gap between a physical and an ecommerce store of any particular retailer. For example, Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report) makes the most of its omni-channel presence with services like click-and-collect.Additionally, the company’s site allows customers to access the inventory at its local stores, so that they can check the availability of a product at the nearest store, purchase it and have it picked up or arrange for same-day delivery. In another online feature, Macy’s mobile app allows customers to scan bar codes of products at stores and check online reviews, promotions and the like.Growth of Off-price Retailing: A recent trend shows that apart from e-commerce, the rise of off-price retailing is making competition worse for retailers. Off-price retailers like TJX Companies Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report), Ross Stores Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report), Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) Nordstrom Rack, Five Below Inc. FIVE, Macy’s Backstage, Bloomingdale’s, Kohl’s and others are doing a good job, unlike department stores and specialty clothing retailers.Customers today are looking for value, which means reasonable and quality merchandise. Off-price retailers offer immense value as they purchase their inventory at a discount.In contrast, department and specialty retailers have to resort to mark downs from time to time in order to clear their inventory. This has led to a major shift in consumer preferences to off-priced merchandise, making department and specialty store irrelevant to consumers.Expanded Payments Options: With retail undergoing a sea change, the modes of payment have also evolved dramatically. The increasing use of mobile payments and the EMV mandate in the U.S. induced retailers to remodel their payment terminals to accept multiple options like mobile payments and EMV cards.Some of the available payment solutions are PayPal Here Chip Card reader, Mercury and Poynt, which equip retailers with different payment accepting options. These devices or hardware ensure compatibility with iOS and Android devices, magnetic cards, EMV, QR codes and NFC payments such as Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay.Technology-Friendly Brick & Mortar Stores: With shoppers increasingly becoming tech savvy, brick and mortar stores need to leave their old-fashioned layout behind and improvise by adopting innovative in-store technologies. With rising demand for convenient delivery and alternative payment solutions, all at affordable prices, technology is bound to play a key role in growth. This is because consumers are becoming increasingly dependent on their mobile phones and other digital devices to buy goods.The simplest way to execute this is through in-store mobile devices, through which customers can make payments, see product demonstrations, gather information and connect to social networks. Further, these in-store devices can help customers locate the products they are looking for. Not only this, retailers have developed mobile apps that will track customers as they shop and send them tailored offers on products in sections they are in, recommend items based on past purchases, or allow them to program automated shopping lists.In-store technologies, that customers look for these days include mobile point of sales, price checkers, self-checkout payment lanes, information kiosks, and digital signage among others. Other innovative technologies to engage customers both in store and elsewhere are smart shelves, Wi-Fi hot spots, point-of-sales (POS) systems, virtual storefronts and endless aisles.Shrinking Store Sizes: Changing consumer preferences have led to an increase in smaller stores. Even ‘big box’ retailers are now concentrating on smaller store formats, which accommodate more specific merchandise according to consumer preferences. We have already seen a transition relating to this idea, with companies like Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) and Best Buy focusing on smaller store formats.The main reason for this shift in consumer preference is the convenience and accessibility that small stores provide. Consumers are looking to make quick purchases these days. Finding the desired products by wandering through endless aisles of big stores seems cumbersome and time taking. Today, smaller stores with specialized selections are preferred as finding desired products in little time is easier in these. Additionally, smaller stores are cost effective right from inception to managing operating costs to finding space in urban environments.Growth of Retail-centric Apps and Services, Social Shopping: As already said, consumers are looking for speedy deliveries apart from multiple buying options. This has increased the number of retail-centric apps that merchants are adopting in order to stay competitive. Further, retailers are looking for third-party solutions to fulfill the demands of customers. Retailers have also been using social media platforms to advertise their brands, launch products and campaigns, talk to customers and even make merchandising decisions.Most companies are now also selling their products through social networking sites like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, which have shopping functionalities. Some retailers that have already adopted the Like2Buy platform on Instagram are Nordstrom, Aeropostale and Target. Moreover, retailers are increasingly seeking the assistance of third parties to quickly get their products delivered.Merging Online and Offline Data to Track Shoppers: The growing use of multiple shopping channels has made it imperative for retailers to collectively study their online and offline data in order to analyze the buying habits of consumers. This gives a more comprehensive picture of their shopping practice.A study of online and offline data has revealed that shoppers usually browse for products online before finally making purchases in stores. Such data can be helpful in tracking the purchase habits of customers and executing effectively on their omni-channel initiatives.Taking Charge of Value Chain: The success mantra in modern retail is to provide a compelling shopping experience, which is only possible by taking full control of one’s value chain i.e., from the creation of products to their consumption. Some of the retailers that have proven themselves in this area are Apple, Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL  -  Free Report) and Trader Joe’s. We expect this strategy to gain importance, with retailers focusing more on fulfillment practices, product distribution, speed and convenience of delivering products to consumers, and more.Growth of Retail in Emerging Markets: Having tapped most of the potential in the domestic market, retailers have started venturing into emerging markets. Most retail chains are witnessing growing demand for their products in countries like Brazil, the Middle East, China and India. Retailers planning to venture into these markets include the likes of The Gap Inc., The Clorox Company CLX, Ralph Lauren, V.F. Corp. (VFC  -  Free Report) and Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report).Consolidation in Retail Industry: The U.S. retail industry has been witnessing further consolidation, with companies merging with peers to become larger and vying to lead the markets they serve. Some of the recent mergers include that of Dollar Tree Inc. DLTR with Family Dollar, which has given rise to a mega U.S. discount retailer. Also, apparel retailer, Ascena Retail Group Inc. ASNA bought Ann Taylor parent ANN Inc., which has strengthened the position of the former in the women’s apparel market.Also, the recent liquidation of sporting goods chains like Sports Authority, Sport Chalet and Golfsmith has left gaps to intensify competition. Such consolidation in the sporting goods space is benefiting other participants like DICK’S Sporting Goods Inc. DKS and Big 5 Sporting Goods Inc. BGFV.Localization of Products Mix: Localization requires tailoring of products and stores to satisfy the needs of native communities. This trait is expected to prove most beneficial this year as customization is likely to attract more customers. One example of such a retailer that tailors its merchandise for respective stores is O’Reilly Automotive Inc. (ORLY  -  Free Report).Bottom LineAs for the general trend, omni-channel will rule retail business. The focus of retailers will be to stick to this growing business model for exemplary customer experience.As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the retail industry over the long term. But what about investing in the space right now?Check out our latest Retail Industry Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now.

Retailers have already flooded the market with offers for the soon-approaching Thanksgiving and Black Friday shopping bonanza, marking the busiest shopping days of the year. Though retail outlets are generally closed on Thanksgiving Day, many operators have been opening stores Thursday night to cash-in early on Black Friday enthusiasm.Right after Black Friday is Cyber Monday, giving special online deals and coupons. Cyber Monday is generally an ‘online only’ day, whereas the Black Friday deals are available both in stores and online.

Online sales for the season are expected to increase 7–10% to approximately $117 billion.Long-Term Trends Ruling the SectorAs revealed by Marian Salzman, CEO of Havas PR North America on the final day of Retail’s BIG Show 2016, there are two trends that are here to stay. The first is the growing uneasiness in everyone’s lives and the second is an addiction to the tech world. With these trends ruling the minds of people, it is essential that retailers innovate new ways to make life easier for consumers and complement their digitized ways.With the increasing influence of technology on the buying patterns of consumers, the general retail sector trends set to rule the future are jotted below:Omni-channel Eliminates Retail Pure-Plays: Omni-channel, which emerged as an option to offer more touch points and multiple channels to customers, has gone beyond this simple definition.

CAR, recently introduced a new payment option with MasterPass by Master Card, wherein travelers can make advance payments for their rentals while making reservations on Avis.com and Budget.com.Technology-Friendly Brick & Mortar Stores: With shoppers increasingly becoming tech savvy, brick and mortar stores need to leave their old-fashioned layout behind and improvise by adopting innovative in-store technologies.

Hence, the traditional loyalty scheme needs to be replaced with customer-friendly and easily redeemable rewards.Of the many retailers that have a deep focus on enhancing rewards on their loyalty schemes, Nordstrom, Rite Aid Corp. (RAD  -  Free Report) and Office Depot Inc. (ODP) are a few.Another method that retailers are now adopting to draw consumers involves going beyond purchases to reward them for their transactions and engagement.

1118,ORLY,"As revealed by Marian Salzman, CEO of Havas PR North America on the final day of Retail’s BIG Show 2016, there are two trends that are here to stay. The first is the growing uneasiness in everyone’s lives and the second is an addiction to the tech world. With these trends ruling the minds of people, it is essential that retailers innovate new ways to make life easier for consumers and complement their digitized ways.
"
1119,ORLY,"With the increasing influence of technology on the buying patterns of consumers, the general retail sector trends set to rule the future are jotted below:Omni-channel Eliminates Retail Pure-Plays: Omni-channel, which emerged as an option to offer more touch points and multiple channels to customers, has gone beyond this simple definition. The cross-channel sales mantra now requires every retailer, whether online or brick and mortar, to bring together both physical and digital systems to serve omni-customers. As a result, retail pure-plays, both online and offline, are now turning omni-channel. This means online retailers are coming up with physical stores or pop-up shops to satisfy customers and vice versa.
"
1120,ORLY,"Here, the prime objective is to bridge the gap between a physical and an ecommerce store of any particular retailer. For example, Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report) makes the most of its omni-channel presence with services like click-and-collect. Additionally, the company’s site allows customers to access the inventory at its local stores, so that they can check the availability of a product at the nearest store, purchase it and have it picked up or arrange for same-day delivery. In another online feature, Macy’s mobile app allows customers to scan bar codes of products at stores and check online reviews, promotions and the like.Expanded Payments Options: With retail undergoing a sea change, the modes of payment while shopping have also evolved dramatically. The increasing use of mobile payments and the EMV mandate in the U.S. induced retailers to remodel their payment terminals to accept multiple options like mobile payments and EMV cards.
"
1121,ORLY,"Some of the available payment solutions are PayPal’s PayPal Here Chip Card reader, Mercury and Poynt, which equip retailers with different payment accepting options. These devices or hardware ensure compatibility with iOS and Android devices, magnetic cards, EMV, QR codes and NFC payments such as Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay.Technology-Friendly Brick & Mortar Stores: With shoppers increasingly becoming tech savvy, the brick and mortar stores need to leave their old-fashioned layout behind and improvise by adopting innovative in-store technologies. The simplest way to execute this is through in-store mobile devices, through which customers can make payments, see product demonstrations, gather information and connect to social networks.
"
1122,ORLY,"Further, retailers are exploring new ways to use mobile devices in store. As a result, they intend to develop mobile apps that will track customers as they shop and send them tailored offers on products in sections they are in; recommend items based on past purchases; or allow them to program automated shopping lists.
"
1123,ORLY,"In-store technologies, that customers look for these days include mobile point of sales, price checkers, self-checkout payment lanes, information kiosks, digital signage, etc. Other innovative technologies to engage customers both in store and elsewhere are smart shelves, Wi-Fi hot spots, point-of-sales (POS) systems, virtual storefronts and endless aisles.Reinvention of Loyalty Programs: With perpetual changes in industry trends, the importance of rewards and promotions for customers has been taken over by value, track record and convenience.  Hence, the traditional loyalty programs have to be clubbed with customized rewards, great products and buying convenience in order to be successful.
"
1124,ORLY,"Further, adding the tech aspect to these programs will enhance their value. Hence, the traditional loyalty scheme needs to be replaced with mobile-based ones to make their customer friendly and easy ways of redeeming rewards.
"
1125,ORLY,"Of the many retailers that have a deep focus on enhancing rewards on their loyalty schemes, Nordstrom, Rite Aid Corp. (RAD  -  Free Report) and Office Depot are a few.
"
1126,ORLY,"Another method that retailers are now adopting to draw consumers involves going beyond purchases to reward them for their transactions and engagement. For instance, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) allows its customers to earn points for every health-related activity they engage in, including walking, weight tracking and so on. Also, DICK’S Sporting Goods Inc. (DKS) recently introduced the “Move” feature to its mobile app, which allows customers to connect to fitness tracking applications like MapMyRun and Fitbit to earn DICK'S ScoreCard points for attaining their activity goals.Impact of Social Media on Shopping Decisions: Business firms have taken to the widely used social networking sites for their promotional purposes. Over the past several years, retailers have been using social media platforms to advertise their brands, launch products and campaigns, talk to customers and even make merchandising decisions.
"
1127,ORLY,"The companies are now also selling their products through social networking sites like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, which recently added shopping functionalities. Some of the retailers that have already adopted this platform are Nordstrom and Target, which are using the Like2Buy platform on Instagram, Home Depot and Burberry.Merging Online and Offline Data to Track Shoppers: The growing use of multiple shopping channels has made it imperative for retailers to collectively study their online and offline data in order to analyze the buying habits of consumers. This gives a more comprehensive picture of their shopping practice.
"
1128,ORLY,"A study of online and offline data has revealed that shoppers usually browse for products online before finally making purchases in stores. Such data can be helpful in tracking the purchase habits of customers and executing effectively on their omni-channel initiatives.Taking Charge of Value Chain: The success mantra in modern retail is to provide a compelling shopping experience, which is only possible by taking full control of one’s value chain i.e., from the creation of products to their consumption. Some of the retailers that have proved themselves in this area are Apple, Ralph Lauren and Trade Joe’s. We expect this strategy to gain importance, with retailers focusing more on fulfillment practices, product distribution, speed and convenience of delivering products to consumers, and more.Growth of Retail in Emerging Markets: Having tapped most of the potential in the domestic market, retailers have started venturing into emerging markets. Most retail chains are witnessing growing demand for their products in countries like Brazil, the Middle East, China and India. Retailers planning to venture into these markets include the likes of The Gap, The Clorox Company (CLX), Ralph Lauren, V.F. Corp. (VFC  -  Free Report) and Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report).
"
1129,ORLY,"Localization of Products Mix and Store Formats to Win the Race: Localization requires tailoring of products and stores to satisfy the needs of native communities. This trait is expected to prove the most beneficial this year as customization is likely to attract more customers. One example of such a retailer that tailors its merchandise for respective stores is O’Reilly Automotive Inc. (ORLY  -  Free Report).
"
1130,ORLY,"Others following this trait are retailers like Starbucks Corp. (SBUX  -  Free Report), Target and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG). These retailers have deviated from their usual store formats and established smaller “express” stores to tap the potential of the urban markets.Bottom Line
"
1131,ORLY,"With the easing of wage stagnation, more new jobs and steady consumer confidence, the retail industry is definitely poised for growth in 2016. Despite headwinds from global economies – China in particular – the U.S. economy has shown resilience with a rise in GDP.
"
1132,ORLY,"Since things are falling in place, we expect retailers to see a dream run from lower gas prices that are leading to growth in discretionary income for savings, debt repayment as well as higher spending on travel, fine dining and other recreational activities. This is opening up more avenues for retailers to generate higher profits, while competing for the top position and keeping costs low.
"
1133,ORLY,"And as for the general trend, omni-channel will rule retail business. The focus of retailers will stick to this growing business model for exemplary customer experience.
"
1134,ORLY,"As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the retail industry over the long term. But what about investing in the space right now?

"
1136,ORLY,"The holiday season is right around the corner, and retailers are bracing up for this year’s race with new strategies to attract traffic. The technology-driven market has opened up numerous avenues to engage consumers, with different offers to lure them to convenient purchases outside regular store hours.
"
1137,ORLY,"While this evolution poses some risks, it has also offered retailers a bundle of new opportunities to emerge as winners this holiday season. Some of the strategies adopted by these hawked-eye retailers include early store openings, extended holiday deals to tempt customers to shop ahead of the traditional Black Friday and Cyber Monday weeks, free shipping for online shopping, price matching and many more.
"
1138,ORLY,"Among the retailers that have already kicked off with their holiday offerings are Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report). Also, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) has begun its Black Friday Early Countdown which features lightning deals for its prime members.
"
1139,ORLY,"Data compiled by eMarketer suggests a 5.7% jump in holiday sales (November and December) to $885.7 billion against 3.2% growth projected earlier. Retail E-commerce holiday season sales are anticipated to increase 13.9%, and represent approximately 9% of total sales this season (or $79.4 billion), up from 8.3% last year.
"
1140,ORLY,"Data compiled by the nation's largest retail trade group, National Retail Federation (NRF), projects a 3.7% sales jump for the period to $630.5 billion, shy of 4.1% growth registered last year but better than the 10-year average sales increment of 2.5%. Online sales for the season are expected to increase 6–8% to approximately $105 billion.Long-Term Trends that Rule the Sector
"
1141,ORLY,"With the increasing influence of technology on the buying patterns of consumers, the general retail sector trends set to rule for about the next five years are jotted below:Omni-channel Retailing: The growth of various shopping means has given rise to the “omni-channel” approach, which focuses on providing more touch points and multiple channels to customers. This approach facilitates the use of all possible media to engage consumers, including brick and mortar stores, online and mobile at the same time or alternatively. This strategy provides customers the ease to select, purchase and exchange a product through multiple channels.
"
1142,ORLY,"For example, a customer may select a product online, buy it through phone and exchange the same at a store without any hassle. Some retailers who are already benefiting from this strategy are Staples Inc. (SPLS), Macy's Inc. (M  -  Free Report), Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) and Chico’s FAS Inc. (CHS).Personalized In-Store Experience: With evolution to the .com era and advancement of consumers, retailers are reinventing their marketing styles, gradually shifting from the mass advertising and promotion format to a more personalized method to impress today’s omni-channel customers. Modern-day consumers prefer more direct communication, like interacting with an executive through their smartphone app or chatting with them on the company’s website. They also look for tailored online as well as in-store offers and recommendations.Increasing Use of Mobile Wallet Technology: With everything in retail undergoing a sea change, the modes of payment used when shopping have also evolved dramatically. Increasing use of smartphones, tablets and mobile technology has given rise to a new mobile application called ‘mobile wallet,’ through which customers can make payments instantly using their smartphones or tablets. Though cash and credit cards remain the primary payment methods, the use of mobile wallet is catching up quickly because of its convenience.
"
1143,ORLY,"The popularity of this particular app among customers is driving retailers to adapt this payment mode by collaborating with some of the mobile wallet providers available in the market like PayPal, Google Wallet, Square Wallet, Dwolla and more.
"
1144,ORLY,"A quick recall of one such collaboration is the fusion of leading car rental company Avis Budget Group Inc.’s (CAR) express rental service “Avis Preferred” with the Google Wallet application. Moreover, the PayPal app has gained recognition with a wide array of retailers, including Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF), Advance Auto Parts Inc. (AAP), Aeropostale Inc. (ARO), American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO), Barnes & Noble Inc. (BKS), Foot Locker Inc. (FL), Guitar Center, Jamba Inc.’s (JMBA) Jamba Juice, J.C. Penney Company Inc. (JCP), Nine West, Office Depot Inc. (ODP  -  Free Report), Rooms To Go, Tiger Direct and Toys “R” Us.Technology-Friendly Brick & Mortar Stores: With shoppers increasingly becoming tech savvy, the brick and mortar stores need to leave their old-fashioned layouts behind and improvise by adopting innovative in-store technologies. The simplest way to execute this is through in-store mobile devices, through which customers can make payments, see product demonstrations, gather information and connect to social networks.
"
1145,ORLY,"Further, retailers are exploring new ways to use mobile devices in store. As a result, they intend to develop mobile apps that will track customers as they shop and send them tailored offers on products of section they are in; recommend items based on past purchases; or allow them to program automated shopping lists.
"
1146,ORLY,"In-store technologies, that customers look for these days include mobile point of sales, price checkers, self-checkout payment lanes, information kiosks, digital signage, etc. Other innovative technologies to engage customers both in-store and elsewhere are smart shelves, Wi-Fi hot spots, point-of-sales (POS) systems, virtual storefronts and endless aisles.Reinvention of Loyalty Programs: With perpetual changes in the industry trends, retailers are now perking up their loyalty programs by replacing loyalty cards with customized offers based on social conduct and behavioral patterns of shoppers, frequently bought items and other such details. Retailers with deep focus on enhancing rewards on their loyalty schemes are Nordstrom, Rite Aid Corp. (RAD  -  Free Report) and Office Depot to name a few.
"
1147,ORLY,"Another method that retailers have recently started adopting to draw consumers involves going beyond purchases to reward consumers for their transactions and engagement. For instance, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) allows its customers to earn points for every health-related activity they engage in, including walking, weight tracking, and so on.

Over the past several years, retailers have used social media platforms to advertise their brands, launch products and campaigns, talk to customers and even make merchandising decisions. The companies are now looking for opportunities to also sell their products through social media.
"
1148,ORLY,"In accordance with this, social networking sites, like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, are adding shopping functionalities to their sites. Some of the retailers that have already adopted this platform are Nordstrom and Target, which are using the Like2Buy platform on Instagram, and The Home Depot Inc. (HD), (RED) and Burberry, which are testing Twitter’s buy button.Investing in Big Data to Track Shoppers: With the growing need for giving personal attention to shoppers, retailers are widely investing in analysis software like “Big Data” that help accumulate information on behavioral patterns, history and background of customers. Analysis of such data helps to predict customer reaction, formulate pricing strategies, offer shopper-specific discounts and provide personalized recommendations to shoppers.
"
1149,ORLY,"Some of the data analytics tools that will be adopted in 2015 include Swarm, which will enable stores to analyze foot traffic, thereby helping to make better decisions and tailor customer interactions, and Collect, which will track the spending habits of the top customers and provide them personalized rewards and offers.Taking Charge of Its Value Chain: The mantra to success in modern retail is to provide a compelling shopping experience to customers, which is only possible by taking full control of one’s value chain i.e., from creation of products to their consumption. Some of the retailers that have proved themselves in this area are Apple, Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL  -  Free Report) and Trade Joe’s. We expect the importance of this strategy to grow, with retailers focusing more on fulfillment practices, product distribution, speed and convenience of delivering products to consumers, and more.Growth of Retail in Emerging Markets: Having tapped most of the potential in the domestic market, retailers have started venturing into emerging markets. Most retail chains are witnessing growing demand for their products in countries like Brazil, the Middle East, China and India and aims at growing their exposure in these countries over time. Retailers planning to venture into these markets include the likes of The Gap Inc. (GPS), The Clorox Company (CLX), Ralph Lauren, V.F. Corp. (VFC  -  Free Report) and Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report).Localization of Products Mix and Store Formats to Win: Localization requires tailoring of products and stores to satisfy the needs of local communities.

"
1151,ORLY,"Retailers are trying to remain competitive primarily by shifting their focus toward the long-term horizon and finding innovative solutions to create value, reduce operating costs and mitigate risks throughout the enterprise.
"
1152,ORLY,"Right-sizing inventories, enhancing efficiency and competence while bringing in technological advancements are the key agendas adopted by retailers. Moreover, cost-containment efforts and merchandise initiatives to improve margins are the top priorities.
"
1153,ORLY,"Retail, owing to its huge spectrum, remains a lucrative investment avenue for investors. The sector reflects the trend of consumer spending trend — an important parameter to gauge the health of the economy. Hence, identifying future winners from this sector and investing in them can be a good decision.

"
1157,ORLY,"Every week the government and other entities release economic reports that cover all areas of the economy - from retail sales to housing, to international trade to consumer sentiment. 
"
1158,ORLY,"In fact, on virtually any given day there could be anywhere from one to a handful of reports. 
"
1159,ORLY,"And while the financial media does cover them, they usually focus on headline numbers without doing a deeper dive. 
"
1160,ORLY,"This is unfortunate because within these reports often exists money-making details that can quickly be uncovered with just an extra few minutes of reading. 
"
1161,ORLY,"For example, in the Employment Situation report, it details what sectors saw the most new jobs or labor force expansion, and which ones contracted. 
"
1162,ORLY,"I can remember countless times where that report got me into the right sectors and industries at the right time before anybody else was talking about them. 
"
1163,ORLY,"In fact, I still remember getting into housing in early 2012 while everybody else was staying as far away from it as possible. But, after seeing construction jobs continue to rise in report after report after report, I knew the housing market had turned. And that was one of the first alerts to the housing recovery - for those who knew where to look. 
"
1164,ORLY,"But the headline number and the obligatory one-or-two-sentence write ups on many news sites missed the best part of the story by not going the extra mile (or paragraph). 
"
1165,ORLY,"Well here we are again, with more stock-picking insight, straight from last week's Employment Situation report. Last week it showed that some of the biggest job creation came from these three industries: 
"
1166,ORLY,"1) Professional and Business Services +78,000 
"
1167,ORLY,"(up 624,000 over the last 12 months) 
"
1168,ORLY,"2) Health Care +45,000 
"
1169,ORLY,"(up 495,000 over the last 12 months) 
"
1170,ORLY,"3) Retail Trade +44,000 
"
1171,ORLY,"(up 300,000 over the last 12 months) 
"
1172,ORLY,"4) Food Service and Drinking Places +42,000 
"
1173,ORLY,"(up 368,000 over the last 12 months) 
"
1174,ORLY,"5) Construction +31,000 
"
1175,ORLY,"(up 233,000 over the last 12  months) 
"
1176,ORLY,"Once these reports point you in the right direction, you can then plug in the appropriate sectors and industries to capitalize on this information and find the best stocks within those groups. 
"
1177,ORLY,"This is just one very specific way to do top down analysis. But you can go to any screener (like the one on Zacks.com or the Research Wizard) and locate the sector, then industry of interest. 
"
1178,ORLY,"Then you should add in your favorite and most successful stock-picking criteria to drill down to the best ones, such as Zacks Rank 1s or 2s (Strong Buys or Buys); market-beating growth rates; below industry valuations; upward earnings estimate revisions, etc.

"
1194,ORLY,"Highlighted stocks include AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report), GameStop Corporation (GME  -  Free Report) and Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (CBRL  -  Free Report).
"
1195,ORLY,"In the midst of an ongoing recession, Retail-Wholesale is one of the top-ranked sectors. Though this sounds paradoxical, there are 3 reasons that justify this.
"
1196,ORLY,"The first has to do with timing. Many retailers operate on a February-January calendar year, which means they report earnings later than most companies.
"
1197,ORLY,"To the extent that analysts revise estimates higher in response to earnings reports, those late reporters receive a better Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank considers changes made to earnings estimates over both the last 60-90 days and over the last 30 days.
"
1198,ORLY,"Secondly, as Rob Plaza discussed yesterday, expectations were overly pessimistic, making it easy for some companies within the retail sector to clear the hurdle by a seemingly wide margin.
"
1199,ORLY,"Finally, there were a few companies in the sector with good earnings reports.
"
1200,ORLY,"Economy Helping Auto Part SalesAutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report) is a good example. Yesterday, shares of the auto parts retailer soared after the company reported bullish results.
"
1201,ORLY,"Fiscal second-quarter earnings totaled $2.03, 18 cents above expectations. Net sales reached $1.4 billion, aided by a 6% jump in same-store sales.
"
1202,ORLY,"The company is benefiting from the decline in car sales. Consumers are keeping their cars longer and, as a result, are spending on maintenance. (Afterall, it's hard to get a job if you can't make it to the interview.)
"
1203,ORLY,"The stock had soared by more than 50% from its November lows prior to the earnings report, so there was not much room for error. Yet, AZO performed and was rewarded with a new 52-week high yesterday, making it a Zacks Rank top performer.
"
1204,ORLY,"AutoZone's positive surprised followed good earnings reports from 2 of its competitors, Advance Auto Parts (AAP) and O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (ORLY  -  Free Report). AZO, AAP and ORLY are Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stocks classified in Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts.
"
1205,ORLY,"Video Games Still Selling
"
1206,ORLY,"Another retailer that has thrived in the face of the recession is GameStop Corporation (GME  -  Free Report).
"
1207,ORLY,"The company recently revised its fourth-quarter guidance to the high-end of the previous range. The world's largest video game reseller expects earnings to have totaled between $1.33 and $1.34 per share. Same-store sale are estimated to have risen by 9.6%.
"
1208,ORLY,"This year, GME thinks it can achieve comparable same-store sales growth between 4% and 6%, which would be impressive given the maturity of the current gaming console systems.
"
1209,ORLY,"Though the company did not provide an EPS projection, half of the 16 covering brokerage analysts raised their fiscal 2010 forecasts in response. The consensus earnings estimate now calls for fiscal 2010 profits to total $2.83 per share, which would be an 18% increase over fiscal 2009.
"
1210,ORLY,"GameStop is scheduled to report in mid-March.
"
1211,ORLY,"GME is a Zacks #2 Rank stock classified in Retail-Consumer Electronics.
"
1212,ORLY,"Restaurants Not As Bad As Feared
"
1213,ORLY,"On the other hand, some companies within the retail sector simply have fared better than analysts feared. This was the case with Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (CBRL  -  Free Report).
"
1214,ORLY,"The chain earned 81 cents during its fiscal second-quarter, 6 cents more than brokerage analysts had projected. Though that sounds good, revenues did decline. Same-store restaurant sales were 1.5% lower and same-store retail sales contracted 7%.
"
1215,ORLY,"CBRL's guidance, however, was good, all things considered. The company reiterated its fiscal 2009 guidance for earnings of $2.65-$3.00 per share.
"
1216,ORLY,"This was important because analysts had been lowering their full-year projections prior to the release of earnings. During the past few weeks, analysts have reversed course, and the consensus earnings estimate has risen by 12 cents to $2.68 per share.
"
1217,ORLY,"Brokerage analysts have also recently raised their full-year profit forecasts on Papa John's International, Inc. (PZZA) and Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH  -  Free Report).
"
1218,ORLY,"CBRL is Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy"") stock, whereas PZZA and TXRH are Zacks #2 Rank stocks. All 3 are classified in Retail-Restaurants.
"

Price and EPS Surprise O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Quote Factors to Drive Better-Than-Expected ResultsFor fourth-quarter 2017, O’Reilly Automotive projects diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.65-$2.75. While for fiscal 2017, the company expects the metric in the band of $11.82-$11.92.Further, for fiscal 2017, the company anticipates revenues of $8.9-$9 billion whereas the gross margin is estimated at 52.5-52.7% and the operating margin at 19-19.4%.O’Reilly Automotive is poised to benefit from store openings in the existing markets as well as the new, contiguous ones. In the first nine months of fiscal 2017, O'Reilly Automotive unveiled 162 new stores across all its markets.

O'Reilly Automotive’s dual-market stores are more dynamic and provide the company with a scope to operate in smaller markets and cater to a larger customer base.However, high fixed costs, increasing wage rates and growing investments have induced an expenditure rise for the company. Also, a huge inventory is hampering the short-term liquidity of O'Reilly Automotive in periods of low sales.For the soon-to-be-released quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales per weighted-average store stands at $440,000, down from the third quarter’s actual figure of $470,000.

1224,ORLY,"The world’s largest and the ultra-popular large cap ETF, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, has been enjoying its strong asset accumulation on the completion of its 25th anniversary. This is because it has become the first ETF with $300 billion in AUM. Though SPY’s inception date is Jan 22, 1993, it officially debuted on the American Stock Exchange on Jan 29, 1993 (read: Amazing ETF Strategies for Skyrocketing Markets).Inside The ETFSPY tracks the S&P 500 index and holds 505 stocks in its basket, with each security holding no more than 3.62%. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration.About one-fourth of the portfolio is tilted toward the information technology sector, which has fully emerged from the burst of the dot-com bubble and is flying higher in the current bullish market. Moreover, financials, health care, consumer discretionary and industrials, each of which accounts for a double-digit exposure, are also performing remarkably well.The ETF charges 9 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in heavy volume of 71.6 million shares a day on average. This ensures higher liquidity with a tight bid/ask spread, leading to lower trading costs for investors (see: all the Large Cap ETFs here).Factors Driving SPYThe U.S. stock market is in the midst of the second-longest bull run in history. Encouraging domestic and international fundamentals as well as better-than-expected corporate earnings are the major catalysts. This, coupled with Trump’s pro-growth agenda aimed at accelerating economic growth, reducing regulation, increasing spending, slashing taxes, and boosting jobs and corporate profits, are bolstering optimism in the economy.Since Trump’s win, the stock market rally has been the fourth largest since 1936, according to Goldman Sachs. Per Sam Stovall of CFRA Research, the S&P 500 rally during Trump’s first year is the third best since World War II, behind only President George H. W. Bush and President John F. Kennedy (read: Trump's First Year in Office: 5 Must-See ETF Charts).Further, a combination of other factors like rise in oil prices, a weak dollar and rounds of upbeat global economic data have bolstered the appetite for riskier assets in recent months. Good news flowing despite the global trade fears, political instability in Washington and geopolitical tension.As a result, SPY generated more than 545% returns over the past 25 years and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.

1227,ORLY,"The story narrating the retail sector’s transformation is now old. What is coming up is the holiday shopping season, the key yearly event for retailers. This money-making period brings with it a lot of enthusiasm as Christmas and Thanksgiving provide ample opportunities for retailers to make up for lost profits during the year.The holiday season, which accounts for a sizable chunk of yearly revenues and profits for retailers, generally extends from Thanksgiving to Christmas, also including the Black Friday and Cyber Monday events. This season can represent as much as 30% of annual sales for some retailers. Last year, holiday season accounted for nearly 20% of overall retail industry sales.Coming to the forecasts for this year’s holiday season, analysts remain optimistic on grounds of gradual wage growth, lower inflation, 16-year low unemployment rate, an uptick in the U.S. consumer sentiment to a 13-year high and a lift in economic activity post-hurricanes. Characterized by the aforementioned improvement in the consumer backdrop, alongside early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, price matching and free shipping on online purchases, the holiday season this November and December is likely to be a huge success.The nation's largest retail trade group, National Retail Federation (“NRF”) rightly projects retail sales for November and December (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to improve 3.6-4% to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion (or 3.6% growth) last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%. Additionally, the NRF projects online holiday sales to rise 7-10% to nearly $117 billion in November and December compared with a 9% improvement to $105 billion in 2015.Apart from the strong consumer confidence, the NRF predicts sales for the period to benefit from a longer holiday season as Christmas is falling on Monday this year and 32 days after Thanksgiving. This will give retailers one extra day of sales than normal, as well as benefit last-minute shoppers in the weekend before Christmas.Moreover, Deloitte projects holiday season sales to go up as much as 4.5%, while e-commerce sales are envisioned to improve 18-21%. The data compiled by Kantar suggests that the fourth-quarter holiday period sales are expected to jump 3.7%. Further, eMarketer forecasts holiday sales (November and December) to increase 3.1% to $923.15 billion, while retail e-commerce holiday season sales are anticipated to rise 16.6%.Further, with considerable growth in retail employment in recent months, the NRF expects to witness lesser seasonal hiring for this year’s holiday bash. It expects retailers to employ nearly 500,000-550,000 seasonal workers this year, a decline from last year’s 575,000 hiring.In this context, retailers including Macy’s, Inc. (M  -  Free Report), J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) and The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) have already put forward their hiring plans for the upcoming holiday season to cater to the holiday rush. Per media reports, Target intends to employ 100,000 associates, while Macy's will hire nearly 80,000 seasonal workers. Meanwhile, Gap is deploying seasonal associates at all stores including Gap, Gap Outlet, Banana Republic, Banana Republic Factory and Old Navy across the United States and Canada. J. C. Penney will hire nearly 40,000 seasonal workers.This apart, there are some trends that are likely to rule the retail space in the long term. Let’s take a glance.Long-Term Trends Rule the SectorWith the increasing influence of technology on the buying patterns of consumers, the general retail sector trends set to rule the future are:Omni-channel Eliminates Retail Pure-Plays: Omni-channel, which emerged as an option to offer more touch points and multiple channels to customers, has gone beyond this simple definition. The cross-channel sales mantra now requires every retailer, whether online or brick and mortar, to bring together both physical and digital systems to serve omni-customers. As a result, retail pure-plays, both online and offline, are now turning omni-channel. This means online retailers are coming up with physical stores or pop-up shops to satisfy customers and vice versa.Here, the prime objective is to bridge the gap between a physical and an ecommerce store of any particular retailer. For example, Macy’s Inc. makes the most of its omni-channel presence with services like click-and-collect. Additionally, the company’s site allows customers to access the inventory at its local stores, so that they can check the availability of a product at the nearest store, purchase it and have it picked up or arrange for same-day delivery. In another online feature, Macy’s mobile app allows customers to scan bar codes of products at stores and check online reviews, promotions and the like.Growth of Off-Price Retailing: A recent trend shows that apart from e-commerce, the rise of off-price retailing is making competition worse for retailers. Off-price retailers like TJX Companies Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report), Ross Stores Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report), Nordstrom’s (JWN  -  Free Report) Nordstrom Rack, Five Below Inc. (FIVE  -  Free Report), Macy’s Backstage, Bloomingdale’s, Kohl’s and others are doing a good job, unlike department stores and specialty clothing retailers. Customers today are looking for value, which means reasonable and quality merchandise. Off-price retailers offer immense value as they purchase their inventory at a discount. In contrast, department and specialty retailers have to resort to mark downs from time to time in order to clear their inventory. This has led to a major shift in consumer preferences to off-priced merchandise, making department and specialty store irrelevant to consumers.Expanded Payments Options: With retail undergoing a sea change, the modes of payment have also evolved dramatically. The increasing use of mobile payments and the EMV mandate in the U.S. induced retailers to remodel their payment terminals to accept multiple options like mobile payments and EMV cards. Some of the available payment solutions are PayPal Here Chip Card reader, Mercury and Poynt, which equip retailers with different payment accepting options. These devices or hardware ensure compatibility with iOS and Android devices, magnetic cards, EMV, QR codes and NFC payments such as Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay.Technology-Friendly Brick & Mortar Stores: With shoppers becoming increasingly tech savvy, brick and mortar stores need to leave their old-fashioned layouts behind and improvise by adopting innovative in-store technologies. With rising demand for convenient delivery and alternative payment solutions, all at affordable prices, technology is bound to play a key role in growth. This is because consumers are becoming increasingly dependent on their mobile phones and other digital devices to buy goods.The simplest way to execute this is through in-store mobile devices, which enable customers to make payments, see product demonstrations, gather information and connect to social networks. Further, these in-store devices can help customers locate the products they are looking for. Not only this, retailers have developed mobile apps that will track customers as they shop and send them tailored offers on products in sections they are in, recommend items based on past purchases, or allow them to program automated shopping lists.In-store technologies that customers look for these days include mobile point of sales, price checkers, self-checkout payment lanes, information kiosks, and digital signage, among others. Other innovative technologies to engage customers both in store and elsewhere are smart shelves, Wi-Fi hot spots, point-of-sales (POS) systems, virtual storefronts and endless aisles.Shrinking Store Sizes: Changing consumer preferences have led to an increase in smaller stores. Even ‘big box’ retailers are now concentrating on smaller store formats, which accommodate more specific merchandise according to consumer preferences. We have already seen a transition relating to this idea, with companies like Target and Best Buy Co. Inc. BBY focusing on smaller store formats.The main reason for this shift in consumer preference is the convenience and accessibility that small stores provide. Consumers are looking to make quick purchases these days. Finding the desired products by wandering through endless aisles of big stores seems cumbersome and time taking. Today, smaller stores with specialized selections are preferred as finding desired products in little time is easier in these. Additionally, smaller stores are cost effective right from inception to managing operating costs to finding space in urban environments.Growth of Retail-centric Apps and Services, Social Shopping: As already said, consumers are looking for speedy deliveries apart from multiple buying options. This has increased the number of retail-centric apps that merchants are adopting in order to stay competitive. Further, retailers are looking for third-party solutions to fulfill the demands of customers. Retailers have also been using social media platforms to advertise their brands, launch products and campaigns, talk to customers and even make merchandising decisions.Most companies are now also selling their products through social networking sites like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, which have shopping functionalities. Some retailers that have already adopted the Like2Buy platform on Instagram are Nordstrom, Aeropostale and Target. Moreover, retailers are increasingly seeking the assistance of third parties to quickly get their products delivered.Merging Online and Offline Data to Track Shoppers: The growing use of multiple shopping channels has made it imperative for retailers to collectively study their online and offline data in order to analyze the buying habits of consumers. This gives a more comprehensive picture of their shopping practice.A study of online and offline data has revealed that shoppers usually browse for products online before finally making purchases in stores. Such data can be helpful in tracking the purchase habits of customers and executing effectively on their omni-channel initiatives.Taking Charge of Value Chain: The success mantra in modern retail is to provide a compelling shopping experience, which is only possible by taking full control of one’s value chain i.e., from the creation of products to their consumption. We expect this strategy to gain importance, with retailers focusing more on fulfillment practices, product distribution, speed and convenience of delivering products to consumers, and more.Growth of Retail in Emerging Markets: Having tapped most of the potential in the domestic market, retailers have started venturing into emerging markets. Most retail chains are witnessing growing demand for their products in countries like Brazil, the Middle East, China and India. Retailers planning to venture into these markets include the likes of The Gap Inc., The Clorox Company CLX, Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL  -  Free Report), V.F. Corp. (VFC  -  Free Report) and Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report).Consolidation in Retail Industry: The U.S. retail industry has been witnessing further consolidation, with companies merging with peers to become larger and vying to lead the markets they serve. Some of the recent mergers include that of Dollar Tree Inc. DLTR with Family Dollar, which has given rise to a mega U.S. discount retailer. Also, apparel retailer, Ascena Retail Group Inc. ASNA bought the ANN Taylor parent ANN Inc., which has strengthened the position of the former in the women’s apparel market.Also, the recent liquidation of sporting goods chains like Sports Authority, Sport Chalet and Golfsmith has left gaps to intensify competition. Such consolidation in the sporting goods space is benefiting other participants like DICK’S Sporting Goods Inc. DKS and Big 5 Sporting Goods Inc. BGFV.Localization of Products Mix: Localization requires tailoring of products and stores to satisfy the needs of native communities. This trait is expected to prove most beneficial this year as it is likely to attract more customers. One example of such a retailer that tailors its merchandise for respective stores is O’Reilly Automotive Inc. (ORLY  -  Free Report).As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the retail industry over the long term. But what about investing in the space right now?Check out our latest Retail Industry Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now.

1229,ORLY,"O'Reilly Automotive Inc. (ORLY  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 earnings after the market closes on Oct 25. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in two of the trailing four quarters, with a negative average surprise of 0.38%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for the forthcoming announcement.Factors Influencing This QuarterO’Reilly expects earnings per share in the range of $3.10-$3.20 for third-quarter 2017. The company anticipates consolidated comparable store sales to increase 1-3% in the reported quarter.The company expects earnings per share in the band of $11.77-$11.87 for the full year 2017, down from the previous expectation of $12.05-$12.15. Consolidated comparable store sales are expected to increase in the range of 1-2% during the year.Revenues are expected to be in the band of $8.9-$9.1 billion as compared with the previous expectation of $9.1-$9.3 billion. For 2017, the gross margin guidance is anticipated in the range of 52.5-52.9% and operating margin is expected to be 19.1-19.5% compared with the previous estimate of 20.1-20.5%.Being concentrated in a few regions in the United States, O’Reilly’s business is linked to the changes in the economic and weather conditions of these regions thus impacting its sales to a considerable extent.High inventory in current assets is likely to affect the short-term liquidity of the company in periods of low sales. Adding to its woes, O’Reilly has witnessed a rise in SG&A expenses in the first six months of 2017 to $1.47 billion. The company expects this rise to persist given the continued pressure from increasing wage rates, higher expected medical cost, additional investments in the company’s internal information system capabilities as well as costs to convert the bond stores acquired in December 2016.Nevertheless, O’Reilly’s is aggressively undertaking acquisitions in existing markets and new, contiguous markets, which are expected to boost sales. Also, the company is opening new stores for greater penetration. Along with this, the company pursues an aggressive share repurchase policy, which continues to boost earnings per share.O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that O’Reilly is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for O’Reilly is currently pegged at 0.00%.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: O’Reilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Price PerformanceO’Reilly has lost 26.3% over a year underperforming the 17.3% decline of the industry it belongs to. Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks in the auto industry you can consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Autoliv, Inc.

1230,ORLY,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (ORLY  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, O’Reilly Automotive has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.5, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.4. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts O’Reilly Automotive’s current PE ratio much below its midpoint (which is 24.6) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 28.6. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that O’Reilly Automotive has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 16.8, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for O’Reilly Automotive’s stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, O’Reilly Automotive has a P/S ratio of about 2.2. This is somewhat lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is considerably below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, O’Reilly Automotive currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes ORLY a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for O’Reilly Automotive is 1.2, a level that is marginally lower than the industry average of 1.3. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, ORLY is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though O’Reilly Automotive might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of F. This gives ORLY a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. While the consensus estimate for the current quarter has fallen about 1.6% in the past two months, the full year estimate has inched up 0.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Price and Consensus  O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Price and Consensus | O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineO’Reilly Automotive is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 26% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1232,ORLY,"O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY  -  Free Report) is one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment, and accessories in the US, serving both professional service providers and do-it-yourself customers.Since I'm a Chicago boy who grew up with NAPA auto parts stores, I've still never set foot in an O'Reilly shop and was surprised to find they now operate 4,935 stores in 47 states. And, as further testament to my ignorance of this great business story, they started in Springfield, MO in 1957, going public in 1993.  History of a Great American Immigrant SuccessWhile ORLY is a Zacks #5 Rank Strong Sell because estimates dropped sharply after weak sales comps in July, I want to share a little about this amazing growth story in case you were as ignorant as I was. We'll come back to the company and stock outlook in a moment.I borrow this little bit of history from the company website...Michael Byrne O'Reilly immigrated to America in 1849, escaping from the hard times of the potato famine, which struck Ireland in 1845-46. Settling in St. Louis, he worked his way through school to earn a law degree, and then pursued a career as a title examiner. His son, Charles Francis O'Reilly, attended college in St. Louis and went to work in 1914 as a traveling salesman for Fred Campbell Auto Supply in St. Louis.By 1924, Charles had become familiar with the Springfield area, having traveled by train to sell auto parts throughout the territory. He recognized the region as an area of growth and opportunity and asked to be transferred there. By 1932, he had become manager of Link Motor Supply in Springfield. One of his sons, Charles H. (Chub) O'Reilly, had also joined the company. Together they provided the leadership and management that made Link the predominant auto parts store in the area.In 1957, Link planned a reorganization, which would have included the retirement of 72-year-old Charles F. O'Reilly, and the transfer of C. H. O'Reilly to Kansas City. Since neither agreed with these plans, they made the decision to form their own company, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.(end of history excerpt from O'Reilly website)From those humble beginnings, father and son created a business legacy that an any immigrant patriarch would be proud of.Now, let's get back to why this company, whose shares have soared from $80 to $290 in four years (summer 2012 to summer 2016), are down 29% YTD. My colleague Neena Mishra wrote about ORLY as the Bull of the Day back in July after their sales comps report and before their Q2 earnings report. Here's what she said then...Shares Plunge After Weak Sales ResultsOn July 5, the company reported its Q2 comparable store sales results, which were much weaker-than-expected.  The stock fell almost 20% and is down about 34% year-to-date (actually trading down to $170 after that report).“After exiting the first quarter and entering April on an improved sales trend, we faced a more challenging sales environment than we expected for the remainder of the quarter. Our second quarter comparable store sales results of 1.7% represent an improvement over our first quarter, but fell below our guidance of 3% to 5%, due to what we believe were continued headwinds from a second consecutive mild winter and overall weak consumer demand,” said the CEO.Falling EstimatesAnalysts have slashed their estimates for the company after weak guidance.  Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and next fiscal year have fallen to $11.83 per share and $13.10 per share from $12.26 and $13.73 respectively, 30 days back.The company has missed in three out of past four quarters. The average negative quarterly surprise for the past four quarters is 2.3%.The Bottom LineAuto parts suppliers are facing increasing headwinds due to rising competition from Amazon. But there are several other factors that have resulted in bearish outlook for the industry. In addition to two consecutive mild winters, better vehicle quality, a smaller number of older cars and weak consumer demand from certain demographic groups have resulted in weak demand for auto parts.(end of Neena Mishra's report on July 17)ORLY actually delivered a 7% EPS beat on July 26, but cut the outlook for the remainder of the year.O’Reilly Automotive reported adjusted earnings of $3.10 per share in the second quarter of 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.90. Net income improved 10% to $283 million (12.3% of sales) from $258 million (11.8% of sales) in the second quarter of 2016.Quarterly revenues went up 5% to $2.29 billion from $2.18 billion a year ago. Revenues were almost on par with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Comparable store sales increased 1.7% in the reported quarter compared with a 4.3% rise in the prior-year quarter.GuidanceFor the third quarter of 2017, O’Reilly projects earnings per share in the range of $3.10-$3.20. The company expects consolidated comparable store sales to increase 1–3%.For full-year 2017, the company expects earnings per share in the band of $11.77-$11.87 compared with the previous expectation of $12.05-$12.15.O’Reilly projects consolidated comparable store sales increase in the range of 1-2% during the year. The company anticipates revenues in the band of $8.9-$9.1 billion compared with the previous expectation of $9.1-$9.3 billion. For 2017, the gross margin guidance is in the range of 52.5-52.9% and operating margin is expected to be 19.1-19.5% compared with the previous estimate of 20.1-20.5%.O’Reilly reiterated its capital expenditure to be within the range of $470–$500 million. However, for 2017, it expects free cash flow to be between $830 million and $880 million compared with the range of $930-$980 million expected earlier.Cooker's bottom line: In her bottom line, Neena Mishra noted the rise of competition from Amazon and better quality vehicles as threats to the auto parts companies' terrific run in this bull market. As an Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) shareholder, I'm hearing that auto buffs are able to order any part, at the best price, anywhere around the world and the shipping is minimal using Alipay. While we may not be at a cycle top for the economy and retail, the auto parts stores may have seen their top and should be avoided until the earnings estimates stop going down and start to head back up.Disclosure: I own BABA shares for the Zacks TAZR Trader service.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.
