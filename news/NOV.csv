As breakouts go, small cap Kemet carried some drawbacks.First, the cup-with-handle base corrected 50%. Deep bases have a climb that can wear a stock out by the time it reaches a correct buy point. Success is more likely when a breakout comes from a base 20% to 33% deep.Second, volume in the handle was high in two of the sessions. Generally, it's best if volume is low in a handle.Third, the stock showed an ugly gap down in the left side of the pattern. The 35% drop in heavy volume Nov. 2 came despite a strong quarter.

4,NOV,"Hindsight may be 20/20, but with some studying, your stockpicking foresight can get pretty good, too.Foreseeing the move by a stock with terrific fundamentals, a No. 1 ranking in its industry, and loads of fund sponsorship, before it happens is crucial. If such a stock breaks out with force, then you're more likely to grab shares at the proper buy point.Think of the ""buy point"" as the ground floor of a potential elevator-like advance to new highs. It's not enough to just buy the right stock. You have to buy the right stock in the right way at the right time.Those who read Investor's Corner regularly have a strong command of one of the most important patterns in growth investing: the cup with handle. The pattern allows you to be consistent in your buying. You're essentially entering a stock only when it's reached the point in which it can rise fast in a relatively short time frame.Human nature hasn't changed. Greed and fear still drive the market. So the cup with handle and other useful patterns of investor behavior will continue to pop up among IBD's wide span of features and screens designed to help you find and buy great stocks at the right time.Make a habit of going through the stocks presented in IBD 50, Big Cap 20, Stock Spotlight, Sector Leaders, IPO Leaders and Stocks Near A Buy Zone. Most of these can be accessed via Stock Lists on the home page at Investors.com.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAre you completely new to chart analysis, or want to bring your skills up a notch? Check out the real-time annotations done in Leaderboard, which debuted in July 2011.A buy point is a price level at which a stock is most likely to begin a significant advance. It also points to an area of the chart that offers the least amount of resistance to price progress.Where that point is depends on the type of base the stock has formed, whether a cup with handle, a cup without handle, a flat base or double bottom.This is the critical moment. Identifying the correct buy point can make all the difference between a successful investment and a losing trade. And before you buy, always check that the Market Pulse table, updated every day in The Big Picture column, shows the current outlook as ""Market in confirmed uptrend.""Let's look first at one of the easiest buy points to spot: one from a cup without handle.In this type of base, the stock declines as much as 30% to 33% from a recent 52-week or all-time high, then starts to recover in a process that takes at least six weeks to complete. Once the ascent begins, there are no significant pullbacks, or anything that might be considered a handle.The buy point on this pattern is easy: 10 cents above the peak in the left side of the pattern.The flat base isn't much different. When the stock recovers and is 10 cents above the base's prior highest point, that's when you jump in.As the stock approaches new highs — building the right side of the cup pattern — the stock suddenly pulls back moderately in price. This pullback is up to 15% in depth but can be much less. According to IBD research, most handles in the most successful stocks show a drop of no more than 8% to 12% from the handle's highest price.Also, a good handle will form within the upper half of the base. How can you tell? Sometimes you can see it visually. Maybe the handle began forming when the stock was just a few points below the cup's left-side high.When it's difficult to tell, what should you do?Use the midpoint test. Add the highest price and lowest price within the cup, then divide by 2. Do the same with the handle.If the handle's midpoint is higher than the base's midpoint, a breakout has a better chance of succeeding. The stock has already shown strong demand by climbing off its lows, plowing past prior price levels in which some shareholders had bought and immediately harbored paper losses. As a stock rebounds, these folks eagerly sell and get rid of the stock.Use the highest level in the handle area and add 10 cents to derive the buy point.Take Seacoast Banking (SBCF) as an example from 2016. After the Donald Trump presidential election win on Nov. 8, bank stocks took off. Florida-based Seacoast joined the bandwagon with a gusher of a move from Nov. 9 to 14, rising as much as 9% during that time frame and clearing an 18.05 handle buy point on a nine-week cup pattern.The midpoint of the cup was 16.83 (15.85 + 17.80 divided by 2). The handle's midpoint of 17.38 (16.82 + 17.95 divided by 2) was higher, so it passed. As seen in Seacoast's case, sometimes, the handle may begin forming slightly above the cup's left-side high.The double-bottom base is a bit different. The stock forms a cup pattern, but makes another correction before it reaches new highs. The second bottom usually is lower than the first.The pattern has a W-shape. The buy point is the middle intraday peak of the W-shape plus 10 cents. Keep in mind that a handle may also form, presenting an alternative entry.No matter what type of base it is, the stock should pass its buy point in heavy volume. That gives you the confidence big investors are buying as well.How much volume should you expect? Trading should swell at least 40% above the stock's 50-day average volume.If you're watching a stock during the trading session and aren't sure if volume is so strong, check the stock quotes at Investors.com. The volume percentage change is continually calculated.Nursing care facility operator VistaCare went public in December 2002 and by April 2003, it had formed a cup base with a high handle (1). The highest price in the handle was 19.Within the handle, the stock fell 11.6%, in range with the typical handle on a cup base during a bull market. Meanwhile, stocks were taking off and leading growth names were bursting out of bases after the market followed through on March 17, 2003, Day 4 of a new rally attempt. On that day, the Nasdaq soared 3.9% in higher turnover; the S&P 500 gushed 3.5% higher.VistaCare broke out on April 28, 2003, in heavy volume, then held above the 19.10 buy point two weeks later during a pullback that became a bullish reversal (2).On the breakout day, VistaCare showed decent ratings  on IBD Stock Checkup despite being such a young new public company: a 72 Composite, 80 EPS, 78 RS and A- for Accumulation/Distribution.Investors who bought at the correct buy point stood to more than double their money by year's end.(A version of this column was originally published in the April 16, 2010, edition of IBD.

Qualcomm announced that acquisition in October 2016. The deal has received antitrust clearance from eight of the nine required government regulatory bodies around the world, with only China's Ministry of Commerce remaining.The Qualcomm-NXP deal has been held up by trade disputes between the U.S. and China, as well as Chinese concerns that the merger could harm domestic companies.The semiconductor sector has been performing poorly this month. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, known as SOX, tumbled below its 200-day moving average on Wednesday. Except for a few days two months ago, the chip index hasn't been below that level in two years.The SOX rebounded on Thursday, climbing 0.8% and ending the day above its 200-day line.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Intel Downgraded, Lam Research Upgraded, Nvidia Started At BuyNvidia Gets Price-Target Hike; Intel Downgraded On CEO TurmoilChip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News

6,NOV,"In the cup with handle or double bottom, success of the breakout depends on the way a stock rises and falls within the base.A third pattern shows that a stock can choose to take neither path before its big move north.Rather than go on an uptrend or downtrend, the stock moves sideways for weeks or months. This action — or lack of it — becomes what's called the flat base.This pattern often forms after a stock breaks out of a cup or other base, gains ground for a few weeks, then stalls. Why? The market might not be ready to rally strongly, or is still weak.A flat base reflects unusual strength. Instead of bending lower, it holds steady in price. This action tells you the stock wants to run higher.When the market finally begins to rally, the stock explodes out of its crouch position.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA flat base must be at least five weeks in length. It can last much longer than that. Within the base, the percentage decline from the stock's high to low usually ranges within 10% to 15%. When the stock drops within the base, institutional investors step in to shore up the stock. The stock doesn't fall much more because investors overall feel comfortable with the stock's current price.When should you buy? Wait until the stock rises 10 cents above the highest price in the flat base. Sometimes the price high is found on the left end of the base. In other cases, the high is in the middle of the base or on the right. Just add 10 cents to that price to find the pivot. Buy it as close as possible to that price point. Don't chase it if it's already more than 5% above the pivot.Oracle (ORCL), the database and e-commerce software giant, muscled out of a seven-month cup with handle on Sept. 3, 1999 (1). In five sessions, the stock rose 18% and hit new highs. A fine start.The market suffered choppy action. From Sept. 13 the Nasdaq tumbled 7% over the next two weeks, yet held up above its 50-day moving average. Two weeks later, it strode to a new high. But the next two weeks saw the Nasdaq fall 10%, and briefly below the 50-day.Oracle dug in its heels. Growth stocks tend to fall 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 times the correction in the major indexes. Not Oracle. The stock held up above 40 during most of its seven-week flat base (2). On an intraday basis, it was no more than 15% below its high.The high on the left side of the flat base was 46.94. Add a dime to get the buy point. Oracle briefly poked above the flat base's 47.04 buy point during the week ended Oct. 15, 1999, but stumbled. A week later, Oracle dropped more than 8% below the prime entry, ushering the golden rule of investing. Some breakouts turn out to be fakeouts.However, one day after the Nasdaq staged a follow-through day on Oct. 28, Oracle broke out for real. It rallied on heavy volume for seven straight sessions (3). A follow-though is a critical signal that the market has possibly bottomed and is ready for a significant turn higher.At the time, Oracle scored an excellent 95 Earnings Per Share Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, and an A for SMR (Sales + Margins + Return on equity). The stock's relative strength line, painted in blue in every IBD daily and weekly chart, shoved into new high ground. The enterprise software group was ranked third among 197 groups.Oracle gained 273% through its March 2000 peak.Here are three more good flat bases that formed in 2016 and 2017 and yielded strong breakouts:Align Technology (ALGN), breakout on Feb. 21, 2017: The nine-week flat base began on Dec. 19, 2016, when the invisible braces marketer peaked at 102.10. Total decline within the base: 13%. Heavy volume was largely absent as Align cleared the 102.20 buy point, yet check out the strong gain on Feb. 1 following quarterly results.Align gapped up 6% and turnover boomed 272% above average. That was a clear sign of strong institutional buying.You can see historical charts of Align and all other U.S. stocks by going to MarketSmith, IBD's advanced charting and stock screening service.Control4 (CTRL), breakout on July 12, 2017: Volume powered 305% above the 50-day moving average on breakout day. In small-cap stocks, volume often rockets double or triple average levels. Total decline within the base: 13.5%.Notice on a weekly chart how as the base formed, the 10-week moving average contained the stock's move.The 10-week line is drawn in red on both an IBD chart and in MarketSmith.Arista Networks (ANET), breakouts on Nov. 14, 2016, and on Feb. 17, 2017: In the first flat base, Arista took the minimum five weeks to complete the base, which sat on top of a much larger first-stage construction. The proper buy point was 87.72. Total decline within the base: 10%.In the second flat base, Arista vaulted out of the base in a breakaway gap past 103.10. On Feb. 17, the data center networking play opened at 111, 7.7% above the proper buy point. Given the huge opening move and strong fundamentals, it would have been perfectly acceptable to buy right at the open. Arista finished the session at 119.06. Turnover mushroomed to 5.9 million shares, 609% above average. Total decline within the six-week base: 15.2%.(A version of this column was originally published in the March 26, 2002, edition of IBD.

11,NOV,"Even Indiana Jones would probably have given up.Howard Carter and his team dug through hundreds of boulders in Egypt's Valley of the Kings for about five arduous years, looking for the lost tomb of Tutankhamun. His research told him the tomb was there. But no one — not even he — could find it thousands of years after the child king's death. Carter's once enthusiastic financial backer was losing patience.But in one of history's greatest examples of persistence with a massive payoff, Carter removed rubble that revealed the entrance of the tomb on Nov. 25, 1922. His discovery is still considered the most significant archaeological feat in modern times, Tarek El-Awady, curator of the ""King Tut: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh"" exhibit, told IBD in an email sent from Egypt. ""Howard Carter's discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun still stands as the greatest discovery made by man,"" El-Awady said.The valuable treasures Carter found still draw crowds to museums around the world. But what Carter did to achieve his goals and persevere is equally priceless, including:Carter was never formally trained as an archaeologist or even a scientist. He was the son of an artist and an artist himself. But he learned about archaeology on the job after he was hired at the age of 17 to draw Egyptian artifacts for a wealthy family. His skill as an artist won him a spot traveling to Egypt alongside some of the best archaeologists of all time, including Percy Newberry. From them he learned how to carefully excavate and catalog a dig's artifacts. This knowledge, paired with his previous training as an artist, created a powerful blend of skill sets that few in the world possessed. ""He learned a lot on the job. You can't learn it until you're standing there having to do it,"" Pearce Creasman, associate professor and director of the Egyptian Expedition at the University of Arizona told IBD. ""He put all the pieces together and learned from all these people and added his special skill (of drawing) to the mix.""Carter's skill set was so unique that he commanded respect on digs and was later named chief inspector for the Egyptian Antiquities Service — a position that would set him up for success later.From Newberry and others, Carter learned the importance of being highly detailed in cataloging everything he found. His journals of findings are richly illustrated in painstaking detail — a standard practice in archaeology today — but perhaps seen as excessive or even obsessive in the day.To capture every detail, Carter developed a breakthrough system of classifying digs that culminated with the King Tut discovery. Every group of objects found was designated with a number from one to 620, Nicholas Reeves and John Taylor wrote in ""Howard Carter Before Tutankhamun."" Smaller groups of items found were then notated with single or multiple letters, such as a, b, c, aa, bb, cc and aaa, bbb, ccc.Again, this was Carter applying his talents to something he learned from someone else. Carter ""learned excavation with British excavator Flinders Petrie, who taught him the importance of small finds,"" Brian Fagen, an archaeologist and emeritus professor of anthropology at University of California, Santa Barbara, told IBD. ""Researchers working on the tomb still consult his notebooks, which are an exceptional record, far ahead of their time.""Carter closely observed and took valuable tips from ""experts."" But just as importantly, he knew what to ignore, too. Theodore Davis, a wealthy U.S. attorney and successful archaeologist whom Carter was working with, declared in the early 1910s that all the great finds in the Valley of the Kings already had been found.Carter disregarded Davis' ""expert opinion."" Carter's own experience proved to be just as precious, if not more than Davis'. Carter ""was a maverick operator, stubborn, ambitious and brimming with self-confidence,"" William Cross, author of ""Carnarvon, Carter and Tutankhamun Revisited: The Hidden Truths and Doomed Relationships,"" told IBD. ""His know-how, spark and ingenuity convinced him that the tomb of Tutankhamun was somewhere in the Valley of the Kings.""After Davis gave up on the dig, Carter had to find another backer to fund a continued search.Carter quit his stable job as an inspector for the Egyptian archaeological service in 1905 to free up time for his search. Some of the hardest years of his life followed.Carter's quest for the tomb was almost an obsession. But he knew that to complete it he would need financial backing. After Davis left the quest, Carter teamed up with a new financial supporter, wealthy Briton Lord Carnarvon. The difficulty was convincing him to keep writing the checks even as Carter found nothing year after year.When Carnarvon grew frustrated and was about to cut off Carter's financing, Carter modified his approach to appeal to Carnarvon's sense as an investor. In those times, archaeologist teams kept half of what they found and returned the remainder to Egypt. Carter knew the cost of financing another dig was a fraction of the reward possible if they found the tomb. He explained the economics to Carnarvon and said if he wouldn't pay to keep digging, Carter would from his own pocket. The pitch was so compelling — blending economic reasoning with scientific precision — it convinced Carnarvon to keep writing the checks. ""He got one guy to buy in and sometimes that's all it takes, is one person to make something really big happen,"" Creasman said.Carter's sharp tongue might have made it difficult to sell his idea, but he ""was smart enough and eloquent enough in tales about Tutankhamun's lost tomb to be enticed and trusted by millionaire investors looking to cash in on antiquities, and the glint of gold to come,"" Cross said.Just imagining your success isn't going to do much. Success comes to those who visualize how to get there. Carter provides an example. While still antiquities inspector, Carter looked back and examined all the successful digs in the Valley of the Kings. Not just his, but everyone's. Most archaeologists randomly dug. But Carter applied his detailed grid-block system of analysis to past discoveries. This allowed him to build a holistic picture in his mind of what was explored, and what wasn't. By ""retroactively applying to all the work done in the Valley of the Kings … he knew areas that other people had missed,"" Creasman said. By studying past records, Carter knew others ""dug 10 feet to the right and 20 feet to the left, and 15 feet over here. They had not dug everything, everywhere.""Perhaps it was another example of how Carter elevated archaeology by blending facets of his unique mind as an artist would. Carter's attention to detail allowed him to visualize what parts of the valley were ""clean territory — an area no one has ever excavated,"" Creasman said.""He had this map in his head, along with internal motivation,"" Creasman said. ""I haven't done everything I can do until I've done this. When people obsess on a thing, they can't let it go.""Carter loved his life's work — ever since starting out as an artist. That passion drove him to keep looking and learning. Others who were purely driven by money would have given up. ""Working in the Valley of the Kings is like magic, the silence and the absolute power of the cliffs surrounding the valley makes every Egyptologist willing to spend his entire life working and working, running after a dream that might or might not ever come true,"" El-Awady said.His passion yielded success even when he wasn't trying. In addition to exploring and drawing, Carter loved horses and riding the west bank of Luxor, El-Awady says. ""One of his greatest discoveries happened when the leg of his horse got stuck in a hole that turned out to be the symbolic burial of King Mentuhotep II (Dynasty 11),"" El-Awady said. ""In this tomb, the beautiful statue of the king was discovered.""Carter brought ""long-term planning, the need for a disciplined approach to finding and excavating sites, and the necessity for recording everything with photographs, drawings, or in writing,"" Fagen said. ""He really was one of the first modern archaeologists, with a unique eye for detail, and always a mind for the long-term outcome of the project.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.Apply your unique interests and abilities to your profession to reinvent what's possible.Overcame: Many failed attempts to find King Tut's tomb and loss of financial backing""All we have to do is to peel the shrines like an onion, and we will be with the king himself.""
"
12,NOV,"With recent Dropbox (DBX) and Spotify Technology (SPOT) IPOs, here's one simple lesson to be learned from the initial public offerings of Facebook (FB), Alibaba (BABA), Snap (SNAP) and Square (SQ): Big-buzz IPOs don't always live up to the hype — at least not at first.X Buying a stock right when it has an IPO is a high-risk proposition, regardless of how convincing the hype may seem.Facebook, Alibaba, Snap and Square all headed south from their second week of trading, providing clear examples of why you should wait for a new IPO to form its first base before you invest.It's an important rule to keep in mind when evaluating IPO stocks like Dropbox, which just went public in March, and Spotify, which started trading in April.The Spotify IPO is technically referred to as a direct listing. This approach allows Spotify to avoid having bankers set the initial share price in a typical order book creation. The music streaming service has hit many of the right notes since its IPO and is now 6% a recent breakout.Dropbox had been on the same trajectory as Spotify, but that changed this week. After a heavy volume breakout on June 14, Dropbox's stock has dropped sharply over the last four days. The cloud-based storage stock is now back below its 34.93 buy point.The same lessons about how to buy IPO stocks apply to top 2017 new issues like Floor & Decor (FND), Canada Goose (GOOS), Smart Global (SGH) and Roku (ROKU).Zscaler (ZS) and Carbon Black (CBLK), both of which went public this year, have also had their fair share of post-IPO volatility.  Canada Goose has been one of the top IPO stocks in recent months, but it has also run into some selling pressure this week.The bottom line with all newer IPO stocks is that if you are going to trade them, you need to always follow a sound set of sell rules.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFrom its first weekly close on May 18, 2012, Facebook sank 54% over the next four months. Snap plunged 48% from its first weekly close on March 3 of this year until apparently finding a bottom in August. And after closing out its first week of trading on Nov. 20, 2015, Square fell 37% over the next 10 weeks.Keep in mind that if you take a 50% loss, you need a 100% gain just to get back to break-even.Alibaba fared better when it went public in September 2014, declining just 12% from its first weekly close while forming an IPO base.It did offer a buying opportunity when it broke out of that pattern in October, but the Chinese internet giant soon proved another point about new stocks: They can be quite volatile.After quickly rising as much as 20%, Alibaba reversed course, falling 47% from November 2014 until finding a bottom in September 2015. The stock continued to struggle and didn't really get going until it launched its current run with a breakout at the beginning of last year.Although many investors chose to ignore it amid all the buzz, Facebook flashed a serious warning sign before its IPO: a sharp slowdown in earnings growth.In the three quarters prior to going public, the company's EPS gains slowed from 100% to 25% to 9%. And in Facebook's first two reports as a publicly traded company, it posted 0% growth.It wasn't until about 14 months after its initial public offering that Team Zuckerberg finally found its mobile mojo and delivered a return to growth with earnings of 13 cents a share on a 58% gain in revenue for Q2 2013.Facebook bolted out of a double bottom on that report and made an impressive multi-year run, although the new Cambridge Analytica data breach has hammered Facebook's stock.Interestingly, it also took Square about 14 months of roller-coaster action before it found its market legs and began to climb. It's no coincidence that the provider of payment-processing software started to climb as its earnings growth started to improve.Square pulled back last November after a sharp climb, but has bounced back to form two new bases and and launch two new breakouts. The stock is now over 10% above its most recent buy point.Premium outerwear maker Canada Goose is yet another example of why it's important to give a new IPO time to set up. Since going public in March 2017, the Toronto-based stock has formed multiple bases, including a cup with handle that it broke out of in November. Canada Goose soared 41% last week on earnings, but has reversed somewhat to give back a piece of those huge gains this week.Specialty retailer Floor & Decor, which went public last April, pulled back after forming an IPO base, but went on to build a 26-week long cup with handle. Since then the stock has struggled to make a sustained upward move and is now testing support at its 10-week line.And then there was Snap.After heading due south for months after it went public, the Snapchat parent seemed to have found a bottom in mid-August, then popped in early February on its Q4 earnings report. But Snap has once again broken down and is now trying to find support at its 10-week moving average, which has fallen below its 40-week line. In addition to its chart action, keep in mind that unlike Alibaba, Facebook and Square, Snap has no profits.So while Snap may go on to make a nice run, the jury is still out.Buying a brand-new IPO can be tempting, but it can also be costly and painful.As the examples above show, you can significantly reduce your risk and still reap plenty of rewards if you follow these three steps:In other words, just like with any stock, make an IPO prove its fundamental and technical strength before you invest.If the pre-IPO buzz turns into a bust, you'll be glad you stayed out. And if the hype turns out to be true, you'll still have plenty of chances to profit.RELATED:Track Today's Top-Performing IPOsUse This Buying Checklist To Review A Stock Before You BuyNetflix, Nvidia Reveal 3 Telltale Clues To Look For In Stock Charts

13,NOV,"Dow Jones futures tumbled Tuesday morning after President Donald Trump said he has instructed the U.S. Trade Representative to identify another $200 billion in Chinese goods for tariffs, ratcheting up the U.S.-China trade war. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures also retreated.The Dow Jones industrial average fell for a fifth straight session on Monday on China trade war fears, while the S&P 500 index dipped. But the Nasdaq composite edged higher, just below record levels. Several techs broke out Monday, including Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Box (BOX), Autodesk (ADSK) and recent China IPO Sogou (SOGO).President Trump late Monday said in a White House statement that the 10% duties on $200 billion in Chinese goods would go forward if Beijing doesn't change its ""unfair practices"" and ""insists on going forward with the new tariffs that it has recently announced,"" the president said in a statement provided by the White House late on Monday.Trump added that if China retaliates against those duties, the U.S. would impose duties on yet another $200 billion in Chinese goods.On Friday, the U.S. said it would slap a 25% tariff on $50 billion of Chinese imports, with some $34 billion kicking in on July 6. That same day, China said it would impose $34 billion in retaliatory tariffs.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePreviously, Trump had threatened to impose tariffs on $100 billion Chinese goods if Beijing retaliated.Separately, the Senate voted 85-10 to reinstate stiff penalties vs. China telecom giant ZTE Corp., adding them to a defense spending bill. It's a repudiation of President Trump's deal to revive ZTE, which shut down as sanctions barred U.S. companies from doing business with the Chinese firm.Dow Jones futures sank 1.5% vs. fair value, signaling a Dow Jones move below its 50-day moving average at the open. S&P 500 futures retreated 1.2%. Nasdaq 100 futures tumbled 1.4%. Stock market futures often do not translate into how the Dow Jones and other major averages actually trade in the next regular session. But this is not a good sign.Alphabet and Sogou, a search engine spinoff from Chinese portal Sohu.com (SOHU), closed in buy range. Box and Autodesk entered buy zones intraday but closed just below their entries. Volume was strong for Sogou, Box and Autodesk, but sluggish for FANG stock Google.Alphabet stock boasts a 97 Composite Rating while Sogou stock has a best-possible 99 CR. Autodesk stock has an OK 73, but the maker of computer-aided-design software is transitioning to a cloud-computing subscription model that has hurt earnings temporarily. Box stock, at a 73 CR, is still unprofitable, but the cloud-based storage firm is narrowing losses with expectations for profits by 2020.Alphabet stock rose 2.1% to 1,183.58 in Monday's stock market trading. That cleared a handle buy point in a double-bottom base. Google's parent also cleared an alternate entry of 1,178.26 from the middle of the W in the consolidation.But Alphabet stock volume was 18% below normal, suggesting a lack of conviction buying by institutional investors.On the upside, Alphabet's relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, hit a new high. Alphabet's RS line hasn't made much progress in more than a year.Google stock fell 1.2% in Tuesday's premarket.Box stock shot up about 7% to 28.64 in volume that was 92% above normal. Shares rose as high as 28.91 intraday, briefly clearing a 28.78 base-on-base consolidation. Box's strong action Monday follows last week's powerful breakout by Dropbox (DBX). Dropbox, a recent IPO, rallied 6% on Monday.Box stock fell 1.6% in the premarket.Sogou stock rocketed 11.4% to 15.43, clearing a 14.80 cup-base entry in volume that was 594% above normal. Coming public at 13 last November, Sogou hit 14.70 intraday in its Nov. 9 debut, and then quickly sold off, hitting 7.91 in early April. But shares have rebounded, skyrocketing 62% in June alone.Sogo retreated 2.7% before the topen.Autodesk stock popped 2.4% to 141.26 on Monday, reaching 142.48 intraday.

14,NOV,"Top-rated retailer Ross Stores (ROST) as well as IBD 50 names Twitter (TWTR), TAL Education (TAL) and Momo (MOMO), scored new highs Friday. The latter three are well-extended past proper buy points.But Ross Stores is still in buy range from its handle entry at 84.67. Ross flashed a sell signal from a prior 82.91 entry when it fell 7.8% below the buy point. A key IBD sell rule says to always cut losses at 7% or 8% from your purchase price. Sometimes, a loss can be cut sooner than that.Despite a strong move for the stock in the past 10 years, Ross's latest breakout is still early stage, because the stock reset its base count when it made a big consolidation last year. The low undercut the low of the prior base, shaking enough sellers out to reset the base count. The breakout on Nov. 17 was first stage.Bright Horizons Family Solutions (BFAM) also made the new highs list. The stock looks poised for its third straight gain Friday. It cleared a 105.14 buy point Wednesday in higher volume. It's still within the 5% buy zone, although the market faces some risk.As of Thursday's close, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq showed five distribution days each. Meaningful losses for the major stock indexes in higher volume are a sign of institutional selling. The number of distribution days should always be monitored closely when the market is in a confirmed uptrend — like now.The financial sector also delivered some new highs. Small-cap Cadence Bancorp (CADE) popped above a 30.60 buy point Friday. It's plenty liquid with an average daily volume of more than 1 million shares. It also sports a Composite Rating of 95, which points toward plenty of positive traits from a fundamental perspective. Umpqua Holdings (UMPQ) also hit a new high as it tries to clear a flat base with 24.83 buy point.RELATED:Retail And E-Commerce Stocks And Industry NewsBanks And Financial Stocks News And Analysis

That includes ETF components such as E-Trade Financial (ETFC), TD Ameritrade (AMTD), LPL Financial (LPLA) and the largest holding of the fund, Charles Schwab (SCHW).But IBD's money center banks, which includes Wall Street veterans Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), is down 4%. Shares of those two institutions remain near the lows of their current price consolidations and underperform other holdings.There's been multiple factors influencing the brokerage and exchange companies this year. Rising interest rates have expanded net interest margins — something noted in Morgan Stanley's Q1 earnings report. The regulatory environment has been easing for banks and other financials. Higher market volatility has resulted in more trading activity — and commissions — for brokers.But financials are lagging several other sectors this year, including software, apparel, health care and semiconductors.To its credit, iShares Brokers-Dealers and Exchanges has a number of solid stocks. Charles Schwab is up about 25% from a breakout to new highs in November. Nasdaq shares are up about 20% from a November buy point. E-Trade has risen some 45% from a Nov. 27 breakout.Among losers, Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) plunged in early February after trading was halted on several inverted volatility products, potentially lowering trading volume at its Chicago Board Options Exchange. The stock has yet to recover. Lazard (LAZ) has been basing most of the year.The ETF itself is forming a cup-with-handle base with a 69.49 buy point. But the pattern is shallow and also could be interpreted as a flat base with a 70.68 entry.RELATED:Growth Of Cloud Computing Is Encapsulated In This FundActive Asset Allocation Made Easy With IBD ETF Leaders IndexHere's A Way To Invest In FANG Stocks With An ETF

19,NOV,"Is a break below the 10-week moving average a key sell rule? Yes. But there are times when you shouldn't sell.Using good sell signals properly to turn paper gains into concrete profits is a cornerstone of IBD-style investing. But you also don't want to sell prematurely when a stock's terrific run-up is simply taking a pause.If a stock is truly poised to etch its ultimate peak or go into a full-blown correction, it will certainly fall below the 10-week moving average. But the stock should undercut the 10-week line severely. And IBD's founder Bill O'Neil has said he wants to see weekly volume pop at least 40% higher vs. the 10-week moving average of volume before taking action.So, what if volume in the down week was dull? If you have a big enough profit cushion, hold. Give it some rope. Great stocks rebound quickly. Or they may be building a new base. If the stock finishes in the upper half of the weekly price range, you can infer that big institutions are swooping in to grab shares at what they deem to be reasonable prices. They are quietly expressing confidence in the company's long-term course.Here's an outstanding example. See the weekly chart of Abiomed (ABMD). The heart pump innovator broke out of a long cup with handle at 126.49 in April 2017 and rallied 58% in 31 weeks.During that nifty run, how many times did the stock finish the trading week beneath the 10-week moving average? Zero.It finally happened during the week ended Dec. 15. Abiomed closed at 188.71, losing 1.4% that week. The 10-week moving average, which graphs the average weekly closing price over the past 10 weeks, stood at 188.84. But volume was whisper-like, 25% below average. The mild price-and-volume action signaled to holders that one could sit tight.The Danvers, Mass., firm soon completed a five-week flat base. Shares broke out past a 200.38 buy point on Jan. 5. Volume after the new year holiday was light. But trading picked up. On Jan. 16, Abiomed climbed past 218; volume surged 88% above the 50-day average.Back in June 2017, Grubhub (GRUB) may have disappointed some investors when it flipped 8.6% lower during the week ended June 30. A week prior, shares bolted 10% higher. A big drop like that after a big gain like that sure leaves a sour taste in the mouth, no?But let's look at the volume.In that week, Grubhub traded 14.4 million shares, 15% higher than its 10-week average. (On IBD and MarketSmith weekly charts, the volume bars also feature a line that shows the 10-week moving average.) That's active, but it falls short of the 40% minimum jump that would normally spur a sell decision.The Chicago-based mobile food ordering giant also held a mild gain above a 42.35 buy point in an elongated double-bottom base. Right move? No move. Grubhub spent the next week mildly beneath the 10-week line, then made savory gains over the next five weeks.Another pullback beneath the 10-week line during the week ended Sept. 22 proved mild. Volume rose just 19% above average, and Grubhub nearly finished in the upper half of the week's price range. Grubhub broke out of a cup without handle at 57.71 in October and has climbed more than 90%.IBD Leaderboard name Five Below (FIVE) sank 6% during the week ended Feb. 2 as the major indexes began their first intermediate correction in 2018. But volume was light, 13% below average.The 33% swan dive by Kemet (KEM) during the week ended Nov. 3 marked a good time to sell, especially if your gains were limited. Volume throttled 86% higher than usual.Trade the IBD 50 efficiently via the Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) ETF, managed by Innovator Capital.

20,NOV,"The Dow Jones industrial average rose a bit more than 0.7% in stocks today and slightly outperformed the other major averages. Retail, software and Chinese ADRs helped fortify the U.S. market's upside. Veeva Systems (VEEV), one of the newest names in IBD Leaderboard, padded its gains Monday with a 2% rise to as high as 81.58, 4% past a 78.38 new buy point.Veeva, the Pleasanton, Calif., medical software firm, is within proper buy range. Volume on Monday expanded 116% above the 50-day average.Shares have also risen 29% from a 63.10 breakout point within a double-bottom base that formed from Nov. 27, 2017, to Feb. 26. That base is part of a longer consolidation.Meanwhile, China's popular video streaming service iQiyi (IQ) bolted to a new high of 32.40, up as much as 13.8%, before retreating significantly.

The iPhone giant has already advanced past a 179.04 entry point in a seven-week double bottom.That double bottom is second stage, suggesting that the stock still has ample room to run. Leading stocks that hop out of fourth- or fifth-stage bases often have more trouble generating profits for investors.Apple is also a member of IBD Leaderboard. The IBD service currently shows four stocks, including Veeva, near a proper buy zone.Among China ADRs, YY Inc. (YY) rallied for a fifth straight session as shares lifted 2.5% and made an intraday high of 125.84, the highest level since March.

YY's Composite Rating is also a best-possible 99 on a scale of 1 to 99.On the downside, Wynn Resorts (WYNN) tanked 5% to 182.83. Volume doubled the stock's 50-day average of 2.24 million shares.

Doubling on the low end is easy. Doubling on the high end is near impossible.""Like a game show host, we can only ask, ""Is that your final answer?"" If negative thinking is your final answer, no one can help you.What are the tools that a teen or preteen can use to build wealth?The first tool is belief in yourself.

Get a job.If you're too young for a job, find chores to do for neighbors: lawn mowing, dog walking, etc.The third tool is frugality.

""Spend some time with someone who has a baby and see how much work is involved,"" Brain writes.As you launch your wealth quest, be aware that starting early is important.

22,NOV,"It's not hard to find top growth stocks in IBD's Sector Leaders screen. ZTO Express (ZTO), one of many top growth stocks based in China, debuted in Monday's screen. The screen also includes China names Baozun (BZUN) and Alibaba (BABA).ZTO Express is an express delivery firm with a market capitalization of around $12.8 billion. It's very liquid with an average daily volume of 2.7 million shares.It was an inauspicious debut for ZTO Express when it went public in October 2016 at 19.50 a share. The good news at the time was that it priced above the proposed range of 16.50 to 18.50 a share. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were the underwriters. The bad news is that the stock headed lower after its first week of trading. Shares fell about 35% over the next four months.Fast forward to today, however, and a booming e-commerce market in China is fueling growth at ZTO Express. Just like UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) deliver packages for Amazon.com (AMZN), ZTO Express does the same for Alibaba.Earlier this month, the company reported adjusted profit of 17 cents a share, up 70% from the year-ago quarter. The results marked the second straight quarter of accelerating growth. Sales growth, meanwhile, accelerated for the fourth straight quarter, rising 48% to $563.4 million.Parcel volume in the fourth quarter totaled 2.015 billion, up 35.8% from the year-ago period. Full-year parcel volume in 2017 increased 38.3% from 2016. Parcel volume market share increased 15.5% in 2017 from 14.4% in 2016.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn the Q4 press release, CEO Meisong Lai commented: ""We are optimistic about the growth prospects of the express delivery industry in China. As China enters the new retail era with e-commerce continuing to grow, industrywide parcel volume is estimated to increase from 40.1 billion parcels in 2017 to approximately 70 billion in 2020, according to the State Post Bureau.""ZTO Express is near the top of a long consolidation that started in November. The conventional entry is 18.18, 10 cents above the Nov. 10 intraday high of 18.08.Since ZTO Express is relatively new as a publicly traded company, fund sponsorship is on the light side.At the end of Q4, 155 funds owned shares. But if ZTO Express maintains its growth trajectory, an increase in fund sponsorship wouldn't be surprising at all.RELATED:Best Chinese Stocks To Buy And WatchAs Baozun Bounces, This Top-Ranked Chinese Stock Nears Buy Zone

23,NOV,"The Nasdaq outperformed other key indexes in afternoon trading in stocks today. But in general, investors appear to be brushing off concerns over stability in the East Asia region after President Trump canceled a highly anticipated June 12 meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. A new Chinese IPO broke out.The Trump news didn't stop ZTO Express (ZTO), a play on Chinese e-commerce, from breaking out. However, keep in mind that the stock has a penchant for pulling back rapidly after hitting new highs.At 2 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq shaved a 1% early-morning loss to nearly nil. Key Nasdaq component Apple (AAPL) erased minor morning losses and is trading near 188, up 5% past its latest 179.04 buy point in a seven-week double-bottom base.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average also cut beefy early losses to around 0.2% to 0.3%. The small-cap S&P 600 rose fractionally.Meanwhile, the Dow transports rallied more than 1.1% as airline, railroad, logistics and truck firms gained ground amid a 1.6% drop in WTI crude oil futures. West Texas Intermediate crude is now at $70.70 a barrel, still up 17% year to date.Please read Wednesday's Big Picture column on how stocks today are mirroring the bullish activity seen in the prior session. As noted in the Market Pulse table within the Big Picture, the S&P 500 has logged seven distribution days within the past 25 sessions. Yet these instances of pronounced institutional selling have not been enough to swat the key large-cap benchmark far from its all-time highs.At 2727, the 500 is just 5% below an all-time peak of 2872 and is up 2% year to date.The Nasdaq composite, benefiting from the strength in FAANG stocks such as Apple and new breakout Netflix (NFLX), continues to lead the major indexes with a 7.5% year-to-date advance.ZTO rolled past an 18.18 buy point in a somewhat jagged cup base that began a negative reversal Nov. 10. No handle formed on the five-month cup base, so the proper buy point is 10 cents above the left-side lip of 18.08.The 5% buy zone goes up to 19.09. Read this recent Investor's Corner on the importance of not buying too far extended in price following a sound breakout.Notice on the weekly chart how ZTO broke out of a first-stage cup-type base at 16.14, rallied 12%, then pulled back sharply to begin a new base. In other words, the stock's action going all the way back to July of 2017 can be seen as a long base on base, one of eight key patterns that savvy growth investors use to time the market and find the right time to buy top growth stocks.The other seven chart patterns to learn and master: the cup with handle, double bottom, flat base, ascending base, high tight flag, saucer, and IPO base.The delivery giant, an October 2016 IPO, has grown earnings 7%, 0%, 35% and 70% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. The Street sees Q2 profit rising 67% to 25 cents a share.On IBD Stock Checkup, ZTO gets an outstanding 98 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99. The Relative Price Strength Rating of 83 means that ZTO has outperformed 83% of all public companies in IBD's database over the past 12 months.If the stock can maintain its fierce new uptrend, that RS Rating should rise. The up/down volume ratio is very strong at 2.7. See it in the ""Technical Performance"" section of Stock Checkup.The Shanghai-based company has a float of 426 million ADS (American depositary shares) and 721 million shares outstanding. The market cap of $13.3 billion makes it a midcap company.Netflix (NFLX), meanwhile, added gains after the streaming giant cleared a 338.92 proper entry in a narrow flat base. See today's Stock Spotlight column for a discussion on how Netflix formed two bases, and why the first one was flawed.Netflix joined IBD Leaderboard on April 5 as a half-position stock, then got upgraded to full-position status on April 17.

24,NOV,"A few years ago Vincent Deluard was a huge cheerleader for smart-beta ETFs, which slice and dice the market using indexes tuned to classic investing factors like momentum and value.But times change and so has Deluard's take on factor-based exchange traded funds. With smart-beta portfolios becoming increasingly popular, the global macro strategist at INTL FCStone Financial recently reached the conclusion that the strategies aren't as shrewd as they seem. So he set out to prove it by building his own ""DUMB"" portfolio. The results were enlightening.""If everyone's doing it, it's not going to work anymore,"" Deluard said.This is a significant change of heart for a 35-year-old Wall Streeter who's spent the past 10 years enamored with the quant theory. Deluard even helped build a multifactor smart-beta ETF. But he said working behind the scenes was a disconcerting experience.""The more I've seen this become mainstream, and the more I see how easy it is to fool people with facts — some long-term back tests, short-term stats — you realize quickly you can really prove anything,"" Deluard said. ""My faith in quant academic finance has really come down quite a bit.""Use of factors in ETF investing has exploded in the past few years. Assets under the smart-beta umbrella in the U.S. have almost tripled since 2012, reaching about $600 billion in 2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Since 2017, issuers have started 67 new smart-beta ETFs, according to BlackRock. The firm estimates that factor strategies will grow to $3.4 trillion by 2022, while smart beta, a subset of the broader factor world, will reach $1.4 trillion.To test the genius of the smart-beta industry, Deluard spent Nov. 7, 2016 — the night before the presidential election — concocting an experiment. He created what he called a ""basket of deplorables,"" an index made up of the outcasts of the smart-beta world, which he named DUMB. To do it, he put together a market-capitalization-weighted index with about 200 companies that are in the S&P 500 index but didn't make the cut for these five factor-based funds:He then combined those five smart-beta funds to create an equal-weighted portfolio that he named SMART. From the experiment's start through April, the most recent period for which the data are available, DUMB beat SMART by more than 2%. Deluard says he remains bullish on the ""DUMB beta"" index, in part because he expects rates to rise and most smart-beta funds have a negative correlation to yields.A Bloomberg portfolio analysis shows Deluard's hypothetical fund benefited from positive exposure to financials, which made up about 30% of the holdings, as well as its positions in profitable and cheap companies.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOf course, there are caveats. Many portfolio managers would argue that a year and a half isn't long enough to draw a conclusion on an investing thesis. Plus, equally weighting five different smart-beta ETFs doesn't really mimic the reality of what the industry is trying to do. The point of the strategy is that different factors work in different market environments, so an investor probably wouldn't want equal exposure to these characteristics at the same time.""These strategies go in and out of favor,"" Melissa Brown, managing director of applied research at Axioma, said. ""If you're going to combine them, you've got to be smart about combining them.""Compare Deluard's DUMB portfolio with the five individual smart-beta ETFs he used, and the winning characteristic is clear. MTUM outperformed by 18% through April as winners kept on winning and investors continued to buy the trend. Meanwhile, QUAL, which aims to track companies with high return on equity and low debt burdens, beat DUMB by 1%. And the three other smart-beta strategies fell short.When you combine factors without a guiding principle or reason, you also could end up with factor dilution — the idea that the conviction of a factor is lessened when mixed with others, according to Mark Carver, head of factor index products at MSCI.""You end up with something that is closer to the benchmark than getting factors,"" he said in an interview at MSCI's New York office. ""And if you do that across four different ideas, you're diluting your ultimate exposure to the factors. You're not even representing what that factor portfolio could look like in a well-designed sense.""Plus, not all smart-beta ETFs are meant to beat the market at all times, according to BlackRock. Instead, they can be used for different purposes. Funds that select companies based on their dividend yields could provide quick income for investors, for example.""Investors recognize that factor investing offers multiple strategic outcomes such as improving returns, reducing risk and increasing income,"" BlackRock said in a statement. ""Short-term performance is not an indication that a factor strategy is working.""Across the industry, firms are preaching smart beta to the masses, focusing on teaching investors how to use factor-based strategies effectively. OppenheimerFunds has gone the creative route, inviting investors to ""race"" their portfolios a la the Kentucky Derby, educating along the way. BlackRock launched a free online tool that one can use to analyze stock funds with a factor lens.Still, it's not the first time smart-beta products have faced skepticism, and Deluard's concern that factor-based ETFs lose their market-beating value as they grow in popularity sounds similar to worries previously presented by Rob Arnott, chief executive officer of Research Affiliates.Two years ago, Arnott, one of the founders of smart beta, wrote a paper warning that most of the ETFs were only succeeding because of their growing popularity with investors and henceforth inflated valuations. Ultimately, the strategies are poised to crash, he argued.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:4 Best Ways To Play Dow Defense Stocks As Trade War Fears EaseInvestors Betting On Fresh Volatility In The Stock Market2 New Ideas To Play Top AI, Bitcoin And Blockchain Stocks

25,NOV,"Top recent issue and hot growth stock Planet Fitness (PLNT) is back in rally mode after triggering a sell signal last week. Shares are just above a previous flat-base entry.XThe Leaderboard member is a fitness chain that is primarily located in the U.S. The company boasts a ""judgement-free"" atmosphere and a cheap membership.In the most recent quarter, year-over-year top- and bottom-line growth increased 33% and 42%, respectively. The company has two quarters of accelerating earnings and sales growth — a bullish fundamental metric. Meanwhile, same-store sales rose 11.1% in Q1. Despite a very solid quarter, higher costs in the quarter offset the better-than-expected same-store sales.Analysts expect the company's earnings to rise 42% in 2018 and another 18% in 2019.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Yet, the stock's long-term story remains intact.

27,NOV,"Total (TOT) became the first oil company to announce that it is pulling out of Iran in the wake of President Donald Trump pulling the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear agreement.XThe French oil major said Wednesday that it will not be able to continue it's South Pars 11 gas development project and will unwind all operations in Iran before Nov. 4 unless it's granted a waiver by the U.S. government.""Total has always been clear that it cannot afford to be exposed to any secondary sanction,"" which could include the loss of financing by U.S. banks or inability to continue its operations in the U.S., the company said in a news release.A secondary sanction would be a major loss for the company. It said over 90% of Total's financial operation comes from U.S. banks, and U.S. assets account for over $10 billion of capital employed.But Total assured investors that leaving Iran wouldn't impact its production-growth targets.Total shares closed down 1% at 63.21 on the stock market today. despite crude prices reversing higher on bullish U.S. supply data. Exxon Mobil (XOM) edged up 0.3% to 82.02. Chevron (CVX) fell 0.1% to 129.56, but is still in buy range after clearing a 128 buy point last week coming out of a cup-with-handle base. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) eased 0.3% to 72.42, in buy range, after breaking out of a cup-with-handle base with a 71.79 entry point. BP (BP) was off 0.2% at 46.71.U.S. oil rose 0.3% to settle at $71.49 a barrel, and Brent crude rallied 1.1% to $79.28 a barrel.Domestic crude stockpiles fell by 1.4 million barrels last week, with gasoline inventories down by 3.8 million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Analysts had expected a 1.75 million-barrel decline in crude stockpiles. But the American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday a 4.854 million-barrel increase in crude stockpiles along with a 3.369 million-barrel drop in gasoline inventories.Domestic production rose to 10.723 million barrels per day, up from 10.70 million bpd, EIA said.Earlier, the International Energy Agency said Wednesday that global crude inventories are below average for the first time since 2014. That reflects the OPEC-Russia production curbs in recent years, even as U.S. production hits record highs.While oil markets already priced in the impact of leaving the Iran deal, the IEA said Wednesday there is ""understandable uncertainty"" about Iran's exports following President Trump's decision to leave the Iran nuclear deal. The IEA added that production in Venezuela is in ""free fall"" as the country's economic crisis worsens.""For now, the rapidly changing geopolitical landscape will move the attention away from stocks as producers and consumers consider how to limit volatility in the oil market,"" the agency said in its monthly oil market report.The IEA also warned in its monthly oil market report Wednesday that its expects the ""recent jump in oil prices will take its toll,"" on demand. The agency lowered its outlook for global demand growth to 1.4 million barrels per day this year vs. a prior estimate for growth of 1.5 million bpd.On Monday, OPEC added the U.S. exit from the Iran nuclear deal to a list of economic uncertainties fueled by U.S. trade policies. YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

28,NOV,"The yield on the 10-year Treasury note spiked to a nearly seven-year high Tuesday, causing selling in stocks and in particular the ones most sensitive to interest rates.Higher borrowing costs sent stocks sharply lower. The Nasdaq composite tumbled 1% and the S&P 500 0.8%. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.9%. The Russell 2000 was down only 0.1% thanks mainly to relative strength in small-cap banks.Volume was tracking higher compared with the same time Monday. Losers led winners by a 2-1 margin on the NYSE and by 6-to-5 on the Nasdaq.The benchmark 10-year note's yield climbed to 3.09% in afternoon trading, and it is up more than 67.1 basis points in 2018, according to data from bond platform Tradeweb. At 3.08% earlier today, it was the highest yield since July 2011.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Yields on treasuries with shorter maturities are at their highest closing and intraday points in about a decade, continuing the basis point increases that began in September 2017 and have sustained so far this year,"" Tradeweb noted.With yields rising, rate-sensitive stocks were among the worst performing Tuesday.Homebuilders were at the bottom of the industry table. Builders were the No. 1 industry group for much of 2017, but have fallen out of favor despite a housing market that remains strong. They are ranked No. 180 out of 197 groups. LGI Homes (LGIH) slid below its 200-day moving average in heavy trading, adding to losses that began with the stock's bearish reversal a week ago.Home Depot (HD) fell after the home-improvement chain's revenue and same-store sales for the first quarter came in soft. Concerns over severe winter weather in parts of the country and rising mortgage rates also have weighed.Property real estate investment trusts, another asset class sensitive to interest rates, were down 1.5%. Semiconductor, consumer products and auto manufacturers were sharply lower as well.Banks tend to benefit from rising interest rates, and the sector led the stock market today. SPDR S&P Regional Bank (KRE) and SPDR S&P Bank (KBE), two of the largest banking ETFs, were up roughly 0.3% to 0.5%.On the political front, there was some cheer for banks. Bloomberg reported that regulators may change the Volcker Rule to make it easier for banks to handle short-term trading.Altair Engineering (ALTR) broke out of a cup without handle in heavy trading. The stock topped the 33.48 buy point after the company beat earnings expectations late Monday. Altair, a product development software company, reported adjusted earnings of 8 cents a share for Q1 and a 19% increase in sales to $91.7 million. The company had its IPO Nov. 1 at 13 a share and is still in the early stages of its base-building history.RELATED:Bond Markets Send These 2 Gloomy Signals On Fed Rate HikesRegulators Target Volcker Trading Rule, Helping Wall Street Trading DesksFed Rate-Hike Odds, Treasury Yields Keep Rising On Solid Retail Sales; Stocks Fall

29,NOV,"Retailing, apparel, consumer-spending and semiconductor-related stocks dominated the market's upside in stocks today, as major indexes sought to beef up their morning gains. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), meanwhile, reaffirmed a new trend of emerging institutional demand within the restaurant industry group.Chipotle, which is a new trading idea in IBD SwingTrader on Wednesday, rallied more than 3% to 440.27 in healthy turnover for what figures to be its fourth up day in a row.Chipotle's volume is running 52% above usual levels, hinting that mutual funds, pensions, hedge funds, banks, insurers and the like are accumulating shares heavily.The stock ran in the short sellers on April 26 after reporting Q1 results that pointed to an ongoing turnaround in fundamentals. After that big jump, Chipotle traded tightly and volume dried up, forming a handle in the process. That positive action following the catapulting move in price in essence formed a handle and a 433.10 buy point within its new deep first-stage base.At 2:30 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite paced the key indexes with a gain of more than 0.7%. At 7405, the premier index of high-growth companies is now up 7.2% year to date. It advanced 28.2% last year.The Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) ETF rallied 1.2% to 35.25. The exchange-traded fund, managed by Innovator Capital, gained 34% in 2017.The S&P 500 rose 0.5%. A two-point drop by 3M (MMM) hampered the Dow Jones industrial average's advance. The blue chip index rose around 0.3%. Volume is running around 7%-8% lower vs. the same time Tuesday on both main exchanges.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use3M has been hit with heavy institutional selling ever since the Dow Jones industrial component and manufacturing giant cracked below the 50-day moving average in severe volume on Feb. 5, a key sell signal.Some sector indexes heated up even more.The PHLX Semiconductor index, also known as the SOX, winged 1.1% higher. Micron Technology (MU) broke out of a new double-bottom base at 54.37 in decent but not great turnover.Notice how in this nine-week double bottom, the middle peak of 54.27 is actually 10 cents beneath the midpoint of the actual base (45.31 low plus 63.42, giving a base midpoint of 54.37). You'd prefer to see the midpoint of a double bottom be firmly lodged within the upper half of the base.That said, Micron is still 11% below the base's 63.42 peak. In other words, it's possible for the stock to continue building the right side of the current base. Double-bottom bases can also form handles, which represent a final shakeout of uncommitted shareholders, and boost the chances of a successful breakout.Micron is a member of the strong data storage industry group. In that group, Smart Global (SGH) continues to act as a market leader as well. Shares, up nearly 4% to 47.33, are working on the right side of a potential cup pattern.Returning to the restaurant group, Wingstop (WING) and Shake Shack (SHAK) are showing robust action so far in 2018.The former has made a series of rebounds off the 50-day moving average after it cleared a 33.64 buy point in a 10-week flat base on Nov. 3, 2017. On that day, the chicken wing chain reported a 31% jump in earnings to 17 cents a share for the third quarter of 2017 as sales lifted 19% to $26 million.Since then, earnings have risen 13% and 19% in the prior two quarters. In IBD Stock Checkup, Wingstop ranks 5th within the Retail-Restaurants industry group with an 87 Composite Rating. That overall ranking belies a solid EPS Rating of 88 on a scale of 1 to 99, which means that the company's long- and short-term profit growth is superior to 88% of all publicly traded companies in IBD's database.Wingstop's Composite score is likely hurt by the fact that it doesn't have an SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity) Rating. Why? Wingstop does not have a calculable return on equity. As of the first quarter of 2018, the Dallas-based company showed a total stockholders' deficit of $146 million. Nonetheless, Wingstop posts excellent operating cash flow that has been higher than annual earnings per share for four years in a row.The Street sees Wingstop's earnings rising 14% to 83 cents a share this year and 19% to 99 cents in 2019.Shake Shack powered past a 44.50 buy point in a four-month cup with handle on April 13, then blasted higher nearly two weeks later after the popular burger, crinkle cut fries, and shake chain posted a 50% bulge in adjusted Q1 profit and a 29% increase in sales to $99.1 million.Wingstop and Shake Shack are small cap firms with market values of $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.In other markets, U.S. crude oil futures eased 0.3% to $71.08 a barrel. That decline didn't stop IBD 50 member Daqo New Energy (DQ) from rallying nearly 11% to 65.22 in hefty trade.The expert in making raw polysilicon for solar cell production is a wild stock, easily prone to swinging up or down 5% any given day. Nevertheless, the stock has now cleared a 65.09 entry point in a deep double bottom base and is in buy range.The 5% buy zone for Daqo goes up to 68.34.Daqo is No. 13 in the IBD 50.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond is holding firmly above the 3% threshold, currently at 3.08%.Fed funds future now show a roughly 54% chance that the Federal Reserve will make four quarter-point hikes in short-term interest rates by December this year.RELATED:How To Find The Correct Buy Point In Stocks: Maximize Your Return, Minimize Your RiskWhich Stocks Just Entered The IBD 50, Sector Leaders, And Other Key IBD Screens?

30,NOV,"Traders torched stocks today amid a bonfire of selling (with respects to the passing of novelist Tom Wolfe) in the U.S. Treasury bond markets. But a small posse of leadership-quality companies bucked the broad Wall Street decline.They included new IPO Altair Engineering (ALTR), Splunk (SPLK), Cree (CREE), Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) and China Lodging (HTHT).In stocks today, homebuilders finished as the worst performer among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, down 5%, as the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond hit 3.08%, marking a new six-year high.D.R. Horton (DHI) tanked more than 6% to 40.58 and dropped sharply beneath its long-term 200-day moving average. The stock is now 23% beneath a 53.32 peak. LGI Homes (LGIH), which staged a vicious reversal last week despite posting robust Q1 results (EPS up 112% to $1.10, sales up 71% to $279 million), took out its 200-day line as shares fell 5.9% to 58.19.LGI Homes' turnover jumped 149% above its 50-day moving average, a strong hint that fund managers sold anxiously.""Rising mortgage rates are further squeezing affordability for would-be homebuyers that are already frustrated by limited inventory of available homes and higher home prices that have resulted,"" Bankrate.com chief financial analyst Greg McBride said.On Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average both slid 0.8%; at one point, both averages fell more than 1%. The S&P 500 sank 0.7%. Volume increased on both main exchanges, according to early data. The higher volume vs. Monday's action implies unusually intense professional selling.As noted in IBD's The Big Picture column, such significant drops in heavier volume are called distribution. A bevy of strong distribution days can signal an end to a major market uptrend.Despite the broad decline among large caps, the Russell 2000 inched less than 1 point higher. The small cap S&P 600 also rose less than 1 point; at 982, the 600 is up 4.9% since Jan. 1 while the S&P 500 is up 1.4%. The IBD current outlook for the market remains ""Confirmed uptrend.""Meanwhile, Leaderboard member Apple (AAPL) staged a gap-down in price, but volume was well below the 50-day average. Given Apple's solid breakout last week, it's normal to see even top stocks pull back to or near the proper buy point.A downward gap appears on a daily chart when the intraday high is below the intraday low of the prior trading session.In Apple's case, Tuesday's intraday high of 187.07 is 79 cents below Monday's session low of 187.86. Not much of a gap.On May 4, Apple broke out of a compact double bottom base pattern that supplied a 179.04 buy point. So far, the breakout has produced a gain of more than 6%.At 186.26, the iPhone, iPad and digital services giant is now up 57% past a 118.12 buy point in a first-stage cup with handle, one of the most important chart patterns that top growth stocks produce before breaking out to new highs and big price runs. Apple cleared that base in the midst of its fundamental turnaround, on Jan. 6, 2017.Altair, a member of IBD's specialty enterprise software industry group, barreled more than 6% higher to 33.51 and narrowly eclipsed a 33.49 buy point in a seven-week cup without handle. The 17% decline within the base is bullishly mild. The Troy, Mich.-based expert in innovation-boosting engineering software went public at 13 a share on Nov. 1 last year.Notice on a daily chart how Altair has made a habit of breaking out of IBD-style bases, going up quickly in just a few days, then reversing sharply below the correct entry. But from a longer point of view, the small cap has done a marvelous job of staying on the north side of its 50-day moving average.Altair on Monday posted a 167% leap in Q1 profit to 8 cents a share as revenue rose 19% to $91.7 million, a quarterly best.Meanwhile, Ligand thrust higher for a fifth straight session, rising more than 2% to 185.37. The biotech play is extended 7.7% past a 172.17 entry in a well-formed double-bottom base.The midpoint of 172.07, found in between the two sell-offs within the base, is in the upper half of the base's price range. That's a good sign.According to IBD Stock Checkup, Ligand sports a shiny Composite Rating of 98 on a scale of 1 to 99. This rating, found only in IBD Weekly and at Investors.com, gauges a stock's corporate fundamentals, stock price strength, and quality of institutional sponsorship. It is not a purely technical indicator.Ligand's Relative Price Strength Rating is a stout 91, also on a scale of 1 to 99. This means the San Diego-based company is beating 91% of all publicly traded companies in IBD's database in 12-month price performance.In terms of market value, at $3.9 billion Ligand barely lifts a finger to the likes of Celgene (CELG), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Amgen (AMGN) in the biotech world. However, Ligand is body-slamming these three peers in terms of earnings growth. Ligand has grown profits 91%, 57%, 77% and 172% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see earnings in Q2 rising 43% to 96 cents a share. Keep in mind, that's on top of the 91% jump in the year-ago quarter.Revenue broke the $50 million barrier on a quarterly basis in both the past two quarters. Year over year, the top line has boomed higher by 43%, 54%, 32% and 92% in the past four quarters.Read this recent New America feature piece on why Ligand is growing so rapidly.China Lodging, a major player in the fast-growing travel market in the Middle Kingdom, sprinted 9% to 169.50 in quadruple normal trade. The stock surpassed a 161 buy point in an unusual four-month double bottom. The RS line roared into new high ground.The proper buy zone goes up to 169.05, or 5% past the 161 entry.China Lodging posted a 79% jump in first-quarter earnings to 61 cents a share as revenue rose 42% to $332 million. After-tax margin climbed an impressive 310 basis points to 13.5%.The stock ranks No. 5 in the IBD 50.Keep in mind that China Lodging's recent base-on-base structure is at least fourth stage, which increases the risk of a breakout failure. The stock initially broke out of an 11-week cup base at 33.10 in the week ended March 18, 2016.However, some companies with stellar fundamentals defy the odds.(For the latest updates on this story and other market coverage, check IBD stories on stocks today.

Kraft Heinz rose nearly 3% to lead the Nasdaq. Infrastructure play Vulcan Materials (VMC) topped the S&P 500. Tesla, Cerner (CERN) and Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) dueled for the low spot on the Nasdaq. Drug distribution giant Cardinal HealthCAH faltered 16%, the S&P 500's harshest early decline.Wednesday's pullback in rising volume further fortified the 50-day moving average as a technical line of resistance for the Dow industrials, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Two weeks of powerful earnings surprises have failed to drive indexes back above that key level. Markets took Wednesday's widely expected no-change policy release from the Fed as a negative.

Shares are down 16% from a January high.Also at the top of the index, cereal maker Kellogg (K) popped more than 2% and chemicals producer FMC (FMC) logged a 4% advance on earnings results.At the low end of the S&P 500, Cardinal Health dug deeper into its downtrend, as shares plunged 16% in opening trade.

32,NOV,"IBD's New Highs List can provide individual investors with a pool of buy candidates. Stocks often reach a new high as they break out of a consolidation.There's another way, though, to use the new highs/new lows data. Treat it as a secondary stock market indicator. Sometimes it can serve as a kind of a canary in the coal mine, either foretelling or confirming a correction.""Sometimes"" is the keyword here. Secondary indicators are called secondary because they don't always work.Let's look at several stock-market uptrends that ran for 50 or more consecutive sessions.September to October 2010: The market was in an uptrend. New highs were running sometimes as high as 350 and never dipping under 100 for more than two consecutive sessions.But Nov. 16, the indexes delivered fewer than 100 combined new highs (NYSE plus Nasdaq) a third day in a row. This had not happened during the entire 51-session run. The Market Pulse shifted to correction.The new-highs tally had signaled a change in character.December 2011 to February 2012: An uptrend that was confirmed Dec. 20, 2011, ran for 67 sessions. But the new highs/new lows data wasn't particularly useful. The new highs tally stayed fairly low throughout the rally.If the canary doesn't normally chirp much, it's hard to spot the change in character.July to September 2012: The uptrend confirmed July 26, 2012, ran for 52 days. Once again, the new-high tally was too restrained to be useful.December 2016 to February 2017: The uptrend confirmed Dec. 7, 2016, lasted 70 days. This rally had many days of huge new-high tallies and strayed into two digits only on isolated occasions. Yet, the new highs tally wasn't useful in the canary role. There were times the market came under pressure, but the situation never degraded into a correction.August 2017 to February 2018: On Aug. 22, 2017, a new uptrend was confirmed. The run lasted 112 sessions. The new-highs tally was in three digits throughout the run, dropping to two digits never more than two days in a row.That changed beginning Feb. 2, when new highs in two digits became common. On Feb. 8, the fifth consecutive session in two digits, the Market Pulse changed to correction.The key is to pay attention to new highs. Sometimes they will signal a change in character.RELATED:Is Apple's Stock, Or The Entire Stock Market, A Random Walk?Winning Is No Reason To Call A Stock's Run Done3 Factors That Can Reveal Much About A CompanyStocks Near A Buy ZoneHow To Find Top Large Cap Stocks: Inside Big Cap 20

33,NOV,"In 2016, Veeva Systems (VEEV) didn't join Leaderboard until weeks after the stock reached a buy point. It still turned out to be a smart move — a lesson that buying is not always limited to the day of a breakout.The health-care software company rose past a 28.05 buy point mid-May 2016. It certainly was not a stellar breakout. Price and volume limped higher when they should have been powerful (1).On the weekly chart, the move looked better in terms of price and volume. The relative strength line made new highs, another plus for the breakout. By May 27, there was no doubt the breakout was working. Shares shot up 8% in heavy trading thanks to a 25% rise in EPS and an even larger increase in sales of 33%.Still, Leaderboard editors waited on Veeva. The stock at this stage had run too far from its buy area. But another opportunity arose in mid-June, when the stock consolidated gently (2). Volume trended lower as the stock eased, and was much lighter than when shares were rising.That's a bullish price-volume combination on any chart, and a sign that institutional investors did not sell heavily during the dip. The stock had not touched its 50-day moving average, where leading stocks normally find their support. Still, Leaderboard editors decided the pullback was attractive and it was time to add the stock on June 20 (3).From a longer-range perspective, the stock was still near the 33.10 prior high in a 14-month pattern.Twelve weeks passed with little trouble. Shares behaved well even while the Nasdaq tumbled nearly 7% on June 24-27. Veeva shares shot up Aug. 31 on a strong earnings report. Yet the stock stalled after that, even if it wasn't making any topping signals.We removed Veeva from the Leaders list on Sept. 9 (4), as shares reached a 44% increase from the 28.05 buy point and a 17% gain from its arrival on Leaderboard. At its prior high, Leaderboard's gain was 20%, which is enough to justify taking profits.Veeva spent 11 weeks forming a base. It broke out Nov. 23 but gave up all gains from the breakout to start on another base.With Leaderboard, investors can get the needed guidance, as market specialists study the selected stocks and annotate charts with the latest signals.

35,NOV,"A breakaway gap is the quintessential breakout and a crucial part of stock analysis.XTypically event-driven, such as a strong earnings report, these price gaps can send a stock catapulting out of a good base. Why do they occur? Buying demand surpasses the available supply of shares to be sold so much that the stock has to rise high enough in price to convince holders to sell their shares and match the heavy demand.By the close of trading on a gap-up day, it's not unusual to see a leadership-quality stock rise at least 20%. Volume tends to surge well above average. It leaves you with no doubt that this stock is going higher, much higher.Let's take a look at LinkedIn back in 2013.

The base's positives included six consecutive up weeks on the right side of the base and a three-weeks-tight pattern within the handle. In the most recent quarter, earnings and sales were up a whopping 267% and 81%, respectively, vs. a year ago.On the breakout day, the stock staged a small price gap up and rose almost 4%. Volume increased 54% above its 50-day average. With an earnings release several weeks away, the stock meandered in and out of the 5% buy range until it launched 21% higher on Feb. 8 (1). Volume surged more than 600% above average as institutions flooded into the stock.There is a direct correlation between power and distance; the more power at the start, the higher the stock can go. From the close of trading on its Feb. 8 breakaway gap, it ran up another 34% before the stock formed a new cup base. Even at all-time highs, the stock had plenty of upside potential.If a stock gaps up so hard that it doesn't trade within 5% of the proper buy point, you may go ahead and buy shares as close as possible to the opening price. But make sure it has the fundamentals to be a true market leader. It should be No. 1 in its industry group, and the market should be in a young, new confirmed uptrend. The Big Picture column gives you a sense of the market's current stage.Since we're in earnings season, it is even more important to keep an eye on leading stocks and their earnings announcement dates. MarketSmith, an Investors.com premium charting and stock screening product, provides lists that look for new breakaway gaps, such as the one made by Planet Fitness (PLNT) in November 2017.Once again, an earnings surprise paved the way for this stock's big breakout. With a huge gap up out of a flat base on Nov. 8, the stock surged past its 27.32 entry in volume more than seven times greater than average. That same day, the stock quickly became extended, but traded in the 5% buy range early in the morning. (The above chart is a weekly chart; please see a historical daily chart at MarketSmith to see the actual breakout.)Unless you're 'Johnny-on-the-spot,' you missed it.Planet Fitness quickly rallied 28% to a high of 35.03 by late December, enabling holders to lock in gains based on IBD's top offense-type sell rule before the stock's next basing process.That's why having access to MarketSmith and its 'Breakaway Gap' list, and other IBD lists, such as IBD 50 and Big Cap 20, can be so instrumental to successful stock research.(A version of this column was originally published on Feb. 3, 2017, at Investors.com.)RELATED:Best Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsHow To Find The Correct Buy Point: Read This Investor's CornerStocks Near A Buy ZoneWhy Winning Stocks Are Already Strong Price Performers Before They Make Big Price MovesStock Analysis: 3 Elements That Can Reveal Much About A Company

37,NOV,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone buyers are turning thrifty, picking less-expensive older models that are good enough over pricier handsets with the latest and greatest technology.That's the finding of a report out Monday from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Sales of the latest smartphones from Apple accounted for 60% of iPhones sold in the U.S. in the first quarter. That's down from 68% last year, 71% in 2016 and 78% in 2015, during the same period, according to Josh Lowitz, partner and co-founder of CIRP.""We now have a full quarter of results for all of Apple's new iPhones, and together they account for a smaller share of total sales than the newest phones did this time last year,"" Lowitz said in a news release. ""This first calendar quarter typically represents baseline demand for iPhones, after the initial launch surge and before any slowdown as buyers begin to anticipate new models.""Apple typically launches its new iPhones in the fall. It introduced the iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus at a media event on Sept. 12. Apple released the iPhone 8 series phones on Sept. 22, followed by the iPhone X on Nov. 3.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe flagship iPhone X accounted for 16% of iPhone unit sales in the U.S. in the March quarter, down from 20% in the December quarter. The iPhone 8 series handsets combined for 44% of sales in the first quarter, up from 41% in the fourth quarter.""After the initial excitement over the iPhone X features, the highest-priced flagship appears to have settled into a smaller share of sales,"" Lowitz said.The iPhone X has a 5.8-inch OLED screen and a facial-recognition sensor for secure log-in, plus augmented reality features. It starts at $999, making it the most expensive iPhone to date.The iPhone 8 starts at $699, while the larger-screen iPhone 8 Plus starts at $799. They sport faster processors and other upgraded components vs. the year-earlier iPhone 7 series.Apple kept the iPhone 7 series phones in its lineup along with the two-year-old iPhone 6S series. It cut the prices of the iPhone 7 and 6S series phones by $100. The iPhone 7 now starts at $549 and the iPhone 6S starts at $449.""Surprisingly, iPhone models introduced in 2015 and 2016 continued to show strong sales,"" Mike Levin, CIRP partner and co-founder, said in a written statement. ""The year-old iPhone 7 and 7 Plus accounted for almost one-fifth of sales, and the two-year old iPhone 6S and 6S Plus had 13% of sales.""He added, ""Consumers appear to want older, cheaper models that have many of the same features.""Apple shares were off 0.3% Monday to close at 165.24.RELATED:Apple Stock Gets Price-Target Cut On iPhone Sales Weakness Taiwan Semiconductor Warning Hits Chip Stocks And Apple

38,NOV,"Alabama-based Warrior Met Coal (HCC) turned profitable in 2017 after posting losses in 2015-16. Despite the turnaround, future results are expected to be erratic.The company earned $8.77 a share in 2017 but is expected to see earnings drop to $7.29 this year and $3.75 in 2019.In the past four quarters, revenue soared 256%, 297%, 490% and 56%.Warrior Met Coal produces coal that is ""ideally suited"" for steel making, according to the company 10-K. The small-cap company sells its met coal to steel producers primarily in Europe, South America and Asia. ""Met"" is short for metallurgical.Met's 10-K report notes that sales contracts are usually a year or less in duration. ""Globally the market is evolving to shorter-term pricing,"" according to the 10-K.Market swings in pricing mean Warrior Met Coal's revenue is vulnerable to fluctuations. ""Met coal has been an extremely volatile commodity over the past ten years,"" the company said in its 10-K.Price swings aren't necessarily bad. They just mean investors need to stay alert.Pretax margin was more than 36% last year. After-tax margin ranged from 36% to 45% in the past four quarters. While those numbers are excellent, there's not much of a corporate history to provide a context. The company formed in 2015.At the Q4 earnings call in February, CEO Walter Scheller said demand for Chinese met coal imports remains strong, ""despite restrictions on imports that were less severe than originally anticipated.""The company will release Q1 results May 2 after the close. The Street expects earnings to rise 34% to $2.93 a share. Comparisons are getting tougher. The year-ago levels now involve triple-digit percentage gains.Warrior Met Coal is known for two huge special dividends declared in November and April.On Nov. 2, Warrior declared a special dividend of $11.21 a share. The payment date was Nov. 22. On April 3, Warrior declared a special dividend of $6.53 a share. The payment date is April 20 to shareholders of record April 13.The stock chart shows a base under construction. The stock is 11% off its late-February high and barely above its 50-day line. Unless the stock adds a handle, the traditional entry point would be the left-side high plus 10 cents (26.53). More aggressive investors could regard a secondary peak at 24.96 as a potential entry.One drawback is the base count. The April 2017 initial public offering's current consolidation is third stage.As a stock rises, it pauses to consolidate. Breakouts from the first two patterns are more likely to work than those from later-stage patterns.RELATED:How To Analyze Profit Margins And ROEThis Pizza Restaurant Is Expanding Its Delivery Reach5 Energy Stocks That Are On FireA Special Tool For Gauging Stock Breakouts

39,NOV,"Stock market futures edged lower for the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100, with chip stocks coming under pressure for a second session. But they indicate that the major averages will continue to hold above their 50-day moving averages after vaulting above that key level Tuesday. One premarket winner is Amazon.com (AMZN), which revealed that it has more than 100 million Amazon Prime members.Customers pay Amazon and Netflix (NFLX) real money for their services. Meanwhile, fellow FANG stocks Facebook (FB) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) have offered free services in which users pay in ""data."" But that free-data, ad-driven model has come under fire in the wake of the Facebook data-privacy scandal. This divide is stark in the FANG stocks' performance.(Apple (AAPL), which is sometimes included in a FAANG stock grouping, is a more extreme example of the dollars-vs.-data model. Apple gets customers — and wireless providers — to pay up for the iPhone, while stressing privacy and not selling users' data.)S&P 500 futures fell 0.1% above fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.1%. Dow Jones futures were just below break-even.Amazon has vaulted 69% over the past year to Wednesday's close.

Late Wednesday, CEO Jeff Bezos disclosed Amazon Prime membership has topped 100 million, the first time the company disclosed any specific figures for Prime users.

The stock sold off sharply in late March on revelations that Cambridge Analytica had unauthorized data on some 87 million Facebook users. The social giant said third parties have likely scrapped data from most of its two billion users. The stock has recouped some losses, helped by a decent performance by CEO Mark Zuckerberg at congressional hearings. But Facebook shares have been lagging the S&P 500 since Nov. 1.Facebook user growth is slowing, new regulations are likely, and the company is spending more to root out fake news and Russian interference. To make matters worse, Amazon appears to be grabbing a bigger piece of the online ad market, cutting into Facebook and Google.Alphabet shares have climbed 26% in the last 12 months, up slightly in 2018. Facebook's woes hit Alphabet shares somewhat, amid concerns about how regulators might target Google's own data practices. Alphabet's RS line hasn't made much headway in the past year. The stock did retake its 50-day line on Tuesday.As for Apple, the iPhone maker also is up 26% over the past year. The stock is up modestly in 2018, approaching a new 183.60 buy point. Apple dipped 0.2% to 177.84 on Wednesday. The RS line is at consolidation highs but hasn't made much progress in 11 months.On the downside, the stock's recent advance has been in light volume.Apple was off 1.4% in premarket trading.

42,NOV,"The bumpy path of Desmond Meade's life meandered to its current interesting point. He is a graduate of Florida International University law school but cannot vote in his home state because his path went through prison: He committed non-violent felonies concerning drugs and other matters during the 10 years when he was essentially homeless. And Florida is one of eleven states that effectively disqualify felons permanently.Meade is one of 1.6 million disenfranchised Florida felons — more people than voted in 22 states in 2016. He is one of the 20% of African-American Floridians disenfranchised. The state has a low threshold for felonious acts: Someone who gets into a bar fight, or steals property worth $300 — approximately two pairs of Air Jordans — or even drives without a license for a third time can be disenfranchised for life. There is a cumbersome, protracted process whereby an individual, after waiting five to seven years (it depends on the felony) can begin a trek that can consume 10 years and culminates with politicians and their appointees deciding who can vote.Meade heads the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, which gathered more than a million signatures to get the state Supreme Court to approve, and local supervisors of elections to verify, the ballot initiative that voters will decide on Nov. 6. Meade's basic argument on behalf of what he calls ""returning citizens"" like him is: ""I challenge people to say that they never want to be forgiven for anything they've done."" Persons convicted of murder or felony sexual offense would not be eligible for enfranchisement.Intelligent and informed people of good will can strenuously disagree about the wisdom of policies that have produced mass incarceration. What is, however, indisputable is that this phenomenon creates an enormous problem of facilitating the re-entry into society of released prisoners who were not improved by the experience of incarceration and who face discouraging impediments to employment and other facets of social normality. In 14 states and the District of Columbia, released felons automatically recover their civil rights.Recidivism among Florida's released felons has been approximately 30% for the five years 2011-2015. Of the 1,952 persons whose civil rights were restored, five committed new offenses, a recidivism rate of 0.4%. This sample is skewed by self-selection — over-representation of those who had the financial resources and tenacity to navigate the complex restoration process that each year serves a few hundred of the 1.6 million. Still, the recidivism numbers are suggestive.What compelling government interest is served by felon disenfranchisement? Enhanced public safety? How? Is it to fine-tune the quality of the electorate? This is not a legitimate government objective for elected officials to pursue. A felony conviction is an indelible stain: What intelligent purpose is served by reminding felons, who really do not require reminding, of their past, and by advertising it to their community? The rule of law requires punishments, but it is not served by punishments that never end and that perpetuate a social stigma and a sense of never fully re-entering the community.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMeade, like one-third of the 4.7 million current citizens nationwide who have re-entered society from prison but cannot vote, is an African-American. More than one in 13 African-Americans nationally are similarly disenfranchised, as are one in five of Florida's African-American adults. Because African-Americans overwhelmingly vote Democratic, ending the disenfranchisement of felons could become yet another debate swamped by partisanship, particularly in Florida, the largest swing state, where close elections are common: Republican Governor Rick Scott's margins of victory in 2010 and 2014 were 1.2% and 1.1%, respectively. And remember the 537 Florida votes that made George W. Bush president.Last week, Scott's administration challenged a federal judge's order that the state adopt a rights-restoration procedure that is less arbitrary and dilatory. A Quinnipiac poll shows that 67% of Floridians favor and only 27% oppose enfranchisement of felons. These numbers might provoke Republicans, who control both houses of the legislature, to try to siphon away support for the restoration referendum by passing a law that somewhat mitigates the severity of the current policy. Such a law would be presented for the signature of the governor, who is trying to unseat three-term Democratic senator Bill Nelson.Again, who is comfortable with elected politicians winnowing the electorate? When the voting results from around the nation are reported on the evening of Nov. 6, some actual winners might include 1.6 million Floridians who were not allowed to cast ballots.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Other columns by George Will

43,NOV,"William J. O'Neil built IBD's ""10 Secrets To Success"" column as an action plan for anyone who wants to create a better life for oneself or for others.Secret No. 1? ""How You Think Is Everything."" In other words, stay focused on success.Secret No. 10: ""Be Honest And Dependable; Take Responsibility.""Perhaps an 11th secret helps the founder of Investor's Business Daily and Investors.com continue to influence readers today:No matter how big you've hit it, be modest. Stay humble.Editor's Note: The Chartered Market Technician Association recently honored Investor's Business Daily founder William O'Neil with a Lifetime Achievement Award. Bill O'Neil was one of the first people on Wall Street — and remains one of the few — to combine fundamental research with technical analysis, giving everyday investors the tools to change their lives. For readers who might not know the man who built IBD, we are updating and republishing this Leaders & Success profile, which first appeared four years ago on IBD's 30th anniversary. If you walked into his office at IBD's Los Angeles headquarters a few years ago, you would have found it similar to the way it was about 10 years earlier in 2004, when IBD celebrated its 20th birthday.The room was the same size as before, with barely enough space to house a conference table and shelves. Same metal desk. Same gray carpet. No mahogany paneling. No Impressionist or postmodernist paintings on the wall.Instead, it featured a portrait of a dog, front pages of IBD and a photo of O'Neil meeting President Reagan in the Oval Office in the 1980s.When a reporter asked O'Neil, ""Outside of starting IBD, what is the achievement you are most proud of?"" the Oklahoma native, now 85, arched his eyebrows, breathed deeply and shrugged.""I don't think of that, don't look at that very much,"" he replied. ""I think starting a business is important because you've got the total freedom to start and create what you want. We've obviously created products that have helped a lot of people.""He added: ""If you want to start a business, you've got to have some experience in the field. If you're going to be selling peanut butter or something, you better have some experience with peanut butter.""O'Neil never joins a conversation with an intention to boast. He publicly cares less about what success he's had and more about the organization's mission today: Make readers smarter investors.""I think the stock market is complicated itself, and not very many people really understand how the stock market works,"" he said. ""If you're going to invest in the stock market, you're going to make mistakes. The typical person doesn't want to buy and then turn around and sell it for a loss. To some extent, to be very successful in the market, you've got to do what you have to do, which means taking some profits and taking some losses.""O'Neil has done very well in a large number of stocks over the decades. In 1962, as a broker at Hayden Stone in Los Angeles, he made profits of more than $200,000 (more than $1.5 million in today's money) in a short play on discount department store chain Korvette, a long investment in Chrysler and a buy in Syntex, one of the first companies to cash in on the birth control pill.That haul helped the graduate of Southern Methodist University start his own institutional stock research firm — William O'Neil + Co. — on Nov. 7, 1963. One of the company's early achievements: managing money for the Vatican.In 2013, O'Neil's research firm celebrated 50 years in the business. It remains a force in the world of institutional stock research.He was one of the first people to use computers to collect vital stock information, and one of the first to place key information on fundamentals and buying trends by mutual funds and top money management firms right on the stock chart.These simple innovations made his products stand out immediately.""How did William O'Neil + Company survive and grow over 50 years? We concentrated on stocks, the one thing we know best,"" O'Neil wrote in the introduction to the book ""50 Years of Independent Market Vision."" ""People asked me why I didn't buy bonds or commodities. The answer was simple: I didn't want to be distracted.""He added: ""Just the concept of concentrating, seeing all the details, is important to innovation and being the best.""Twenty-one years after founding the securities company, O'Neil in 1984 launched Investor's Daily (later changed to Investor's Business Daily) with a mind toward building a new business and helping individual investors use the same tools as top money managers to find stock market winners.Today, IBD is more than a paper and a website. It hosts dozens of beginning-to-advanced-level workshops as well as IBD Summits to help investors of all levels, including money managers, to become smarter in the stock market and make consistent profits through the platforms Investors.com, Leaderboard, SwingTrader and MarketSmith.Awareness of IBD continues to grow. Investor's Business Daily reaches over 5 million investors each month who access IBD content across platforms including digital, mobile, print, events, meetups and social media.Brian Edwards, a former high school English teacher who moved to Southeast Asia to start an online toy manufacturing business, first met O'Neil during a two-day Level 4 Masters program workshop in Los Angeles in 2004.An active growth investor, Edwards asked O'Neil about the paper's online direction and whether he felt overwhelmed by the changes sweeping the media industry.""I was looking for insights. Bill's response was knowledgeable and reassuring, down-to-earth, the meat-and-potatoes variety. I like meat and potatoes,"" Edwards told IBD. ""Bill's investment approach is similar. He urges one to follow historically valid rules and not to get overwhelmed by emotion. He has found stability in an environment others find chaotic.""Does O'Neil ever take losses in stocks? Of course. One reason for his success in the market is the ability to consistently keep losses small, usually in the 3%-4% range.He quickly learned the benefit of acting fast when you realize you have made a mistake.In addition, early in his stock-investment career, O'Neil made a point to meet Gerald Loeb in New York. Loeb was making serious money as a stockbroker and wrote the investment classic ""The Battle for Investment Survival.""In that book, he advised people to limit losses to 10% in any stock.Loeb, a California native, went to Los Angeles and visited O'Neil, who recalls: ""As he was leaving, I asked Loeb, 'Do you always sell every stock in trouble at 10%?' He said, 'I would hope to be out of them much quicker than that.' ""Born in Oklahoma City, O'Neil moved with his family to Muskogee, roughly 40 miles southeast of Tulsa, when he was young.His father had left the family by then, but O'Neil says his aunt motivated him to strive for success. She encouraged him to sell magazines to women in the neighborhood when he was in grade school.O'Neil listened. Soon he landed a better-paying job on a newspaper route. He loved sports, particularly baseball, and worked hard to earn the extra $20 needed to buy a new glove or bat. After school, he hustled to finish his newspaper route so he could join baseball games.""I was a pitcher. You're competing with nine batters all game long. You can do all right, then in the sixth inning, one of them beats you,"" said O'Neil, who also played the cornet. ""I think I learned something from sports and a couple other activities.""O'Neil stresses that it's crucial to listen and learn from the very best in their respective fields.The same philosophy applies to books. O'Neil once bought a library of investment books and found that most were junk. Only five or six really helped him learn how to make money in the stock market.O'Neil himself has produced four editions of ""How to Make Money in Stocks"", a best-seller.""Everyone and his brother has written a book on investing,"" he said. ""Find out who is successful in a field, and if they've written a book, then the writing is from somebody who's been there, done that and been successful in that field. That, I think, is the whole key.""O'Neil is upbeat about the stock market's prospects over the next 30 years. ""The country will grow and continue to grow as it's done in the past. You cannot hold human nature down,"" he said. ""And you've got this freedom in the country, so there's a lot of opportunity. There will be new inventions, new developments, new companies. That I wouldn't worry about.""You have this constant renewal of new products coming along, new services coming along, and a company does pretty well for a while. Then the company either gets too large to grow or is replaced by someone else.

44,NOV,"Concern over an intensifying conflict between the U.S. and China over the gaping trade deficit remained front and center in the stock market on Friday, sending the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 2%.At 23,950, the Dow Jones industrial average still remains above the key 200-day moving average but is also down more than 2% year to date.At 2 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 saw their losses to expand around 1.9% to 2%. The S&P SmallCap 600 sank 1.7%.Volume is running lower on both exchanges vs. the same time Thursday.Micron Technology (MU) nearly gave back all of its stout gains from a 47.08 entry in a double-bottom base. Shares dropped to as low as 47.26 before rebounding.When a leading stock breaks out and rises at least 10% past the proper buy point, a good sell rule is to exit the position if the stock threatens to do a complete round trip of those large short-term gains. Such negative action indicates the general market is either highly choppy or in correction mode.On March 19, IBD downgraded the current outlook (as seen in IBD's Big Picture) to ""Uptrend under pressure"" from ""Market in confirmed uptrend"" after the S&P 500 logged as many as six distribution days. A distribution occurs when the major indexes fall 0.2% or more in higher turnover vs. the prior day. IBD uses NYSE composite volume to study the price-and-volume action of the S&P 500.Six trading sessions later on March 29, IBD noted via The Big Picture column that the current outlook got downgraded again, this time to ""Market in correction."" During this phase, it's smart strategy to raise cash, lock in gains, cut losses, and sit on the sidelines.

46,NOV,"CAN SLIM investing in growth stocks can be a good match with retirement plans? Why?When it comes to generating retirement income from stocks via dividend investing, capital gains still matter. That's the main ingredient of growth stocks, which IBD's CAN SLIM investing method favors.This sounds unconventional if one thinks the only ""sure"" way to generate retirement income from stocks is to load up on century-old blue chip stocks. Either those or big utilities that pay a solid dividend, quarter after quarter.Yet an ""unconventional"" approach to finding, buying and selling stocks can be a gold mine of income for disciplined investors. What does it take? The ability to follow investing rules and don't let opinions interfere with the process.So why not employ the research-driven technique of selecting the best growth stock companies to enhance your annual return? By doing so you can avoid long-term erosion of your nest egg.It takes true commitment to study and monitor the market, learning from mistakes, and some patience to generate income from stocks. Mastering IBD's seven-point CAN SLIM investing paradigm for selecting, buying and selling stocks takes discipline. But the rewards are clear.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSuppose you have a $500,000 retirement account. You need $50,000 a year to live comfortably. If none of that money in your retirement account is invested, the gas tank goes empty in 10 years.You'll get income if you invested the entire wad in a basket of stocks that pay dividends with, say, an annual yield of 3%. That's well more than the 2% the S&P 500 provides today. Assuming no change in underlying stock prices, you could expect to receive $15,000 of cash dividends. Not enough income for your spending needs.Consider this option. Allocate half of the $500,000 toward highly ranked growth stocks. Ranked by what? Earnings growth, sales, profit margin, return on equity, industry leadership and rising fund sponsorship, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. You limit your buys to just six stocks during the year, investing $50,000 each time. Assume none of these stocks pay cash back to shareholders.Suppose three of the stocks turn out to be losers. You cut losses at -5% (equal to a $2,500 loss), -8% (-$4,000) and -8% (-$4,000). The other three make money. You achieve gains of 10% ($5,000 profit), 20% ($10,000) and 50% ($25,000). By year's end, you've amassed a net short-term capital gain of $29,500 before taxes, a return of almost 12% on half of your total portfolio.Now, suppose you place the other $250,000 in investment-grade corporate bonds, ultrasteady megacap blue chips with dividends yields of 2% to 4%. And some of that to perhaps some municipal bonds. Then you might earn approximately $7,500 in interest and dividend payments or more. This boosts your total gain to $37,000. The total return hits 7.4%.IBD's TAKE: The Dividend Leaders screen, part of IBD Data Tables in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com, is one place to look for dividend-rich companies with highly stable earnings, critical for paying out future dividends.Now, withdraw 5% of the total portfolio, or $25,000, for your living expenses. Use Social Security and pensions to get the additional income for living costs. That leaves an extra $12,000 in your portfolio, giving the account a total boost of roughly 2.4%. That's enough to counter a potential loss of purchasing power due to inflation.Rinse and repeat. Chances look good that your nest egg will last a long time.You can start your search by looking at growth stock screens at Investors.com and in the IBD Weekly. IBD Big Cap 20 is a good place to look for stocks with both growth potential and cash payouts. Superregional banks Regions Financial (RF) and Northern Trust (NTRS), as well as investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) and insurer Sun Life Financial (SLF) joined the Big Cap 20 in the Nov. 14, 2016, edition of IBD Weekly. All four pay dividends to shareholders, but capital gains in the months that followed proved more valuable to shareholders.Since then, Regions has done well. Even amid the current market correction, through Thursday's close, the Birmingham, Ala., institution has doubled from a 10.10 long saucer buy point; Northern Trust has climbed 50% past a 73.84 cup with handle entry; Morgan Stanley has rolled ahead 82% since an early October breakout past 32.47. And Sun Life has risen as much as 31% past a 33.93 saucer-with-handle pivot point before correcting again and working on a brand-new base.Sector rotation can hamper traditional income-generating plays. Consider Verizon (VZ). In late January 2016, the telecom rallied past a 47.33 buy point within a long saucer base and gained 20% by July 5. But over the next four months, Verizon gave back all of that gain. In 2017, integrated telecoms turned out to be market laggards.Instead of sitting through the disappointing round trip, use IBD's common-sense sell rule of taking at least some gains at 20%-25%. Redeploy the money in a more promising growth stock investment or park the profits in cash. In some cases, you need to take profits more quickly, especially when the market's ride gets rough.Alphabet (GOOGL) serves up a recent example. The megacap tech broke out of an 11-week flat base with a 1,006.29 buy point on Oct. 11, 2017. After a brief stumble, the stock really got moving a few weeks later, thanks to a strong gap up in price on Oct. 27. That helped spark a nearly 19% run to a new high of 1,197 on Jan. 29 of this year.But as seen in a daily chart, Alphabet succumbed to the sharp volatility and fast correction seen in stocks in early February. By Feb. 8, the Google search engine owner completed a round-trip of those solid gains. Lesson? It's fine to sell and preserve at least some profits before they all disappear. You can always buy a great stock such as Alphabet again.Do not dismiss the strategy of raising cash near major market tops. No matter how great a company's management or how big the cash dividend, you want to sidestep serious damage to any of your growth stocks. You can always buy shares back when market conditions improve. Reading IBD's The Big Picture column will help you spot these all-important junctures in the market.Will you panic and sell late if stocks go into a bear market? At some point, equities will fall hard again. Just look at the equity markets in 1990, 1998, 2000-02, 2008-09 and 2011. In every instance, at least one major index fell 20% or more from its 52-week peak.

47,NOV,"Roger Wittenberg started Trex Company (TREX) in the mid-1980s with just a few crumbs — breadcrumbs, actually.Wittenberg had a business where he crushed unused loaves of bread and sold the crumbs to farms and kitchens. But then there were countless plastic bags in which the unused loaves had been wrapped that were left over.""He believed the best way to make money was through recycling products — taking things no one else wanted and developing a product that utilized that material and selling it,"" current Trex Chief Executive Jim Cline told Investor's Business Daily.So Wittenberg combined the plastic bags with sawdust and other materials to make a fireplace log, but it wasn't very flammable and gave off a plastic stench. He tossed the unburned logs behind his barn and forgot about them. Months later, those logs proved resilient in the weather and sun, and it dawned on Wittenberg that his would-be recipe for a log might work better as composite decking.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTurns out he was right — in a big way. As of 2016, Trex had 45% market share of the composite decking market — a niche that accounts for about 17% of all decks, according to consultants Principia Partners. Cline thinks Trex has gained market share in that time, and is winning more customers than the much more prevalent wood decks. There are an estimated 40 million decks in North America, Cline said.Wall Street also is bullish on Trex's chances. B. Riley FBR analyst Alex Rygiel notes in a Nov. 8 report that composite decking is expected to make up 21% of the total deck market by 2021 at a conversion rate of 1% per year. Taking away just 1% market share from wood equals $50 million in annual sales, Trex says.""Not only is Trex taking market share from within the composite deck board market, but the market is taking share from traditional wood,"" Rygiel said. ""These two market-share gaining successes are providing a multiplier to growth.""The company's shares have rocketed 58% over the past 12 months and are worth more than six times what they were at the end of 2012 when Trex and the nation were emerging from the 2008-2009 recession. Shares were up 2.8% near 109 Thursday afternoon.In February, Trex reported its 2017 sales, which marked a record for the fifth consecutive year. Net sales advanced 18% to $565.2 million for the year. Earnings also increased to a record $3.22 per share, rising 41% year over year. Sales were light but profit topped expectations.Trex has a $3.15 billion market cap, putting it in the top quarter in IBD's 43-company Building-Construction Products/Miscellaneous industry group. Trex stock began forming a flat base in early January with a buy point at 120.50.But things weren't always so rosy for Trex. After Wittenberg made his discovery, he sold the technology to Mobil Oil in 1992 and was hired by the company. Four years later, after the Exxon Mobil (XOM) merger, four executives, including Wittenberg, retrieved the decking division back again in a leveraged buyout.Trex went public in 1999 and rapidly grew through the mid-2000s. Then it began to struggle, Cline said. By 2007, two of the founders came out of retirement to help the limping business and brought in Ron Kaplan to head it up. Kaplan, in turn, persuaded then semi-retired Cline to join.""That was the beginning of a really dramatic turnaround of the company,"" Cline said. Cline took the reins in August 2015 and Kaplan remained on as chairman.Key to the turnaround was the advent of Trex's Transcend Composite Decking in 2010. This second-generation product introduced a chemically and physically bonded shell over the surface of Trex's core first-generation board.""It enabled us to guarantee our boards wouldn't fade and wouldn't stain for the life of the deck — or 25 years,"" he said. ""That was a dramatic change in the industry and if you looked at all the decking products we manufacture today, they didn't exist prior to 2010.""Most of Trex's competitors have followed suit, he said. Among those are Advanced Environmental Recycling Technologies (AERT) and privately held Fiberon and AZEK/Timber Tech.Trex's composite decking is comprised of 95% recycled materials including plastic bags, stretch wrap and post-industrial waste blended with material from flooring manufacturers and sawdust, Cline said. The exact recipe is a company secret.Its manufacturing allows the company to use polyurethane that is considered otherwise undesirable because it contains certain colors. Cline estimates Trex pays 10 cents-20 cents per pound depending on the coloring. Bright reds and bold blues are undesirable, but are obscured in the final product due to manufacturing processes. Rivals often use polyurethane that costs 55 cents-60 cents.The resulting product is more durable than materials like wood, early-generation composite and PVC. Unlike wood, composite decking won't rot, split, swell, twist or fade. It doesn't splinter easily or require annual maintenance. It isn't subject to insect infestation and doesn't add to deforestation.Upfront, composite decking costs more than wood, Cline says. But over time, the maintenance on wood decks adds up significantly.To put up a Trex deck that is 20 feet by 25 feet, it costs $2,703-$4,450, depending on which product the customer selects. All of its products have a 25-year warranty. A wood deck might cost just $890 initially, but could run up to $8,703 in maintenance costs over a 10-to-15-year lifespan, Trex estimates.""It's twice the life for half the cost,"" Cline told IBD. ""There's more money paid up front for composite decking material than there is for wood. But eventually, the composite becomes much less expensive over time.""Trex has significant room to grow as it keeps chipping away at wood decks. In its March 2018 presentation to investors, Trex estimated the U.S. residential decking and commercial railing markets at $6 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Exterior improvements capture 34% of home improvement spending, the company said.Marketing, too, has made a shift in the last decade. In the past, consumers would rely on contractors to make a decision regarding the floor used in their decks. Today, the customer is savvier and willing to do research to identify the best option.The company is also working to expand in Europe, Asia, Australia and the Middle East. Last July, it formed a commercial subsidiary with the acquisition of SC Company for $71.5 million, enhancing Trex's presence in the commercial railing market. That segment is growing faster than core sales.Today, Trex also makes railings, pergolas and furniture, Cline said. The goal is to become a broadly ""outdoor products company."" Cline recognizes that outdoor products are often discretionary spending, subject to the whims of the economy. In 2011, Trex was in the throes of the Great Recession and saw sales take a 20% hit from its peak to its trough. He doesn't expect Trex to experience pangs like that again.""The last downturn was probably the worst I've seen in my lifetime,"" he said. ""Looking at that 20%, I don't expect we'd see that kind of decline in another environment. Now that we have products the customer is looking for, I think the decline would probably be closer to 10%-15%.""RELATED:Jim Cline Helped Rebuild A Teetering Trex Into A Global LeaderShopify Is Killing It By Making Businesses Win OnlineAtlassian's Collaborative Software May Change Future Of The Office

49,NOV,"Elections: Facebook now faces myriad legal actions for its apparent misuse of private data on its members. But one possible legal problem that isn't getting any attention involves whether Facebook (FB) made, and the Obama campaign accepted, illegal ""in-kind"" contributions to Obama's 2012 re-election effort.As we noted earlier, the Obama campaign's use of Facebook data dwarfed anything Trump did. Cambridge Analytica purchased data from an academic, who gathered it in 2014 through an app that said the data would only be used for academic purposes. There's no question that was misleading.But by the time the general election rolled around, the Trump campaign had dumped Cambridge as a consultant, which means the data Cambridge bought had no impact on the general election.In contrast, the Obama campaign's use of Facebook was massive, and even more intrusive. About a million people let the campaign gather not only data on themselves, but on all their friends, who didn't know their data was being harvested as well — a number that could easily have reached 190 million, which, at the time, was about equal to every active Facebook user in the U.S.Obama's tech gurus were able to match this rich treasure trove of personal data — likes, dislikes, photos, etc. — with other databases, creating the largest and most detailed profiles on voters ever assembled.And the campaign aggressively used its unique access to influence millions of people the campaign identified as ""persuadable,"" sending them highly targeted campaign messages that appeared to come from their Facebook friends, rather than the Obama campaign.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseObama's people saw this as a massive advantage, telling the press after the election that it was ""the most groundbreaking piece of technology developed for the campaign."" The press, in turn, heralded Obama for his brilliance at leveraging social media to activate voters and win an election at a time when its approval ratings were low and the economy was doing poorly.Apparently, Facebook knew its user data was being harvested en masse, but didn't care.After the Cambridge Analytica story broke, an Obama campaign staffer, Carol Davidsen, tweeted about how ""Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but they didn't stop us once they realized what we were doing."" By ""whole social graph,"" she presumably meant profiles of every Facebook user in the U.S.She went on to tell the Washington Post that ""We would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.""She also said that Facebook officials came to the campaign offices after the election recruiting Obama's tech team, and that ""they were very candid that they allowed us to do things they wouldn't have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side.""This wasn't entirely new news, by the way. The New York Times reported in 2013, in another glowing piece on Obama's tech team, how ""The campaign's exhaustive use of Facebook triggered the site's internal safeguards."" Facebook's response, according to one campaign official: ""They'd sigh and say, 'You can do this as long as you stop doing it on Nov. 7.'""That's where the potential legal trouble starts. Despite all the hosannas for Obama's technical prowess, the arrangement between the campaign and Facebook might have been outside the law.According to Heritage Foundation election expert Hans von Spakovsky, federal law ""bans corporations from making 'direct or indirect' contributions to federal candidates.""That ban, he says, doesn't just include cash, but anything of value. ""In other words, corporations cannot provide federal candidates with free services of any kind.""He goes on, if ""Facebook gave the Obama campaign free access to this type of data when it normally does not do so for other entities — or usually charges for such access — then Facebook would appear to have violated the federal ban on in-kind contributions by a corporation. And the Obama campaign may have violated the law by accepting such a corporate contribution.""To be sure, von Spakovsky isn't saying that Facebook or Obama did break the law, only that, given what Davidsen has now admitted (and so far as we know, no one from Facebook has disputed her claims), the Federal Election Commission, if not the Justice Dept., should investigate.""Carol Davidsen's admissions should provide a sufficient basis for opening a federal investigation of what may have been a serious violation of the law,"" he concludes.We agree. And if the mainstream press weren't so pro-Obama and anti-Trump, you'd be hearing a lot more people besides von Spakovsky calling for such an investigation.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Facebook Privacy Scandal: Why Regulation Is Not The AnswerFunny, When Obama Harvested Facebook Data On Millions Of Users To Win In 2012, Everyone Cheered

50,NOV,"You've likely seen or heard numerous talking heads and stock market experts say the current bull market, now in Year 10, is extra-long in the tooth. That's true.William O'Neil, author of the growth stock investing classic ""How to Make Money in Stocks"" and founder and chairman of IBD, has frequently noted that the typical market rally lasts three to four years, while a sharp correction runs for about nine months, possibly a bit longer.Notice how this pattern has been tossed aside lately?The March 2000-to-October 2002 Nasdaq crash lasted for two years and seven months. A five-year bull run followed, which then set the stage for another violent decline. The January 2008-to-March 2009 bear market lasted for nearly 15 months from peak to trough.Common sense would say that the extreme severity of decline in each of those bear markets is one reason why the rebounds in equity prices have lasted longer than average. The market simply needed more time to mop up those losses and stretch into new high ground.In the realm of equities, greed is slow yet steady most of the time. Fear runs at a much quicker pace and thus tends to carry a sharp bite —  like a habanero chili pepper that's a little more picante than expected.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMany market pros stress that in the equities market, a bull doesn't die of old age. Instead, the market falls in anticipation of a major economic decline.As an individual investor, you simply cannot read every quarterly report or digest every weekly and monthly report on the economy. You alone can simply not predict that the manufacturing industry is going into a deep freeze three months from now, that China's real estate market will crash six months after the lunar new year, how deep the U.S.-China trade war could punish the global economy, or what the next country will be to default on its sovereign debt.So is there a simpler way to take action when the market appears ready for a big fall? Absolutely. Watch the market itself. The market is the sum of buying and selling decisions by millions of money managers, both big and small. No one is smarter than the market as a whole. So why not track it on a daily basis and pay attention to instances of unusually strong professional selling? When the smartest members of the Big Money rush for the exit, you can see it.IBD calls it distribution.Distribution days can be likened to a fine wine. A glass or two is fine. It's social, and it's probably good for your digestive system. But one too many will send you reeling.A distribution day is defined as the loss of at least 0.2% (without rounding up) by a major index — the Nasdaq, the NYSE composite or the S&P 500 — as volume ticks higher than the prior session's total. Tracking the accumulated damage is crucial to gauging a market's health.Why? Because distribution days almost always are signs that institutions are exiting the market. And, as the big funds control the bulk of daily volume and hence the overall market's direction, you can't expect stocks to rise without those big guns on your side.How many is too many? For now, the market could probably withstand six or seven distribution days before rolling over — especially when most or all of those declines are small in scale. Keep in mind, too, that if the S&P 500 or Nasdaq drops, say, 0.5% or 0.6% but finishes well in the upper half of the session's trading range amid higher turnover, such action may actually indicate solid institutional support, not a door-busting exit.Indeed, the market has sometimes been saddled with as many as eight or nine technical distribution days, yet still lumber higher. Use the Market Pulse table in IBD's The Big Picture Column every day to instantly track the exact distribution-day count. The column itself will go into the nuances surrounding the distribution as well.Happily, a distribution day does not necessarily scar the market permanently. There are three ways a distribution day can fall off the count. The first is by the calendar. After 25 sessions, a distribution day expires. The count falls by one.A second way a distribution day can fall off the count is for the index to rise 5%, on an intraday basis, from its close on the day the higher-volume loss appears. In the past, the rise had to reach 6%, when the stock market showed greater than normal volatility. As with most problems, a bull market is a great curative.The third way is far more painful. A broad market correction makes the distribution day count a moot point. Often, a high distribution-day count will presage that correction. Once the market falls into a correction, the big question is when it will regain its uptrend.When a follow-through day arrives, signifying a new uptrend, the distribution-day count starts clean at zero for all three key indexes.The distribution-day count could have kept you out of the market in early 2008, when a series of declines snowballed into the worst rout in recent memory. As it happened, the count rose as the indexes fell.Look at the chart of the S&P 500 at the end of 2007. See how distribution days mounted just before the collapse: Dec. 11, 2007, -2.5% (1); Dec. 17, -1.5% (2); Dec. 27, -1.4% (3); Dec. 31, -0.7% (4); and Jan. 2, 2008, -1.4% (5). All were meaty declines, indeed. And each time, volume rose on the NYSE vs. the prior trading session.On Jan. 4, 2008, you saw a 2.5% sell-off (6) and the sixth distribution day in 25 sessions. That's the day the Market Pulse declared a market correction.On Dec. 31, 2007, the S&P 500 finished the year at 1468. By Nov. 21, 2008, the large-cap index fell almost 50% to as low as 741. A six-week rebound didn't achieve much, and in the first three months of 2008, stocks resumed their bear-market slide. By March 6, 2009, the S&P 500 notched a 12-year low of 666.79, a 54.5% slide from the 2007 peak.(A version of this story ran in the March 5, 2012, edition of IBD.

At the end of the most recent quarter, the company has already opened seven e-commerce stores in fiscal-year 2018, ending late March.In the most recent quarter, earnings and sales grew 48% and 36%, respectively. Looking forward to fiscal-year 2019, earnings are expected to rise 27%.The Toronto-based company quickly flew to a 75% gain from a cup with handle's 21.84 buy point after an earnings-related surge on Nov. 9.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHowever, it is worrisome that the left side of the base consists of just one week — a week in which the stock plunged about 26% off its all-time high price of 38.25 in massive turnover. The company likely faced excessively high expectations even as it beat the Street's targets in its Feb. 8 earnings release.After the 26% correction, the stock is forming the right side of a potential cup-shaped base with a 38.35 buy point.Another concern is the lack of upside volume on the stock's rebound. Ideally, the stock should fall in light volume, while recovering in heavy volume to indicate strong institutional demand.Also, be on the lookout for a new handle to form that would lower the risk-optimal entry from 38.35.As a result, the stock's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a slightly favorable C+ — according to IBD Stock Checkup. Look for that to improve as the stock finishes out the right side of its basing process.Meanwhile, Canada Goose stock boasts a 98 out of a highest-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating. The rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics designed to gauge a stock's leadership qualities.Lastly, the stock's relative strength line — the line painted in blue on every daily and weekly MarketSmith and IBD chart — has yet to reach a new high. The RS line should hit a new high on the breakout day or shortly thereafter to confirm the stock's strength.RELATED:IPO Stock News And Analysis: Find Today's Top New IssuesRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchAI Stock And Alibaba IoT Partner With 217% Growth Tests Buy ZoneWhen To Sell Stocks: Get Ready For An Exit When The Group's Leaders Crumble

54,NOV,"The Dow Jones industrial average stretched its gain to 0.8% and notched session highs before surrendering all of that advance. At around 2:45 p.m. the Dow slipped about 0.1% after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates by a quarter point, a widely expected move.Still, oil, steel and transport stocks led the market higher and may produce new solid breakouts.At least nine of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrials had rallied 1 point or more ahead of the U.S. central bank's decision, and Boeing (BA) at one point took a strong step toward potentially reclaiming its rising 50-day moving average. Shares of the plane and satellite maker rolled up more than 3 points to as high as 341.88, cutting a swift 13.3% drop from its 371.60 peak by nearly half, before reversing lower and falling around 0.2%.Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, noted that ""the statement gave a reprieve to the concern of a fourth rate hike this year, although if inflation continues to gain traction, the FOMC appears ready to include a fourth rate increase.""Fellow Dow 30 component Chevron (CVX) and numerous other oil and gas exploration companies rose sharply on the back of another big spike in West Texas Intermediate crude prices. Chevron rose 2.9% to 117.80 but still lies beneath its 50-day line. Watch for the right side of a potential new base to build. The base's left-side high is 133.88.The integrated oil major has shown nifty top-line growth as revenues rose 42%, 18%, 20% and 19% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. The Street sees Chevron earning $1.48 a share, up 5%, and revenue jumping 21% to $40.47 billion.WTI futures gained more than 2% and reached $65.24 a barrel, the highest level since December 2015. Weekly U.S. crude oil supplies sank by 2.6 million barrels in the latest reported week. The U.S. dollar fell mildly vs. both the euro and the Japanese yen.IBD's Canadian oil and gas exploration group showed the strongest gain, up 8.6%. Through Tuesday's close, the group ranked a lowly 194th among 197 IBD industry groups and subgroups for six-month relative performance.The S&P 500 rallied nearly 0.6% while the Nasdaq composite lifted 0.5%, padding its year-to-date gain to 7.2%. The Dow continues to lag by rising around 0.8% since Jan. 1 at 24,928. Semiconductor, steel, railroad, basic chemical and automaker firms also scored gains of 2% or more.In Leaderboard, Luxembourg-based steel pipe specialist Tenaris (TS) reaffirmed the notion that 2018 is going to be another year for the stockpickers. The member of IBD's Steel-Producers industry group flew almost 5% higher to 37.53 in roughly average turnover and is in buy range after a second breakout attempt from a long, deep cup with handle.Tenaris, who serves many oil and gas companies across North America, joined Leaderboard on March 9. It grew earnings per share 500% and 575% in the past two quarters on sales gains of 32% and 52%.All of the 12 stocks in Leaderboard, which is up more than 10% year to date through Tuesday, featured charts that are annotated with the correct buy points and sell points to help users maximize their profits and minimize losses.Tenaris sports a robust 96 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 in IBD Stock Checkup.Oil firms weren't the only stocks in the vast energy sector to rock.Warrior Met Coal (HCC), highlighted in this Inside The IBD 50 column last week, extended its early gains and jumped more than 5% to 31.64. The solid gain, albeit in light turnover, signals eagerness among institutional investors to not let the stock collapse beneath the rising 50-day moving average.Warrior broke out of a cup with handle at 17.60 on Nov. 13 and is now making its second rebound off the 50-day moving average near 29, a sound follow-on buy point. Even at follow-on entries, investors should always have a defensive system in place by using the golden rule of selling.The Dow transports gained 0.5% as big rallies in delivery service, ship transport, trucking and railroad stocks offset a sell-off in the airline sector.FedEx (FDX), one of the 20 components in the Dow transportation average, rose more than 2% and reached as high as 258 as shares attempt to make a bullish jump back above the 50-day moving average. Volume is running more than double average levels.FedEx on Tuesday posted a 62% boost in earnings for the February-ended fiscal third quarter to $3.72 a share, smashing the Thomson Reuters.The Federal Reserve is widely expected to boost the fed funds rate on overnight loans from the central bank to a 1.5%-1.75% target range during an announcement scheduled for 2 p.m. ET.The U.S. central bank increased short-term interest rates by a quarter point five times from December 2015 to December 2017, and so far it's stuck to a policy of gradual tightening given that inflation is not growing at a fast clip.As reported in the ""Vital Signs"" graphic on top of page A2 in the March 5 edition of IBD Weekly, core consumer prices rose 1.8% vs. year-ago levels, not quite meeting the Fed's target of minimum 2% inflation.

56,NOV,"Schlumberger (SLB), the world's largest oilfield services company, beat fourth-quarter forecasts Friday and expects oil companies to start spending more, while a top oil watchdog predicted U.S. oil output could surge past Saudi Arabia and Russia this year.X The bullish signals in spending and production follow the Q3 reporting season three months ago, when shale producers emphasized spending discipline over production growth.But since then, oil prices hit three-year highs as shale producers have been cutting expenses, with many of them suddenly flush with cash after tax cuts.Citing third-party surveys, Schlumberger expects a 15%-20% increase in North American investments in 2018 and a 5% increase in international spending, the first growth in four years.Those years saw lower spending due to the slump in crude. That, plus output curbs from OPEC and its allies, has translated to a tighter market, easing the supply glut that had weighed on prices.""This means the oil market is now in balance and the previous oversupply discount is gradually being replaced by a market tightness premium, which makes us increasingly positive on the global outlook for our business,"" Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard said in a statement.International markets are especially important to Schlumberger where management said it has four to five times the earnings power than in North American land operations.Shares closed up 0.1% at 76.43 on the stock market today after falling as much as 3% as U.S. crude prices dropped 0.9% to $63.37 a barrel.  Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg said while Schlumberger's outlook comments were generally positive, markets may have been disappointed by lack of a dividend increase.Halliburton (HAL), which is scheduled to report Q4 results Monday and is more exposed to North America, rose 1.3% and Baker Hughes (BHGE), on tap for Wednesday, closed flat. Oil and gas equipment company National Oilwell Varco (NOV) rallied to close up 0.2%. National Oilwell said 2017 results should come in at or above prior expectations.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Schlumberger's adjusted earnings jumped 78% to 48 cents per share while revenue climbed 15% to $8.179 billion. Revenue from North America rose 59% to $2.81 billion during the quarter. Analysts were expecting EPS of 44 cents on revenue of $8.12 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.But Schlumberger took $2.7 billion in charges, with nearly $1 billion related to investments in Venezuela.The company also said it is exiting the marine and land seismic acquisition market, booked a $938 million charge on a Venezuelan investment, and signed a memorandum of understanding with Occidental Petroleum (OXY) for a five-year service project in New Mexico's Delaware basin for 700 wells.Also in a monthly report out Friday, the International Energy Agency raised its outlook for growth in U.S. oil production by 240,000 barrels a day to 1.35 million barrels, enough to top Saudi Arabia and Russia.""Relentless growth should see the U.S. hit historic highs above 10 million barrels a day (in production), overtaking Saudi Arabia and rivaling Russia during the course of 2018 — provided OPEC and non-OPEC restraints remain in place,"" the IEA said.In its own monthly report out Thursday, OPEC said U.S. shale producers lowered break-even costs between 2015 and 2017 but now service companies are raising rig and labor costs so break-even prices are rising.Despite increased costs, OPEC cited a JPMorgan report that found U.S. shale exploration and production companies could achieve ""decent rates of return"" at $60 per barrel even if costs rose by another 15%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalDividend Hikes, Largest IPO Ever Lead 5 Oil Stories To Watch This Year

57,NOV,"Some top international stock funds seek out companies that fit a specific growth trajectory. Others among the best foreign funds for 2018 want to find industry leaders that allocate capital smartly to provide both sustainable growth in earnings and a hefty return to shareholders. And still others take a blanket approach toward a single country, such as Japan.The very best foreign funds recognized in the IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards drummed up unique strategies to stay atop the heap in 2017. They also pose this critical question to the individual investor:""What type of investing style suits me best when trying to build solid long-term gains?""Answering the question may help an investor sit tight when markets get volatile, especially ones overseas. While the names of the best foreign funds may change, the importance of patience and the ability to sell shares near market tops, not at market bottoms, does not change.The MSCI EAFE index rose 25% in 2017. Scores of country-specific or region-focused mutual funds in IBD's annual survey soundly beat this benchmark.But Oppenheimer Global Opportunities (OPGIX), Matthews Asia Dividend Investor (MAPIX), DFA Japanese Small Company (DFJSX) and Wasatch World Innovations Investor (WAGTX) receive a standing ovation for delivering outstanding long-term compounded returns.The MSCI EAFE's average annual return from Jan. 1, 2008, to Dec. 31, 2017, was understandably poor at 1.94%. The Wall Street subprime loan crisis and bankruptcy of Lehman Bros., real estate crashes in Ireland and Spain, the solvency scare of Greece, and three separate bear market declines in mainland China equities — repeat, three — all clawed at equity prices around the globe.Yet $8.4 billion Oppenheimer Global scored an 11.64% annualized gain over that 10-year period through Dec. 31. Matthews Asia achieved a 9.03% gain, DFA Japanese Small Company 8.56%, and Wasatch World Innovations 8.5%.Hennessy Japan Small Cap Investor (HJPSX) took the top rung with a 12.01% average annual return. (See Lawrence Carrell's story for more on the fund.) Morgan Stanley Institutional Global Franchise (MSFAX), Oppenheimer International Small-Mid Company (OSMAX) and Franklin International Small Cap Growth (FKSCX) also hit annualized gains of 8% or more.Oppenheimer Global Opportunities parked more than 40% of its money in U.S. companies, as of Jan. 31. But look at the next seven countries and that group, including the U.K., Germany, Japan, France, Denmark, Italy and Sweden, makes up a slightly greater share of the entire fund's assets at 42.3%.""I'm trying to buy companies that are young in their life cycle, not old value traps,"" portfolio manager Frank Jennings said in an Oppenheimer-produced video. ""Very often there're three or four people running this little business. Altogether they don't know what they're doing, there's certainly no sophisticated management systems. They succeed, it achieves some scale, but it still has that entrepreneurial juice, and that's the powerful phase I am trying to capture before it becomes a saturated bureaucracy.""The average market cap of the holdings stands just below $14 billion, or in midcap range based on IBD's perspective. (IBD Big Cap 20 requires a company's market value to top $15 billion.) The fund's median market cap is even less at $7.8 billion. Global Opportunities tends to own companies with price-to-earnings ratios that exceed the S&P 500.Oppenheimer takes big bets on individual companies. San Francisco-based Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) is the biggest holding, at 11.7% of the entire fund. Even after breaking out of a seven-month base at 25.88 in big volume on Nov. 6 and quadrupling in price, the market value of the developer of treatments that are commercialized by its Big Pharma and biotech partners is $17 billion, a far cry from the megacaps such as Amgen (AMGN) ($136 billion market cap) or Gilead Sciences (GILD) ($106 billion).Other large holdings that perhaps carry this ""lean yet mean"" corporate flavor include industrial laser maker Coherent (COHR), social media giant Twitter (TWTR), household carbonated beverage systems pioneer SodaStream (SODA) and 3-D computer-aided design software firm PTC (PTC).Matthews Asia Dividend benefited from what it called a ""Goldilocks scenario"" in Asian equities thanks to improving inflationary conditions and ""moderate monetary policy from Asia's central banks,"" the fund's managers wrote in a semiannual commentary to shareholders. ""Concerns over potential systemic risks also subsided, most evident in the stabilizing Chinese economy. Reflecting the improving macroeconomic environment, Asian currencies mostly strengthened against the U.S. dollar in another tailwind for Asian equities.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMatthews Asia Dividend buys both steady dividend payers and ""dividend growers,"" which tend to be cyclical firms that have plenty of untapped growth potential. The sector allocation fully reflects this thinking; consumer discretionary holds the biggest piece at 26.1% of the international mutual fund's holdings through Dec. 31, while consumer staples ranks No. 2 at 18.5%. Financials rank 3rd at 18.3%, information technology 4th at 9.5%.As of Feb. 28, Matthews Asia Dividend showed five of the top 10 holdings hailing from either mainland China or Hong Kong, including Minth Group, China Construction Bank and Ping An Insurance. South Korea's Hyundai Motors and semiconductor expert Rohm of Japan also make the top 10.DFA Japanese Small Company Portfolio holds companies that barely make the radar screens of most foreign stock funds. Among its 1,782 stocks, the average weighted market cap is $1.18 billion. The industrial, consumer discretionary, IT, materials and financial sectors make up more than 80% of the fund's $4.2 billion in assets fed to its corresponding Master Fund.The annual turnover rate is extremely low among active funds, 10% through Oct. 31, 2016.The $234 million Wasatch World Innovations is an aggressive growth fund that currently sees strong growth potential in the U.S., the U.K., France and Japan. Nine of its top 10 holdings, including media turnaround play New York Times (NYT), Costco Wholesale (COST), Sony (SNE) and Nintendo (NTDOY) hail from those four countries alone.The 10th holding is SodaStream.

The Street sees earnings rising an additional 5% in 2018 and 15% in 2019.NYT enjoyed a healthy earnings rebound of its own last year, scoring a profit of 80 cents a share, up 40%.

The S&P 500 was down nearly 0.4%.  The Dow Jones industrial average also backtracked and fell 0.3%. The Dow has been meeting resistance at the 50-day moving average this week.The Russell 2000 shed 0.2%. Volume was modestly lower on the NYSE and higher on the Nasdaq compared with the same time on Monday.Trump late Monday issued an order barring the proposed Broadcom takeover of Qualcomm due to national security concerns. Broadcom shares pared gains but were up 1.5% at midday, while Qualcomm fell more than 4% to the lowest level since Nov. 3. Qualcomm shares are also close to testing the 200-day moving average. Shares got choppy after taking out the medium-term 50-day line on Feb. 5.On Tuesday, Trump fired Tillerson as secretary of state, and named CIA Director Mike Pompeo to replace him. Trump announced the changes on Twitter. There was no official announcement on the White House's website.In economic news, core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 0.2% in February. But the annual inflation rate was steady at 1.8%, below forecasts. The soft inflation number eases the odds of a fourth interest-rate hike this year. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was nearly unchanged at 2.86%.The retail sector — including department stores, consumer electronics and home furnishings — performed well in the market today. Homebuilders also were leaders as the group tries to shake off a slump. Airlines and data storage also had notable gains.Hospitals, health care services and medical researchers were among medicals that lagged the market.

59,NOV,"Stocks rose early on Tuesday but the Nasdaq surrendered moderate gains to fall mildly. The Nasdaq composite, up more than 0.6% during the first hour of trading, slumped 0.5% right before lunchtime in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average, up as much as 0.7% after the open, edged slightly lower.Alphabet (GOOGL) helped lead the pullback, falling more than 1% to 1,153. The Google site operator and pioneer in self-driving technology is forming a new base after selling off hard in early February. The megacap internet content firm limited its decline to 17% from a 1,197 peak as shares found support at the 200-day moving average.Meanwhile, semiconductor shares also cooled but still show high relative strength.ASML (ASML) was off around 0.2% but at 210.95 the Dutch chip equipment giant still held above a 208.68 buy point in a three-month base on base, one of the most powerful chart patterns that top growth stocks form before breaking out to new highs and strong price advances.ASML has grown its earnings per share by 25%, 74%, 115%, 34%, 46% and 39% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters on revenue gains of 17% to 53%. As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, the megacap member of IBD's semiconductor equipment firm gets a solid but not great EPS Rating of 88. Q1 profit is seen rising just 1% to $1.13 a share, burdened by a very big gain (115%) in the year-ago quarter.At the market get-go, investors applauded the arrival of tamer U.S. consumer price increases in the U.S. and looked past the sudden termination of President Trump's Secretary Of State, Rex Tillerson.The CPI index and the core index both showed a 0.2% rise in February, down from much bigger month-to-month gains in January.Within the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, just three names rose 1 point or more, including UnitedHealth (UNH), McDonald's (MCD) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).General Electric (GE) marked the Dow industrials' index's low end, down more than 3%. JPMorgan Chase reportedly cast doubt on the viability of GE's already reduced cash dividend. The industrial powerhouse is slated to pay shareholders 12 cents a share on April 25 to holders of record Feb. 26. That gives GE an annualized yield of 3.3%, vs. 1.8% for the S&P 500.GE holds a 3 Relative Price Strength Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, meaning it's outperformed just 3% of all companies in IBD's database over the past 12 months.The large-cap S&P 500 let gains of 0.4% slip to a 0.1% loss near lunchtime on Wall Street after finishing 0.1% lower on Monday. Yet the 500 continues to create a solid cushion above its 50-day moving average, a healthy sign for stocks. The Nasdaq composite, up 0.4% on Monday, hit new highs again with another 0.4% jump. The Nasdaq is aiming for an eighth straight advance.As noted in IBD's The Big Picture column, on Friday the Nasdaq spurted into new high ground, ending a six-session phase in which the market uptrend was under pressure. The current outlook is now back to ""Confirmed uptrend,"" which means that investors can actively search out breakouts in big volume by companies with high-quality fundamentals.The S&P SmallCap 600 edged 0.3% higher early before sliding to a 0.1% loss. At 972, the index is up 3.8% year to date.Among small caps, Canada Goose (GOOS) flew back above its key 50-day moving average as shares jumped more than 2% to as high as 33.87, then settled back. It's the second rebound back above the 50-day moving average, offering a new secondary buy point following an early-November breakout at 22.10.The seller of ultra-premium outerwear and cold weather apparel has been a stunning stock within the apparel and retail group, tripling in price since its March 16, 2017, IPO at 12.75 a share.Canada Goose cleared a first-stage cup with handle at 22.10 on Nov. 8, catapulting higher the next session on solid quarterly results (earnings up 32% to 29 cents a share, sales up 35% to $172.3 million). Last month, Canada Goose posted another solid quarter of growth with EPS up 38% and sales up 27%.The Street sees the small cap firm posting a net loss of 6 cents a share in fiscal Q4 ending in March vs. a net profit of 17 cents in the year-ago period. In the quarter ended June 2017, Canada Goose lost 13 cents a share.Despite the checkered bottom-line results over the past two years, influenced by the seasonality of its merchandise mix, Canada Goose gets a 95 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 in IBD Stock Checkup.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Lumentum (LITE) held on to Monday's strong gains and then some, rising 0.6% to 72.35. The expert in 3D sensors for smartphones and other optical communications components has cleared a 66.80 early entry point in a deep seven-month base and is 8% past that buy point.In February, the company reported a big turnaround in earnings, up 193% in the December-ended fiscal second quarter to $1.67 a share, ending a two-quarter slump in profits. Sales leapt 53% to $404.6 million.In a Feb. 6 IBD technology story, industry analyst and Loup Ventures Managing Partner Gene Munster noted that Lumentum management indicated 3D sensor revenue should more than double in the second half of 2018 over 2017.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on growth stocks, top industry groups, breakouts and financial markets.)RELATED:Do You Know The Golden Rule Of Investing?Finding Great New IPO Leaders: Who Are The Next Home Depot, Microsoft, Cisco, Google?The Latest In Investor's CornerWant To Sharpen Your Market Timing In Buying Stocks?

62,NOV,"Is it too much to ask that the government not insult our intelligence while it is lightening our wallets? As an overture to his predictable announcement of steel and aluminum tariffs, the president, that human sponge ever eager to soak up information, held a ""listening session,"" at which he listened to executives of steel and aluminum companies urge him to do what he intended to do. He ended this charade of deliberation by announcing the tax increases.XThe tariffs — taxes collected at the border, paid by American consumers — on steel and aluminum imports will be 25% and 10%, respectively, the most severe of the options proposed by his Commerce Department, which impedes the activity denoted by its name. But the 6.5 million employees in steel-using industries (46 times the number of steel-making jobs) and the hundreds of millions of consumers of steel- and aluminum-content products should not complain, they should salute: The president says the tariffs are national security necessities.Never mind that the Cato Institute's Colin Grabow notes that defense-related products require only 3%t and 10% of domestic steel and aluminum production, respectively. Or that six of the top 10 nations that export steel to the United States have mutual defense agreements with the United States. Or that China, an actual military competitor and potential adversary, is not among the top 10. Or that Canada, a NATO ally, supplies more U.S. aluminum imports than the next 11 countries combined. Or that, as The Washington Post reports, ""For nearly a quarter-century under U.S. law, Canada has been considered part of the U.S. defense industrial base, as if its factories were American."" Or that the aluminum for military aircraft and the steel for military vehicles will be more expensive so, effectively, the administration is cutting the defense budget. Cato's Dan Ikenson says the administration's argument seems to be ""that an abundance of low-priced raw materials from a diversity of sources somehow threatens national security.""But, then, invocations of ""national security"" can rationalize a multitude of sins. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., says the sugar import quotas that enrich a few already rich Floridians are required for America's ""food security."" It will be desirable (because educational) if some nations retaliate for the steel and aluminum tariffs by imposing 25% tariffs on Florida citrus in the interest of ""food security.""Electrolux, Europe's largest manufacturer of household appliances, responded to the U.S. tariffs by suspending plans to invest $250 million in a Tennessee factory. Before the announcement of the tariffs, which are intended to raise steel prices, Whirlpool's CEO lamented to analysts that rising prices of steel and other materials might knock $250 million off Whirlpool's profits. Whirlpool had just made a rent-seeking raid on Washington, where it successfully sought protection against foreign washing machines — tariffs and import quotas that will punish American purchasers of appliances. As Lily Tomlin says, ""No matter how cynical you become, it's never enough to keep up.""Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

Now this capacity for mischief is in the hands of someone who knows next to nothing about the one thing — business — he is supposed to know something about.Protectionism is a scythe that slices through core conservative principles, including opposition to government industrial policy, and to government picking winners and losers, and to crony capitalism elevated to an ethic (""A Few Americans First""). Big, bossy government does not get bigger or bossier than when it embraces protectionism — government dictating what goods Americans can choose, and in what quantities, and at what prices. Down the decades, Trump has shown an impressive versatility of conviction, but the one constant in the jumble of quarter-baked and discordant prejudices that pass for his ideas has been hostility to free trade. It perfectly expresses his adolescent delight in executive swagger, the objectives of which are of negligible importance to him; all that is important is that the spotlight follows where his impulses propel him.For more than a century, enlarged executive power wielded by agenda-setting presidents has been the sun at the center of progressives' solar system of aspirations. Hence protectionism — economic life drenched by politics and directed by unconstrained presidential ukases. So, if on Nov. 6 the Democrats capture either house of Congress, on Nov. 7 there will be, effectively, an accommodating Democrat in the presidency.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Trump's Tariffs On Steel And Aluminum Will Cost The U.S. DearlyStill More Bad News (For Democrats) About The GOP Tax CutsHere's The Real Inflation Problem We Face Today

64,NOV,"The Nasdaq composite outperformed the broader market on the shoulders of big-cap techs. But the index erased early gains to fall modestly with less than an hour left in Tuesday's post-holiday session.X At one point, the Nasdaq gained nearly 0.8%, then retreated to a 0.4% loss. With less than a half hour to go, the leading index is down just 0.1% after sprinting 5.3% higher last week.Among IBD's 197 industry groups and subgroups, three of the top four performers on Tuesday hailed from the semiconductor sector and were each up 1.5% to 2.1%. Auto and truck replacement parts, fiber optics, data storage and design software stocks also outperformed, rising 1% or more.At 3:30 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average, hit by losses of 1 point or more among nearly half of its 30 components, sank more than 1%.The S&P 500 fell 0.85%. Volume was tracking significantly lower vs. the same time on Friday, a good sign for the bulls, especially after a follow-through took place on Valentine's Day, last Wednesday.After a follow-through occurs, declines by the major indexes in lighter trade are ideal.The Dow and S&P 500 indexes have rallied for six straight sessions. This would be the Nasdaq's second straight loss.Google site operator Alphabet (GOOGL) outperformed the market and rose 0.4% to 1099.30 in below average turnover. The stock hoisted itself back above the key 50-day moving average intraday, though Alphabet was fighting to close above that level. The support line flattened out some, but is still in a long-term upward trajectory.A rising 50-day moving average is bullish. Even more bullish is when a stock pulls ahead of its 50-day line. This hints at healthy demand by the institutional set.At 1,105, Alphabet is up 4.9% since Jan. 1. In October, the megacap tech play in web search and self-driving technologies had cleared a 1,006.29 buy point in a 10-week flat base and rallied as much as 19% before its fast slide in early February.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersAlphabet has posted lovely double-digit gains in both earnings per share (up 28%, 27%, 32% and 28%) and revenue (up 22%, 21%, 24% and 24%) on a year-over-year basis in the past four quarters. Full-year profit is seen rising 16% to $41.47 a share in 2018.Keep in mind that many of the top growth companies do a good job of managing analysts' expectations, giving the management a chance to under-promise and over-deliver.Steel companies are emerging as a hot new industry group for 2018.South Korea's Posco (PKX), along with Nucor (NUE), U.S. Steel (X) and global steel maker ArcelorMittal (MT) all have mild gains since Jan. 1.Posco is testing institutional buying support near the 10-week moving average for the second time since it cleared a shallow cup with handle at 76.32 during the week ended Dec. 1. A cup with handle typically shows a minimum decline from high to low of 12%. The handle should show a smaller correction than the cup base itself, and in most cases is confined to a drop of just 8% to 12%.To find Posco's correct buy point, add 10 cents to the highest price within the handle, or the intraday high of 76.22.One flaw with Posco's shallow cup with handle? The midpoint of the handle, 72.31, was slightly lower than the cup's midpoint of 72.47. Thus, a chart reader could also interpret the entire pattern as simply a well-constructed flat base, which shows mostly sideways price action and a decline of no more than 15% from head to toe. In this perspective, the correct buy point for Posco would have been 77.86, or 10 cents above the left-side high. Posco thrust above that flat-base entry with a high-volume rush of buying on Dec. 8.Meanwhile, Olympic Steel (ZEUS) cleared a 25.34 buy point in a long, deep cup with handle before reversing. Shares are still up nearly 1% to 24.70. Volume is running more than 100% above the 50-day average.Highland Hills, Ohio-based Olympic Steel is expected to report it earned 11 cents a share in the fourth quarter of last year, capping earnings of $1.25 a share for the full year. Wall Street sees 2018 profit leaping 56% to $1.95 a share.The stock, part of the metal product distribution industry group, has a 75 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup, and a positive rating of B- for Accumulation/Distribution on a scale of A (heavy net fund buying over the past 13 weeks) to E (heavy net selling).Elsewhere, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rallied 11% as its bullish rebound continues. Watch to see if the closed-end fund that tracks the price of the popular digital currency can retake its 50-day moving average, a critical step in forming the right side of a potential but flawed new base.GBTC had gone on a climax run in December after a fantastic breakout past 10.93 in a deep cup with handle on Nov. 22. In a climax run, a stock or ETF goes nearly vertical after rising sharply in price for months, and such action signifies a last gasp of desperate buying by traders ahead of a major top. However, some stocks have been able to recover from a climax run and set up a new breakout. But it takes a lot of time.In other markets, U.S. near-term crude oil futures rose 0.4% to $61.79 a barrel. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond held steady at 2.89%, still below its early 2014 peak of 3.04%.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on growth stocks, business and financial markets.)RELATED:When Did Nvidia Show Up In This Top Growth Stock Screen In IBD?Hot Growth Stocks Leading The Market Today: A Peek Inside IBD 50 How Does Your Stock Weigh Against Its Peers?

65,NOV,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq 100 retreated Tuesday morning amid disappointing earnings from Dow component Walmart (WMT) and mining giant BHP Billiton (BHP), though Dow stock Home Depot (HD) had good results. Rising bond yields also put some pressure on futures.X The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones have rallied for six straight sessions, pushing the market back into a confirmed uptrend after a sharp, brief correction. The Nasdaq composite rose for five sessions before edging lower Friday.S&P 500 index futures sank 0.5% vs. fair value. Dow Jones futures retreated 0.55%. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.5% vs. fair value.Walmart reported better-than-expected holiday sales, but earnings fell short. Walmart shares fell nearly 4% in premarket trading on the stock market today. Home Depot earnings and sales topped, with the home improvement giant hiking its dividend 16%. Its stock edged higher.BHP Billiton shares had been near a buy point heading into earnings. Roku (ROKU), Stamps.com (STMPS) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) also have fourth-quarter earnings on tap with their stocks in consolidations.BHP Billiton reported six-month adjusted earnings rose 25% to $4.05 billion, but that was less than some estimates. The mining giant hiked its dividend to 55 cents from 40 cents. BHP signaled some new openness to a proposal by activist investor Elliot Management, which wants the mining giant to reorganize as a single entity in Melbourne and drop its second listing in London.Shares fell 3.5% to 46.98 early Tuesday.The Australian mining giant is in a flat base, really a base-on-base pattern with a 50.89 buy point. BHP sold off during the stock market correction but had come roaring back, quickly retaking its 50-day moving average last week.BHP's relative strength line hit its best level in more than two years last week on a daily chart, or just shy of that mark on a weekly chart. The RS line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. Investors should look for stocks with strong RS lines.But wait for stocks to enter buy zones, and be cautious about buying or holding stocks entering earnings season.Roku will report late Wednesday. Roku makes set-top boxes for streaming video such as Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN) Prime Video, Hulu and more, competing with rival devices like the Amazon Fire TV and Apple (AAPL) TV. But it's focusing on services and advertising for growth.Analysts expect an adjusted loss of 11 cents a share on revenue of $183 million. Key for investors will be growth metrics such as the company's active user base, streaming hours and average revenue per user.Roku came public at 14 in late September and debuted well. After a short rise shares consolidated in an IPO base. On Nov. 8 Roku released its first earnings report as a public company. Shares skyrocketed 55% the next day and another 46% over the next two sessions as Roku blasted to a new high. The stock continued rising to 58.80 on Dec. 19.Shares pulled back sharply over the next several weeks but started to move higher in February. It's working on a cup base with a 58.90. The stock just retook its 50-day line on Friday, closing at 48.22.Roku fell 1.2% early Tuesday.Stamps.com also reports after Wednesday's market close.Analysts expect earnings per share of $2.75 vs. $2.73 a year earlier. Revenue should climb 12% to $119 million.Stamps.com is in a consolidation with a 233.23 buy point though aggressive investors could treat 211.50 as an early entry. The stock is just below its 50-day moving average line. Stamps.com closed Friday at 186.60.The stock was not yet active Tuesday.Stamps.com stock fell 23% after its last report.The stock's RS line is low. A move above the 211.50 area would presumably lift the RS above at least a short-term level, but still below its late October peak.Norwegian Cruise Line reports fourth-quarter earnings early Thursday. Analysts expect earnings per share to rise 31% to 63 cents, with revenue up 11% to $1.252 billion.Norwegian Cruise Line is in a flat base going back to early August with a buy point of 61.58.

66,NOV,"Stocks were higher at midday Wednesday but gave back some gains, as the market tried to find its footing following Tuesday's broad slide.X The Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.4% increase, a leap that came largely thanks to Boeing's (BA) 5% rally to an all-time high. Boeing today beat earnings expectations and gave an upbeat forecast on profit and revenue for the coming year.The S&P 500 was up 0.1% after being up as much as 0.6% in today's market. The Nasdaq also climbed around 0.1% as it also faded from early gains. The main indexes recovered only a fraction of Tuesday's sharp losses and were near session lows. As IBD's signature market analysis column, The Big Picture, has noted, the market has seemed frothy and a larger pullback would not be surprising.Volume was lower compared with the same time Tuesday. Breadth was mixed, with advancers over decliners by 6-to-5 on the NYSE but losers ahead on the Nasdaq by the same ratio.The small-cap Russell 2000 reversed lower and was down a fraction. The Dow transports, however, rose 0.6% as airline and trucking stocks were among the morning's top performers.Brazil-based airline Azul (AZUL) broke out of a cup-without-handle base, gapping past a 29.53 buy point. But volume was unimpressive.A few other breakouts also were fading, including insurer Chubb (CB) (which tried to top a 156.10 buy point) and chip company Aquantia (AQ) (13.90 entry). Chubb missed earnings estimates late Tuesday. Aquantia went public on Nov. 3 and is thinly traded with an average daily turnover of 224,000 shares.Internet retail also was one of the day's winners, as Amazon.com (AMZN) rose to a new high and extended a scorching advance.The stock has risen more than 20% from its 1,213.51 buy point, an increase that justifies taking profits. Amazon.com reports earnings Thursday after the close, and shareholders have the opportunity to lock in gains and sit out the earnings announcement, and thus the risk that comes with any quarterly report.Amazon has been a member of IBD Leaderboard since March 29, 2017.Homebuilders were bouncing back and were one of the 10 best industry groups this morning. D.R. Horton (DHI) beat earnings expectations Wednesday. But the stock met resistance at the 50-day moving average and erased most of its early gains. It was a disappointing move that failed to remove worries about the industry's ability to remain a market leader.Energy, recreational vehicle, steel and some retail industry groups were the weakest. U.S. crude prices fell 0.3% to $64.27 a barrel. Officials reported a surprisingly large build in domestic crude inventories while oil production increased again.The Innovator IBD 50 Fund (FFTY), an ETF that tracks the IBD 50 index, was only slightly higher but still endeavoring to rise from support at the key 50-day moving average.RELATED:Boeing Beats Q4 Earnings Forecast, Gives Strong GuidanceHomebuilder Giant D.R.

67,NOV,"Stocks remained broadly lower as Apple's (AAPL) iPhone X news weighed. A Bitcoin play, however, bucked the broad decline.X PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) trimmed its loss to 0.2%, while SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) gave up 0.3% each. Emerging markets tumbled with iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) down 1.2%.Apple, down 2%, was one of the Dow's biggest losers. Shares slid further below the 50-day moving average. They had re-cleared a 176.34 last week before reversing lower. The iPhone maker reports earnings on Thursday. Apple is cutting its iPhone X production by half amid disappointing sales, Japan's Nikkei reported Monday.Homebuilders, utilities and real estate led the downside among sector funds in the stock market today. Oil and gold plays pulled back along with prices for the underlying commodities. VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) and VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) dropped 3% and 2.4%, respectively.Bitcoin also came under pressure, falling 4% to $11,231.09, according to CoinDesk. It had initially climbed to $11,765.40. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), however, rose 6%. It remains slightly below its 50-day line.Biotechs, banks and retail were among the few groups bucking the selloff. IShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) advanced 1% to its best level since August 2015. Gilead Sciences (GILD) surged 5%, sailing past an 86.37 cup-base buy point, to follow up on Friday's big move. Ablynx (ABLX) soared 12% after Sanofi said it's buying the Belgium-based biotech for $4.8 billion.Propelled by top tech stocks like Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA), the stock market continues rising to new highs. Many leveraged funds have generated even higher returns for those who don't mind taking on extra potential risk.Leveraged funds designed to outperform on the way up often aim for double or triple a particular benchmark index's performance. Likewise, those designed to act inverse to the index can snare big gains when the index sinks, but drop if the index rallies. These high-octane plays aren't for the fainthearted.Three emerging markets plays topped the list of leveraged ETFs with biggest year-to-date gains through Jan. 24, according to Morningstar Direct. Direxion Daily FTSE China Bull 3X (YINN) has surged 53.1%, far out in front of the S&P 500's 6.2% advance. It had a big 2017 too, racking up a 129.8% gain. YINN's average annual return for the past three years is 8.6%, trailing the S&P 500's 13.8% for the same period.Direxion Daily MSCI Brazil Bull 3X (BRZU) came in second with a 47.3% YTD gain. A 30.8% gain last year outpaced the S&P 500, but its three-year performance is -12%. Direxion Daily Russia Bull 3X (RUSL), in third, is up 38.9% this year. It ended 2017 with a 1% gain; its three-year average annual return is 20.3%.Given such relatively inconsistent long-term performance, most traders generally view leveraged funds as a short-term investment. Another point to keep in mind: Leverage plays tend to have higher costs. YINN, BRZU and RUSL carry expense ratios of 1.3%, 1.1% and 1.1%, respectively, compared with iShares MSCI Brazil's (EWZ) 0.6%.All of the ETFs in the accompanying table are currently extended from buy points. But if you find such leveraged plays appealing, watch for a new consolidation or a pullback to the 50-day moving average.Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X (SOXL) is extended from a 167.60 entry of a cup with handle. But declines Wednesday and Thursday have brought it closer to buy range. The $678.1 million fund was featured in this ETF column on Jan. 18, a day after its breakout. It rose as much as 12% from the breakout to its Jan. 23 peak. SOXL surged 50%-plus from a prior breakout in September to a Nov. 22 intraday high.The ETF, which aims to deliver 300% of the daily performance of the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index, will mark its eighth anniversary in March. The top five names in the index as of Dec. 31 were Texas Instruments (TXN), Intel, Qualcomm (QCOM), Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO). Intel surged 11% after reporting better-than-expected Q4 results late Thursday.Nvidia, known for its graphics chips used in personal computers, game consoles and mobile devices, is also becoming a big player in the self-driving car and artificial intelligence fields. Shares are at all-time highs.SOXL has delivered a 26.6% YTD gain, 141.7% in 2017 and a three-year average annual return of 77.8%. Its expense ratio is 1.1%.Friday's pick, SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend (SPYD), is near the top of a potential buy zone from a rebound off the 50-day line.RELATED:Intel, Nvidia Power Dow, S&P To Highs; Bitcoin Below Key SupportApple Loses Support But Dow At High; Bitcoin Play Goes PositiveCan You Make A Million Dollars By Trading ETFs?

68,NOV,"Take it to the bank — investors who use discount brokers grasp the impact of costs on their portfolios. And investors showed they value low costs by ranking Low Commission & Fees as the most important of 14 key traits they weigh in assessing which brokerage to use.X The preferences come from IBD's sixth Best Online Brokers report in which investors were asked to rate the importance of 23 brokerage traits.So, what are the online brokers that scored best in the Low Commission & Fees category of IBD's annual Best Online Brokers survey doing to distinguish themselves, to earn those votes from investors? And are fees about to sink lower?Low cost is a key weapon for winning and holding on to customers. You can even get free trades from some brokers, depending on the size of your transaction, how often you trade and the size of your account balance.But commissions vary a lot. Among the five highest ranked brokers in this category, Interactive Brokers (IBKR) has a regular commission of a low $1 minimum on trades of at least 1,000 shares of a U.S. stock. Two rivals — Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab (SCHW) — battle for customers with their $4.95 commissions. TradeStation parries with a $5-per-trade levy. And Merrill Edge's standard levy is $6.95 per trade.There's a similar range in prices for options trades.And some Best Online Brokers offer even bigger discounts to customers who qualify.At Interactive Brokers, if your monthly volume is more than 100 million stock shares, Interactive's commission plummets to 0.05 cent per share, with a minimum fee per order of 35 cents.Merrill Edge customers can get 100 free stock and ETF trades per month if they're in Merrill's Preferred Rewards Platinum program. That requires having a Bank of America (BAC) checking account. You've also got to maintain a three-month average combined balance of $100,000 in a Bank of America savings account and/or a Merrill investment account.TradeStation offers special deals too. You can choose between its $5 per trade levy and tiered pricing as low as 0.6 cent per share for each share in excess of 500. Investors who trade 5 million or more shares a month pay just 0.2 cent per share, with a minimum commission of 50 cents per trade. Depending on which exchange an investor like that uses, TradeStation will relay additional exchange execution fees or rebates, if any, on to the investor.Still, to get the best prices you might have to jump through hoops.TradeStation customers using tiered pricing risk triggering a $99.95 per month service fee unless their account balance is large enough or their trading volume high enough.And check out no-load mutual funds. Each of the top brokers in the Low Commissions & Fees category offers them. But some brokers charge a transaction fee on some of their no-load funds.Then there is research. It's mostly provided without additional fees by the top-ranked online brokers. Interactive Brokers, whose focus is low-cost, high-volume trading, offers freebies including blogs, newsletters and Fox Business News and other news sites. Investors can buy additional a la carte information including research like Thomson Reuters Stockreports+ for $2 a month up to Slingshot Insights for $725 per month after a free 30-day trial.Yet as fierce as competition is in this arena of commissions and fees, all customers do not gravitate solely to the lowest prices. Why not? In a word: Service.""As far as competing at zero commission, I don't feel we have to match brokers that do that,"" said Gregg Murphy, senior vice president of brokerage products at Fidelity. ""The breadth and overall value of our overall operation is significantly greater than what some other firms with lower costs offer.""Free research, a user-friendly platform and detailed information about a customer's price improvement on trades are just some of Fidelity's services.Price improvement reflects the difference between the maximum price a buyer says he will pay and the actual asked price that the broker obtains. For sellers of securities, it means they got more than the bid price on average.Merrill Edge voices a similar theme based on being part of Bank of America. David Poole, head of Merrill Edge advisory, client services and digital capabilities, said, ""We look at the full suite of our combined offerings — money market funds, low mortgage refinancing rates, bank accounts. It's tough for smaller players to compete with us on price and the whole gamut of offerings, which are a significant benefit.""And what about the future? Six of the seven top-ranked brokers in the Low Commissions & Fees category lowered some key fee during 2017. Are more fee cuts coming soon?Interactive Brokers, which touts its low prices, says more fee cuts aren't imminent. ""It's unlikely,"" said chief market analyst Andrew Wilkinson, whose firm's break point for its lowest stock trading commission is 100 million shares. ""We're for professional traders, not people who are relatively docile. And our customers value our services other than raw pricing too, such as price improvement and order routing.""In contrast, Fidelity touts its price improvement, which averaged $13.09 per 1,000-share market order between Jan. 1, 2017 and Nov. 30. Industrywide, the average is $2.02, Fidelity says.Merrill's Poole says robo-advisors cause more price pressure than cost-lowering mobile apps do. Yet robo-advice's impact is mainly restricted to investors who are super focused on low-cost products like ETFs, he says.And Fidelity's Murphy says lower fees from small rivals won't prompt new cuts from big shops. ""The majority of brokers offering zero commissions just have a trading app,"" he said. ""That limits trading functionality. Not even close to our level of overall offerings.""Murphy's colleague Scott Ignall, senior vice president of brokerage customer experience, adds, ""Our scale also gives us cost savings that we can pass through to our customers.""Ignall's advice to cost-conscious investors is simple: Don't look just for the lowest commission. Keep your eyes peeled for hidden costs as well.""There's a small set of competitors that have very low commissions and margin rates,"" he said. ""But look behind the covers. They charge you for market data, for adjusting orders when you want to cancel an order. Some require large account balances. Look at the details in fees. Look for a quality overall experience.""Want to read more about the other top brokers, the latest commission trends and more?

69,NOV,"It's pop quiz time. Which of these three investing benchmarks produced the biggest returns since the summer of 1999 through the start of 2018: the S&P 500 average of large-cap stocks, China's Shanghai Stock Exchange composite index, or gold?XThe correct answer? That shiny metal used a lot in jewelry, traded heavily by short-term speculators in the futures markets, and stored for long-term safekeeping in bank vaults around the globe.From a bottom near $250 a troy ounce in August 1999 through Wednesday, gold has delivered compound annual growth of 9.6%. Thanks to solid gains over the past year, the S&P has improved its annually compound gain to 4.5% in that nearly 18-1/2 year span, excluding dividends. And the Shanghai composite has gained a compounded 4.6%.If you guessed wrong, it might be because a tough 5-1/2 years took some shine off gold. The price today is still off 29% from its all-time high of $1,895 an ounce in 2011.But in recent months, gold is regaining its mojo.On the Comex exchange, near-term futures are currently at $1,363 an ounce, rising 9.7% since its mid-December near-term low and up 4% since Jan. 1. That year-to-date advance still trails a 5.8% gain for the S&P 500 and a stunning 7.6% rise for the Shanghai composite.Yet even as Bitcoin fever seems to be catching on, gold futures appear to be breaking through a key downtrend line that stretches back to September 2011.A sharp upward bust of that trend line could signal a change in direction again and another long-term buying opportunity. For the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), that inflection point would be a thrust above 123.The highly liquid ETF on Wednesday gapped up to a 1.4% gain to 129.07 in heavy turnover. SPDR Gold is also clearing a 128.42 buy point in a nearly five-month saucer base.The ETF trades on average 7.1 million shares a day; in other words, as much as $896 million worth of the popular trading vehicle changes hands each day. SPDR Gold Shares is now up 10.8% since Jan. 1, still ahead of the S&P 500's 6% advance.Not that gold is an easy game to play, especially for short-term speculators. Gold prices continue to show tremendous volatility in the short term, vacillating with the latest political, economic and international tides. Since October of 2016, the London P.M. fixing price of gold has risen or fallen 2% or more for the week at least 14 times. And since July of last year, it moved up or down 1% for the week at least 18 times.No wonder many golden hairs on commodities traders' heads quickly turn silver.""Gold has no true fundamentals, no intrinsic value, only limited industrial and practical use and doesn't generate cash flow,"" said Sandra Navidi, CEO of the macroeconomic consulting firm Beyond Global LLC.""Its value is primarily driven by fickle psychology and by what the next investor is willing to pay,"" said Navidi, the author of ""$uperHubs: How the Financial Elite & Their Networks Rule Our World.""So, if you don't want to trade in the short term, how do you win in gold?One key, says veteran portfolio manager Joe Wickwire, is to fully comprehend the difference between being a speculator and an investor. An investor thinks long-term (at least three to five years) and understands the beauty of gold as a hedge against the weakening purchase power of other financial assets.Wickwire's job as an investment professional is to exploit the disconnect between the price of gold when it is driven by short-term speculative money and to know when it makes good sense as a long-term play amid changing financial, monetary and economic conditions.""Gold is a financial asset insurance policy,"" said Wickwire, who has managed the Fidelity Select Gold Portfolio (FSAGX) mutual fund since August 2007 as well as the Fidelity Global Commodity Stock Fund (FFGCX). Wickwire keeps a chart on the wall of his office in Boston listing 17 factors that influence gold prices, adding ""I could add another 17 factors.""The Fidelity Select Gold Portfolio fund is up 2.7% since Jan. 1 and up 8.6% over the past year.Over the long haul, the four chief factors influencing gold prices are macroeconomic imbalances, geopolitical shocks, the laws of supply and demand, and the overall state of the gold mining industry, he says.Wickwire shares a simple yet brilliant rule of thumb that can help an individual investor get a sense of the long-term picture for gold: Look at real interest rates. When rates are less than 2%, the price of gold tends to go up.Right now, the fed funds rate on overnight bank loans is in a target range of 1.25%-1.5%. Many economists expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by a quarter point three times this year, repeating what it did in 2017. Currently, the U.S. prime rate is 4.5%.Compare those figures with the 1970s, when the U.S. economy suffered from double-digit unemployment and torrid inflation. By 1980, the yield on the 3-month U.S. Treasury bill climbed toward 14%, but the real rate after inflation was low. Gold and other precious metals were hot.When Federal Reserve chief Paul Volcker set on a course to kill inflation by sharply raising short-term interest rates during the early years of Ronald Reagan's presidency, the market turned upside down. Inflation fell, economic growth came back, entrepreneurs started new companies as tax rates fell, and U.S. equities had their longest stretch of gains (1982 to 2000) of the century.""Real rates came down and assets were priced properly. Gold was boring,"" Wickwire said.Not so, lately.

70,NOV,"Looking sloppy isn't a crime, whether you're talking about an unkempt guy with a neckbeard or a double-bottom base on a stock chart. X The double-bottom base is easy to overlook because, until the pattern is complete, it looks like a disaster. After the stock declines, it rebounds without surpassing the previous high. Then the stock…
"
71,NOV,"As an earlier Investor's Corner column explained, the cup with handle carries a sort of Swiss watch-like intricacy.X The shape, dimensions, depth of decline, slope of the incline, price-and-volume interplay and other details help determine the quality of a stock that etches this important chart pattern.Not all cup-with-handle bases pan gold. So an investor should train his or her eyes for flaws that may result in a market malfunction.Put another way, if you learn to sidestep the poorly formed ones, then you reduce the likelihood of taking a loss in your future buys. Fewer losses on individual stocks boost your overall return.As seen in the accompanying daily chart of Paycom Software (PAYC) back during its base-building phase in 2016, the stock's breakout from a seven-week shallow cup with handle didn't work. The Oct. 24, 2016, breakout past a 51.56 entry lasted barely longer than a day. Eight days into the move, Paycom plunged more than 15% despite good Q3 results (EPS up 88%, revenue up 40%).Why didn't this cup with handle work out?A major reason was how Paycom formed the base. The handle showed a proper light decline of 6.5%, less than the 12% drop within the cup portion.Yet the overall shape of this cup with handle was distorted. Paycom spent less than three weeks building the left side of the cup, then took just five trading sessions to form the cup's right side. In contrast, the handle portion took nearly four weeks to form. Such action rarely has shown up among decades of IBD's model studies on the biggest stock market winners.The opposite should occur. A stock should take plenty of time to form the cup, and much less time to finish up the handle.Paycom gained a lot of attention in IBD's screens and coverage since its April 2014 debut. In the week ended Nov. 7, 2014, the payroll and human resources management firm glided past a 19.34 buy point in a six-week cup base. That base formed next to a longer initial base. Just 12 months later, Paycom hit a new high of 46.35, up 140%.Over the same time frame, the NYSE composite fell 3.3%.A large correction from late 2015 to early 2016 sent the stock plunging 52% from a 46.35 peak to as low as 22.42. That's a big enough drop to reset the base count.However, Paycom had created a long series of bases-on-top-of-bases throughout 2015, and its long-term uptrend since hitting all-time highs in September 2014 was still largely intact. One could conclude that the most recent breakout came quite late in the stock's long-term run.(A version of this column was first published on Jan. 6, 2017.)Paycom recently joined IBD Leaderboard, where select top growth stocks are highlighted for breaking out of proper bases.

74,NOV,"Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, which ripples over the steep hills of this Pittsburgh suburb and stretches south to the West Virginia border, has not had a competitive congressional election since 2006. The fact that it will have one on March 13 makes this the most important 2018 voting before Nov. 6.XThe seat's most recent occupant, Republican Tim Murphy, 65, a married father, had won it eight times, the last two times unopposed, and by 28 percentage points when last opposed, in 2012. A fervent anti-abortion social conservative, he resigned in 2017 amid some ethical challenges, including allegations that he urged his pregnant girlfriend to get an abortion. The national GOP under its current livewire leader, Stormy Daniels' acquaintance, is decreasingly convincing as a vessel of social conservatism, but at least it still opposes deficit spending and protectionism.Democrats retain an approximately 70,000 registration advantage in this district, a residue of its past as home to unionized steelworkers (there are 86,000 union households). It was, however, voting Republican in federal elections long before the president discovered that he is a Republican. It has voted Republican in five consecutive presidential elections; in those, George W. Bush (twice), John McCain, Mitt Romney and Donald Trump carried it with 49.7, 53.3, 55.2, 57.9 and 58.1%, respectively. There was no surge for Trump, just the continuation of a trend.The Republican nominee to hold the seat, Rick Saccone, a 60-year-old four-term state legislator, says he was ""Trump before Trump was Trump,"" which is probably true but might not be saying much, the eponymous fellow having recently arrived at his current convictions and party allegiance. Saccone has lived an eventful life: 18 years in the Air Force, a Ph.D. in international relations, author of nine books, two of them on North Korea, where he lived for a year negotiating nuclear policy. His Democratic opponent is Nancy Pelosi.Actually, it just seems that way. One ad run on his behalf warns that his actual opponent, Conor Lamb, would be — wait for it — ""one of Nancy Pelosi's sheep."" Lamb immunized himself early on by saying that if Democrats win a House majority, he will not vote for Pelosi as speaker. Seasoned professional that she is, she probably is bemused that her hopes of becoming speaker depend on some Democratic House candidates pledging to oppose this.If Democrats had asked a Hollywood studio to supply a candidate for this time and place, it would have sent Lamb. He is 33, 6 foot 3, the nephew of Pittsburgh's controller and the grandson of a former majority leader of the state Senate. He has the polish of a former Marine officer and federal prosecutor, and radiates a determination not to radiate anything other than placidity. He says that the biggest surprise of the campaign has come when knocking on doors: ""I thought there would be more about specific issues."" Instead, people just want compromises, by which they mean calm.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersThe first day of deer-hunting season — Nov. 26 this year — is a school holiday in many communities in Pennsylvania, and after the Florida school shooting, Lamb said something true and therefore discordant with national Democratic pronouncements: ""There's not one thing we can do with the stroke of a pen or one thing you can ban"" to prevent such tragedies. Lamb says that many local offices in the district are held by Democrats, and that Democratic voters are energized by the novelty of a competitive race.Pennsylvania has the nation's fourth-oldest residents, and this district is the second oldest. Here retirees are worried about soaring health care premiums and rickety union pension funds. Polls show Saccone with a single-digit lead in a tightening race, and Trump's approval and disapproval almost even.Recently, Democrats won a Wisconsin state Senate seat in a district Republicans had held since 2001 and that Trump carried with 55%t of the vote. And a Republican-held Kentucky state legislative seat in a district Trump won with 72%t. Last Tuesday, Democrats captured a Connecticut House district that Republicans had held for 44 years, and a New Hampshire district Trump won by 12 points.Southwest Pennsylvania, as much as any place in the nation, made Trump president. He, his daughter and his vice president have campaigned for Saccone, on whose behalf the spending advantage has been estimated to be 17-to-1. If Lamb nevertheless wins, Democrats will have found a template for many districts in 2018: candidates who seem ideologically unlike the national party and temperamentally unlike the president.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:More political news and commentary on Election 2018Other columns by George Will

75,NOV,"The major market averages held heavy losses in early Friday trade, as the stock indexes looked to make it four consecutive down days. The indexes received some early support from February consumer sentiment data, which came in better than expected at 99.7, vs. the 99.5 Econoday consensus estimate. Top stock JD.com (JD) plunged 7% in the stock market today.X The major indexes — the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average — appeared set to end the week on a sour note with Friday's losses exceeding 0.8% apiece. All three showed weekly declines of about 3%, while giving up their respective 50-day moving average support levels.Among the Dow industrials, McDonald's (MCD) dropped almost 4% after RBC Capital Markets slashed its price target on the fast-food chain from 190 to 170. The analyst sees slowing U.S. same-stores sales due to a weak debut of the restaurant's new value meal menu. After an over-41% gain in 2017, the stock has reversed course in 2018, falling over 12% year to date, while giving up its long-term 200-day support level.Elsewhere, Apple (AAPL) was testing its 50-day support level early Friday with a near-1% fall. The stock has done well since Feb. 9, as it moved back above its 50- and 200-day moving average lines to hit a new high this week.Among companies reporting earnings, JD.com (JD) declined 7% after reporting weaker-than-expected earnings and sales results early Friday. The Chinese e-commerce stock is building a new base after a previous cup-with-handle breakout failed. Today's action puts the stock at its long-term 200-day moving average line.Rival and IBD 50 member Alibaba (BABA) fell nearly 3%. It, too, is etching the right side of a potential base after a failed breakout. The stock fell through its 50-day line Thursday.Leading growth stock Splunk (SPLK) advanced about 4% after beating the Street's expectations late Thursday.

76,NOV,"Stocks stumbled in early-afternoon trading Thursday, then accelerated losses after President Trump announced the U.S. would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports (25% on the former, 10% on the latter) as early as next week. Meanwhile, a brief rebound by the U.S. dollar helped dampen enthusiasm in crude oil. WTI near-term futures, down more than 2% on Wednesday, lopped off another 1.4% to $60.80 a barrel.XMeanwhile, many top-rated companies in the leisure sector brushed off the market sell-off and continue to form part of the market leadership. They include online travel agent Booking Holdings (BKNG) and Marriott Vacations Worldwide (VAC).WTI crude, reaching as low as $60.18, has now fallen almost 6% from its Feb. 26 short-term peak of $63.91. WTI is still up 43% from its June 2017 low near $42.53.The U.S. dollar, meanwhile, strengthened briefly against both the euro, getting as high as $1.2162 before sinking again. The dollar also lost ground against the Japanese currency, now worth 106.40 yen.Yet the fall in crude did not inhibit gains by two major U.S. producers, Diamondback Energy (FANG) (up almost 2%) and Continental Resources (CLR) (up more than 2%). Both stocks are in base-building mode, with the former in the sixth week of a potential cup base. Continental is still treading below its 50-day moving average, but the 21% correction from a 58.89 peak on Jan. 11 is normal for bases such as the cup with handle.Meanwhile, investors returned to U.S. Treasuries following a second day of testimony to Congress by new Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell, who noted that, for now, he doesn't see signs of acceleration in wages. Worker pay is a key component of inflation watched closely by the U.S. central bank, which is targeting a minimum inflation level of 2% as it works off its huge bond holdings and shows signs that it's on track to raise interest rates at least three times this year.At 2:30 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average sank to session lows with a 1.9% drop as more than half of the Dow's 30 components lost 1 point or more, while 12 names sank 2 points or more. It's the Dow Jones' biggest single-session drop since a 4.2% drubbing on Feb. 8.The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 lost around 1.5%-1.6%, after both key benchmarks sank sharply in February. The 10-year Treasury bond yield eased further to 2.81%, off the Feb. 21 near-term peak of 2.95%.Volume is running higher vs. the same on Wednesday on both main exchanges, indicating strong selling by the institutional crowd.Automaker, department store chain, alcoholic beverage, grain and generic drug firms led the decline, all falling 2.9% or higher. So in one sense, investors sold defensive and lagging stocks hard.But internet content, fabless semiconductor, medical systems and retail internet shares also fell 2.5% or more, offsetting solid gains for steel making, steel alloy, security, consumer electronics retail and metal ores stocks. All four groups were up 0.9% or more.Losers beat winners by more than 2-1 ratio on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE.Keep in mind that the market has now generated three distribution days, or sessions of unusually heavy profit taking by mutual funds, hedge funds, pensions, banks and the like, since the Feb. 14 Day 4 follow-through that confirmed a potential new market uptrend is in place. Further big drops in higher volume could result in a change in IBD's current outlook for the market.Dow Jones industrials leader Caterpillar (CAT) fell 3.3% to 149.48 in volume that picked up in pace to now run nearly 40% above the 50-day average.The industrial and commodity-oriented sector leader survived two tests of buying support at the 50-day moving average last month and is making its first test at the key medium-term support and resistance level in March. Shares are also 13% below the 173.24 peak, meaning the potential for a new base to form is rising.Cat, which has reeled off six quarters in a row of top and bottom line growth, is up 4% since clearing a saucer with handle at 140.54 in massive volume on Nov. 30.A saucer with handle is one of seven superb chart patterns that every growth investor needs to know to time their purchases properly and reap the biggest possible gains over a relatively short time period.Meanwhile, leisure-oriented companies continue to lead the market upside and show superior relative strength.Marriott Vacations gained as much as 4.4% and reached as high as 146.85 before cooling off some. Volume is still running twice its usual level. The operator of vacation ownership villas across the U.S. and seven more countries busted out of a 10-week flat base at 143.63 on Jan. 23 and rallied 7% before slipping back into the base during the early-February market sell-off.Now, the small cap stock ($3.8 billion market cap) is trying to build a new base.Marriott Vacations has a decent but not great 82 Earnings Per Share Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup; however, the profit outlook is sunny.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see earnings lifting 23% to $7.11 a share this year and up another 16% to $8.23 in 2019.Booking Holdings (BKNG), formerly known as Priceline Group, lost early gains and its losses deepened a little bit. The stock fell 1.3% to 2,007.72. The online travel booking titan briefly took out a 2,068.09 buy point in a six-month base that is awkward in shape, partly due to the big gap down of 13% on Nov. 7. However, Booking has climbed back above its 50-day moving average and the relative strength line is vaulting higher, signaling outperformance vs. the S&P 500.Booking has shown consistent growth with earnings up in the mild double digits on a year-over-year basis in five of the past six quarters.Revenue has climbed 19%, 17%, 13%, 18%, 20% and 19% vs. year-ago levels over the same time frame. Booking owns the popular travel websites Priceline.com, Booking.com and Agoda.com.As seen in IBD's sector-categorized stock research tables through Wednesday's close, Leisure ranks a decent No. 11 out of 33 sectors and holds a 3.8% gain year to date.

77,NOV,"As the major indexes continue to hold near all-time highs, it might be time to take profits in these winning stocks: Grubhub (GRUB), Planet Fitness (PLNT) and Caterpillar (CAT). Weight Watchers (WTW) and Autohome (ATHM) also have reached similar gains, but you may want to hold onto these fast risers.X Grubhub settled Friday 21% above a flat base with a 57.71 buy point initially cleared on Oct. 25. When a stock becomes 20% to 25% extended past a buy point, that's usually a good time to take at least partial profits, meaning sell part of your position.But an argument could be made for holding onto — or buying more — Grubhub shares, depending on how they act around the 50-day line. Typically, the first and second successful rebounds from the 50-day line after a breakout are considered add-on buying opportunities. Grubhub also could be starting to form a new base.However, the relative strength line, which tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been slumping since Grubhub's stock peaked on Nov. 20.Grubhub rose 0.1% soon after the opening bell on the stock market today.The action of Planet Fitness shares is similar to that of Grubhub's. An earnings-inspired gap-up in early November sent shares surging out of a flat base. The stock has pulled back a few bucks from an all-time high in late December, but is successfully finding support at the 50-day line.Planet Fitness edged up 0.8% early Monday.Caterpillar has been on a steady rise since clearing a 140.54 entry point on Nov. 30. Up 21% from the buy point as of the end of last week, Caterpillar is set to report Q4 results on Thursday. The stock has gapped up on earnings for at least the last two quarterly reports, but has already been on a big run.Caterpillar fell a fraction Monday morning.Weight Watchers has made quick gains since its last breakout, running up 20% as of Friday in less than 10 trading sessions after its breakout from a cup-with-handle base. But you may want to hold onto Weight Watchers. If a stock runs up 20% or more within the first three weeks of the breakout and the market is in a healthy uptrend, you should hold that stock for eight weeks to see if it can be held for longer-term gains. Fast risers often have the best gains.The relative strength line is continuing to trend higher, which is a positive sign.Weight Watchers sank 0.4% early Monday.Autohome ended last week 22% above a buy point after breaking out of a long consolidation. Like Weight Watchers, Autohome ran up quickly, triggering the eight-week hold rule.Over the past few sessions, the Chinese internet stock has not been able to close at the high end of its intraday range. Still, Autohome has only logged three down days since clearing the buy point.Autohome rose 0.7% early Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Our New America section featured Autohome right after it powered into new high ground, launching a strong run.

78,NOV,"Investors preferred to continue investing in U.S. stocks and trimming their stakes in Bitcoin-related securities on Tuesday as the Nasdaq continued to stage one of its biggest month-to-date gains.X The Nasdaq composite rallied 0.7% while the Nasdaq 100, capturing the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that exchange, rose 0.8%.Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), meanwhile, flashed a warning sign that a prolonged correction may be in the works. The popular fund dropped 2% to 1,653.90, sinking for a third straight session and giving back all of last Thursday's strong rebound. The fund is also losing more ground below its critical 50-day moving average.Bitcoin Investment Trust gave astute chart readers a pair of sell signals in December when it showed some clear signs of a climax run, one of the most important sell signals featured in IBD market columns. Bitcoin also slashed through its 10-day moving average, a good sell trigger for short-term traders.The PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq 100, is now at 169.49. The heavily traded ETF extended its overall gain since a Day 3 follow-through on June 30, 2016, to more than 57%. A follow-through is a vital market-turning signal that was noted by The Big Picture back then. Typical follow-through rallies occur on the fourth day or later after an initial rally attempt that follows a significant market correction.Meanwhile, some blue chips took a break as the Dow Jones industrial average finished practically at breakeven. At least seven of the 30 member stocks in the Dow Jones industrials fell 1 point or more, including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) following its plan to take a $13.6 billion charge following the new tax code and repatriate billions in profits back into America immediately. The company also suffered a setback in court over a drug patent.The S&P 500 lifted 0.2%. Breadth was positive on both exchanges; on the Nasdaq, winners smashed losers by a nearly 4-3 margin. NYSE winners crushed losers by nearly 9-to-5.J&J slid 4% to 141.83 in heavy turnover, but the uptrend remains in place as the diversified medical products giant remains above its 50-day line. At its recent peak, the stock held a 14.9% profit since clearing a 129.10 buy point in a long base on base, a key pattern for those who want to buy the most bullish growth stocks.Apple (AAPL) edged slightly higher to 177.04 and trades just a few points off its all-time peak of 180.10. At that peak, the largest company in the U.S. exchanges by market cap ($900 billion) has run 52% since the pivotal breakout from a cup with handle at 118.12 on Jan. 6, 2017.Apple is also up nearly 10% from its latest true base, a second-stage cup with handle that provided a 160.97 entry. The base formed from Sept. 5 to Oct. 26. Volume on the Oct. 27 breakout came in strong, 64% above the 50-day average. It later tried to break out from a flat base at 176.34 but has not climbed much from that entry.While the iPhone and digital services titan has sort of set the standard over the past 12 months on how a giant company can turn things around and rally nicely from key breakouts points, the market's rally across techland means that IBD-style growth investors can possibly find other big cap names that could present even richer stock profit potential.Four names to consider include:Lam Research (LRCX), a play on semiconductor equipment, $34 billion market cap: The stock rallied nearly 3% to 215.05 and is crafting the right side of a new cup-style base since peaking at 219.70 on Nov. 21.Lam, which had been regularly featured in IBD Big Cap 20 throughout 2017, is expected to grow fiscal second-quarter earnings by a whopping 64% to $3.68 a share. In contrast, Apple's profit in the just-ended fiscal first quarter is expected to rise 13%.PayPal (PYPL), digital payments pioneer, $101 billion market cap: The stock floated 0.2% higher to 84.18, a fifth straight gain, and is now up 5.9% past the recent breakout from a good flat base at 79.48. Shares are thus a tad extended from the proper buy zone.Earnings are seen rising 24% to 52 cents in Q4, following year-over-year gains of 13%, 17%, 19%, 28% and 31%.Salesforce.com (CRM), a business software innovator, $81 billion market cap: The Marc Benioff-led cloud-based enterprise software giant is nominally in buy range at 113.24, 3.6% above a 109.29 entry in a six-week flat base.Earnings in the January-ending fiscal fourth quarter are seen rising 18% to 33 cents a share following EPS increases of 26%, 14%, 47%, 17%, 38% and 62% in the prior six quarters. The average gain over the time span: up 34%.(Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary and analysis on growth stocks, charts and financial markets.)RELATED:Stocks Near A Buy ZoneYou're Invested In Stocks And Equity ETFs; What To Do Now?

Bitcoin reversed slightly higher despite increased scrutiny from regulators.X PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) rose 0.8%, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) climbed 0.2% and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) was fractionally lower.Techs got a boost from Netflix, which gapped up and soared 10% to a record high after reporting its quarterly results. Amazon rose 3% and graphics chip designer Nvidia advanced 2%, both to new highs. Apple (AAPL) was flat after giving up an early gain of more than 1%.Gold miners, biotech and real estate led the upside among sector funds in the stock market today.Health care, telecom and consumer staples were among the biggest decliners. Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) slipped 0.5%, but remains near all-time highs. Component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), its biggest holding, sank 4% in heavy trade after a federal appeals court upheld a ruling that invalidated a patent on its Remicade arthritis drug.

Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) fell 4% to slide further below its 50-day moving average.Here's a leading stock play to consider if you favor high dividend payers such as Ford (F) and Verizon Communications (VZ), which offer yields north of 4%.PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio (SPHD) is rebounding off its 50-day moving average line, which sets up a potential buy opportunity. Shares advanced nearly 4% from its last test of the support line in late October. The fund was featured in this ETF column on Nov. 3 as it moved up off the 50-day line.SPHD, which marked its fifth anniversary in October, has amassed $3 billion in assets. It tracks the S&P 500 Low Volatility High Dividend Index, which comprises 50 stocks on the benchmark index that have a history of providing high dividend yields with low volatility. The fund and index are rebalanced and reconstituted twice a year.SPHD screens for the top 75 S&P 500 companies based on their dividend payout, according to Morningstar Direct, then omits the 25 stocks with the highest volatility in the prior year. That lowers the fund's exposure to riskier names.Real estate accounted for the biggest sector weighting at nearly 22% of assets, followed by utilities at about 17%. Information technology, energy and consumer staples contributed around 11%, financials 9%, telecommunication services 5.5%. Smaller allocations were in industrials, health care, consumer discretionary and materials.Top holdings as of Jan. 19 included Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Verizon, Iron Mountain (IRM), CME Group (CME) and Ford. The top five made up 14.5% of the portfolio. Iron Mountain offers a 6.6% annualized dividend yield, Ford 5% and Verizon 4.5%.IBD's TAKE: Verizon Communications pays a hefty annualized dividend of 4.5%, but how do its fundamentals rate in its industry group? Find out now at IBD Stock Checkup.SPHD returned 0.7% this year as of Jan. 19, trailing the S&P 500's 5.2% gain. The ETF's average annual returns over the past three and five years of 12% and 15%, respectively, slightly lag the benchmark index, which gained 14% and 16% over the same periods. SPHD pays an annualized dividend of 3.2% vs. the S&P 500's average 1.7% payout. The fund carries a 0.30% expense ratio.Monday's pick, Global X Social Media (SOCL), is slightly extended from a Jan. 2 rebound off the 50-day line. It extended its win streak for a fourth straight session on Monday.RELATED:Stocks Rise After Senate Vote; Biotech Soars, But Bitcoin DropsStocks Mixed As Nike Leads Dow, GE, Apple Weigh; Bitcoin QuietTop Chip Stocks Defy Market's Trend; Bitcoin Play Bounces Back

80,NOV,"Think of penny stocks the same way you think of really cheap perfume.X The fact that you could buy 100,000 shares of a 10-cent stock for $10,000 might sound very enticing. After all, with that many shares in the portfolio, you might feel like a company insider or an institutional-class investor.The thought that the penny stock just needs to rise another 10 cents to double in price may be like an irresistible cologne or eau de toilette.The truth? As you learn and master the rules of IBD-style investing, you quickly learn that a stock's share price is a function of a company's quality and growth record. In the long run, stocks with higher quality, big institutional support and strong growth will give you consistent results.A stock that is trading at 20, 60 or 100 a share or more is attractive to fund managers across the globe. With millions of dollars to invest, each portfolio manager still needs to buy a cartload of shares of such a stock.Now, let's imagine what it would be like to try to build a $50 million stake in a company whose shares trade at 20 cents each. The manager would have to accumulate 250 million shares. Few companies have that many shares outstanding, let alone a float that large.If you spot a stock in the IBD 50 that trades at least 1 million shares a day at 40, it has $40 million of daily turnover. This allows funds to buy and sell shares smoothly, making less of a serious intraday impact on the price.Of course, some pros excel at buying and holding stocks that trade for less than a buck or two a share. But even for them, the road to profits is not smooth. Penny stocks are a whole lot closer to becoming financial dust if the underlying company files for bankruptcy.Do you remember Central European Distribution? (The company traded under the ticker symbol CEDC before going private and then later winning court approval in May 2013 to restructure financially, wiping out a ton of outstanding long-term debt.) The exporter of fine wines and liquors and vodka distiller in Poland moved like a hot rod during the 2003-to-2007 bull run. IBD frequently covered the former then-IBD 100 member. In July 2008, the stock traded as high as 77.48.But after the 2008 bear market, CEDC never made a new high again. On Feb. 26, 2013, the stock fell 77 cents, or 55%, to 62 cents amid a mountain of souring convertible debt. Despite efforts to shore up its finances, CEDC kept falling until its stock was suspended from trading on April 12. On July 8, Nasdaq said it would delist shares of CEDC as well as three more companies.Care more about the dollar size and quality of your investment, not the sheer number of shares you own.Suppose you bought $10,000 worth of Apple (AAPL) when it first broke out of a first-stage base on March 4, 2004. The buy point was 24.94, the average volume was 5.7 million shares. That's solid liquidity. So what if you owned just 400 shares? Apple rose 179% to 69.57 by Nov. 29, growing your wad to $27,900.Today, Apple trades near 177 following a 7-for-1 split in June 2014. Profit and sales increases surely are not going at the same clip it did a decade ago, but the megacap tech still is capable of churning out low double-digit EPS and revenue gains.That's remarkable for a company with $229.2 billion in fiscal 2017 revenue (ended in September last year), 5.09 billion shares outstanding, and earnings expected to climb 24% in the current FY 2018 to $11.46 a share.(A version of this column was first published in the Aug. 14, 2013, edition of IBD.

"
81,NOV,"Biotech and internet-related large caps helped the Nasdaq composite forge a solid gain of 1% Monday, while General Electric (GE) is trying to put the skids on a sharp five-day slide that sucked out nearly $28 billion worth of the company's market value.X Meanwhile, oil and gas shares continued to advance in droves as energy prices remain strong. WTI crude oil futures reversed from small early losses and edged 0.2% higher to $63.49 a barrel.Diamondback Energy (FANG), an IBD Leaderboard play, jumped more than 3% to 132.21 and extended gains past a 115.03 buy point to nearly 15%.GE, the focus of a front-page story in the latest IBD Weekly, has a $139 billion market cap and 8.67 billion shares outstanding. At the end of the devastating 2008-09 bear market, GE traded as low as 5.73 a share, equivalent to a $49 billion market value at that time.The Nasdaq 100 — led by 1%-plus gains from tech heavyweights Alphabet (GOOGL), Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) — lifted 0.8%. The S&P 500 gained 0.8% while the Dow Jones industrial average lagged, up nearly 0.6%.Apple (AAPL), the largest company on the Nasdaq and a Dow 30 component, fell 0.8% to 177 but volume was dull. The iPhone giant, despite getting new downgrades, is not triggering any sell signals. Shares are up 10% since clearing a fine second-stage cup with handle at 160.97 on Oct. 27, and slightly above the more recent entry at 176.34.The megacap tech recently hopped off its 50-day moving average near 170 three weeks ago, justifying a follow-on buy for holders with a nice profit cushion in the stock.The Russell 2000 rose nearly 0.4%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and was sharply down on the NYSE, according to preliminary data.GE, part of the 30-stock Dow industrials, is now trading 33% below its 200-day moving average, which too has been falling hard since May of last year. Excluding the brief flash crash of August 2015, the last time GE fell this hard below the important long-term level was all the way back in March 2009, the tail end of the market's severe slide after topping in November 2007.Plus, notice how a rally in early January this year failed to keep GE shares above their 50-day moving average for long. Healthy stocks trade above their 50-day moving average, which in turn leads the 200-day moving average higher. For GE, the opposite is occurring.Technically speaking, GE could find some buyers among the value investing crowd. However, as noted in this GE feature by IBD, GE faces the unenviable task of deciding whether to maintain positions in the power, aviation and health care markets, or to sell more parts of itself to become leaner and meaner.GE's attractiveness as a dividend play has definitely lost its luster after the board approved a 50% haircut in the quarterly dividend to 12 cents a share in November.Within the Dow Jones industrial average, fellow component Verizon Communications (VZ) makes IBD's Dividend Leaders screen. The telecom giant, which has a 4.5% annualized yield and a terrific three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 5 on a scale of zero to 99, rose nearly 2% to 52.89 in fast turnover. A move past 53.79, 10 cents above the high in the handle of a long saucer base, could present a timely buy point.The Street expects Verizon to post a 2% rise in fourth-quarter profit to 88 cents a share on a 3% lift in revenue to $33.25 billion. Results come out Tuesday before the market open. (Check IBD's earnings calendar for other companies set to report results.)Meanwhile, fellow Dow 30 components Intel (INTC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) continue to do well, with gains of 2% each. The former is still forming a new base. The latter appears to be building a shallow new base atop a much longer saucer with handle that furnished a breakout past 247.17 on Nov. 30.Elsewhere in the stock market today, biotechs helped lead the upside following news that French pharma giant Sanofi (SNY) is buying Biogen (BIIB) spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) for more than $11 billion, while Celgene (CELG) confirmed rumors that it's buying Juno Therapeutics (JUNO).At least 11 of the 463 companies in IBD's biotech industry group hold a solid Composite Rating of 90 or higher and trade at least 10 a share. They include Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), which hold an awesome score of 98 and 97, respectively.Ligand ran up nearly 3% to 160.26 in afternoon trading, extending gains from a 149.41 buy point in an eight-week flat base to 7%, so it's a bit extended in price.Vertex, which reports Q4 results on Jan. 31 after the close, is trying to clear stubborn resistance near 160 as it builds a long flat base that could also be viewed as a saucer pattern. The standard buy point is 167.95.(Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more analysis on growth stocks, charts, and financial markets.)RELATED:Stocks Near A Buy ZoneWhere Is The Stock Market Headed?

"
82,NOV,"Has Bitcoin's sharp pullback created a buying opportunity? Or is Bitcoin just a shell game that preys on gullible suckers? One way to distill an answer is to look at how some of Wall Street's sharpest money managers play the cryptocurrency — at least, the ones who are willing to get involved with Bitcoin at all.X Even shrewd investors disagree about the wisdom of Bitcoin bets. Legendary investor Warren Buffett recently repeated that he will never invest in Bitcoin. Yet just one day earlier JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said he regrets calling Bitcoin a fraud.So with experts divided, how should you proceed? Invest? Or not? Volatility is part of the controversy. As of early Monday afternoon, the price of Bitcoin was around $10,470. That was a stomach-churning 46% below its Dec. 16 peak of $19,343.If you do invest in Bitcoin, are direct investments the best way to go? Some professional investors, including 11 mutual funds, use indirect investments instead. Among their mutual funds, hedge funds and private accounts, Kinetics Asset Management holds Bitcoin and Bitcoin proxies that were worth about $200 million as of Dec. 31, says Peter Doyle, co-manager of $171 million Kinetics Internet Fund (WWWFX).IBD'S TAKE: Keep up with news about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at IBD's special section devoted to news and trends about digital currencies.Doyle and his colleagues' performance kicked butt in 2017, helped by their Bitcoin exposure. Among their mutual funds, Kinetics Internet's 57.43% gain made it the second-best performing U.S. diversified stock mutual fund with at least $100 million in assets that year. The $15.6 million Kinetics Global (KGLAX) jumped 50.29%, topping 97% of its world small-/midcap peers, according to Morningstar Direct.Kinetics Small Cap Opportunities (KSCOX), with $197.1 million in assets, gained 26.23%. That made it the fourth-best performing small-cap blend fund. And $829 million Kinetics Paradigm's (WWNPX) 28.41% return was better than 80% of its midcap growth peers.Bitcoin itself soared 1,204% in calendar 2017, according to Coindesk.com.Kinetics mutual funds had Bitcoin exposure through Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rather than Bitcoin itself. Weightings in GBTC ranged from 12.10% by Internet to 1.32% for Small Cap Opportunities as of Sept. 30.Why do Kinetics funds own the digital currency indirectly rather than directly? ""The Securities and Exchange Commission won't let us self-custody Bitcoin itself, so owning it through Bitcoin Investment Trust is how we avoid that issue,"" Doyle said. GBTC is run by Grayscale Investments. ""Grayscale provides custodianship.""Five Kinetics funds are among 11 mutual funds that held 4.4% of GBTC shares as of Dec. 31, according to IBD data. The $554 million Emerald Banking & Finance (HSSAX) had 1.39% of its shareholders' money at work in GBTC as of Nov. 30.GBTC is publicly traded on the OTCQX, which is run by OTC Markets Group (OTCMKTS). Publicly traded companies' financial statements are audited. GBTC's financial statements are audited by Friedman LLP.GBTC's share price is set once daily like a mutual fund, although GBTC is neither a mutual fund nor an ETF and thus is not regulated under the auspices of the Securities Act of 1940.Like most publicly traded securities, you can own GBTC shares in your own name. You can leave GBTC shares to beneficiaries. You can even own them in certain IRAs.According to Grayscale, Bitcoin Investment Trust assets are stored with Xapo Inc.,  a third-party custodian. Access requires ""multisignature addresses, the private keys for which are protected by intense cryptographic, physical and process security.""Tight security is necessary because hackers have attacked various Bitcoin deposit sites. Hackers have stolen more than 14% of the total supply of Bitcoin and Ether, another digital currency, Bloomberg quoted security expert Lex Sokolin as saying last week. Last month, Youbit, a South Korean Bitcoin exchange, was forced to shut after hackers stole 17% of its assets.Assuming industrywide security issues can be solved and the price of Bitcoin can rally, why wouldn't everyone trade Bitcoin through GBTC rather than the cryptocurrency itself?One reason is that, like many hedge funds, Grayscale limits access to shares to accredited investors.That means only a person whose earned income exceeded $200,000 (or $300,000 together with a spouse) in each of the prior two years, and reasonably expects the same for the current year. Alternatively, you must have a net worth of more than $1 million, either alone or together with a spouse, excluding the value of your primary residence.A second reason is that GBTC shares trade at a steep premium to the value of Bitcoin itself. Each GBTC share represented 0.09181239 Bitcoin as of Dec. 31. At Friday's Bitcoin price of $10,470, each GBTC share represents about $961 of Bitcoin.But GBTC shares traded for 1688 each as of Monday afternoon. That's a whopping 76% premium to the value of the Bitcoins held by GBTC.Some premium might be justifiable if it's easier to buy and sell shares of this trust than to trade in Bitcoin itself. You also don't have to store and guard GBTC shares as zealously as Bitcoin. But is a 76% premium your idea of reasonable?James Davolos, a manager of Kinetics Internet, said, ""For the average investor now, the complexity of setting up a digital wallet and buying tokens on exchanges and linking them to a bank account is laborious and complicated. For a lot of individual investors, there is a high utility value in owning Bitcoin through a trust, which contributes to the premium.""Doyle adds that the trust also adds value by enabling an investor to lend and borrow shares. ""People pay 25% to 30% just for that,"" he said. ""So while there is a premium to GBTC, it is not as great as people think.""In addition, the Kinetics team is not fazed by the volatility shown by Bitcoin or the trust. ""Our overall cost basis is probably no more than $20 million, probably closer to $15 million, so even with these ups and down we've still made a lot of money and are not alarmed,"" Doyle said.Kinetics first got interested in Bitcoin and its proxies because of the interest in cryptography held by Murray Stahl, CEO of parent company Horizon Kinetics. Stahl also felt consumers and investors would gravitate to a currency that provides an alternative to ""the flawed global banking system and governments' (excess) printing of money. In fact, demand would outstrip supply, and that would be reflected in cryptocurrency's rising price,"" Doyle said.In any case, Grayscale plans an action to make GBTC's share price more affordable, at least psychologically. GBTC says it will split its shares 91-for-1. Shareholders of record as of Jan. 22's market close will get the split, which is slated for completion on Jan. 26. Shares trading for 1768, for example, would then cost about 19.43.""That split will make GBTC much more liquid,"" said Bradford Pine, president of Bradford Pine Wealth Group, a financial advisory firm in Garden City, N.Y. ""That may draw more sophisticated money into this (GBTC).""Overall, Doyle is bullish. ""Ultimately, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will become more routine in our economy,"" he said. ""Then you won't make an extra rate of return on them. That's probably five or six years from now. In the meantime, as a potential form of new currency, in the foreseeable future, you can make an extraordinary rate of return for maybe three or five years.""If that outlook is wrong? ""I can say almost with certainty that cryptocurrencies will come to a bad end,"" Warren Buffett recently told CNBC.On Friday, the Securities and Exchange Commission told the Investment Company Institute (ICI), a trade group representing mutual funds and ETFs, that before it green-lights Bitcoin investments by mutual funds, funds must satisfy SEC questions concerning valuation, liquidity and security.The SEC wrote, ""(We) are not aware of a custodian currently providing fund custodial services for cryptocurrencies. In addition, how would a fund intend to validate existence, exclusive ownership and software functionality of private cryptocurrency keys and other ownership records? To what extent would cybersecurity threats or the potential for hacks on digital wallets impact the safekeeping of fund assets under the 1940 Act?""RELATED:How To Decide If Bitcoin Is Safe For You To Trade

85,NOV,"Andrew Cilek might be — this is just a hunch — unaware that 2018 is Brooks Brothers' bicentennial. Judging by what he wore when he went out to vote in Minneapolis on Nov. 2, 2010, his preferences in shirts run less to button-down Oxford cloth than to chatty T-shirts. The question the U.S. Supreme Court will consider on Wednesday is whether Cilek's expressive shirt impermissibly interfered with Minnesota's interest in maintaining ""peace, order and decorum"" at polling places.XMinnesota forbids voters from wearing in a polling place political badges, buttons or other insignia designed to ""influence and impact"" voting, or ""promoting a group with recognizable political views,"" even if the things worn do not refer to any candidate or issue on that day's ballot. Nine other states have similar laws, and all 50 states have ""speech-free zones"" around polling places. Cilek's T-shirt featured the Gadsden Flag (""Don't Tread on Me"") and a small tea party logo. He also sported a button, from a group worried about voter fraud, that read ""Please I.D. Me."" He was temporarily prevented from voting, so, being a real — that is, litigious — American he went to court.The Supreme Court has found no constitutional infirmity in campaign-free zones, but Minnesota's law as Cilek experienced it seems to mandate a First Amendment-free zone, which he says is unconstitutionally overbroad. Minnesota has admitted that its law also would forbid apparel bearing the logos of, for example, the Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO, which do indeed have ""recognizable political views."" These might (to use the language of campus speech police) ""trigger"" in people who see them ... what? Political thoughts perhaps tangentially related to candidates or propositions on the ballot?A lower court upheld the law used against Cilek's T-shirt as furthering Minnesota's legitimate interest in polling-place ""peace, order and decorum"" and ""the integrity of its election process"" and — the nanny state never sleeps — to protect voters ""from confusion and undue influence."" What is more offensive, the paternalistic condescension of the government assuming that ""confusion"" will somehow discombobulate voters who glimpse, say, an ""American Legion"" or ""NAACP"" sweatshirt, or the government's hubris as censor of influence that is ""undue""?It is one thing to ban, as the court has allowed, active ""solicitation of votes"" in or close to a polling place. It is, however, a bit much for Minnesota to forbid passive expression of political — very broadly defined — allegiances not associated with any person or issue being voted on. What about a shirt emblazoned with the words ""America is the land of opportunity""? Those words, which a guide for University of California employees says can constitute a ""microaggression,"" could trigger fainting spells among voters at polling places sniffing for the reek of unchecked white privilege.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersAnd what about a T-shirt with a pristinely unpolitical message (e.g., ""I despise cocker spaniels"") that might disturb some sensitive souls in a polling place? The Supreme Court can try to enunciate what is unimaginable — clear standards concerning every conceivable language use in a hypersensitive America. Or the court can give its squint of strict scrutiny to all such polling-place laws, many of which will not pass muster. Otherwise, polling-place officials will have broad discretion to lay down the law, if it can be dignified as law, on an ad hoc basis concerning what is and is not a ""recognizable"" political view or ""undue"" influence.The First Amendment was ratified in 1791. One hundred and twenty-eight years passed before the court confronted a case — three cases, actually — squarely concerning freedom of speech. Dealing disgracefully with residues of Woodrow Wilson's wartime semi-totalitarianism, the court held: During wartime, the government can restrict speech that could ""create a clear and present danger"" of evils that Congress has the power to prevent. And the guarantee of free speech does not protect printing leaflets urging disruption of the war effort. And Wilson's administration did not violate the amendment when it imprisoned Eugene Victor Debs — he had received 6% of presidential vote as the Socialist Party's candidate in 1912 — because he made an anti-war speech.Nowadays, the court frequently adjudicates speech controversies because governments eagerly embrace sinister rationalizations for ""balancing"" free speech against competing values, to the detriment of free speech. Hence the court should affirm Cilek's admirably prickly resistance to Minnesota's officiousness. Today more than ever, with freedom of expression increasingly threatened, an American's default position regarding restrictions should be: Don't tread on me.You might also like ...Janus v.

86,NOV,"Market breadth continues to improve as the key indexes showed solid gains on Monday with just two trading sessions remaining in February.X The advance is even more impressive given the negative reaction among a few Chinese companies trading on the NYSE, including New Oriental Education (EDU) and TAL Education (TAL), amid news that China's leader, Xi Jinping, may be able to exceed his two-term limit as the country's president.TAL fell more than 5%, yet closed near the top of its intraday range. At 36.81, the stock also is holding mildly above a 36.26 buy point in a choppy late-stage base. TAL has been a monster winner, rising nearly six-fold since it initially broke out of an excellent cup with handle at 6.54 (adjusted for a 6-for-1 stock split) in the week ended Nov. 13, 2015. That base could also be interpreted as a double bottom.New Oriental, down 4% to 92.02, is trading just below a 50-day moving average and may be in the early stages of forming a new base.Plus, leading Chinese internet and e-commerce stocks don't seem to be having a severe reaction overall. Autohome (ATHM), part of IBD Leaderboard, fell more than 2%, but volume was mildly below average.The auto information website is up 28% year-to-date and remains on the north side of its 50-day moving average. Autohome, being a midcap firm with a market value of just under $10 billion, still tends to trade more wildly than, say, any stock on the Dow Jones industrial average.The Nasdaq gained 0.9% amid nice rallies by the FAANG stocks, while the S&P 500 matched that gain. Alphabet (GOOGL), which stands a good chance of posting mild double-digit profit growth in both 2018 and 2019, rose 1.1% to 1,141 in light trade and is working on new cup-type base.A cup base must be a minimum of six weeks in length, while a strong cup with handle should never be less than seven weeks.Alphabet is up more than 8% year to date, and its relative strength line (drawn in blue in every IBD chart) reflects outperformance vs. the S&P 500 for more than two weeks. The megacap tech is also up more than 13% (or extended) from an October breakout past a well-formed flat base that showed a 1,006.29 buy point, or a dime above the base's left-side peak set on July 24.The stock market followed through on Valentine's Day, when the Nasdaq ripped 1.9% higher in heavier volume vs. the prior day. That big gain came on day four of a new rally attempt following a nearly 12% correction by the leading market index.Also on Feb. 14, the S&P 500 rallied 1.3% higher as NYSE volume rose, marking a follow-through day of its own.Leading stocks lagged a bit, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) gained just 0.5%. The exchange traded fund managed by Innovator Capital that tracks stocks in the IBD 50 was up more than 37% in 2017.Top industry groups for the day included solar, computer networking, RV makers, fiber-optic telecom equipment, mortgage services, airlines and movies, all up 2% or more. Only a handful of IBD's 197 industry groups fell 1% or more, including dairy products, home-furnishings retailers, specialty retailers and auto parts.Another reason why Monday's gain is impressive: U.S. new-home sales for January came in at 593,000 on an annualized rate, badly missing the Econoday estimate of 640,000. Indeed, interest-rate-sensitive names are struggling in 2018 as U.S. government bond prices keep falling, jacking up interest rates.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond was around 2.86%, still off its recent peak of 2.95%, but up from 2.40% at the end of last year.Year to date, at least 14 of IBD's 197 industry groups have risen 10% or more. And 11 groups sport an advance of 12% or more. In contrast, the S&P 500, at 2779, is up less than 4% since Jan. 1, excluding dividends.Such information is vital for the growth investor. Why?Decades of research by IBD show that as much as half of a great stock market winner's move is influenced by the performance of its broad industry sector and precise industry group. For this reason, IBD ranks every one of the 197 industry groups and subgroups by six-month relative performance each day. See the current list in IBD Data Tables, featured inside IBD Stock Lists.Leisures-Movies and Retail-Internet are up 21% and 20%, respectively, since Jan. 1.

89,NOV,"The concept of compounding is a brilliant one. You perform this when buying more shares in a stock that dishes up fat dividends. Or when you reinvest capital gains in a mutual fund or high-yield exchange traded fund with new shares.X Can you compound your gains in high growth stocks? Sure. Two steps are key.First, buy a high-quality stock on the breakout from a solid cup with handle, double bottom, flat base or other essential chart pattern. The market should be in a confirmed uptrend; find out for sure in The Big Picture.A brilliant stock rockets above the entry. Then at some point, it catches its breath. That's good. A mild pullback keeps all parties to the stock honest. The stock may then rebound off the 10-week moving average at a higher price than the original breakout. When you see the rally resume, it's often a sterling opportunity to add some more shares to your core position.Never used the 10-week moving average before? Don't fear. It simply graphs the average closing price over the 10 past trading weeks. Once a new trading week is done, a new 10-week average is calculated. That's why it's a ""moving"" average.Coherent (COHR) offered great chances to add to a winning play after a January 2016 breakout from an 11-week base at 69.77 — 10 cents above the high on Nov. 5, 2015 — that was part of a long saucer base. The industrial laser expert rallied 40% over 12 weeks to 99.82, then pulled back.When the stock crossed back above the 10-week line in May (1) around 91.68 and in early July (2) near 91.75, one could have added shares. How many? Consider a quarter or a third the size of your core stake.A stock sometimes is so strong that it rises 50%, 100% or more without even pricking the 10-week moving average. Instead, perhaps the stock traded tightly for weeks. Perhaps a three-weeks-tight or four-weeks-tight entry point unfolds. A strong advance that follows may offer the precise follow-on entry.Ideally, the stock will rebound in heavy or increasing volume. If trading is light, focus on the price action. Does the stock quickly mop up recent losses and rally to new highs? If so, your stock is showing vigorous demand from the institutional crowd. You're likely to not only see a nice gain in the first shares you bought, but additional profits in the second wad of shares.Wilder stocks may test investors' mental strength and discipline by going all the way back to the initial entry. But the rebound may offer a second chance to buy properly.(Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary on investing, stocks, and financial markets.)RELATED:Finding Excellent Stocks For Your Watch List: Inside IBD 50Finding Excellent Stocks For Your Watch List, Part II: Inside Big Cap 20When To Sell A Stock: Sometimes, Multiple Defense-Type Sell Signals Take Place At OnceIs It Okay To Buy Stocks Now?

91,NOV,"The Nasdaq composite is trading near session highs in late-afternoon trading Friday with a nearly 0.5% gain. The leading index in 2017, up 28.2% that year, looks poised to stage a third up week in a row. At 7316, the tech-centered index is up nearly 0.8% for the week.XThe Nasdaq rallied 3.4% and 1.7% in the first two trading weeks of 2018 in what is shaping up to be one of the strongest starts in recent years.Digital payments firms continue to lead the market upside. PayPal (PYPL), a member of the IBD 50, added another 0.8% to 83.63 in below-average trade and is now mildly extended past a 79.48 buy point in a third-stage flat base.PayPal had first broken out of a long saucer-like pattern around 44 in April 2017, rallied more than 37%, then built a narrow five-week flat base that produced a 55.24 entry. PayPal broke out of that second-stage base on July 10 and rallied nearly 44% before correcting quickly in price for two weeks in late November to early December.Great stocks have the ability to keep running higher even after forming two, three or even four bases. But such market leaders are rare, as noted in this column in IBD's Investor's Corner, a longtime feature dedicated to helping readers how to buy and sell stocks more profitably.Meanwhile, Google site operator Alphabet (GOOGL) has gotten off to a roaring start, at least among megacap names, in 2018. Shares are down slightly, yet the stock has now advanced 7.7% since Jan. 1.Apple (AAPL)  is up 5.5% since Jan. 1. The iPhone giant, though, has had a masterful run since breaking out of a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12 back on Jan. 6, 2017.More recently, Apple cleared a 106.97 entry in an eight-week cup with handle Oct. 27, just ahead of reporting robust quarterly results.Nevertheless, both stocks are acting in healthy fashion following recent breakouts. Alphabet has rolled nearly 13% since it cleared a 1,006.29 entry in a 10-week flat base on Oct. 11.At 3 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 rose 0.3% on the back of gains in meat, tobacco, truck, electronic parts, shoe retail, specialty retail and lodging shares. Breadth is positive on both exchanges. Winning issues are exceeding losers by a more than 2-1 margin on the Nasdaq and roughly 9-5 on the NYSE.The Dow Jones industrial average reversed from small losses to edge slightly higher. But IBM (IBM) is weighing on the Dow, sliding more than 7 points or 4% to 161.56 following a big gap up Wednesday. IBM, which has been struggling for years to post meaningful gains in the top line, is still in the early stages of building the right side of a bottoming base.An additional four of the 30 components in the Dow industrials, including American Express (AXP) and Visa (V), are down 1 point or more. Amex dropped more than 3% to 96.75 and is undercutting the key 50-day moving average in whale-like volume. It's the first time Amex has probed the medium-term support level since early September.The financial services powerhouse reported a net loss of $1.41 a share on a 12% revenue increase to $9.42 billion.Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) backed off 57.93 to 1,799 in very light volume. The closed end fund that tracks the popular alternative digital currency is trying to hold above its fast-rising 50-day moving average.While a pullback to the 50-day line and subsequent rebound can serve as a legitimate follow-on entry, keep in mind that the fund has already made a tremendous price run following a Nov. 22 breakout past 985.10 in a very deep cup with handle. The gain from that buy point reached as much as 257%.In addition, climax-run-style action also makes it more likely that Bitcoin Investment may need more time to shape another potential good base and supply a better entry point.One major differentiator between Alphabet and Apple for investors is the fact that for years, the former has been investing in self-driving technology that in the future could become standard in all vehicles. Some observers believe that its software development may eventually become a significant new revenue driver.For now, digital ads remain Alphabet's bread and butter. In the past six quarters, revenue has climbed 21%, 20%, 22%, 22%, 21% and 24% vs. year-ago levels. That fantastic growth has boosted earnings as well, up 42%, 27%, 7%, 28%, 27% and 32% vs. year-ago levels over the same time frame.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see earnings jumping 32% in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $10 a share, which would be a quarterly high. Alphabet has 694 million shares outstanding across all share classes and a float of 295 million. Revenue is seen rising 22% to $31.85 billion.Alphabet is slated to report Q4 results Feb. 1 after the close. The stock earns a top-notch 99 Composite Rating on IBD Stock Checkup, as well as an A for SMR Rating that tracks sales growth, profit margins, and return on equity.Apple continues to be on a solid growth track as well. The Street sees earnings in the December-ended fiscal first quarter rising 13% to $3.78 a share, then accelerating to a 38% gain to $2.90 in the March-ending second quarter, on revenue gains of 10% and 29%.Elsewhere, the Dow utility average flipped 0.3% lower amid another sell-off in U.S. Treasury bonds, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond up to 2.64%, eclipsing the March 2017 high of 2.62%.WTI crude oil prices fell 0.9% to $63.36 a barrel but are still up 5% since Jan. 1.(Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more analysis on growth stocks, charts and financial markets.)RELATED:Stocks Near A Buy ZoneThe Latest In Investor's CornerWhere Is The Stock Market Headed In 2018?

92,NOV,"Columbia Mid Cap Growth Fund (CLSPX) is revving up its engine. In recent periods, the $1.9 billion portfolio has been neck-and-neck with or a tad ahead of the broad market and its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct. So far this young year, going into Thursday, the fund is up 5.08% vs. 4.89% for the S&P 500 and 4.64% for its peer group. That's an improvement over the past three years, when it slightly lagged the S&P 500.X Credit starts with leading stocks held by the fund. Top holdings FleetCor Technologies (FLT) and Red Hat (RHT) rose 36% and 74% in the past 12 months. Top new buy Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Arista Networks (ANET) rose 42% and 198%.Other holdings include Thor Industries (THO) and Align Technologies (ALGN), which are up 48% and 186% in the past 12 months. Like Arista and FleetCor, they happen to be members of the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.Eight of the fund's 10 largest positions as of Dec. 31 had IBD Composite Ratings in the 80s or 90s. So did seven of its 10 top new buys. IBD's Composite Rating is scored on a scale of 1 to 99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.Managers George Myers, Brian Neigut and William Chamberlain invest in companies poised for sustainable long-term growth and which have high or improving margins and returns on invested capital.And the managers consider midcaps the sweet spot of the market. With market capitalizations between $2 billion and $30 billion when the fund buys them, midcap stocks are ""big enough to offer stability yet small enough to deliver significant growth opportunities,"" the managers explain in their Dec. 31 fact sheet.Commercial fleet payment processor FleetCor was the fund's top holding as of Dec. 31. Its weighting rose to 2.65% from 1.72% at the end of September. Trading around 204, share price is extended from its November breakout from a 171.88 buy point of a long base.Late last year the company boosted its share buyback program and said that Wal-Mart (WMT) would begin to accept its payment cards at fueling stations.Red Hat earnings per share grew 12%, 40% and 20% the past three quarters. Red Hat is the top provider of open-source Linux software for corporate data centers.As IBD has reported, analysts have been looking for traction in Red Hat's public cloud business as customers shift computing workloads to cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon and a Red Hat partner.Dollar Tree re-entered the portfolio in October. EPS grew 10%, 37% and 40% the past three quarters. In December, the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and sales. It also raised its full-year earnings and sales forecasts.The managers began their current stake in Arista in November. EPS grew 30%, 37%, 81% and 95% the past four quarters. The cloud-networking software maker is the No. 1 ranked stock in IBD's Computer-Networking industry group, which in turn is ranked second among IBD's 197 industry groups.Arista has been taking share from Cisco in the data center-switching market. ""We think Arista's long-term software development will continue to drive share gains as already demonstrated by the current 100 gigabit cycle and recent switch-router traction,"" Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette recently told IBD.IBD'S TAKE: You can see how Arista's strengths — like its 49% three-year EPS growth rate — stack up against its peers' at the stock's easy-to-read IBD Stock Checkup page.Recreational vehicle maker conglomerate Thor Industries gapped up 13% on Nov. 28 as it was about to report a 63% jump in quarterly earnings after the close. That 63% hike capped increases of 27%, 40% and 44% the prior three stanzas.Invisible braces maker Align is known for its computer-assisted design approach to straightening teeth. Its EPS growth has accelerated for three quarters, growing 18%, 37% and 60% in the three most recent frames. Sales growth has also accelerated in that period.Trading around 272 and forming a new base, shares are just 2% above their 266.51 cup-shaped base buy point.The stock is ranked No. 1 in its IBD Medical-Products industry group.RELATED:2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains, With A Foreign TiltYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

93,NOV,"Let's say you design cars for a living. Before rushing them out into the world, you'd probably want to test them to see how they handle in real life. You could, if you wanted, build test car after test car, and drive them into the ground until the transmission evaporates. Maybe you'll just keep crashing them into walls, until you've anticipated every possible scenario and, perhaps, destroyed your budget.   X Or, you might do what Ford (F), General Motors (GM), Boeing (BA), Airbus (EADSY) and thousands of businesses worldwide are doing to be more prudent with their time and more precise with their designs: Use software made by a relatively unknown IPO, Altair Engineering (ALTR), to simulate and predict how their products will perform in the real world. Usage of Altair's software seems ever likelier, analysts say, as computing costs fall and an array of products — including from the automakers that drive the bulk of Altair's sales — get smarter. And they say Altair's sales growth is set to outpace that of its rivals, helped by the company's early adoption of the technology, acquisitions and a way of selling products that plays toward engineers' curiosity.""The portfolio of products that we have, it's very well-positioned to support the automotive market in that space as well as the supplier universe,"" Chief Financial Officer Howard Morof told Investors Business Daily. ""That's not just specific to automotive — there are sensors almost everywhere nowadays.""Over the years, Altair's portfolio has helped NASA better predict how a space capsule might fare in a splashdown landing. It has given Medtronic (MDT) more insight into how to design a better stent. It gave Unilever (UL) more clarity into how it could design a better deodorant can for Lynx — better known as Axe, of body-spray fame, in the U.S.As Altair bombards product designs with code rather than the elements, companies with products to test can make better decisions about ways to design products, and save money otherwise spent designing actual, physical prototypes.""They're the editor that says 'Take this chapter out, or move this character there' — that kind of thing,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis said. While Altair came public just two months ago to pay down debt, it entered the stock market as a company that already had a global presence. Founded in 1985, the company over that time has added some 5,000 customers and tens of thousands of users to its name, with 69 offices in 24 nations. Over that time, the pencil drawings on paper or computer that were once the basis of product testing have given way to simulation technology, which Altair Chief Executive James Scapa, at a conference on Wednesday, said could have the ability to ""dictate"" the parameters of design. ""What's happened now is that the physical design is being replaced with simulations,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Nandan Amladi said. ""So you can essentially design the physical object in a simulated environment and do the crash-testing simulation within that environment so that you don't actually have to build the physical prototype until much later on in the process.""And since 1996, Altair has acquired 19 companies or technologies, cramming 11 of them into the past three years, RBC analysts said. Horof said mergers would continue to be a part of its long-term growth strategy. Analysts say Altair could be headed for a stretch of mid-teens annual sales gains, in a roughly $6 billion simulation and analysis software market that has only grown in the high-single digits on overage. That industry-outpacing expansion would also be propelled by the company's unique way of selling its product. In that model, which the company calls a ""units""-based model, a customer receives the company's entire product line — amounting to dozens of applications — and the customers license those units based on how many people will use the software. Historically, Amladi says, software companies have sold a specific set of products. Altair's model encourages broader, more active use, he says. In 2016, RBC notes, the average customer used around 15 of the applications offered by the company. ""If you're an innovative engineer, it's a nice sandbox to play in,"" Amladi told IBD, ""because you can essentially use whatever's suitable.""The company gets most of its sales via HyperWorks, its flagship simulation platform. Altair also has products in the Internet of Things and cloud computing. According to RBC, 48% of Altair's sales in 2016 came from customers in the automotive industry. In one way, that works out in its favor, as Ford and GM pump more money into self-driving cars and electric vehicles.   ""We expect heavy user industries like auto that are at or near cyclical peaks will continue to invest as new initiatives around electric vehicles and autonomous driving motivate more simulation regardless of the economic backdrop of the current business,"" JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty said in the firm's investment thesis on the company.  None of Altair's customers accounted for more than 10% of its billings in 2016. But if the auto industry got sick — U.S. auto sales slipped last year and are expected to do so this year — Altair could catch cold too. As the company builds up its sales force by 10%-15%, execution will become more important. JPMorgan analysts say they're confident in Altair's technology, but cite sales execution as a primary risk to its financial targets for the company.  Other risks include foreign exchange. Altair also competes against some much bigger rivals, like Germany's Siemens (SIEGY) and France's Dassault Systemes, which might have more cushion to discount their software.  Around 60% of Altair's new business comes from existing customers, according to Deutsche Bank. Wall Street could press the company to shift that ratio — toward snapping up new business from new customers — something Amladi said remained an important issue to watch.  As a new issue with only one earnings report under its belt, a few quarters likely are needed for shares to even out. Shares jumped in the three weeks after their debut, but have gotten choppier over the past week, running in the red before climbing back up Thursday. Canaccord's Davis, in his Nov. 27 initiation note on the company, said that despite its potential the stock, which was just under $23 then, was still too expensive. A pullback to below $20, or signs of better growth and profitability within a year or so, could make the company more attractive, he said.  ""As one guy explained to me, being public is like being nibbled to death by ducks,"" Davis told IBD. ""None of the individual investors will kill you, but it's kind of irritating.""Shares of Altair jumped 4.7% to 26.70 in afternoon trading Friday.

The loss erased all of the stock's gains for 2018, leaving shares at their lowest level since the company reported its third-quarter results on Nov. 16. Amazon.com (AMZN) rose 1.1% after MKM Partners hoisted the stock's price target to 1750, up from 1,350. On Tuesday, the stock ran against the market, rising 1.4% in firm trade. The move continued the stock's rebound from support at the 10-week moving average, pushing shares almost to the 20% profit-taking level, following a flat base breakout in January.  
"
99,NOV,"The major market averages looked to rebound from Tuesday's heavy volume reversal with modest gains early Wednesday as leading chip stock ASML (ASML) surged higher in the stock market today. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.2%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average moved up 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively.X Meanwhile, Bitcoin continued its string of recent heavy declines, falling another 16% to pierce through the $10,000 level, according to Coindesk.Among the Dow Jones industrials, Apple (AAPL) was mostly unchanged despite an analyst downgrade. Longbow Research cut its rating on the iPhonemaker from buy to neutral, citing a ""good, not great iPhone cycle."" Shares have been fighting to regain a 176.34 flat-base buy point.Elsewhere in the Dow, Goldman Sachs (GS) topped the Street's forecasts, but its trading operations continued to see significant weakness compared to other big banks. Shares dropped over 3% and have been struggling to maintain their momentum since a Nov. 1 breakout above a 247.18 buy saucer-with-handle buy point. The stock found itself back at its 50-day line where it will need to find support.Meanwhile, rival investment bank Bank of America (BAC) announced mixed results, as shares traded 2% lower. The stock remains up more than 20% from a 25.45 cup-shaped base buy point.Leading chip stocks were seeing buying demand early Wednesday after chip-gear maker ASML reported strong Q4 results. Shares jumped 6%, following up on Tuesday's breakout above a 186.47 cup-shaped base buy point. The stock was extended from the entry.Applied Materials (AMAT) advanced 2%, as the stock continues to etch the right side of a potential base. Look for the stock's relative strength to drastically improve; it has been underperforming the general market since late November.FANG stocks Amazon.com (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) saw heavy selling Wednesday, as shares declined 0.7% and 1.7%, respectively. Amazon remains extended from a 1,213.51 flat-base entry, while Netflix is extended from its own 204.48 flat-base buy point.Among companies reporting earnings, Charles Schwab (SCHW) fell 0.4% after meeting Q4 earnings and sales targets.

100,NOV,"Stocks were mostly lower Thursday despite big gains from chip stocks ASML (ASML) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), and Bitcoin's rebound.X PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) closed fractionally higher, while SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) fell nearly 0.4% and and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) gave up 0.2%. Small caps led the downside with iShares Core S&P Small-Cap (IJR) and iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) losing 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively.Real estate, energy and metals miners were among the biggest sector fund losers in the stock market today. Most oil plays dipped as West Texas intermediate crude prices slid 0.3% to $63.75 a barrel.Chip gear makers and retail bucked the downtrend. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) rose 0.7% to a new record high. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), its top holding, surged more than 3% after its quarterly results topped views. Shares are near the top of a buy range from a 42.67 cup-with-handle entry cleared Wednesday.ASML, which leapt 7% Wednesday, extended its gains with a 2% rise. The Netherlands-based chip gear maker on Wednesday delivered strong earnings results.Gold plays declined along with gold futures, which shed 0.9% to $1,326.70 an ounce.Bitcoin, meanwhile, climbed 5% to $11,734.94, according to CoinDesk. The cryptocurrency was off an earlier high of $12,045.10, but has rebounded from Wednesday's dive below $10,000. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) gapped up 14% to retake its 50-day moving average. A strong bounce off the support line offers a potential buy opportunity, but keep in mind that GBTC can be a highly volatile play.Ethereum and Ripple bounced back from Wednesday's slump too.If you could get triple the performance of the hottest chip stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Texas Instruments (TXN), would you go for it?Most investors would probably say yes. Those who don't mind pursuing returns despite potentially steeper declines and a higher expense ratio may want to take a look at Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X (SOXL).The high-octane ETF soared to a record Wednesday with an 8% pop, taking out a 167.60 buy point of a cup with handle along the way. It closed just out of buy range, but a minor decline could put it back into the zone. SOXL surged more than 50% from a September breakout to its Nov. 22 intraday high.The $721.7 million fund, which will turn eight in March, aims for 300% of the daily performance of the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index. It's a leveraged fund, which means it can use financial derivatives and debt to boost returns of the underlying index. According to Morningstar Direct, U.S. stocks made up nearly 55% of its portfolio, non-U.S. stocks 10%, and cash about 35% as of Dec. 31.Its biggest positions were Intel (INTC), Texas Instruments and Nvidia, at roughly 8% apiece. Qualcomm (QCOM) and Broadcom (AVGO) accounted for more than 7% each. Graphics chip designer and artificial intelligence player Nvidia surged 81% last year. Broadcom and Texas Instruments rose 45% and 43%, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: Are Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies real investments or a speculator's game? Individual investors should be extremely cautious about diving into this new area. Read this feature about Bitcoin risks and possible gains first.So far this year, Nvidia and Texas Instruments are outpacing the broader market with respective gains of 16% and 14% through Jan. 17. Texas Instruments' relative strength line is at a new high; Nvidia's is lagging a bit.SOXL has run up 27.7% this year, far ahead of the S&P 500's 3.8% return. Its average annual returns of 82.8% and 86% for the past three and five years, respectively, also lead the benchmark index's 13.6% and 16% gains for those periods. The ETF bears a 1.1% expense ratio.Wednesday's picks, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU), pulled back during that day's session. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) plunged as much as 18% but pared the loss to 6% by Wednesday's close. It finished below the 50-day moving average.RELATED:Apple Sits Out As Microsoft, IBM Boost Dow; Bitcoin Trims LossStocks Go Red As Apple, Microsoft Reverse; Bitcoin Sinks FurtherApple, Microsoft Fuel Dow To Record; Will Bitcoin Rebound Last?

101,NOV,"Wall Street is giving Qualcomm (QCOM) positive reviews for its business strategy as it defends itself from a hostile takeover attempt by fellow chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO).X Qualcomm received at least four price-target hikes and one stock rating upgrade after the company on Tuesday presented its plan for staying independent.Qualcomm shares slipped 0.3% to close at 68.02 on the stock market today. Earlier in the session, Qualcomm was up as much as 1% to 68.90. On Tuesday, Qualcomm jumped 4.4% to 68.25. It had been approaching a buy point of 69.38 in a 63-week cup-with-handle base.Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah upgraded Qualcomm stock to buy from neutral and raised his price target to 75 from 58.""Qualcomm leadership is very smart, but over the last several years, the San Diego-based management team at times has been unassertive and complacent,"" Shah said in a note to clients. ""Now with Broadcom's hostile takeover attempt analogous to a 'gun to the head,' we expect the company to more aggressively focus on driving shareholder value in order to remain a stand-alone franchise.""Potential drivers for the wireless-chip maker include closing its acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and settling its legal disputes with customer Apple (AAPL), Shah said.Qualcomm on Tuesday raised its profit outlook and said it might use funds to buy back stock if its $38 billion bid to acquire NXP fails.""With tax reform, we are well-positioned to complete a large stock buyback that will deliver essentially the same level of accretion to Qualcomm stockholders as if we had closed NXP,"" Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer George Davis said in a webcast, according to Reuters. ""Our preference is to close NXP, but not at all costs.""IBD'S TAKE: Qualcomm has an IBD Composite Rating of 54 out of a possible 99. For more analysis on Qualcomm, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Qualcomm forecast adjusted earnings per share of $6.75 to $7.50 in 2019 on revenue of $35 billion to $37 billion. Wall Street had been modeling for earnings of $3.79 on revenue of $23.59 billion. Qualcomm expects to achieve its new profit target through a $1 billion cost-reduction plan and by resolving current licensing disputes, including with Apple.""We are encouraged by the new $1 billion cost-reduction program,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley said in a report. ""We also believe Qualcomm's acquisition of NXP remains on track and will create a company with significant earnings power and cash flow, developing into a clear industry leader in the mobile, Internet of Things, and automotive semiconductor markets backed by the extremely strong combined intellectual-property portfolio of Qualcomm, NXP and Freescale (Motorola).""Walkley reiterated his buy rating on Qualcomm and raised his price target to 86 from 83.In addition to Nomura and Canaccord, Qualcomm received stock-price-target increases from Macquarie and Mizuho Securities.Qualcomm management repeated its assertion that Broadcom's offer substantially undervalues Qualcomm. On Nov. 6, Broadcom offered to buy Qualcomm in a cash-and-stock deal worth $130 billion, including $25 billion of net debt.Qualcomm on Tuesday urged its investors to reject Broadcom's takeover proposal, which is being put to a shareholder vote for Qualcomm's March 6 annual meeting.In a statement Tuesday, Broadcom criticized Qualcomm's go-it-alone plan as a ""transparent attempt to sell a quick fix"" to its shareholders.Meanwhile, Broadcom reportedly is facing an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission into whether it engaged in anti-competitive tactics in negotiations with customers, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.RELATED:Chip-Gear Stocks Rock On Upbeat ASML, Ichor Reports

102,NOV,"Are investors getting tired of milestones by now? X A day after the major indexes suffered their first distribution day of the year, stocks resumed their bullish stance that had pervaded the second half of 2016 and all of 2017. And this time, tech stocks refused to sit out. While the Dow Jones industrial average certainly…
"
103,NOV,"Major indexes continued to stage a healthy rebound, breakouts gained more steam, and a key Bitcoin-driven ETF showed more signs that a longer-term correction in the alternative digital currency may be in the works.X Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), which staged a tremendous price run of more than 1,500% in 2017, plunged as much as 18.3% intraday before shaving a majority of those losses.Yet shares in the Bitcoin-tracking exchange-traded note still dropped more than 7% to 1,607 and severely undercut the critical 50-day moving average for the first time since peaking at 3,522 in December. Bitcoin Investment had broken out on Nov. 22 from a large, deep cup with handle at 958.10 and gained more than 250% before topping. Concerns of South Korea mulling a move to ban cryptocurrency trading are apparently still weighing on traders.At 2:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite, the leading major index in 2017 with a 28.2% gain, rose nearly 1.1%, while the S&P 500 practically matched that advance. The Dow Jones industrial average spurted 1.1% higher, helped by gains of 1 point or more in at least 12 of the 30 components.Longtime Dow Jones industrial component IBM (IBM) staged a bullish gap up as shares rose more than 2% to 168.59 in volume running double its 50-day average. The stock has also risen past a 162.61 buy point in a first-stage saucer with handle.This base is part of a long bottoming base process. The buy zone goes up to 170.74.Optimism is rising among analysts that Big Blue will finally break its multiyear slump in revenues. Q4 profit, meanwhile, is expected to inch up 3% to $5.16 a share, which would be the biggest increase in four quarters.IBM drums up a terrible Composite Rating of 42 on a scale of 1 to 99 in IBD Stock Checkup, but low Composite and other scores are typical for companies that have been lagging for years but are aiming at a real turnaround. On the positive side, a B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating points to net buying among fund managers in IBM over the past 13 weeks.Buying only those stocks that show an Accumulation Rating of C+ or higher generally increases the odds of making money when buying a stock at the proper entry point.The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 25.1% in 2017.The Dow transports edged up 0.3%; the Russell 2000 was up almost 0.6%. Volume is running mildly lower on both exchanges following a distribution day, or session of unusually intense institutional selling, on both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.Top-ranking stocks as seen in IBD's key stockpicking screens mostly thrived, with several hailing from the semiconductor and related sectors. Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment ranks first among 197 industry groups tracked by IBD with a 3.5% lift. Homebuilding, computer networking, leisure products and oil drilling stocks also led the upside with gains of 2% each.Universal Display (OLED), No. 1 in the IBD 50, moved out of buy range as shares rolled nearly 3% higher to 204 in volume running more than 25% above normal levels.The expert in organic light emitting diodes for a range of electronic devices broke out past a 192.85 entry in a six-week cup without handle on Jan. 8 and has acted well since then. The 5% buy zone goes up to 202.49.Universal Display has sported four quarters in a row of excellent top and bottom-line growth. The Ewing, N.J., firm earned 28 cents a share in the third quarter vs. a 3-cent loss a year earlier. That followed EPS increases of 41%, 450% and 115%.No wonder, then, that Universal Display gets a top-notch 99 Earnings Per Share Rating from IBD, which means that the company's profit growth over the past three to five years and in recent quarters is superior to 99% of all companies in IBD's database.The Street expects earnings in Q4 to rise 53% to 84 cents a share on a 33% jump in revenue to $99.3 million. In Q1 of this year, Universal Display is seen growing earnings 41% to 31 cents a share and revenue up 20% to $66.9 million.Universal Display is ranked No. 1 in the IBD 50 and has a relatively small float of 41 million shares out of 47 million shares outstanding. A small float is bullish for growth stock investors, as it helps constrain supply of shares, one of tenets of IBD's CAN SLIM seven-point selection system for outstanding stocks. Plus, it takes fresh demand from only a few institutional investors, including hedge funds, pensions, banks and sovereign wealth funds, amid a limited supply of shares readily available for sale, to send a stock into breakout mode and into new highs.Universal Display is now a mid-cap stock with a value of $9.6 billion. Mutual funds and hedge funds owning shares in the stock have climbed from a combined 344 funds at the end of 2016 to 416 at the end of last year.Laser maker Coherent (COHR) (breakout at 320.83), scientific instruments maker IPG Photonics (IPGP) (cleared a cup at 248.33), semiconductor lithography systems expert ASML (ASML) (186.47 buy point in a solid flat base) have also broken out and shown positive action.Lam Research (LRCX), a huge winner since 2015, is building a base. Watch to see if shares can remain above the key 50-day moving average. If it does, it would boost the chances that the wafer cleaning and etching systems supplier can continue to flesh out the right side of a potential new base.Lam had cleared a 170.10 entry in a good flat base on Sept. 11 and rallied 29% before correcting in price. One of IBD's key sell rules is to take at least partial gains when a stock breaks out and advances at least 20% to 25% from the proper entry.Going back to Bitcoin Investment Trust, IBD noted in a prior Stock Market Today column how a definitive cross below the 10-day moving average offers a good exit point for short-term traders. Bitcoin Investment Trust violated its 10-day line on Dec. 20, just two days after it posted a closing peak of 3,463.Given the climax-run-style move that it made in mid-December, following strong gains earlier in the year, it's sensible to expect that it will take weeks, if not months, for the ETF to set up another proper buy point.Bitcoin, itself, took years to digest strong gains after it broke out in October 2013 and ran up from a breakout near 120 to a peak of 1,087 just two months later, an 800% gain in just two months. It took more than three years of basing before Bitcoin eclipsed that high.(Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary on breakouts, growth stocks, and other financial markets.)RELATED:How To Trade Stocks: Do You Know This Critical Chart-Reading Skill?How To Invest With Success: The Latest In Investor's CornerStocks Near A Buy ZoneWhen To Sell Stocks: What Does A Climax Run Look Like?How To Find Excellent Growth Stocks: Start With A Simple Routine

104,NOV,"Apple (AAPL) hit a record high Tuesday morning, looking at first glance like a market leader after reclaiming a buy point Friday. But Friday's move had some glaring weaknesses and by Tuesday's close Apple retreated to settle just under its entry area again.X Meanwhile, iPhone chipmakers such as Broadcom (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Qorvo (QRVO), which have been market laggards in the past several weeks, hit key resistance Tuesday. But Qualcomm (QCOM) made a big move.On Tuesday, Apple hit a record high of 179.39, but reversed with the market, closing down 0.5% to 176.19, back below the 176.34 flat-base buy point.Apple rose 1% to 177.09 on Friday, reclaiming the 173.64 entry. That wasn't an especially powerful price gain. Meanwhile, volume was 7% below normal. You want to see trading activity rise at least 40%-50% above average on breakouts and moves into buy zones.Apple's relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is well off recent highs. (The RS line is the blue line in the stock charts below.) Friday's 1% stock move, not much more than the S&P 500's 0.7% advance, did little to change that. You want to see a stock's RS line lead or confirm a breakout or move into a buy area.Apple's RS line hasn't made headway since early May. Even when Apple briefly broke out on Dec. 18, the stock's RS line was off its prior highs.Can Apple's move into buy zone work? If the market continues to power ahead, then there's a good chance that Apple's stock will continue to climb. It's also possible that Apple will begin to outperform the S&P 500 significantly again.Investors should try to focus on stocks that will deliver the strongest gains, while minimizing the risk of losses, especially big losses.Apple reports earnings on Feb. 1.Broadcom is currently in a flat base with a 285.78 buy point. Broadcom sank 0.4% to 263.25 after finding resistance at its 50-day moving average. The RS line has fallen to its lowest levels since early July or early May. That reflects a series of flat bases on top of or next to each other without making much headway.IBD'S TAKE: With the market now in a confirmed rally for 100 days, it can be hard to see who are the true leading stocks and which are in the middle of the pack. See why IBD's relative strength line is so important.Qualcomm is an interesting case for two reasons.First, the wireless chip giant is in a royalties battle with key customer Apple, as well as related legal and regulatory challenges and probes around the world. Those woes helped send the stock crashing from October 2016 to last September.Second, Broadcom is making a now-hostile bid for Qualcomm, so the latter's shares skyrocketed in November. Since peaking in late November, Qualcomm and Broadcom shares have  generally moved in a similar fashion. Then again, so has Skyworks Solutions.But Qualcomm separated from Broadcom on Tuesday, climbing 4.4% to 68.25 as it laid out its case for staying independent, offering bullish 2019 targets.Qualcomm is in a huge cup-with-handle base. If you prefer, you can view the handle as a flat base on its own. Either way, the buy point would be 69.38. Shares closed Friday at 65.38, finding support at its fast-rising 50-day line.Qualcomm's RS line has lagged badly since late Nov. 24, reflecting the stock's underperformance over that time. But the RS did get a nice bounce Tuesday with shares rising and the major averages retreating.Skyworks Solutions is in a consolidation essentially next to two prior patterns that had short-lived breakouts. Skyworks has a 117.75 buy point. Shares closed Friday at 101.21, continuing to trade below its 50-day and 200-day line. The 50-day line last week fell below the 200-day, negative technical action known as a bearish cross.Meanwhile, the RS line peaked in early June and is now just off its lowest levels in a year.Skyworks found resistance at its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, reversing lower to close off 1.3% at 99.86.Qorvo, like Skyworks, is in a consolidation next to a pair of bases with breakouts that soon failed. It's also below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The RS line is right around the lowest levels in a year after peaking last May.Qorvo is in a consolidation with an 81.30 buy point, but has a lot of work to do. Qorvo sank 2.45% to 69.30 on Tuesday, finding resistance at its 200-day line.Analog Devices (ADI) and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI), both seen as iPhone X plays, are both in shallow, short cup bases. The RS lines are lagging, though a powerful stock gain could lift these stocks' RS lines above at least a short-term high from their recent pseudo-handles (they are not proper handles). Keep in mind that the RS lines have basically been flat for a year. Integrated Device's earnings have been spotty.Analog Devices rose 1.2% to 93.10, closing in on a 94.09 entry. Integrated Devices fell 1.7%.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:These 4 Top Tech Stocks With Strong RS Lines Hit Buy PointsA Stock Rises Again After Its First Breakout Fails; Should You Buy Again?Facebook Tumbles Below Buy Point; Why Breakout Was Never 'Meaningful'When Will You Know The Top Stocks' Big Runs Are Over?

105,NOV,"What do you get when you bring together two professional poker players, a CNBC pundit and an ex-boxer who tried to turn a social gaming company into a cybersecurity company? The answer is Riot Blockchain (RIOT), which was one of the hottest stocks for a few months late last year.X While it isn't the only company to abruptly declare a crypto-strategy — Long Blockchain (LBCC) and Eastman Kodak (KODK) have made similar moves — Riot Blockchain stands out.Since its sudden pivot last October from biotech, it has become a poster child of investors' blind rush into blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, as well as the subsequent hangover when cold, hard daylight reveals what is actually going on — or not going on.For example, Riot Blockchain has scooped up some companies with little to no track record of actually doing anything. (One of those acquisitions is a company owned by a frequent guest on CNBC, which aired an investigation into Riot last week.) Riot also has lost two auditing firms in just one year, has failed to muster enough voting shareholders for an annual meeting, and is crisscrossed with investors, including relatives, who have worked on similar deals together in the past, raising questions about its governance.This pattern of behavior should give investors pause, said Marquette University accounting assistant professor Joseph Wall, who consults in areas including blockchain technologies and financial forensic investigation.""I'm not going to say this company in particular is doing anything illegal,"" he said. ""I just know that companies that have those patterns of behavior, each one of those patterns is not advantageous to small individual investors.""However, Riot Blockchain CEO John O'Rourke says the skeptics who are unconvinced about his firm's approach will lose out in the end.Speaking before publication of the CNBC report, which sank Riot's stock by 33% Friday, he added that ""our legacy shareholders"" are happy that the stock was trading at a multiple of what it was prior to the blockchain pivot.""Ultimately with what we have in place now we're well capitalized: we have over $40 million cash in the bank; our stake in Coinsquare is worth over $50 million,"" he told IBD. ""Those two things alone are tangible assets you can't question.""IBD'S TAKE: Bitcoin's meteoric rise has done more than make some daredevil investors rich overnight. It's also put blockchain — the software technology enabling Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies — on a trajectory of its own.But investors who pay attention to fundamentals and stock charts would recognize multiple red flags instantly about Riot Blockchain, even without knowing anything about the company's operations and leadership.The stock surged in October after the company changed its name from Bioptix and announced a new crypto focus, just as Bitcoin mania was beginning to spread far and wide. After a one-month pause, Riot embarked on a climax run, along with the rest of the Bitcoin investing world. That's when a stock suddenly skyrockets over several weeks in a frantic run-up after a strong prior gain — followed by a massive reversal.After a climax run, stocks, commodities and currencies usually lose well more than half their value quickly and make take months or years to recover, if ever.Here's how Riot's climax looked. It nearly tripled over the five sessions to Nov. 24 in huge volume. The stock paused for a couple of weeks, and then nearly doubled again. It had its largest point gain on Dec. 18, a day before its final intraday peak. From its Dec. 19 peak of 46.20 — when Riot Blockchain announced a $37 million private placement — the stock crashed 77.5%. Riot rallied back somewhat with Bitcoin over the next several sessions but crashed last Friday. Riot has continued to sell off this week, tumbling 13% to a three-month low.Loup Ventures managing partner Douglas Clinton, a former analyst for Piper Jaffray, has questioned whether Riot Blockchain has the necessary knowledge base in blockchain.""The CEO, from as far as I can tell, doesn't necessarily have a background in technology,"" he said. ""So obviously they see an opportunity, and we agree that blockchain is an opportunity, but we had a hard time understanding what their unique insight is and what they want to accomplish by investing in blockchain.""O'Rourke says he has been ""engrossed"" by blockchain technology since 2012. In 2013, he invested in three blockchain companies and has personally accumulated Bitcoin. Since then, he says he's done ""a tremendous amount of research,"" while speaking with thought leaders and attending conferences. He also pointed out that two ""key opinion leaders"" are on Riot's advisory board.He was referring to a pair of professional poker players: Jason Les, a cryptocurrency miner who describes himself as a ""student of Bitcoin,"" and Jason Mo, who is described by Riot as one of the most respected independent investors in the cryptocurrency space.Other notable pieces in Riot's team are ones that are no longer there. Riot Blockchain dismissed EisnerAmper as its certifying accountant last month, a year after the firm's previous auditor, GHP Horwath, resigned. MNP is the new auditor.""Having several auditors suggests you either have very bad abilities to pick an auditor (incompetence or unlucky), or are unable to find an auditor to fudge your numbers the way you want them fudged (unethical),"" said Pai-Ling Yin, a USC business professor and director of the school's Technology Commercialization Initiative.O'Rourke declined to comment.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersThen there's Barry Honig, a boxer turned activist investor who forced out the old management at Riot, paving the way for the pivot to blockchain. In his days as a stock broker, he was fined $25,000 and suspended for 10 days in 2000 by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for alleged stock manipulation. Honig has denied he is a stock manipulator.Prior to Riot, he and O'Rourke were investors in MGT Capital Investments, which they tried to turn into a cybersecurity company from a social gaming one. But Intel (INTC), which bought the McAfee cybersecurity company in 2010, blocked MGT from changing its name to John McAfee Global Technologies.Meanwhile, Honig successfully flipped mobile gaming firm Majesco to what is now PolarityTE (COOL), a biotech currently cited by Nasdaq for non-compliance on audit committee composition and board independence rules. And he has been accused of trying to illegally strip the pharmaceutical company BioZone away from its founder. That case was settled in 2016.Many of the people involved in those endeavors are also Riot Blockchain investors. For example, directors and investors in PolarityTE and MGT were early investors in Riot, while another is a fund controlled by Honig's brother. Other big early investors have ties to O'Rourke due to his role as a board member of MUNDOmedia, whose chief legal and corporate development officer is a Riot director.In fact, a review of SEC filings reveals that investors with connections to Honig and O'Rourke controlled a majority of Riot's 5.4 million outstanding shares before its blockchain pivot.Despite their past dealings, Honig insists he is a passive Riot investor and is letting O'Rourke call the shots. ""John happens to be a terrific, smart young man,"" he said. ""He's got a tremendous amount of integrity.""Marquette University's Wall, who runs his own securities investment firm, said the relationships among the people involved in Riot should be another red flag to investors, as the insiders could potentially have access to information on the company that a normal investor does not.One trade that has drawn particular attention is O'Rourke's sale of most of the Riot shares he held at the time on Dec. 29, just days before the company announced its third accountant in a year. He said it was for tax reasons.""In general when you combine a changing of auditors, insider selling, a lack of disclosure, postponing shareholder meetings, then you bring in a close network of people where you don't have arms-length transactions, that usually doesn't result in good things for a small investor in the long run,"" Wall said.Another Honig connection also pops up in Riot's most recent acquisition. On Feb. 7, Riot announced the buyout of Logical Brokerage, with a view to establishing a U.S. digital currency exchange.Logical President Mark Fisher and Honig serve on the board of the Florida Vipers basketball team, which is also an educational non-profit meant to help inner city youth. Honig told IBD that while he is an acquaintance with CNBC pundit Fisher, the two have ""never really spoken to each other"" about Riot.Logical's website states it is a ""futures introducing broker."" But its National Futures Association listing says it has no on-exchange futures or options customer accounts, is not soliciting customers, is not managing futures or options customer accounts, operates no commodity pools and is not engaged in retail off-exchange foreign currency futures or options.O'Rourke said he liked that Logical is a CFTC-licensed registrant and has the ""framework"" for dealing with regulators. But neither the CFTC nor the NFA regulate spot-market digital currency exchanges or activity.In November, Riot agreed to buy Nevada cryptocurrency mining company Kairos Global Technology, which at the time had been incorporated for just over two weeks.Riot in October acquired a majority stake in TessPay, which is developing a blockchain payments ecosystem for the telecom sector with hopes to launch in September or October. TessPay also plans to go public via a reverse-takeover agreement that will give it a majority of a subsidiary, created by Cresval Capital, to be called ""TessPay Inc."" Cresval is a company focused on mineral exploration.Riot Blockchain, in regulatory filings, said TessPay had net tangible assets of roughly $10,000 as of October. The company, which was founded in July and has around 15 employees, would not comment on whether that figure had changed or what those assets were.When asked how far the companies are from bringing products to market, O'Rourke said, ""They are actively in development. No timeline is in place publicly quite yet.""However, Riot Blockchain does have a crown jewel; its holding in Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Coinsquare. Riot invested $3 million into its parent GoNumerical last September, and claims the stake is now worth 15 times its original value. Riot recently announced it had invested another $2.5 million while exercising previously acquired warrants.This has been their most prudent move so far, according to USC's Yin.""In light of what I've said about Riot acquiring anything related to crypto, Coinsquare appears to raise the least red flags,"" she said. ""This is still a new frontier, a lot of exchanges will enter, but not all will survive, and it is hard to predict who will be left.""Bill Peters contributed to this article.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Before You Buy Bitcoin, Read ThisSEC Halts Trading In 3 Companies Over Crypto, Blockchain Claims The Coming Cryptocurrency Lobbying WarBitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And Trends

Roku's results will come after the closing bell.The company, whose devices compete against those from Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), has focused more on advertising and other services to grow. But Wall Street will likely be zeroed in on user growth, sales per viewer and the amount of time viewers spend using the devices.Shares rose 6.3% to 51.18 on Tuesday Tuesday. Roku reclaimed its 50-day moving average last week. The stock is working on a cup base with a 58.90 buy point.Roku, which came public at 14 in late September, released its first earnings report as a public company on Nov. 8. Shares surged 55% the next day and another 46% in the following two sessions as Roku blasted to a new high.

Rate hikes are one of the ways the Fed tries to keep the economy from overheating, as higher interest rates from the Fed filter through the rates on loans from banks.The 10-year Treasury yield has risen sharply in 2018 to four-year highs on global growth and inflation concerns. That's pushed up mortgage rates to their highest levels in four years. That could push some homebuyers on the sidelines or inspire them to lock in current rates before they move higher. Solid job growth, improving wage gains and more millennials having families could offset rising mortgage rates.January's existing-home sales data due Wednesday morning from the National Association of Realtors likely won't reflect the 2018 rise in mortgage rates. Existing-home sales data reflect actual closed sales, not contract signings. Investors will get a more timely indicator from weekly mortgage application data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, which will also be released on Wednesday. MBA reported a big drop in home loan demand in its latest report.Owens Corning, whose sales depend on people buying and renovating property, is expected to report fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.03, a 43% jump, on revenue of $1.518 billion, up 10%.

110,NOV,"Investors should be looking for leading stocks breaking out of bullish bases in volume, with their relative strength lines — which track stocks' performance vs. the S&P 500 index  — leading or confirming the breakout.Weibo (WB), Atlassian (TEAM), Match Group (MTCH) and Align Technology (ALGN) cleared buy points in proper bases Tuesday morning with RS lines that were already right at or close to at least short-term highs. But the stocks pulled back or turned negative with the broader market reversal. Only Weibo is in buy range now.X Take-Two Software Interactive (TTWO) also is near a buy point in a proper base with strong RS lines, though it also reversed lower.Weibo and Align Technology have best-possible 99 Composite Ratings, while Atlassian has a 98 Composite Rating. Match Group and Take-Two Interactive are at a solid 92.In recent weeks, many stocks have been hit buy points in lackluster volume with RS lines signaling the stock is just keeping pace with or falling behind the fast-rising S&P 500. Some of those breakouts have not fared well.Weibo, a top Chinese short-message social network, cleared a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 122.31. Shares rose 1.4% to 123.19 in heavy volume on the stock market today after spiking to 128.37 intraday.Closing near session lows is not great action, but that's better than the general market, which reversed from strong gains to close lower, near the day's worst levels.Weibo's RS line edged past a short-term peak around the handle and neared the old all-time high on the left side of the consolidation. (The RS line is the blue line in the stock charts below.)Keep in mind that Weibo broke out of a late-stage base, which are less likely to succeed or be big winners than a first- or second-stage pattern.Weibo parent Sina (SINA) has been flirting with a double-bottom base buy point of 113.05, briefly crossing that level Friday. Sina fell 0.9% to 111.97 after climbing to 116.11 intraday. Its RS line is lagging more than Weibo's. Sina's RS line was trading right at very short-term highs.Atlassian, a collaboration software maker, is in a cup base with a 53.55 buy point, shot up to 55.25 intraday but pulled back to close with a 0.5% gain at 52.82.The RS line has moved above the short-term high around a pseudo-handle, providing some confirmation of the stock price action. The RS line is still lagging its November highs.Atlassian reports earnings on Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: With the market now in a confirmed rally for 100 days, it can be hard to see who are the true leading stocks and which are in the middle of the pack. See why IBD's relative strength line is so important.Match Group, which operates Match.com, Tinder and other dating sites and apps, is in a consolidation with a 32.97 buy point. That's 10 cents off the old intraday high on Nov. 8 following earnings, but the stock closed well below that peak that day. So as Match Group has consolidated and moved toward its old highs, the RS line has actually moved into new-high ground, bullish and uncommon for base-building stocks in the current market uptrend.Match.com briefly topped the buy point on Jan. 3 but closed lower. Shares ended Friday at 32.64.Match Group rose to 33.08 intraday but reversed to fall 3.8% at 31.40.Take-Two Interactive Software fell 2.85% to 113.96 intraday Tuesday, finding some support just above its 50-day line. As a result of Tuesday's action, the video game stock now has a handle for its consolidation, slightly lowering the potential buy point to 120.28.Take Two's RS line took a hit with Tuesday's sell-off. However, if the stock can break out strongly, the RS line could retake its short-term high around the handle.Align Technology, which makes the Invisalign transparent braces, tumbled from late November to just before Christmas. Shares have rebounded since then, building the right side of a consolidation with a 266.51 entry. Align rose 2.1% to 263.88 after reaching 268 intraday, briefly clearing that entry point.Align's RS line is moving higher, though still off its late November peak. It has risen above a very-short-term high. It also helps that the RS line had such outperformance in 2017, as Align was one of the big stock winners of the year.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Apple's Move Into Buy Range Left Much To Be Desired — And Then There's ThisFacebook Tumbles Below Buy Point; Why Breakout Was Never 'Meaningful'When Will You Know The Top Stocks' Big Runs Are Over?

111,NOV,"Major stock indexes turned negative in late-afternoon trading Tuesday, not a surprise given the ebullient gains during the first two weeks of trading in 2018.X The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 both showed losses of around 0.4% to 0.5% after rising as much as 1% and 0.8%, respectively. The 500 breached 2800 for the first time. The Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.2% after rising as much as 1.1% in the early going.At one point, at least nine of the 30 components in the Dow industrials advanced 1 point or more, By around 3 p.m. ET, however, only three stocks in the Dow were up 1 point or more, and all three hailed from the health care arena: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK) and UnitedHealth (UNH).Merck gapped up nearly 6% to 62.07 in quadruple normal turnover on good news regarding a potential treatment involving Keytruda with two additional medicines for lung cancer. For now, Merck continues to be in base-building mode.Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was running sharply higher vs. the same time on Friday.Meanwhile, Bitcoin and other alternative digital currencies continued to cool off. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) gave back most of Friday's rebound, losing 10% to 1,763. However, the overall picture of the fast-rising exchange-traded note has not changed. It's been in a normal correction since peaking at 3,523 on Dec. 19, and Tuesday marks the start of a fifth week of digesting the superlative gains seen in the fourth quarter of last year.On Nov. 22, Bitcoin Investment Trust broke out of a very deep cup with handle at 985.10 and roared more than 257% higher in less than a month. On a daily chart, one can see that Bitcoin Investment is trying to halt its slide at the 50-day moving average.Crude oil prices and copper eased too, while gold prices rose on the back of a weaker U.S. dollar. The euro last week moved past $1.22 for the first time since December 2015. WTI near-term futures edged 0.7% lower to $63.88 a barrel.Market breadth turned negative in U.S. equities, with losing stocks outmatching winners by nearly 2-to-1 on both exchanges.A few leading stocks let their strong gains slip. Weibo (WB) moved past a 122.31 buy point in a seven-week cup with handle and rallied to as high as 128.37, up 4.9% past the proper entry. But the stock backtracked to cut its gain to roughly 1%.The decline within Weibo's cup base runs from 123 on the left-side peak to 97.49, a correction of 20.7%. That's within the normal parameters for this important chart pattern for investors on the hunt for strong breakouts. However, the most recent base is late stage, which increases the risk of failure.The Chinese social network broke out of a first-stage base at 19.20, also a cup with handle, during the week ended April 8, 2016.Weibo was initially featured in the IBD Stock Analysis column on March 24, 2016. It also became the 10th current stock on IBD Leaderboard on Tuesday, joining fellow Chinese ADRs Autohome (ATHM) and 58.com (WUBA).Weibo wasn't alone in terms of top-rated companies starting the MLK holiday-shortened trading week on a sour note.LGI Homes (LGIH) fell more than 8% to 69.53 and triggered one sell signal as volume jumped 125% above its 50-day average. The stock posted its biggest point drop since breaking out of a solid seven-week cup base at 50.05 on Oct. 2. Tuesday's drop was also the largest since the entry-level homebuilder cleared an earlier, deeper cup base at 40.57 in late June 2017.Shares in LGI are now testing institutional buying support at the critical 50-day moving average.Lithium metal supplier Sociedad Quimica (SQM), NetEase (NTES), New Oriental Education (EDU) and streaming video hardware play Roku (ROKU) also staged negative reversals in heavy or increasing volume. Such concerted selling hinted at some pronounced profit-taking among mutual funds, hedge funds, banks, insurers, large investment advisors and the like.Stay abreast of future potential changes in the overall market trend by reading The Big Picture column each day.Amid the broad market reversal, a few highly-rated names still acted well.Oneok (OKE) gained for a fourth day in a row, rising more than 1.3% to 59.45 in above-average turnover. The oil and gas transport play has cleared a 16-week cup pattern at 56.19 and is slightly outside the proper buy range. The 5% buy zone goes up to 59.00. Buying too far extended in price puts an investor in a vulnerable spot as a stock can quickly pull back and test the initial entry following a strong move up.Wall Street expects the Oklahome-based firm to stage a strong rebound in earnings in 2018, up 34% to $2.25 a share following a 1% climb in 2017. Fourth-quarter results are likely to be announced in late February.Oneok also sports a 5.1% annualized dividend yield.Abiomed (ABMD), the heart pump maker and one of 15 names in IBD Sector Leaders screen, rose more than 1.2% to 217.74 in slightly above-average turnover. The market leader is extended after surpassing a narrow flat base at 200.38 on Jan. 5.Abiomed scores a lofty 98 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup.Grubhub (GRUB), No. 23 in the IBD 50, is off around 0.7% yet remains above the key 50-day moving average following a two-day rebound on Thursday and Friday. Continued support at the 50-day line, or 10-week moving average on a weekly chart, would give investors a chance to add to a current position in the mobile and online food ordering service.Grubhub is up 21% since clearing a 57.71 buy point in a six-week flat base on Oct. 25 following robust third-quarter results (earnings up 22% to 28 cents a share, revenue up 32% to a record $163.1 million).

112,NOV,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose strongly Tuesday morning while Dow futures jumped about 240 points while Bitcoin and other digital currencies plunged on renewed talk from South Korea about banning trading.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings early Tuesday. Citigroup (C), , CSX Corp. (CSX), Comerica (CMA) and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) all report today.X Citigroup and Dow component UnitedHealth Group closed Friday near buy points, with caveats. CSX is the first rail operator to report this week, while Interactive Brokers precedes Charles Schwab (SCHW) on Wednesday. Citigroup and super-regional Comerica kick off a new wave of big bank earnings.S&P 500 futures were 0.5% above fair value. The dollar's recent weakness continued vs. major rivals, hitting a 2-year low vs. the Chinese yuan. Dow futures popped 1% vs. fair value and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.7% against fair value.Bitcoin fell 9% to $12,335.19, according to CoinDesk after falling as low as $11,182.71. South Korea's finance minister stressed that banning cryptocurrency trading is on the table. Ethereum lost 14% and Ripple 20% vs. 24 hours earlier, according to CoinMarketCap. That follows further signals from China to crack down on Bitcoin mining in that country.The No. 1 U.S. insurer reported before the opening bell Tuesday. UnitedHealth earnings rose 23% to $2.59 a share, beating views for $2.50, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue climbed 9.5% to $52.06 billion. UnitedHealth also raised its 2018 EPS forecast.UnitedHealth rose 2.7% to 234.78 before the opening bell on the stock market today. That suggests a move above a 231.87 buy point from a flat base.But the relative strength line, with tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging since the end of November, actually hitting a consolidation low on Thursday.Ideally, a stock's RS line (the blue line in the charts below) should lead or confirm a breakout.A strong breakout could push the RS line to at least a short-term high over its pseudo-handle.  Flat bases do not have handles, and this brief pause was not long enough to qualify as a handle in any other pattern, but it's still something for the RS line to try to top.UnitedHealth also is the first managed-care company to report for the latest quarter, with several in or near buy zones. Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI) moved into a buy zone Friday, joining Humana (HUM), though none of the breakouts came on impressive volume and their RS lines continue to lag. Aetna (AET) and WellCare Helath Plans (WCG) are near buy points but with lagging RS lines.Citigroup reports early Tuesday as well. EPS should edge up 4.4% to $1.19, with revenue edging up 0.5% to $17.09 billion.Citigroup has a flat base that's a half-step above a prior flat base, which was just above yet another flat base. The buy point is 78.02. Shares rose to 76.84 on Friday.But Citigroup, which outperformed the RS line from early June to early October and generally outperformed rival banks over that span, has had a declining RS line since then.Citigroup follows bank earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) on Friday. Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) report later this week.Comerica also reports Q4 earnings early Tuesday, with analysts forecasting a 31.5% EPS jump to $1.21 billion with revenue climbing 13% to $819 million.Comerica shares have risen 7.2% in January and are well extended from any buy point. The stock's RS line has been rising for the past four months.Rail giant CSX delivers Q4 results after Tuesday's close. Analysts expect a 14% advance to 56 cents even as revenue slides 5% to $2.88 billion. This is the first report after CSX named James Foote CEO in December following the death of veteran railroad exec Hunter Harrison.CSX's stock is modestly extended from a 55.09 buy point. Shares briefly tumbled on news that Harrison was taking a leave of absence followed quickly by his death, but shares didn't fall quite enough to invalidate the buy point. Also, shares found support at their 200-day line and never closed below their 50-day.CSX's RS line initially confirmed the Nov. 30 breakout. But the RS line hasn't made headway since then, and has generally been lagging for more than six months.Later this week, Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Kansas City Southern (KSU) will report quarterly results. Canadian Pacific is in a buy zone while Kansas City is near a flat base buy point, but both have lagging RS lines.Interactive Brokers reports will issue results late Tuesday. Revenue should more than double to $399 billion with earnings sprinting to 39 cents  a share vs. 7 cents a year ago.Shares cleared a short consolidation last week, hitting new all-time highs. The RS line is not quite at record levels, but rose sharply from the end of May through early December.Charles Schwab is expected to report earnings on Wednesday.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:These 5 Top Tech Stocks Are Near Buys With Strong RS LinesA Stock Rises Again After Its First Breakout Fails; Should You Buy Again?The RS Line Speaks Volumes About Apple And iPhone Chip StocksFacebook Tumbles Below Buy Point; Why Breakout Was Never 'Meaningful'These 24 Top Stocks Are Expected To Report 50%-Plus Earnings GrowthWhen Will You Know The Top Stocks' Big Runs Are Over?

113,NOV,"Snapchat is for teenagers, Facebook (FB) is for your mom and Twitter (TWTR) is for folks who like the din of a public square.X But email remains the dominant form of business communication, and recent IPO SendGrid (SEND) is riding a wave of Uber receipts, Yelp (YELP) notifications and eBay (EBAY) marketing emails to profitability.The cloud-based email-service provider, which sprouted in 2009 after participating in the TechStars accelerator program, mostly specializes in something known as email API. Its servers send over a billion emails a day on behalf of its 58,000 customers, a list that includes Uber, Yelp, eBay, Spotify, Airbnb and Glassdoor.After pricing at 16 a share, SendGrid jumped 16.5% to 18 in its Nov. 15 debut. The stock was up nearly 7% in early trades Monday, near 25.74.In this day and age, email seems like a straightforward form of messaging, but as it turns out, a lot of them disappear into the ether. The industry average for email deliverability is only 80%, wrote William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri in a recent report, meaning that one in five emails never makes it to its destination. You might not mind so much if an ad whizzes by you, but refreshing your inbox for the arrival of a much-needed password reset or shipment confirmation is another matter.By contrast, SendGrid's delivery rate is 94%, which Suri — who initiated coverage of the stock with an outperform rating – says is ""a result of its strong sender reputation and close relationships with inbox service providers — enabling the company to effectively navigate sophisticated email filters and avoid emails being sent to spam.""For SendGrid's customers, ""the delivery of their emails to the inbox is not a 'nice to have,' it's a business-critical communication from their company to the user,"" Chief Executive Sameer Dholakia told Investor's Business Daily. ""And the difference between it getting there nearly all the time and it only getting there most of the time is the difference between acceptable and unacceptable.""Transactional email API drives about 80% of SendGrid's revenue, with the rest stemming from email marketing campaigns and other services. While the company would not disclose its largest clients by revenue, Dholakia said that no single customer accounts for more than 2% of total revenue.""Our top 10 customers constituted 10% or less of our total revenue in any period, so it's a highly de-risked and un-concentrated customer base, which is terrific,"" he said. ""I know not all companies that look like us enjoy that, but thankfully for us, we're fairly broad-based.""The company earned an adjusted $576,000 in the first six months of 2017 vs. an adjusted loss of $2.365 million during the prior-year period. For the year, analysts expect SendGrid to report a profit of 3 cents a share, according to Zacks Investment Research. But Wall Street sees a 4-cent loss in 2018 before the company returns to the black with a 2-cent gain the following year. Revenue was expected to rise 25% to $100 million in 2017, swelling to $136 million in 2018 and $170 million in 2019.IBD'S TAKE: Since going public Nov. 15, Sendgrid shares have generally climbed from their IPO at 16. Shares settled Friday at 23.97, a record close and up 50% from its IPO. But Sendgrid is not the top-ranked stock in its group. That designation belongs to Autohome (ATHM).SendGrid is in ""heavy investment mode,"" according to Morgan Stanley. William Blair's Suri expects public-company costs and investment expenses to weigh on operating margins and profitability in the near term, but says SendGrid's self-service model means that it doesn't need a big salesforce, translating to lower sales and marketing expenses.""Over the longer term, we believe SendGrid should be able to exceed its operating margin target of 25% given the efficient dynamics of its business model, which include high SaaS gross margins and below-average sales-and-marketing expense,"" wrote Suri on Dec. 11.Analysts put SendGrid's share of the very fragmented email API market at 1%-2%, competing against the likes of SparkPost and Amazon's Simple Email Service (more on that later). On its smaller marketing campaign front, MailChimp, Constant Contact (owned by Endurance International (EIGI)), Oracle (ORCL) and Salesforce.com (CRM) are rivals.""We see a fragmented competitive landscape of private players, positioning SendGrid as the go-to platform, which should allow the company to sustain a 20%+ revenue (compound annual growth rate) over the next 15 years,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Stan Zlotsky. He initiated coverage with an equal weight rating and 23 price target, as he sees most of SendGrid's growth potential and margin expansion already priced in.Dholakia, who has been at the helm since 2014, sounds bullish about SendGrid's growth prospects and position in the industry.""There are many smaller competitors that compete with SendGrid that I think will find it increasingly difficult to compete with SendGrid, just given economies of scale,"" he said, indicating that management is keeping an eye open for possible acquisitions.The company has made two small buys so far, acquiring Message Bus' customer base in 2015 and bringing email marketing startup Bizzy into the fold earlier in 2017, the latter of which was ""a great technology and talent deal, more so than about revenue or business,"" said Dholakia. Bizzy should help beef up SendGrid's marketing campaign business.SendGrid also has a partner — and a rival — in Amazon (AMZN). The companies over the summer expanded their technology alliance, with SendGrid saying it is ""aggressively expanding (its) footprint with Amazon Web Services (AWS)."" But its offerings also compete with Amazon Simple Email Service (SES), which debuted in 2011 as a ""bare bones"" add-on to AWS, wrote Morgan Stanley's Zlotsky.Amazon's seemingly endless appetite can prompt nervousness, even in companies that don't compete directly with the e-commerce and cloud-computing behemoth. (After all, prior to its acquisition of Whole Foods Market, who would've thought Amazon was so interested in the grocery space?)But even though SendGrid's per-email prices are three to four times more expensive than Amazon SES, neither its chief executive nor analysts seem too concerned about the idea of Amazon unhinging its jaw and feasting on the email API sector.""We had a very candid conversation about the 'co-opetition' nature of that relationship,"" said Dholakia of the e-commerce titan, adding that Amazon is ""very used to having this conversation where they partner very closely with companies that they may compete with on any given service.""And Morgan Stanley's Zlotsky said talks with customers revealed that SendGrid's higher email deliverability, analytics and customer support took priority over pricing. He also pointed out in his recent report that SendGrid is listed as the ""premier AWS email service"" in the AWS Marketplace.""They've been great,"" said Dholakia of Amazon. ""We integrated very closely — so it's not one of these Barney relationships, where you put out a press release and that's about as deep as the relationship goes.""Among various analyst concerns: growing competition, the sustainability of its self-service model and the ease with which customers could switch to a rival email API product.There's also the fact that SendGrid's business depends entirely on email. (Young people, Zlotsky notes, aren't so hot on email.)Nevertheless, he sees SendGrid as the ""leading provider"" in a $9 billion-and-growing total addressable market (TAM), ""which should provide the company with a long runway of sustainable growth,"" he wrote.Echoing that sentiment, William Blair's Suri told IBD that the company is ""very attractively valued"" and led by a ""solid management team, solid execution guys.""SendGrid's growth, he said, is ""underestimated by the market.""YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:New Cloud-Based Issue To Turn Profitable This Year, Forms IPO BaseTop Data-Analytics IPO Pulls Back To Critical Support LevelCould These 10 Growth Stocks In The IBD 50 Have A Banner 2018?IPO LeadersStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

115,NOV,"Chip-equipment maker Entegris (ENTG) is poised to benefit from several initiatives in the New Year, including a push into China, Wall Street analysts say.Entegris shares rose 70% in 2017 and have been forming a flat base over the past eight weeks with a buy point of 33.15. Entegris fell 1.1% to 30.45 on the stock market today.The Billerica, Mass.-based company is a leader in specialty chemicals and advanced materials for the microelectronics industry. Entegris has three business segments: specialty chemicals and engineered materials, microcontamination control, and advanced material handling.Entegris should see solid growth in the fourth quarter and will be aided by new initiatives in 2018, Needham analyst Edwin Mok said in an Oct. 26 report.""With additional capacities coming on line and new growth initiatives (China, bulk chem, new materials and advanced filtration), we see this growth extending into the coming year,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Entegris has an IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of a best-possible 99 and ranks No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group. For more analysis on Entegris and its peers, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Entegris has been adding gas and graphite material capacity in its South Korea facility. Plus, it has two new partnerships in China, where it hopes to expand its presence.""We see these efforts driving incremental revenue in 2018, helping Entegris to continue to outperform the industry,"" Mok said. He rates Entegris stock as buy with a price target of 35.Stifel analyst Patrick Ho said Entegris is one of his ""most preferred names"" in the semiconductor capital equipment market. He rates Entegris as buy with a price target of 35.""The company's current business structure allows for multiple growth avenues over the next few years,"" Ho said in a Dec. 5 report. ""The company is particularly well positioned to benefit from innovations in materials engineering that drive both new materials utilization and increasing capital intensity for contamination control products.""Entegris views itself as a ""natural acquirer"" in an industry that needs consolidation, Loop Capital Markets analyst Chris Kapsch said in a Dec. 1 report. However, company management is ""extremely patient and disciplined on the M&A front,"" he said. Kapsch has a buy rating and price target of 40 on Entegris.Mergers and acquisitions are a top priority for Entegris, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari said in a Nov. 3 report.""While valuation discipline on the part of Entegris management and complacency on the part of potential sellers may hinder the pace of consolidation, in the long-run, we firmly believe that the semiconductor materials industry will continue to consolidate given its fragmented structure (particularly, in relation to semiconductor devices and semi cap equipment) and the increase in R&D requirements,"" Hari said.Higher research and development intensity will squeeze sub-scale suppliers out of the market, Hari said.RELATED:Chip-Gear Sales Forecast To Post Records This Year And NextWall Street Analysts Identify Top Chip Takeover Targets For 2018

116,NOV,"The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite erased much or all of their gains in mid-afternoon action, putting in doubt their five-day win streak. The Russell 2000 pared its advance.X The Dow was fractionally higher. Beaten-up General Electric (GE) was one of the Dow's top performers Friday on news that it will shed its overseas lighting business.The S&P 500 rose 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.1%. Alphabet (GOOGL), the second-largest stock in the composite, was trying to retake its 50-day line. It is not yet in a new buy area, as are some other major Nasdaq components.The Russell 2000 climbed 0.3% trying to close above its 50-day moving average. The Nasdaq, Dow and S&P 500 had already risen back above their 50-day lines. That's a good sign as the market tries to put its February correction in the rearview mirror.Indeed, gains were broad, with advancers over decliners by better than 13-to-6 on the NYSE and by nearly 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Even the battered utilities were taking part in Friday's advance. The Dow utilities average climbed 0.9%.Volume was tracking higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq compared with the same time Thursday.Steel stocks and some related industry groups topped the performance table on news that the U.S. Commerce Department recommended heavy tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

The Russell 2000 lagged with a 0.4% increase.Volume rose on the Nasdaq and fell on the NYSE compared with the same time Wednesday. Advancers led decliners by 12-to-7 on the NYSE and by 8-to-5 on the Nasdaq.The most important element of today's trading is the behavior of the main indexes at their 50-day moving averages. The S&P 500 and the Dow remain below their 50-day lines, and after a few days of sharp gains, the indexes seem due for a break.But the Nasdaq, which has outperformed the other two indexes, has already climbed above its own 50-day line with more energy. The Nasdaq chart is painting a more favorable outlook, at least for the short term. While the indexes are giving these mixed signals, keep in mind that the market has flashed a bottoming signal.Technology components helped the Dow advance, as Cisco Systems (CSCO) led with a 4% increase to the highest level since December 2000.

118,NOV,"Just a few years ago it seemed like Canada's farmers couldn't get peas into the ground fast enough, but they're now falling out of favor.Pea plantings will probably decline to a seven-year low this spring, while lentil acreage drops by 27%, according to the nation's agriculture ministry. Sowings will decline as farmers swap land for wheat and canola, the Canadian-made oilseed that's used in everything from salad dressing to french fries.It's a classic crop boom and bust. Since 2014, pea and lentil acres surged across the country amid rising demand for the vegetarian staples and as farmers enjoyed record prices for the legumes. But that swell of production quickly led to a global glut and sent prices tumbling. Now countries such as India, the world's biggest consumer, are imposing tariffs on imports to try to shore up markets for domestic suppliers. Regina, Saskatchewan-based AGT Food & Ingredients Inc., one of the top exporters of pulse crops, has slumped more than 40% in the past 12 months.""It is challenging to put pulses in knowing that returns are not going to be as profitable,"" said grower Morgan Nunweiler, who plans to slash his lentil acres in half and plant more wheat on his 3,000-acre farm near Rosetown, Saskatchewan. ""Looks like defaulting to cereals and canola is kind of what farmers in the area are doing.""Grower bids, a measure of cash prices, for some grades of large green lentils have tumbled 34% since November, and bids for red lentils were as low as 16.5 Canadian cents a pound in mid-February, according to data from Vancouver-based Stat Communications. By comparison, canola futures remained steady since Nov. 30, while benchmark wheat traded in Chicago climbed more than 8%.As supplies grew, prices were further hurt amid declining export prospects. In December, India imposed a 30% duty on chickpea and lentil imports. The chickpea tax was increased to 40% this month. The country had bumper harvests and is trying to unload its surplus inventory.""After India did what they did, it sort of shocks the market and shocks farmers a bit,"" said Corey Loessin, board chairman of the Saskatchewan Pulse Growers.Meanwhile, export demand for canola from countries such as China, Mexico and Japan remains strong, and additional oilseed acres will not result in a supply glut, according to Chuck Penner, the owner of LeftField Commodity Research in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Rising acres will send production of the oilseed to an all-time high, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada said in a Jan. 25 report.

120,NOV,"Election 2018: Two months ago, Democrats were giddily talking about an anti-Trump-fueled ""Blue Wave"" that would sweep them into power in the November mid-terms.  Now with less than nine months to go until election day, that wave may be petering out.X A ""wave election"" was easy to believe in December. Republicans had lost a series of special elections, saw more than 30 state legislative seats flip from red to blue (this week's loss in Florida made it 36) and lost five state-wide races, including governor races in Virginia and New Jersey. Republicans even lost a Senate seat in Alabama.At the same time, ""generic ballot"" poll results in December showed Democrats with a double-digit lead. Poll-watching site FiveThirtyEight noted that Republicans were ""in worse shape right now than any other majority party at this point in the midterm cycle since at least the 1938 election.""After the Alabama election, Former DNC head Tom Perez declared ""There is a blue wave sweeping the country. …Voters are rejecting Donald Trump and the Republican Party's radical agenda and electing Democrats up and down the ballot.""But in the weeks since, something has changed in the country — something the Trump-obsessed media are ignoring.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveFor one thing, the public's mood continues to improve. The closely-watched IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index hit 56.7 in February, the highest it's been in 13 years.Other signs of economic gains — continued job growth, wage gains, the stock market, which despite its recent turmoil is still way up from a year ago — have also became more obvious.In addition, the Republicans passed a massive tax reform, which has resulted in millions of workers getting unexpected bonuses and raises that their employers directly attributed to the corporate tax cuts. This month, millions more workers are seeing bigger paychecks, as their federal withhold rates go down.While Democrats continue to believe that attacking these tax cuts is a winning issue for them, the IBD/TIPP poll, along with others, shows that the public is seeing through their lies and distortions.Worse for Democrats, the public is starting to credit Trump for the good economic news.And that generic ballot? The Democrats' huge lead has collapsed. The IBD/TIPP poll had them up by just 5 points.  In December, by way of contrast, a CNN poll had Democrats up by 18 points.The Morning Consult poll released this week shows Republicans with a lead of one point on its generic ballot question.As for Trump, it's looking as though banking solely on Trump hatred to bring out the vote might not be such a good idea after all.Morning Consult finds Trump's approval rating hit 47% in February, which is where Rasmussen has him.  These polls, it's worth noting, were taken after Trump's widely praised State of the Union address.The Real Clear Politics average has Trump at 42%, which is up from 37% in mid-December. The highest Trump has ever been in the RCP average is 46%.(The IBD/TIPP poll still has Trump at a 35% approval, but the bulk of the poll was completed before Trump's speech, and those surveyed after were more positive about Trump than those polled before.)None of this is to say that Democrats won't gain seats in November. The party out of power usually does well in mid-term elections. Trump also remains an unpopular president, despite his recent gains. And mid-term elections depend heavily on which base is more energized, which also favors Democrats.But if current trends continue, all those counting on a tsunami-sized anti-Trump Blue Wave could very well be in for big disappointment on Nov. 6.You might also like….Economic Optimism Hits 13-Year HighTax-Cut Popularity Surges: IBD/TIPP PollHow to use IBD's technique to spot a major market bottom

121,NOV,"The major averages dusted off minor early losses and headed into the final hour of trading on Tuesday with modest gains.X The mild reversal from an opening decline is bullish for stock investors, but for now the current outlook, as noted in the Market Pulse in IBD's The Big Picture, remains at ""Market in correction.""At least seven members of the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1 point or more, hoisting the blue-chip index up nearly 0.4%. The Nasdaq composite is doing slightly better, rising more than 0.5% despite mixed action by the FAANG stocks.The S&P 500 rallied 0.4% to 2665, cutting its year-to-date loss to less than 0.4%. The large-cap benchmark rose 19.4% in 2017.Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), a closed-end fund that tracks the alternative digital currency, took a breather after rising five straight sessions, falling more than 4% to 14.23.While the fund showed nice support during last week's test of the 200-day moving average, it is still recovering after a climax run in December and a round-trip of all its gains following a Nov. 27 breakout past a 10.93 buy point in a very deep cup with handle.After that breakout, Bitcoin Investment Trust gained more than 254% to a peak of 38.75, ending that run with a near-vertical climb of 112% in just seven sessions. Stocks and funds that go into climax runs need a lot of time to digest those magnificent gains, form a new base, and set up a potential new breakout.So the right move right now for Bitcoin traders is to make no move and simply watch.IBD analyzes the market action by looking at the relative performance of 197 industry groups and subgroups. Today, at least 14 of these groups rallied 1.5% or more, sharply beating the major indexes. They include education and media software, solar power, department stores, trucking, cement, metal ores, computer networking gear, wood products and internet content.In the education and media software group, two thinly traded names stand out. Instructure (INST), which provides a cloud-based task management platform for schools and teachers, gapped up 14% to 42.60 in whale-like volume after briefly clearing a 36.70 buy point in a flat base last week. 2U (TWOU), a March 2014 IPO, gained more than 3% to 72.96 in light trading.2U has a sloppy earnings record, losing money in both Q2 and Q3 of 2017. But the provider of online learning software to universities is expected to post a 225% jump in fourth-quarter earnings to 13 cents a share. Revenue has grown 37%, 32%, 35% vs. year-ago levels in the past three quarters.Among large and megacap plays, Dow Jones industrial component Caterpillar (CAT) at one point gained nearly 3 points and got as high as 155.20 in below-average turnover. The construction and mining gear titan is close to a second attempt of climbing back above the key 50-day moving average. For now, the stock appears to be in the early stage of forming a new base.The stock has gained as much as 73% after a strong breakout past a 99.56 buy point out of a flat base on April 25.Cat, a wonderful turnaround story in 2017, has reeled off four quarters in a row of brisk growth (EPS up 100%, 37%, 129% and 160% vs. year-ago levels). The Street expects earnings to rise an additional 61% to $2.06 a share in the first quarter.On the downside, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) got hammered again, falling 5% to 324.70. It was the largest point loser on the Nasdaq. The former big market winner and expert in eye disease was featured in IBD's short-selling column, The Short Side, on Jan. 8.Regeneron triggered a follow-on short-sale entry point near 389. It  issued a topping signal on Aug. 1, when shares cut through the 50-day moving average in high volume, then failed to rebound sharply above the midterm support and resistance line.RELATED:Finding The Next Great IPO Stocks: Who Are The New Home Depot, EMC, Oracle, Google?Also In Stock Market Today: Time To Sell 3M Stock, Or Hold?Stocks Near A Buy ZoneWhich Way Is The Market Headed Now?

122,NOV,"Graphics-chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) rallied on Friday after delivering a beat-and-raise quarterly report late Thursday, while fellow chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) rejected a raised takeover bid by Broadcom (AVGO) as being still too low.Nvidia shares were up almost 6%, near 230.15, in morning trading on the stock market today.X Nvidia earned $1.78 a share, up 80% year over year, on sales of $2.91 billion, up 34%, in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Jan. 28. Analysts expected earnings of $1.16 a share on sales of $2.67 billion for the period, according to Zacks Investment Research. For the current quarter, Nvidia guided to earnings of $1.46 a share on sales of $2.9 billion, topping estimates for earnings of $1.14 a share on sales of $2.46 billion.Nvidia's fourth-quarter results were helped by strong sales of processors for data centers, gaming PCs and consoles and cryptocurrency mining.Nvidia's results were ""an intoxicating combination of faster, more profitable growth,"" Loup Ventures Managing Partner Gene Munster said in a note to clients. They provide ""further evidence of the magnitude of the opportunity ahead of Nvidia. Its products are a foundational part of the future of technology, based on their use in data centers, autonomous vehicles, virtual and augmented reality platforms, cryptocurrency mining, and esports.""IBD'S TAKE: The stock market is now in a correction. Read our cover story on why stocks sold off and what you should do now.Nvidia stock received at least 10 price target hikes following the earnings report.

123,NOV,"Electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA) is set to report fourth-quarter results after the market close Wednesday, and investors will be watching for progress on the company's critical Model 3 vehicle.X Tesla has had a hard time getting the premium sedan off the factory floor. One month ago Tesla announced fourth-quarter delivery estimates that show it continues to struggle with Model 3 production, while the Model S and Model X were in line with expectations.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson in a research note Wednesday said his channel checks indicate Model 3 deliveries are still ramping very slowly.""We spoke to 16 sales centers in the U.S. and found few signs of progress vs. the implied delivery run rates at the end of the quarter,"" Erickson wrote. ""Half of the sales centers we spoke with have only seen a few deliveries cumulatively, and the majority commented that employee cars continue to make up most of them.""Tesla said it manufactured a total of 2,425 Model 3 sedans in the fourth quarter, which is well short of where it had intended to be at that time. It expects to produce 2,500 Model 3 sedans per week by the end of the first quarter and 5,000 per week in the second quarter. Analysts will be looking for any manufacturing bottlenecks.The consensus is for Tesla to report revenue of $3.28 billion, up 45% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus on adjusted earnings is for a loss of $3.12 per share, compared with a 69-cent loss in the year-ago period.Erickson said numerous responses throughout the channel checks suggested Model 3 cars are being delivered to sales centers with slight blemishes of fit and finish.

He remained sector weight on Tesla.UBS analyst Colin Langan last week reiterated a sell rating on Tesla, largely driven by the Model 3 shortfall. Langan has a price target of 195 on Tesla stock. Tesla shares were up 3%, near 343.50, during afternoon trading on the stock market today.Tesla acknowledged production woes with its Model 3 when it reported third-quarter results on Nov. 1 that missed earnings expectations by a wide margin.""While we continue to make significant progress each week in fixing Model 3 bottlenecks, the nature of manufacturing challenges during a ramp such as this makes it difficult to predict exactly how long it will take for all bottlenecks to be cleared or when new ones will appear,"" Tesla said at the time.Last month, Tesla announced a new 10-year compensation package that includes incentives for the company's chief executive, Elon Musk, to grow the electric-car company's market cap more than 10-fold, to a staggering $650 billion, compared with about $57 billion today.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:SpaceX's Falcon Heavy Successfully Lifts Off; Musk's Roadster In OrbitStocks Up; Will Tesla Someday Hit 4,000?Tesla's Reported Lithium Move Could Ease Key Model 3 Production BottleneckSelf-Driving Cars: Why 2018 Will Be The Year The Rubber Hits The Road
"
125,NOV,"Tesla (TSLA) reported fourth-quarter earnings after the market close Wednesday that beat revenue and earnings estimates as it maintained production targets of its Model 3 sedan.X Tesla said revenue was $3.29 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $3.28 billion. It reported a loss of $3.04 a share on an adjusted basis, beating the consensus estimate of a loss of $3.12 per share.The electric car-maker's shares were unchanged at 345, during recent after-market trades on the stock market today. Shares closed the regular session Wednesday up 3.3%.Tesla said it continues to target weekly Model 3 production rates of 2,500 by the end of the first quarter and 5,000 by the end of the second quarter. But, as it did in the previous quarter, Tesla said that while it expects to hit these production targets, ""our prior experience on the Model 3 ramp has demonstrated the difficulty of accurately forecasting specific production rates at specific points in time.""It intends to start adding enough capacity to get to a 10,000-unit weekly rate for Model 3 once it hits the 5,000 per week milestone.""2018 will be a transformative year for Tesla, with a high level of operational scaling,"" Chief Executive Elon Musk said in prepared remarks with the quarterly results. ""As we ramp production of both Model 3 and our energy products while keeping tight control of operating expenses, our quarterly operating income should turn sustainably positive at some point in 2018.""Despite delays in production, Model 3 net reservations remained stable in the fourth quarter, the company said. In recent weeks, Tesla reservations have grown as the Model 3 has arrived in select Tesla stores and received numerous positive reviews, it said.In the fourth quarter, Tesla delivered 28,425 Model S and Model X vehicles and 1,542 Model 3 vehicles, totaling 29,967 deliveries. It added 12 new store and service locations resulting in 330 total locations worldwide at the end of the year.IBD'S TAKE: Tesla shares have been consolidating since the stock hit an all-time high of 389.61 on Sept. 18.

Check out IBD's Tech Leaders feature to get a broader idea on top tech stocks.Tesla said this year it expects ""major growth in Tesla energy storage deployments, as the production ramp of our storage products is just as steep as with Model 3.""Capital expenditures reached $787 million in the fourth quarter, mostly attributable to Model 3 and Gigafactory 1 (battery) production capacity increases. It ended the fourth quarter with $3.37 billion in cash, compared with $3.5 billion in the previous quarter. Earlier this month Tesla raised $546 million in securitized notes.Last month, Tesla announced a new 10-year compensation package that includes incentives for the company's chief executive, Elon Musk, to grow the electric-car company's market cap more than 10-fold, to a staggering $650 billion, compared with about $57 billion today.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:SpaceX's Falcon Heavy Successfully Lifts Off; Musk's Roadster In OrbitFutures Point To More Losses; These 3 Top Techs Fall LateStocks Up; Will Tesla Someday Hit 4,000?Tesla's Reported Lithium Move Could Ease Key Model 3 Production BottleneckSelf-Driving Cars: Why 2018 Will Be The Year The Rubber Hits The Road

126,NOV,"From high-efficiency AA batteries to the powerplants of electric cars, lithium has emerged as a critical mineral and source of energy — a trend that has given Global X Lithium & Battery Tech (LIT) big gains in 2017.X The exchange traded fund does not track the price of lithium, but rather the main players in the industry, from producers of the mineral to large users such as electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA) and No. 1 smartphone maker Samsung.In a portfolio of 35 companies, the largest holdings are Albemarle (ALB) and FMC Corp. (FMC), two U.S.-based lithium producers. Albemarle accounts for 18% of the portfolio and FMC 17%. Both stocks have performed well, rising sharply from buy areas in February and March.Other holdings account for much smaller portions of the fund, including a 7% stake in Chile-based Sociedad Quimica y Minera (SQM), the world's biggest producer of lithium. Chile holds more than half of the world's known reserves of lithium, according to Bloomberg, and Albemarle has operations in that country too.The ETF — up more than 60% this year — is forming a chart pattern that could result in further gains. It is forming a flat base with a potential buy point at 40.89.The fund's success may explain why investor interest has risen in 2017: Average daily volume is about 665,000 shares, up from about 46,000 at the beginning 2017. Assets have increased to more than $1 billion, a respectable sum for a specialty ETF.Emerging technologies can make for volatile investments, and Tesla's up-and-down 2017 illustrates that. Overall, analysts expect continued expansion for lithium power. Demand for lithium started rising with the growth of portable electronics. That part of the market is expected to level off. But as a report from Global X notes, ""the new x-factor for lithium demand growth is electric vehicles, and to a lesser extent, utility scale energy storage for renewables like wind and solar.""In China, battery electric vehicle sales soared 96% in October from the year-ago period, and for the first 10 months of the year Chinese electric vehicle sales were tracking 45% ahead of the year-ago period, according to a research note from Nomura Instinet on Nov. 21.

127,NOV,"Since the day Donald Trump was elected president in November of 2016 the Dow Jones industrial average has risen by some 35%, making the last 14 months one of the greatest bull-market runs in history.Some $6 trillion of wealth has been created for Americans — which is very good news for the 55 million Americans with 401k plans, the 25 million or so who have IRAs, and another 20 million with company pension plans and employee stock ownership plans.X The left was certain that exactly the opposite would happen with a Trump presidency.  To borrow a recent phrase from House minority leader Nancy Pelosi, Trump's policies would cause ""Armageddon"" for family finances, the American economy, and the stock market.Keep all this talk of economic meltdowns and financial market doomsday in mind the next time you hear a news commentator say that ""most economists"" believe that Trump's policies won't work, or ""mainstream economists"" believe Trump doesn't know what he is doing.  When it comes to Trump, his critics so far have almost all been not just wrong, but dead wrong.Here are some of the greatest hits, gleefully compiled from the media over the past 18  months or so.""Donald Trump's first gift to the world will be another financial crisis."" Headline in the U.K. Independent. ""(He) gives every impression that he will soon be hustling America — and possibly the entire world — in the direction of another catastrophic financial crisis."" Same article.""I have no stocks. I advise people not to invest in the stock market, not now. Way too dangerous."" Film maker Michael Moore, August, 2017.""It really does now look like President Donald J. Trump, and markets are plunging. When might we expect them to recover?  A first-pass answer is never… So we are very probably looking at a global recession, with no end in sight."" Paul Krugman of the New York Times the day after the election.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth Perspective""Trump's domestic policies would lead to recession."" Former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, March 2016.""If Trump wins we should expect a big markdown in expected future earnings for a wide range of stocks — and a likely crash in the broader market (if Trump becomes president)."" Eric Zitzewitz, former chief economist at the IMF, November 2016.""Under Trump, I would expect a protracted recession to begin within 18 months. The damage would be felt far beyond the United States.""  Former Clinton and Obama chief economist Larry Summers, June 2016.""Trump would likely cause the stock market to crash and plunge the world into recession."" Simon Johnson, MIT economics professor, in The New York Times, November 2016.""Citigroup: A Trump Victory in November Could Cause a Global Recession"",  Bloomberg Financial News headline, August 2016.""I have never seen an election in which the markets have so strong of a view as to what was good and bad about the outcome.

Now the left has to engage in logical contortions to explain how the red hot American economy is really a result of Obama policies — every which one Trump has systematically been at work dismantling.As I've acknowledged many times, the roaring stock market and the surging rate of growth of the economy (which is now estimated at 3.5%, up from 1.6% in Obama's last year in office), could turn against Trump in the months and years to come.It's quite possible that the market exuberance over Trump's deregulation and tax cut policies have run too far ahead, though I'm predicting 3% to 4% growth for 2018 with the Trump tax cut kicking in.But what is certain at this point so far in Trump's presidency is that anyone who sold stock on the basis of predictions by liberal ""experts"" like Larry Summers or Paul Krugman or Steve Rattner missed out on a 30%-plus surge in their financial wealth. At some point the market will take a tumble and these discredited gurus will shout ""see.""We would have so much more respect for these pundits if they would just do a mea culpa and admit that they were wrong about Trump and his policies.

128,NOV,"The year ahead for Apple (AAPL) could bring a lineup of jumbo-sized iPhones and an internet television service, Wall Street and technology analysts speculate.Apple kicked off what many expect to be a major iPhone upgrade cycle with the Nov. 3 release of the iPhone X. The new flagship smartphone is Apple's biggest iPhone redesign in three years. The device features a 5.8-inch OLED display, a facial recognition security feature, wireless charging, augmented reality capabilities and other enhancements.Apple hopes to keep the momentum going with its 12th-generation smartphones, scheduled for release in fall 2018.Respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities thinks the 2018 iPhone lineup will include three handsets with screen sizes as big as or bigger than the iPhone X, which has the largest iPhone display to date.Kuo believes Apple will come out with a refreshed 5.8-inch OLED model and a premium 6.5-inch OLED iPhone, plus a 6.1-inch LCD handset. Analysts with investment bank Nomura are predicting the same lineup.The new OLED iPhones will be pitched to high-end smartphone customers, while the new LCD iPhone will be positioned as a mid-range device, Kuo said. Apple also plans to refresh its entry-level iPhone SE early in 2018, he said.What the new iPhones will be called is the subject of much debate. Apple complicated its naming scheme with the fall 2017 release of the iPhone 8 series and the 10th-anniversary iPhone X, pronounced ""ten"" as in the Roman numeral. It skipped the number nine in its naming system.The new iPhones likely will include high-speed antenna modules for gigabit LTE connectivity, Kuo said. That's an area where Apple has lagged rivals in adoption of the latest standards. Kuo predicts that 70% to 80% of the new baseband processors will come from Intel (INTC) because Apple is embroiled in a legal fight with wireless-chip leader Qualcomm (QCOM) over patent royalty rates and terms.IBD'S TAKE: For a roundup of 2018 predictions for the stock market, visit the IBD page ""2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New Year.""The iPhone business is vitally important to Apple. Sales of iPhone handsets alone accounted for 62% of Apple's revenue in its fiscal year ended Sept. 30. Plus, some of Apple's accessories and services businesses are directly tied to the iPhone.The big question Apple must answer in the New Year is whether the iPhone X and iPhone 8 series phones have sparked a ""supercycle"" of upgrades or not, GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives told Investor's Business Daily.Apple will have to outsell the 231 million units the iPhone 6 series sold to be considered a success, he said.""If it's anything north of 240 million, I would characterize it as a supercycle,"" he said. ""The next few quarters are huge 'prove me' quarters for Apple to show that there's still mojo on the smartphone side.""Apple's competitors in the smartphone business aren't about to roll over. Samsung is expected to release its Galaxy S9 smartphones in March. And Chinese handset makers are giving Apple headaches in China, the world's largest mobile phone market. Plus, Chinese smartphone makers Huawei and Xiaomi are reportedly in talks with U.S. wireless operators, including AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ), about selling their smartphones to American consumers as soon as 2018.In early 2018, Apple is expected to release its premium voice-activated wireless music speaker HomePod. The $349 device was supposed to be out in the holiday shopping season, but Apple delayed the launch in November to fine-tune the product.It will compete with wireless speakers with voice-response technology such as the Amazon (AMZN) Echo speakers and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Home.Smart speakers are seen as a foot in the door to sell consumers more smart home technologies, such as connected thermostats and lighting, which people can control with voice commands.Meanwhile, Apple's next-generation Apple Watch could include an advanced heart-monitoring feature, making the wearable a serious medical device. Apple wants to add an electrocardiogram sensor to the smartwatch to spot cardiac problems, Bloomberg reported.Apple's fastest growing business is its services division, which includes such things as Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Pay and the App Store.Some research firms such as CCS Insight think Apple will launch a subscription video-on-demand service next year to take on Netflix (NFLX), Amazon and others in the fast-growing sector.Apple has hired some major Hollywood executives to buy original television series for the new service.Among the shows it has reportedly secured are a reboot of the 1980s anthology series ""Amazing Stories"" from producer Steven Spielberg; a drama about a TV morning news show starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon; and a new space-themed drama series from Ronald Moore, a writer and show runner known for his work on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation,"" as well his mid-2000s revival of the ""Battlestar Galactica"" series.Apple management has revealed little about its video efforts, other than to say the company is exploring the market and seeing where it leads.RELATED:Apple To Launch Netflix Rival In 2018, Research Firm PredictsApple HomePod Speaker Delayed, Will Miss Holiday Shopping SeasonApple Could Reach $1 Trillion Market Cap In 2018, Analyst Says

129,NOV,"Trump's Crash?: The media have used the stock market plunge not as an opportunity to enlighten readers how our markets work, but as yet another occasion to bash Trump. Don't they ever get tired of it?XGiven Trump's brash, take-no-prisoners nature when it comes to the media, it's probably not surprising they might want some payback. But they do their readers no favor by politicizing yet another essential part of American life — the stock market.After three days in which the bellwether Nasdaq stock index fell 6.7%, anti-Trump schadenfreude was pervasive on the web and in the media.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveWe ran a quick Google screen of ""trump stock market crash"" and in less than a second got 1.62 million hits.CNN's headline was typical: ""A stock market lesson for Trump — the hard way.""USA Today's headline  on a piece by William Cummings asked: ""Trump Has Often Taken Credit For The Stock Market's Climb. Will He Own The Drops Too?""Another USA Today column by Herb Jackson featured an almost identical theme:  ""Politicians Who Crow About Stock Market Gains Face Hazard When Market Drops.""Meanwhile, in The New York Times, Nobel-winning Trump-basher Paul Krugman wrote under this headline: ""Has Trumphoria Finally Hit A Wall?""Krugman doesn't exactly blame Trump for the market drop, but suggests gullible market investors are guilty of falling for Trump's childish idea that the economy can grow 3% a year, not the 1.5% pace that Krugman believes is the speed limit.When the January jobs report came in last Friday showing a strong jobs gain and a sharp 2.9% annual rise in hourly wages, the largest in years, and then was followed by a steep three-day stock market decline, it suggested to Krugman that Trump's 3% growth target is a fantasy, nothing more.""So are we heading for trouble? Too soon to tell,"" he wrote. ""But if we are, rest assured that we'll have the worst possible people on the case.""There are other examples from the media, to be sure. And some, even economists, dragged out the old ""overheating"" metaphor, as if the economy were a Model-T Ford always on the verge of steaming over. But in economics, there is no such thing as ""overheating.""And for the record, if you'd like to go back and look, the data are clear: Higher wages do not cause inflation, which is the fear du jour that the media are selling and that the Fed will possibly respond to by jacking up interest rates.Don't readers deserve to hear a little more about how the stock market really works than just anti-Trump snark?It's true that Trump has often played up Wall Street's gains. Last week's State of the Union Address was a great example.""The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value,"" the president said. ""That is great news for Americans' 401(k), retirement, pension, and college savings accounts.""But what Trump said is absolutely true. And people forget that not only were prognosticators predicting that the stock market would plunge if Trump were elected president, but they seemed at times to actually be hoping for it to happen.Again, Krugman's famous comment, published the day after Trump's election, is instructive: ""It really does now look like President Donald J. Trump, and markets are plunging. When might we expect them to recover? ... If the question is when markets will recover, a first-pass answer is never.""Got that? Never. For the record, since those words were published, the S&P 500 Index has risen 26%. And that's after the recent big market drop.Again, it's unfair to single out Krugman, though he's a tempting target. In the lead-up to the presidential election, many others in the media warned of a market crash to come if Donald Trump were to win.So what happened? On election night,  Nov. 8, 2016, as IBD wrote a week and a half later,  ""fear consumed traders. At one point futures on the Dow Jones industrials index plunged 800 points."" Democrats were everywhere in the media, gloating.Oops.  ""By Friday, the index finished the week up 959 points, more than 5%,"" IBD wrote back then, making the case for a Trump bull market that later became reality.Yes, Trump can claim credit for the stock market's general turnaround. But is every blip upward in the major stock indexes due to him? Is every slip down in share prices his fault too?No. That's absurd. Just as with any president, Trump sets the broader policies and hopes that they boost the economy, which underperformed during the Obama years. That's exactly what has happened.Trump set in motion economic policies premised on deregulation, low taxes and the rule of law. These three things alone have convinced corporations, small businesses and entrepreneurs that it's a good time to be investing and building things in America.In short, the stock market's rise has been driven by the anticipation of higher productivity and greater profits to come for America's makers and those who invest in them.So why did markets tumble in recent days? The jobs data showed a surprisingly solid 200,000 gain in jobs and the best wage gains in years. This terrifies the inflation-averse bond market.Inevitably, the bond vigilantes will pressure the Fed to raise interest rates more than the three to four times expected this year, to ""cut-off"" future inflation. That's why the market panicked — not because Trumponomics is a fraud.The point is, markets respond to existing conditions. Not to wishes or hope or change.But they also anticipate trends in the near future. Given the market's gains of the last 12 months and economic changes in the works, that future is much brighter than the media are telling you.RELATED:To learn more about the markets and investing, follow the links below:How To Invest IBD's Market Trends The Case For A Bull Market (2016)Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

Its original offer on Nov. 6 was worth $70 a share, with $60 a share in cash and the rest in Broadcom stock. The deal has a total value of over $121 billion and would be the largest-ever technology deal.""Our proposal includes substantially more Broadcom stock, which will allow Qualcomm stockholders a greater opportunity to participate in the upside created by the combined company's strategic and operational advantages,"" Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan said in a letter to Qualcomm's board of directors. ""Broadcom's track record demonstrates our ability to consistently accelerate share price appreciation following acquisitions and indicates a substantial likelihood that we will exceed our synergies expectations.""Broadcom also said it is prepared to pay a significant termination fee if the deal cannot obtain the required government regulatory approvals.One condition of the deal is that Qualcomm can't delay its annual shareholders meeting past March 6.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom has an IBD Composite Rating of 76 out of a best-possible 99. It ranks No. 12 on IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group.

""We suspect the price is still below what Qualcomm is looking for.""Raymond James analyst Chris Caso said Broadcom has other options for mergers and acquisitions if the deal doesn't happen, ""though none would be as significant as the Qualcomm deal.""Cowen analyst Karl Ackerman said Broadcom's latest maneuver makes it ""abundantly clear"" that it doesn't want to own NXP.""What we think should not be overlooked is the notion that an acquisition of NXP by Qualcomm is a form of 'poison pill' to thwart a possible takeover by Broadcom,"" Ackerman said in a report Monday.Broadcom stock fell 3.1% to 228.10 on the stock market today, amid a broad market sell-off.

132,NOV,"Apple (AAPL) fought to hold above its 200-day moving average, but by the close had retreated below the key level as the major averages crashed on the stock market today. The 200-day line is a last-ditch support area for growth stocks. Quickly regaining that level would be good news for long-term investors in the iPhone maker.X Apple already plunged more than 6% last week, capped by Friday's 4.3% tumble after the tech titan reported weaker-than-expected iPhone shipments and guided low on current-quarter revenue. Apple, a member of the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average. That stock has triggered four sell signals in the past two weeks, at least for recent Apple investors.These sell signals were all the more glaring because Apple gave such weak buy signals. The stock cleared a 176.34 buy point in three different periods. The moves were generally modest with unimpressive volume. Also, the relative strength line, which tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, continued to trend lower.Meanwhile, iPhone-related stocks, including Broadcom (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Universal Display (OLED) and Applied Materials (AMAT) have shown weak chart action as well. More on those later.Here are the four sell signals for Apple.Apple fell below its 176.34 entry on Jan. 24, sinking 1.6% to 174.22 in its heaviest volume since Nov. 3. The RS line, the blue line in the chart below, fell to the lowest levels of the consolidation. But the stock did find support at its 50-day moving average.The next day, Jan. 25, Apple retreated below its 50-day moving average, again in above-average trade. The 50-day line is the red line in the chart below. That capped a 3.9% weekly decline as the RS line fell to its worst levels since July. Apple shares kept falling for the next few sessions, pushing the RS line to mid-June lows.Just ahead of Apple's Thursday night earnings report, Apple bulls could still talk themselves into believing that expectations of lowered guidance were already priced in. And in after-hours trading Thursday, Apple shares did rally, even hinting at a move back to the 50-day moving average.But on Friday Apple fell 4.3% to 160.50 — 9% below the 176.34 entry. When a stock falls 7%-8% below a buy point, it's an automatic sell for recent investors.Friday's move triggered yet another sell signal, this one for the Oct. 27 breakout from a cup-with-handle base. The stock ran up nearly 12% from that 160.97 buy point and then round-tripped. You never want to see a 10% gain go to zero.So if you bought Apple from the October or January breakouts, there were definite reasons to sell.While not sell signals for Apple, the action of many iPhone-related stocks gave wavering Apple investors additional reasons to take profits or cut losses.Chipmakers with heavy Apple exposure fared even worse than their big customer, falling with other semiconductors in December and continuing to slump in January. Broadcom, Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo (QRVO) hit multi-month lows while their RS lines hit 52-week lows. Broadcom gave bullish preliminary revenue and guidance last week, but the share gains were muted. Qorvo did roar back last week, despite slashing guidance late Wednesday, providing some hope that the bad news was priced in for the Apple ecosystem. But much of Qorvo's gain stemmed from a big new iPhone contract win.Qorvo lost 6.4% on Monday.Applied Materials is a chip-gear giant that also makes equipment for producing OLED screens. OLED screens are used on the iPhone X and other high-end smartphones and displays. Applied Materials came pennies from a cup-with-handle buy point on Jan. 25, but reversed lower. Last Tuesday, shares fell below their 50-day moving average. On Friday, shares slid 4.9%.On Monday, shares sank 4.7%, undercutting their 200-day line.Universal Display, which makes technology for OLED displays, broke out on Jan. 8, though the RS line was lagging somewhat. Shares rose solidly over the next two weeks, but reversed sharply lower after a Jan. 19 peak. On Jan. 23, Universal Display fell below its buy point. On Jan. 24, the day Apple undercut its buy point for the last time, Universal Display tumbled through its 50-day line, dropping as much as 10% below the entry point, making it invalid.Shares have continued to slide, falling 5.9% on Monday. They've erased most of the gains from a short base-on-base buy point initially cleared on Oct. 31.If you bought Apple at the January 2017 breakout from a 118.12 cup-with-handle breakout, you're still sitting on a big gain. There's no glaring sell signal. But the reasons for holding the stock have become less compelling. Since late February, Apple has merely matched the S&P 500 index, with clear underperformance for the past three months.Apple fell to 158 soon after Monday's open, undercutting its 200-day moving average for the first time since July 2016. Shares rebounded as high as 163.88 but then succumbed to the broader market. Shares closed down 2.5% to 156.49 in more than double normal volume.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stocks Fall Broadly; Is A True Correction Near?IPhone Chip Suppliers Pressured By Apple's Quarterly ReportDid You See The Big Flaws In These IBD 50 Stocks' Charts?Anatomy Of A Chart: Breaking Down The Buy And Sell ZonesIs It Time To Get Into - Or Out Of - The Stock Market?

133,NOV,"At its most basic level, a flagship IBD sell rule to take a 20% to 25% gain in a great stock is straightforward.XDecades of IBD research show that a stock tends to correct sharply in price once the gain from a base breakout reaches that threshold. That said, implementing the rule isn't always a slam dunk, especially when it comes to stocks showing signs they could be big leaders.The bottom line: While it's a good idea to take a 20%-25% gain if you have it, take other factors into consideration. Is the market in the early stages of a new bull run, or the later stages? Are distribution days, or signs of institutional selling in the Nasdaq and S&P 500, too prominent to ignore? And how much conviction do you have in the stock?In 2017, hordes of highly rated stocks broke out, made gains of that magnitude, pulled back in very light fashion, then kept going higher.Autohome's (ATHM) gain from a 67.79 entry recently hit 28%. A 20% gain came within three weeks after the Jan. 2 breakout, meaning the Chinese automobile online ad and marketing firm has potential to be an even bigger market leader. It's been an easy hold so far for those who bought the Leaderboard stock at the latest entry.So, what's a good game plan from here? Well, one option is to take the gain and move on. Another strategy? Hold longer and wait for meaningful signs of heavy selling in the stock.Short-term traders waiting for a convincing break by Autohome of the 10-day moving average got one Tuesday when shares fell 2.5% to 82.46. Selling right at the close would have produced a 21.6% profit. However, volume was just average and the stock closed near its session high. The problem with waiting for a test of the 10-week moving average is that the support level corresponds close to Autohome's latest buy area. Letting a stock erase a double-digit gain from a buy point isn't sound strategy.Third option? Sell half the position for a profit, and give the other half more room to work.After an Aug. 28, 2017, breakout over a 110.01 buy point, former Leaderboard name Thor Industries (THO) quickly hit the 20% to 25% profit level. Some may have decided to take profits when the RV maker fell 4.7% in higher volume in the week ended Nov. 10, but it held above the 10-week moving average.The Nasdaq composite showed six distribution days, an elevated count, but many of them showed relatively mild percentage declines. Those who sat tight, waiting for a legitimate test of the 10-week line, were rewarded when Thor found support, then made new highs. By Nov. 29, Thor hit a high of 156.86, raising its gain to 42%. A defense-type sell signal flashed when shares slumped 10% in the week ended Jan. 26.RELATED:How To Build Long-Term Profits In Your Portfolio: Take Most Gains At This LevelCan Some Big Stock Market Winners Keep Rising After Forming Multiple Bases?How Options Can Help You Win Big During Earnings SeasonStocks Near A Buy Zone

134,NOV,"Enterprise software maker CA (CA), also known as CA Technologies, was on the verge of breaking out above a potential entry in the stock market today before trimming gains in midday trade.

"
135,NOV,"Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) recently set a record by becoming the first Chinese company to reach a market valuation above $500 billion.The Tencent milestone demonstrates how publicly traded, China-based companies have matured and risen to the international stage. China is experiencing rapid capital market growth and has set its sights on being an innovation leader. And it's become increasingly integrated within global markets, providing new opportunities for investors.Tencent, the 19-year-old leader in online gaming and messaging, on Nov. 20 had its share price climb to reach a market valuation of $522 billion — higher than the $519 billion valuation of Facebook (FB) on that day. Tencent shares have more than doubled in price this year.Until now, membership in the $500 billion club had belonged to U.S. tech giants: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook and Microsoft (MSFT).Another big winner among China-based stocks is e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA). Its blockbuster initial public offering three years ago surpassed Facebook as the largest technology IPO on a U.S. exchange. Alibaba raised $25 billion, vs. the $16 billion raised by the Facebook IPO in 2012.Alibaba and Tencent are not only big, but growing fast.In its latest quarterly results, Alibaba said revenue rose 61% to $8.3 billion as adjusted earnings climbed 63%. Tencent, in its latest quarter, said revenue rose 62% to $9.4 billion as adjusted earnings rose 42%. Both companies have consistently grown revenue and earnings at double-digit rates.""It's rare to see big companies growing at the rate of Alibaba and Tencent,"" said Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer at Krane Funds Advisors, which runs several China-focused exchange traded funds.Other high-profile China stocks growing at a fast rate include JD.com (JD), which competes mainly against Alibaba in the e-commerce market. JD came public in June 2014, with shares priced at 10 and currently trading near 42.Another is Baidu (BIDU), the largest search-engine company in China, with its shares up 43% this year.Whether Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, JD.com and many other fast-growing China companies can maintain their momentum, Ahern says indicators are pointing in the right direction.""China consumer confidence is at an all-time high and you have great earnings growth, so the trajectory is there and a strong case to be made that there is further upside available,"" Ahern said.IBD'S TAKE: Visit IBD's page on the Best Chinese Stocks To Buy And Watch to stay on top of the latest movers and shakers in China.The S&P China 500 Index, which contains 500 of the largest and most-liquid Chinese companies, is up 40% this year. The S&P New China Sectors Index, which includes Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu and JD.com, is up 59% this year. That compares with 20% for the U.S. S&P 500 index.The International Monetary Fund estimates that China's gross domestic product will rise 6.7% this year from the year-ago period, ""owing to the momentum from last year's policy support, strengthening external demand, and progress in domestic reform,"" the IMF said in a report published in August.But despite being the second largest equity market and the second largest economy in the world China remains an unknown quantity to many investors and is underrepresented in their portfolios, said a recent report from UBS. But that is gradually changing. As the capital markets of China become liberalized, it's expected that Chinese equities will become more prominent in the portfolios of global assets allocators, to reflect the importance and influence of its economy and financial markets.But the UBS report also cautioned that investors will need to take a more active approach to managing portfolios, as an economy in transition will create winners and losers.Since the 1980s, China has adopted a series of reforms to stimulate economic growth, including the privatization of government-controlled enterprises to foster competition. It also established equity and bond markets to finance the growth of the private sector and also support the government's spending. And it has enticed institutional investors into the market and cultivated mutual fund and ETF markets.And about one year ago China revised rules on foreign institutional investments in the country's domestic securities, to encourage more fund inflows. Three years ago regulators established China Connect, a cross-boundary investment channel giving foreign investors access to the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets through Hong Kong.In June, after four years of discussions, index provider MSCI announced it would include mainland Chinese equities, known as China A-shares, in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which tracks $1.6 trillion worth of assets around the world, and related indexes. It's an acknowledgment of China's gradual market liberalization efforts.""The impact of the inclusion in the initial stage is expected to be modest, due to the limited inclusion factor,"" wrote Vania Pang, a capital markets and investments analyst at ICBC Credit Suisse Asset Management, after the MSCI announcement was made. ""Nevertheless, the decision shows that the China A market has gained recognition from international investors and cannot be neglected.""RELATED:Alibaba Pushes Deeper Into Retail With $2.88 Billion InvestmentJD.com Stock Jumps As Quarterly Earnings Beat EstimatesBaidu Tech Conference To Push AI, Video Streaming Amid Stock SlumpChina Web Firms Sina, Weibo, Autohome Top Third-Quarter Views

136,NOV,"The semiconductor industry saw some major acquisitions announced in late 2017, and analysts expect the merger activity to continue in 2018.As the new year begins, Broadcom (AVGO) is preparing for a hostile takeover attempt of Qualcomm (QCOM). Qualcomm rejected Broadcom's Nov. 6 buyout offer worth $130 billion and has refused to negotiate with the suitor.In addition to Qualcomm's resistance, the deal must pass muster with antitrust regulators.Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google are among companies that have expressed private concerns to Qualcomm about the impact of a Broadcom takeover, CNBC reported Dec. 8.Broadcom has nominated a slate of candidates to replace Qualcomm's current board of directors and it will be put to a shareholder vote at Qualcomm's 2018 annual meeting, scheduled for March 6.Meanwhile, Qualcomm is still trying to close its $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), which was announced in October 2016.Another major chip industry deal, announced Nov. 20, is the $6 billion purchase of Cavium (CAVM) by Marvell Technology Group (MRVL).""With debt still relatively cheap, we think the consolidation trend will continue in 2018, and perhaps accelerate as many serial acquirers have reduced leverage and may be looking to strike again,"" Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland said in a Dec. 12 report.Leading takeover candidates for 2018 include Integrated Device Technology (IDTI), Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC), MaxLinear (MXL) and Microsemi (MSCC), Rolland said.KeyBanc Capital Markets identified Cypress Semiconductor (CY) and Teradyne (TER) as its top picks to get acquired. Other potential takeout candidates include Ambarella (AMBA), Silicon Labs (SLAB), Nanometrics (NANO) and Micron Technology (MU), KeyBanc said in a Dec. 15 report.""Consolidation in semiconductors will increasingly be driven by the need to increase scale to enable higher levels of research and development spending,"" KeyBanc said.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on chip stocks, visit IBD's news page Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News.The potential for mergers and acquisitions is likely to put a floor under semiconductor stocks, mitigating any potential large pullbacks in the group, JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur said in a Dec. 1 report.""In an era of slowing growth and lower cyclicality, industry players are looking to M&A to increase diversification/scale, extend market leadership positions, and drive higher profitability and capital returns,"" Sur said.The chip market is being helped by demand strength in such markets as processors for artificial intelligence, automotive, cryptocurrencies and data centers, Susquehanna's Rolland said.RELATED:Chip Merger Activity Continues Apace With Silicon Labs Deal

Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Red Hat (RHT) and ServiceNow (NOW) have each surged more than 70% this year.Better yet, an ETF that holds these hot AI stocks could soon present a buy opportunity: iShares North American Tech-Software (IGV) is looking for support near its 50-day moving average. If it finds support and stages a solid move above the 50-day line, that would set up a possible entry.IGV has pulled back to and rebounded off the support line for most of this year.

The ETF's respective average annual returns of 20.1%, 11.6% and 12.7% for the past five, 10 and 15 years also beat the benchmark index's 16%, 8.3% and 9.9% gains for the same periods.IGV sports a 0.48% expense ratio.Wednesday's pick, SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY) remains in a potential buy zone from a rebound off its 50-day moving average line.RELATED:Apple Tests Support, Bitcoin Drops; Big Dividend Play Near BuyWal-Mart, Apple Lead These 4 Dow Giants Just Below Buy PointsApple Drags Dow Into The Red; Will Bitcoin Resurge This Week?

139,NOV,"Stock indexes inched up in midday action Wednesday, as the market coasted in slow, post-Christmas trade. Volume on both major exchanges was tracking higher than Tuesday, but it was an easy comparison because turnover on Tuesday was the lowest in more than four weeks.X The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average all rose around 0.1%, while the small cap Russell 2000 rose 0.4%.Early movers included electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA). Shares fell 1% in average volume. Tesla is headed toward its eighth loss in 10 sessions and is now 19% off its high.Reuters reported that analysts at KeyBanc said Tesla would only deliver 5,000 Model 3 sedans in Q4 — far below KeyBanc's original estimate of 15,000. The Model 3 carries a $35,000 price tag. KeyBanc kept its rating of Tesla at sector weighting.Tesla has shown sloppy action on the stock chart since June. The company lost money in each of the past four quarters. Tesla has not yet set a date for its release of Q4 results, according to its website.Outerwear designer and provider Canada Goose (GOOS) struck a new high Wednesday in heavy volume.Canada Goose is 46% above a 21.28 buy point, which the small cap cleared intraday in October. Because volume was soft, disciplined investors would've passed. However, a Nov. 9 gap up offered an alternative entry (the gap up opening price) at 23.70 in huge volume.  The stock is 31% above the gap-up entry, and investors could take profits now.Canada Goose lost a penny a share in fiscal 2014, then grew earnings to 20 cents a share, 25 cents and 43 cents. The fiscal year ends in March. The stock is No. 1 in its group in Stock Checkup at Investors.com.

140,NOV,"Estimates on Tesla (TSLA) Model 3 deliveries were slashed by a Wall Street analyst Wednesday, which followed conversations last week with salespeople at 18 Tesla stores nationwide.X KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson cut his estimates on Model 3 deliveries in the fourth quarter to 5,000 from 15,000. He also lowered his estimate on deliveries for the Model 3 in 2018 to 108,000 from 120,000.Tesla is expected to announce fourth-quarter Model 3 deliveries next week, as the maker of all-electric vehicles has struggled to get its Model 3 out the door, during what Musk has called ""production hell.""""We still forecast the company should ramp up to 350,000 Model 3 deliveries by 2020 but believe the curve toward that point is a bit steeper and thus more back-end-weighted,"" Erickson wrote in a research note to clients. ""While it is likely to be a few quarters before the company's true Model 3 gross margin judgment day arrives, we remain Sector Weight as we think the Model 3 margin ramp will disappoint.""Erickson also believes that deliveries of the Tesla Model S and X are tracking generally in line with management's expectations.As Tesla struggles with Model 3 production, Chief Executive Elon Musk in a tweet on Tuesday said a pickup truck is in the planning stages.""I promise that we will make a pickup truck right after Model Y. Have had the core design/engineering elements in my mind for almost 5 years. Am dying to build it,"" Musk wrote. He first revealed plans for a pickup truck in 2016.The Model Y is a crossover SUV built on the Model 3 platform that is reportedly in the more advanced stages of development. Tesla expects to launch the Model Y by late 2019 or in 2020.Tesla last month announced plans for a futuristic big-rig truck, called Semi, and a new Roadster sports car, at a time when the company is burning cash and is behind schedule for its Model 3.Adding the Tesla pickup to the Model Y, the Semi big-rig and new Roadster means that Tesla has more models planned than are being made.Tesla shares fell 1.8% to 311.64 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Tesla undercut its 200-day line on Friday and its 50-day line on Tuesday. The stock has been showing a great deal of whipsaw action, as it tries to rebound from its recent lows and build the right side of a potential base.Tesla acknowledged production woes with its Model 3 when it reported third-quarter results on Nov. 1 that missed earnings expectations by a wide margin.

141,NOV,"E-commerce leader Amazon (AMZN) has significant momentum heading into 2018 and could beat fourth-quarter revenue estimates if the expectations of a Wall Street analyst prove accurate.X GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives estimated Amazon received between 45% and 50% of holiday online retail sales this year, up from 38% during the same period last year. The sales gains came despite a strong online performance by Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), and with Target (TGT) and Best Buy (BBY) also holding their own, Ives said in a research note to clients.Wal-Mart has stepped up its game and is on pace to significantly increase its market share online this holiday season, Ives said. But Amazon holds an advantage with its Prime membership program, where customers pay $99 a year and receive free shipping and numerous other perks, turning them into loyal Amazon fans and shoppers. Ives estimates that there are 88 million Prime customers, up about 40% from last year. The average Prime customer spent 22% more this holiday season than the year-ago period, he estimates, ""which speaks to the pure power of the Amazon consumer model,"" Ives wrote.""While Walmart is emerging as Amazon's biggest sole competitor online, we believe customer overlap remains small today as Prime membership growth and Amazon's stronghold on e-commerce remain hard to penetrate as we expect this trend to continue to play out in the near-term heading into 2018,"" Ives wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is on the exclusive IBD Leaderboard list of top stocks. Amazon shares are currently extended from a 1,083.41 buy point. The latest breakout was from a late-stage base, and the stock broke out in a sudden rush of buying from near the base's lows, both negatives.Amazon on Tuesday touted its biggest holiday sales season ever. Among its success stories, in one week alone more than 4 million people joined its Prime service, either through free trials or paid memberships. Amazon does not reveal total Prime customers.Amazon scored record sales on Cyber Monday and Black Friday as consumers responded to a raft of promotions.""The ring-fence that Amazon has built around its Prime customer base has significantly benefited the company in a fiercely competitive pricing environment with much more competitive prices and inventory from Wal-Mart in particular seen over the last month, (and) with Target and Best Buy also holding their own based on our analysis and retail tracking,"" Ives wrote.He maintained a rating of highly attractive for Amazon, with a price target of 1,350 and calling it a top pick for 2018.Amazon shares rose 0.5% to 1,182.26 on the stock market today. Amazon shares hit a record high of 1,213.41 on Nov. 27.Ives projects Amazon can beat fourth-quarter revenue estimates by 4% to 5% if his holiday sales estimates are accurate.The retail sector has been showing strength recently, from long-ailing department-store titans like Macy's (M) to discount chains like Wal-Mart. Also stepping up its game against Amazon, Target recently announced that it would buy an online delivery company to expand its same-day delivery services to shoppers.In terms of Amazon's next strategic move, wrote Ives, ""We believe pharmacy and health care is the natural logical next step to take in 2018 as the company looks to further expand its consumer stronghold.""Early this month Amazon received two price-target hikes, following a five-day conference on cloud computing that demonstrated its growing strength in artificial intelligence.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Retail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchAmazon's Booming Apparel Business In Position To Pass Macy's, TJXLooking For The Next Big Thing?

The fund was up 30.92% this year going into Thursday, thanks in part to gains by aerospace giant Boeing (BA), up 91% this year; video game provider Activision Blizzard (ATVI), up 80%; and robotic surgical systems maker Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), up 72%.X The fund's gain is better than double its 12.37% three-year average annual gain. And it tops the 28.01% average this year by his large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct as well as the S&P 500's 22.04% gain.Information technology and consumer staples were the fund's first and fifth largest sectors as of Nov. 30, with weightings of 41% and 9% respectively. That reflects the outlook expressed by managers Gregory Woodhams and Justin Brown, who noted in their Sept. 30 commentary that growth prospects appear strong in tech and that valuations in consumer staples are compelling.Those factors matter to the managers because they seek to invest in companies whose fundamentals are strong and improving but whose share price performance does not fully reflect those traits.Activision is one of the fund's tech holdings. So are Facebook (FB) and Applied Materials (AMAT). The latter two both happen to be members of the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks. Facebook is also a member of Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play moves of top stocks.Trading around 178, Facebook shares are up 55% so far this year. IBD readers see that Facebook is in a buy range from a prior 175.59 flat-base buy point. Big volume during its Nov. 29 slide was a bad sign, but the stock is holding up so far. The number of daily active Facebook users has climbed above 1 billion. Facebook's growing mobile platform is pulling in the bulk of the company's total advertising revenue.The managers like Activision because it's a video game publisher that they think should continue to benefit from an ongoing shift to online subscription models, away from reliance on console-based video games. The shift to a subscription model tends to boost a business's margins.American Century research shows that capital spending by semiconductor companies is rising. Applied Materials is a semiconductor equipment provider that is seeing rapid growth due to increased demand for chips used in artificial intelligence and big data applications, Growth Fund's managers told shareholders.IBD'S TAKE: Apple, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft and others are racing to develop artificial intelligence hardware and software. Bookmark IBD's AI page to follow the latest developments.In consumer staples, the fund's managers noted that Dollar Tree (DLTR) is bucking the trend of weakness among brick-and-mortar retailers. Dollar Tree benefits from focusing on lower-income consumers, the managers said. And the company has boosted its results due to its acquisition of the Family Dollar chain.Dollar Tree shares are up 41% so far this year. Earnings per share grew 10%, 37% and 40% the past three quarters.Wal-Mart Stores' (WMT) earnings per share inched up a modest 2%, 1% and 2% the past three quarters. That reflects the competitive challenge faced by brick-and-mortar retailers in general as they compete with online retailers such as Amazon (AMZN) — which is also a holding of this American Century fund.Wal-Mart sales rose 1%, 2% and 4% the past three stanzas. Yet Wal-Mart shares are up 43% so far this year. Why such bullishness by investors? In the third-quarter, reported last month, Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce sales jumped 50% and gross merchandise volume leapt 54%. The company appears to be learning how to compete online.As IBD recently reported, Wal-Mart's 2016 acquisition of Jet.com has beefed up its online capabilities. And acquisitions in 2017 such as ModCloth, Bonobos, Moosejaw, are helping the megastore build its indie and fashion cred. Those enabled the firm to beat Q3 forecasts last month and give upbeat holiday-quarter guidance.Wal-Mart also announced last month that it will start to sell Lord & Taylor's department store products on Walmart.com. That will broaden its assortment of products and fashionable apparel, IBD has reported.American Century Growth appears poised to continue its run by aiming for leadership stocks. Seven of its 10 largest holdings as of Sept. 30 had IBD Composite Ratings in the 90s. So did two of its five top new buys. A third top new buy had a Comp Rating of 89. IBD's Composite Rating is scored on a scale of 1 to 99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher. RELATED:How The New Tax Bill Affects YouYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

146,NOV,"Americans felt the holiday shopping spirit this year, with U.S. retail sales growing at their best pace in six years, while Amazon (AMZN) reported a gangbusters holiday season with its customers across the world shopping at record levels.X Holiday sales, excluding automobiles, rose 4.9% from Nov. 1 through Christmas Eve — the largest year-over-year increase since 2011 — with e-commerce sales vaulting 18.1% compared to a year ago, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks both online and in-store spending.""Overall, this year was a big win for retail,"" said Sarah Quinlan, a senior vice president at Mastercard. ""The strong U.S. economy was a contributing factor, but we also have to recognize that retailers who tried new strategies to engage holiday shoppers were the beneficiaries of this sales increase.""The retail sector has been showing strength recently, from long-ailing department-store titans like Macy's (M) to thriving discount chains like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Costco Wholesale (COST). As consumers continue to shop on mobile devices or online, brick-and-mortar stores continues to see closures, lower foot traffic and bankruptcies, including those of Sports Authority and Toys R Us.Shares of Amazon rose 0.7% on the stock market today, avoding their fifth straight modest loss. Amazon has advanced 8% from its late October breakout from a late-stage base.Other retail stocks jumped, including a 4.6% gain for Macy's, 5.4% for JC Penney (JCP) and 6% for Kohl's (KSS) as department stores led all industry groups. Wal-Mart rose 1%, Best Buy (BBY) 1.1%. Costco edged up 0.1%.Macy's hit its best levels since early May, J.C. Penney retook its 50-day moving average, Kohl's set a 1-year best and Best Buy an all-time high. Wal-Mart is one of four Dow stocks near buy points.Macy's and Costco have advanced 26% and 8% in the past month, respectively, vs. a 3% gain for the S&P 500 and a 2% decline for Amazon.Other retail stocks with big Tuesday gains include Children's Place (PLCE), Finish Line (FINL) and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF).Mastercard (MA) rose 0.3% in Tuesday trade.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point may have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that could move higher.Within the consumer sector, Amazon could drive 40% to 50% of overall U.S. retail sales growth ""as e-commerce gains share within retail and Amazon gains share within e-commerce,"" Morgan Stanley equity analyst Kimberly Greenberger wrote in a recent analysis.Amazon reported Tuesday that more than 4 million people started Prime free trials or began paid memberships in one week of this holiday season alone. The Echo Dot smart speaker was the No. 1 selling product from any manufacturer in any category this holiday season.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Retail and E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchLooking For The Next Big Thing?

148,NOV,"Stocks reversed lower after the Fed's comments, but closed out the session with modest gains. Boeing (BA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) boosted the Dow Jones industrial average.X SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) rose 0.3%, PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) advanced 0.4% and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) added 0.1% in the stock market today. Emerging markets outperformed with iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) up 0.5%. Small caps lagged: iShares Core S&P Small-Cap (IJR) and iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) fell 0.5% each.The Fed held rates steady, but slightly more hawkish comments regarding inflation spooked the market.Boeing led the Dow with a 5% gain after topping Q4 views and offering bullish guidance. Also on the Dow, Microsoft rose nearly 2%, on track for a new closing high. Apple recovered 0.3%. The iPhone maker reports on Thursday.REITs, utilities and semiconductors led the upside among sector funds. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH), featured in Monday's ETF column, advanced 0.8% to retake a 105.93 buy point. Graphics chip designer Nvidia (NVDA) rose 2% to a new record high.Biotech, health care and building plays were lower. Oil funds were mixed as West Texas intermediate crude prices rose 0.5% to %64.82 a barrel. Gold funds climbed as did underlying gold futures.But Bitcoin edged 0.4% higher to $10,073.52, according to CoinDesk. It had earlier climbed back above the $10,300 level. A South Korean official said the country doesn't plan to ban but will regulate cryptocurrency exchanges, according to Reuters. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), however, slumped 12%. It's now 61% off its mid-December peak.Stocks got smacked across the board Tuesday. But on the plus side, that may help set up new buy opportunities in equity ETFs holding top stocks like AI player Nvidia and Alibaba (BABA).Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) gapped down and fell more than 3% early Tuesday, but found support at its 50-day moving average and pared its loss by the close. If it continues to bounce off the support line, that could mark a chance to buy shares. An early January rebound off the 50-day yielded an 8% advance through a Jan. 22 intraday high. A late August pullback and bounce off the line produced a near 23% gain through a Nov. 22 intraday high.The fund, which launched in April 2015 as a partnership between IBD and Innovator Capital Management, has attracted $376.8 million in assets. It tracks the IBD 50 Index, which comprises the top 50 growth stocks selected by IBD. Most of these names have in common traits of the market's biggest winning stocks, such as outstanding profit and sales growth, wide profit margins and a high return on equity.The fundamental and technical metrics used for stock selection are based on decades of research started in the 1960s by IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil. His CAN SLIM investing system includes current and annual earnings, new products, service or management, stock price performance, institutional ownership and the overall market.Information technology accounted for more than half of the portfolio, around 52%, consumer discretionary 21%, financials 10% and health care 8%. Smaller positions in industrials, energy, consumer staples and materials made up the rest. The U.S. represented the biggest country weighting, 81%, followed by China at 14%, Australia 3% and Argentina 2%.IBD'S  TAKE: Nvidia is a leading chip stock, but how do the company's fundamentals rank in its industry group? Find out now at IBD Stock Checkup.Top holdings as of Jan. 29 included graphics chip designer Nvidia, which is also a leading player in the artificial intelligence field, Chinese online retail giant Alibaba, Arista Networks (ANET) and Align Technology (ALGN). All closed lower Tuesday but retain double-digit gains this year vs. the S&P 500's 6% advance. Arista and Align fell sharply in early trading and closed near the top of their session range.Align Technology fell before the opening bell on the stock market today despite reporting better-than-expected earnings late Tuesday.So far this year, FFTY lags the S&P 500 with a 4.1% to 6.2% return. The ETF's one-year return of 40% leads the broader index's 26.9% gain. FFTY carries a 0.80% expense ratio.

150,NOV,"Apple (AAPL) is expected to deliver solid earnings growth for the December-ending fiscal first quarter on Thursday. But several analysts expect Apple to guide lower for the current March quarter due to weakening iPhone X demand. But what is the stock chart telling us right now?X Apple should report a 14% earnings per share gain to $3.82 with revenue climbing 10% to $86.02 billion. For Q2, the consensus is for year-over-year growth to accelerate, with EPS up 38% to $2.10 and sales swelling 26% to $66.54 billion. But some see sales as low as $62 billion.Shares of the Dow Jones industrial average component fell 3.9% in last week's stock market trading to 171.51. The stock fell below a flat-base buy point of 176.34 and its 50-day moving average in the heaviest weekly volume since the week ended Nov. 3.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index advanced 2.2% last week to a record high. That big divergence between the S&P 500 and the world's most valuable company underscored Apple's current status as a lagging stock, not a leader. Apple shares fell 2.1% to 167.96 on Monday, turning slightly negative for 2018.The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been trending lower since early November. Even as the stock cleared its buy point several times in recent weeks, the RS was well off its highs. The RS line (the blue line in the chart below), sank to its lowest level since June.Apple retreated 0.6% Tuesday to close at 166.97, falling intraday to its lowest level in nearly three months. The RS line rose slightly as Apple fell a little less than the S&P 500, which fell 1.1%.Investors should be looking for stocks with RS lines that lead or confirm breakouts.Apple's weakness is backed up by trouble with iPhone-related stock plays, including Apple chipmakers and companies involved in the OLED screens used in the iPhone X and other high-end electronic devices. However, Qorvo (QRVO) shares did jump 3.6% on Tuesday, retaking its 50-day moving average ahead of its earnings Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Apple bulls are hoping that the iPhone giant will deliver standout holiday quarter results and offer guidance that's strong or at least not as bad as many analysts fear. If so, Apple shares could rally. But it's dangerous for investors to try to prove that they know better than the collective knowledge of the market. The way to outperform the broader averages consistently is to listen to what the market is saying right now.And right now — not last year, not two weeks in the future — the market is cool on Apple.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Stocks Soar; These 5 Mega-Cap Techs Are On DeckThese 7 Stocks With 99 Composite Ratings Have Earnings This WeekFacebook, Apple, Amazon To Grab Earnings Spotlight: Investing Action PlanThese 3 Top Stocks Are Near Buy Points; This Leader Just Broke OutThese Four IBD 50 Tech Stocks Are In Buy RangeEarnings Preview: Will FANG Names, Other Hot Growth Stocks Deliver Stellar Results?

151,NOV,"FBI Scandal: Was FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe's sudden departure from the nation's premier law enforcement agency a one-off move by a disgruntled and politically harassed bureaucrat? Or was it the tip of a much-bigger iceberg and a sign of things to come in a heavily politicized federal bureau that meddled in the last election? Evidence so far points to the latter.XMcCabe was forced out of the No. 2 FBI power post on Monday just before the House Intelligence Committee voted to release a top secret memo detailing possible extensive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses during the Obama administration.McCabe was no coincidence. FBI Director Christopher Wray read the memo Sunday, and by Monday afternoon McCabe was gone.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveNational security reporter Sara Carter, citing ""current and former FBI officials,"" wrote that more resignations are likely to follow and that Wray was ""shocked to his core"" after reading the memo.McCabe is at the center of what increasingly appears to be a cabal of FBI officials dedicated to undermining Trump's presidency. If so, and a congressional memo is not in and of itself proof, it would signal a major scandal that ultimately could lead to firings, fines and even prison terms.Howard Kurtz, the veteran media critic, in his recently released book ""Media Madness,"" writes that McCabe was the one who initiated an ill-fated meeting last February with President Trump's controversial first chief of staff, Reince Priebus. McCabe contacted Priebus, wrote Kurtz, to tell him that a piece in The New York Times claiming that the Trump campaign had repeated contacts with Russian intelligence officials was, in McCabe's word, ""bullsh#t.""But when Priebus requested that McCabe and the FBI specifically and publicly refute the Times story, McCabe said he couldn't. Then-FBI Director James Comey likewise refused. But that didn't stopAs the Federalist's Mollie Hemingway writes, ""Now, a week later, CNN was airing a breaking news story naming Priebus. According to 'multiple U.S. officials,' the network said, 'the FBI rejected a White House request to publicly knock down media reports about communications between Donald Trump's associates and Russians known to U.S. intelligence.' ""In short, McCabe appears to have set up the administration to be accused of tampering with an active investigation or even, possibly, an obstruction charge. Then leaked it to the press.McCabe is also a key figure in Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz' investigation into how the FBI handled Hillary Clinton's illegal use of a private email server to send and receive classified information.The investigation, the Washington Post reported Tuesday, ""has been focused for months on why Andrew McCabe, as the No. 2 official at the FBI, appeared not to act for about three weeks on a request to examine a batch of Hillary Clinton-related emails found in the latter stages of the 2016 election campaign.""Even shadier, McCabe's wife Jill rant for a Virginia state senate seat in 2015. At the time, she received donations of nearly $675,000 from former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe's super PAC, and from the Democratic Party of Virginia.McAuliffe, as is well known, is a long-time Clinton partisan, aide and friend who went on to be governor of Virginia. As the FBI's No. 2, he had influence and direct control over the investigation into Hillary Clinton's missing 33,000 emails and the use of an illegal server during her tenure as secretary of state.To suggest that the money McAuliffe directed toward McCabe's wife would have no impact on how he conducted his investigation and subsequent decisions is, of course, absurd and contrary to basic common sense.McCabe seems to have been an agent-in-place for the Democratic Party, and FBI Director Wray finally said, ""enough."" McCabe, by the way, still walks away with nearly $2 million in retirement benefits.As we said, McCabe just might be the first of several. Already a number of FBI employees have been demoted because of their political activities. Let us be as clear as we can be: We don't care what McCabe's political views are, as long as he did his job.But the clear impression that he and others, including Comey, may have been tilting their decisions toward Hillary Clinton, who until Nov. 8, 2016, looked like a shoo-in for the presidency, is not just unacceptable — it is likely legally actionable.As Congress and the president mull releasing even more information on this sad affair for American democracy, it's important to note that this is potentially bigger than even Watergate. If in fact a circle of government employees worked to subvert American law and the political process, it's not a firing offense — it's a criminal offense.RELATED:Hillary Clinton Email Scandal Explained The FBI Is Looking Guilty As Hell In Russia ProbeClinton Email Scandal: New Revelations Of Cover-Up Spell Trouble For Hillary Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

152,NOV,"Stocks sold off for a second straight session Tuesday as UnitedHealth (UNH), Pfizer (PFE) and Apple (AAPL) weighed on the Dow Jones industrials. Bitcoin plunged 10%.X SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) sank 1.2%, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) dropped 0.9% and PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) gave up 0.7%. Emerging markets also sold off; iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) lost 1.2% in the stock market today.Energy, health care and retail led the downside among sector funds. Oil plays slid as West Texas intermediate crude prices dropped nearly 2% to $64.37 a barrel.Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) gapped down and lost 2%, though it remains near all-time highs. UnitedHealth Group and Pfizer, down a respective 4% and 3%, were the biggest Dow losers. The two stocks are also in XLV's top three holdings.Health care stocks got hurt after Amazon (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and JPMorgan (JPM) said in a statement they will team up on ways to ""address healthcare for their U.S. employees.""Among other Dow stocks, Apple fell 0.6% as it continues to slide further below a 176.34 buy point and its 50-day moving average. The iPhone maker reports quarterly results Thursday.Telecom and utilities were among the few industry groups spared in the rout. Even gold commodity ETFs gave up early slim gains as gold futures reversed to a loss. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU) fell 0.4% each.Bitcoin plunged 11% to $9.975,59, according to CoinDesk, as the digital currency got hit with new regulatory measures in the U.S. and South Korea. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) gave up 8% to its lowest close since Dec. 5 as it fell further below its 50-day line.Graphics chip designer Nvidia (NVDA) may be extended from a recent buy point, but investors may still have a chance to buy it and other leading chip stocks.VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) is just above a 105.93 buy point of a flat base initially cleared in mid-January. SMH was last featured in this ETF column on Dec. 1 as shares were testing the 50-day moving average. They undercut the support line but remained near it to form the bottom of the flat base. A prior rebound off the 50-day yielded a 24% gain to a Nov. 24 intraday high.The $920 million fund, which marked its sixth year last month, tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. The index is composed of the most liquid chip companies based on market cap and volume.The U.S. accounted for the biggest country weighting as of Dec. 31, at just north of 79% of assets. Taiwan and the Netherlands represented about 10% each, and Bermuda 2%. The top five holdings were Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), Intel (INTC), Nvidia, ASML (ASML) and Texas Instruments (TXN). They made up 37% of the portfolio.SMH has returned about 10.5% year to date through Jan. 26, according to Morningstar Direct, outpacing the S&P 500's 7.6% gain. Average annual returns of 26.9% and 27.6% over the past three and five years, respectively, are also ahead of the benchmark index's 14.2% and 16.2% gains for the same periods.IBD'S  TAKE: Nvidia is a leading chip stock, but how do the company's fundamentals rank in its industry group? Find out now at IBD Stock Checkup.Chip stocks had a tough Monday overall, though a few fabless names fared well. Fabless companies design semiconductors, but outsource the manufacturing. SMH component Nvidia, which is also a player in the hot artificial intelligence field, rose 1.5% to a record high. Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), meantime, surged 12% on a report that Japan's Renesas Electronics is in talks to acquire the San Jose, Calif.-based chip designer for potentially $20 billion.SMH carries a 0.36% expense ratio.Monday's pick, Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X (SOXL), remains slightly extended from a 167.60 cup-with-handle entry.RELATED:Apple Slips Ahead Of Earnings, But Biotechs, Bitcoin Play GainIntel, Nvidia Power Dow, S&P To Highs; Bitcoin Below Key SupportStock Market Closes At Record High; Is Bitcoin No Longer A Fraud?

153,NOV,"U.S. stocks remained broadly lower at midday Tuesday in what appears to be a perfectly normal pullback after stunning gains earlier this month. Commodity plays helped pace the downside as agricultural chemical, oil and gas exploration, oil drilling, metal ores and steel shares fell hard.X Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, fell for the fourth time in five sessions. At 165.94, the largest company on the Nasdaq by market cap is now 4% below its 50-day moving average, which flattened out last week. Gains from an Oct. 27 breakout from a good second-stage cup with handle at 160.97 have now been squeezed to 3.4%, and shares are down more than 5% from the 176.34 buy point.Apple's 1.2% slide weighed on all three major indexes, with the Nasdaq composite down 0.9%, the S&P 500 off 1% and the Dow Jones industrial average sinking 1.3%.At least eight of the 30 components within the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2 points or more, including UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Goldman Sachs (GS), 3M (MMM) and McDonald's (MCD). Yet even with Tuesday's decline, at 26,198 the Dow stands 8.3% higher since Jan. 1.McDonald's posted a 19% jump in adjusted fourth-quarter profit to $1.71 a share. But sales dropped 11% to $5.34 billion, the biggest year-over-year drop since the first quarter of 2015.Nevertheless, shares of the fast-food icon have performed well since clearing a long saucer with handle at 130.10 in late March, rolling up more than 38% from that breakout point. As seen on a weekly chart, it continues to hug its slowly rising 10-week moving average (painted in red in all IBD and MarketSmith charts).On Monday, the Nasdaq notched its third distribution day, or instance of heavy professional selling, and its second in four sessions. Keep track of the distribution count for both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 by reading The Big Picture column on a daily basis. When the current outlook for the market changes, you'll have a good strategy and motivation to take action to either sell stocks and reduce exposure, or hold on to your positions.At this point, a new investor in Apple shares has to decide where to draw the line in the sand. When a stock has gained 10% or more following a sound breakout, a good rule of thumb is to sell shares for a small profit to prevent a complete wipeout of gains. The stock can always be bought back when market conditions improve.From a longer-term point of view, however, Apple is still acting just fine.On Jan. 6, 2017, the iPhone, iPad and digital services giant broke out of a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12. By Jan. 18 of this year, shares rose as much as 52.5%. Over the same period, the Nasdaq composite rallied 32%. The S&P 500 also trailed, rising 22.9%. The S&P SmallCap 600 rose just 14.5%.Over that ascent, Apple survived normal-looking sell-offs that sent shares temporarily below the 50-day moving average in June and September. Notice on a long-term weekly chart how Apple did not venture too far below the 10-week moving average, which moves in similar form with the 50-day on a daily chart.Elsewhere in the stock market, investors sought to accumulate shares in select names in business and medical software. Workday (WDAY) rose more than 3% to 120.75 in volume running nearly double its usual levels. The stock is now slightly extended after breaking out of an eight-week cup with handle at 114.98.Find the correct buy point in this pattern by adding 10 cents to the highest price within the handle, which is 114.88.Paycom Software (PAYC), which also excels in the HR and payroll automation and outsourcing markets, erased mild early losses to edge slightly higher. At 92.69, the Oklahoma City-based firm has gained 7.5% after a Jan. 12 breakout past an 86.20 entry in a good flat base.Defensive industries including hospital, nonalcoholic beverages, soap and meat rallied.Back to the downside, Pulte Group (PHM) gapped down and dropped more than 3% to 32.18 in active turnover. The stock closed below its 50-day moving average on Monday for the first time since a breakout past a 24.53 buy point in a flat base in June 2017, marking a key sell signal.The homebuilder reported a 27% rise in Q4 profit to 85 cents a share, matching the consensus view. Revenue rose 12% to $2.79 billion, missing the Thomson Reuters estimate.A large number of Pulte's industry peers have also slid sharply below their 50-day lines, including NVR (NVR), LGI Homes (LGIH) and Toll Bros. (TOL). But a few reversed nicely off their lows, a good sign.After a healthy breakout and substantial price run, a sharp undercut below the 50-day line and failure to recover back to the support line is a key IBD defensive sell rule to help you preserve your profits.As a two-day Federal Reserve meeting on interest rate policy began on Tuesday, bond traders did not seem to actively seek bargains even after the recent sell-off in Treasuries. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year bond is currently at 2.71%.The 3-month Treasury paper has a yield of 1.42% and the 2-year note a yield of 2.12%; thus, the yield curve continues to maintain a positive slope.The Building sector ranks No. 3 among 33 sectors as ranked by mid- and long-term relative price performance as of the latest IBD Weekly print edition. However, the sector is also down more than 2% since Jan. 1, so it's actually severely lagging the broader market. See the entire sector rankings via the stock research tables inside IBD Weekly (beginning on page B5) as well as by going to IBD Data Tables in ""Stock Lists"" at Investors.com, then clicking on IBD Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables.Key earnings reports after the close on Tuesday include Illumina (ILMN), Align Technology (ALGN) and Electronic Arts (EA).Illumina, the expert in genetic data analysis equipment, is expected to post a 44% jump in Q4 profit to $1.22 a share. That would mark the biggest year-over-year increase since a 72% gain in the first quarter of 2015.In the prior four quarters, Illumina showed a 5% EPS increase, declines of 11% and 5%, and a 14% gain.Illumina, down just 0.5% to 240.40 in light turnover, has rallied in steady stair-stepping fashion after breakouts past a 12-week flat base at 189.58 on Aug. 2, 2017, and from a base-on-base breakout past 214.44 on Nov. 22.(Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary and analysis of breakouts, growth stocks, and financial markets.)RELATED:Can You Really Spot Major Market Tops?

154,NOV,"Stocks came off lows in afternoon trading Monday, although some industry groups were under added pressure.X Losses were well-contained, with the main indexes trading inside Friday's price ranges and declines at less than 0.3%.The Nasdaq composite was off 0.1%, the S&P 500 0.2% and Dow Jones industrial average 0.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000, which has been lagging the major indexes for about a week, fell 0.2%.Volume was higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq compared with the same time Friday. Although the key indexes pared losses, breadth was poor. Losers led winners by more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE and by 3-to-2 on the Nasdaq.Energy, chip equipment, homebuilding and solar industry groups were some of the weakest in today's market.Signs of stress are growing in the homebuilding group. LGI Homes (LGIH), William Lyon Homes (WLH), Toll Bros. (TOL) and D.R. Horton (DHI) have moved below their 50-day moving averages for the first time since September, when those stocks were basing. A few other builders had already slid below the 50-day line.Myriad Genetics (MYGN) gapped down in heavy trading after Goldman Sachs initiated the stock with a sell rating today. The genetic testing company erased all gains from a breakout past a 37.40 buy point, which results in a sell signal.But Gilead Sciences (GILD) soared above the 86.37 buy point of a cup without handle. Volume was more than triple its usual pace. But the relative strength line is well short of a new high, which may hamper the stock's move to new highs.The biotech is following up Friday's 5.3% surge, which came after Jefferies upgraded Gilead to buy from hold and raised its price target to 95 from 87.Fibria (FBR) broke out of a cup without handle, clearing the 17.31 buy point in heavy volume. Reports quoted by Reuters say Netherlands-based Paper Excellence is considering acquiring the Brazil-based forestry company. The relative strength line is trending higher but has not made a new high.Universal Display (OLED) fell 6% and continues to struggle below the 50-day moving average. The maker of organic light-emitting diode technology has been weakening on reports of flagging demand for Apple's iPhone X, which uses an OLED display. On Monday, Japan's Nikkei reported that lackluster sales of the iPhone X may delay Apple's plans to introduce OLED screens in other models.Dow component Caterpillar (CAT) was down nearly 3% in heavy trading. The stock had been rallying from its Nov. 30 breakout past a tightly wound flat base at 140.54 and had climbed more than 20% until it started to stall the past couple of weeks.Despite strong earnings Thursday, the stock has come under selling since then. Caterpillar's behavior shows the importance of taking profits after a stock is up 20% or 25% from its entry.RELATED:OLED Display Suppliers Dim On Lowered iPhone X ProspectsApple Cutting iPhone X Production In Half After Disappointing Sales: ReportDow Leader Caterpillar Just Steamrolled Estimates AgainUse This Key Stock Chart Pattern To Pump Up Your PortfolioWhere Is The Stock Market Headed?

155,NOV,"For the past six years, Investor's Business Daily and TechnoMetrica have conducted an annual study of investors' experiences with their primary online brokers. For this brokerage comparison, the study measures investors' sentiment regarding the performance of their brokers on key features and attributes. Based on the individual ratings assigned to these characteristics, an overall index is computed for each online broker. The Best Online Brokers rankings are determined by these indexes.X The latest edition of our study follows a similar methodology to previous years, encompassing two phases of survey research.In the first phase of the project, we identified the most important features and characteristics of online brokers according to their investors. An online survey of investors was conducted using the MaxDiff method, in which respondents were presented with combinations of 23 potential attributes, and were asked to identify which characteristics were the most and least important to them.The survey for Phase I was implemented from July to August 2017, and included the participation of 894 visitors to IBD's Investors.com website. Based on the results of the survey, we narrowed the 23 attributes to 14 based on their importance to investors. TechnoMetrica also developed the weights that should be assigned to each of the 14 features to compute an Overall Customer Experience Index for each online broker.Low Commissions & Fees topped the list of the most important attributes in this year's Best Online Brokers study, overtaking the previous year's leader Trade Reliability, which dropped to second place. The remaining attributes in the top five are identical to last year's study: Site Performance, Equity Trading Tools and Customer Service.The Phase II survey spanned from Sept. 5 to Nov. 13, 2017, during which 5,052 visitors to the IBD website Investors.com participated in the research.Our brokerage comparison in this report is limited to online brokers with 125 respondents or more. Of the 19 brokers that were explicitly listed in the questionnaire, eight garnered at least 125 respondents.Survey respondents rated their past six-month experiences with their primary broker using a five-point scale (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair and Poor) for the 14 attributes.To make the brokerage comparison, we developed a Customer Experience Index for each broker attribute, using the following question: Based on your experience with your primary online broker during the past six months, how would you rate your primary online broker?The Customer Experience Index denotes the difference between the percentage of respondents giving ratings of Excellent and Very Good and the percentage who gave ratings of Fair and Poor.For example, if 30% of respondents rated customer service of a broker as Excellent, 26% Very Good, 20% Good, 13% Fair and 11% Poor, we calculated the Customer Experience Index to be 32% (56% less 24%).This report presents the five online brokers with the highest Customer Experience Index for each of the 14 attributes.To arrive at our Overall Customer Experience Index, we combined the subindexes for all 14 attributes using the weights we developed in Phase I. The five online brokers with the highest ratings in this index make up our Top Overall Customer Experience list.Want to read more about each of the top five brokers, the latest commission trends and more?

157,NOV,"When looking at annual returns for the year, it would be a mistake to think they come at a steady rate. More often, the year is punctuated by fits and starts. The job of a swing trader is to capitalize on the upswings and sidestep the pullbacks.What's made the last year challenging is that defensive action on pullbacks often saw immediate rebounds to new highs. However, if you didn't take defensive action, you left yourself exposed to sector rotation. That could leave you with the wrong stocks as the indexes were making new highs.Taking a look at the action of IBD's SwingTrader over the last few months illustrates the point. Our current trades shrunk considerably as the Nasdaq composite spent time below its 5-day moving average and dipped below its 10-day line in mid-November. Skechers (SKX) was already on as a current trade, but the list expanded more aggressively starting on Nov. 16 (1). Scientific Games (SGMS), Illumina (ILMN), and United Rentals (URI) were good for some quick gains before the index started pulling back on Nov. 29 (2). Our defensive selling accelerated on Dec. 1 (3), a morning plagued by headlines that later proved to be false.On Dec. 7, the buying started again in earnest (4). Getting in early at these reversals, rather than waiting for new high ground, has been critical to staying in phase with the market. While some quick profits were booked in names like RingCentral (RNG) and Kennametal (KMT), there were some small losses as well, like Netflix (NFLX). But, as the market pulled back starting on Dec. 19 (5), two things occurred that were noteworthy. First, the pullback was very orderly and slow to give up its 10-day moving average. Second, several stocks set up, triggered buys and made progress during this time.Take Diamondback Energy (FANG). There were many constructive chart patterns forming among oil explorers and producers as the Nasdaq hit new highs. Diamondback Energy stood out because of its strong earnings record and relative strength. While the market pulled back slightly, it made significant progress.On Jan. 2 (6), the Nasdaq celebrated the New Year by starting a fantastic run of 8.4% the first few weeks. SwingTrader added names aggressively early on. The backdrop helped boost our confidence. Diamondback Energy was already up 7.8% from its entry by the start of the year. We also booked a few quick profits from stocks like Weight Watchers (WTW) and Mastec (MTZ) during the pullback. Whenever you start from a position of strength, you have the flexibility to push a little harder. We still employed profit-taking rules to nail down gains along the way up. The reversal on Jan. 16 (7), sparked some loss cutting and profit taking and on Jan 23. (8), another round of selling occurred, as the index seemed extended.The SwingTrader product has a list of every past trade. What is immediately recognizable is that strings of profits see intrusions of losses periodically in times of market weakness. Keeping that list overwhelmingly green requires more names in a favorable market and quick action when it isn't.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Recent swing trading articles on stocks noted above are available on Skechers, Illumina, RingCentral, and Diamondback Energy.Stock Market Follows Newton's Laws In Swing Trades Swing Trading Strategies And LessonsSwing Trading Webinar

159,NOV,"Wall Street expects a big holiday sales quarter from Apple (AAPL), but analysts are bracing for a sharply reduced outlook from the tech icon for the current reporting period.X Analysts are worried the March quarter, its fiscal second, could come in under current expectations, given reports out of Asia that Apple is cutting production of the iPhone X amid slowing demand for the premium-priced smartphone.BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk thinks Apple will guide to March-quarter revenue as low as $60 billion, compared with consensus of $68 billion.""Smartphone upgrade rates remain at record low levels and do not appear poised to rebound in the first calendar quarter,"" Piecyk said in a note to clients Friday. ""Reduced iPhone promotions could be having an impact, but the sustained lengthening of the replacement cycle appears driven simply by customer choice to hold on to their phone longer.""He lowered his iPhone sales estimate for the March period to 53 million units from 60 million based on a more conservative outlook for upgrade rates. Piecyk rates Apple stock as buy with a price target of 198.Apple stock has been hit by heavy selling in recent days but managed a slight gain to 171.51 at the close on the stock market today. On Thursday, the stock cut through its 50-day moving average line, a key technical support level. Meanwhile, Apple's relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has slumped to its worst level since July.Apple is scheduled to report its December-quarter results after the market close on Thursday. It will be the first quarter to include sales of the company's new flagship iPhone X smartphone, which went on sale Nov. 3. It also will be the first full quarter of sales for the iPhone 8 series handsets and the Apple Watch Series 3 smartwatch, which hit the market on Sept. 22.Apple is expected to earn $3.81 a share, up 13% year over year, on $86 billion in revenue, up 10%, in its fiscal first quarter, according to Zacks Investment Research.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 82 out of a best-possible 99. For more analysis on Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang believes the March-quarter risk is ""overblown."" Still, he believes Apple could guide to sales of $61 billion to $63 billion for the period, below the Street's consensus.Apple could get a lift from the introduction of the company's HomePod smart speaker and perhaps a new version of its entry-level smartphone, possibly called the iPhone SE2, he said. Zhang rates Apple stock as buy with a price target of 180.Wall Street is in ""full panic mode"" ahead of Apple's December-quarter report because of supply chain checks out of Asia, GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said in a report. Ives rates Apple stock as ""highly attractive"" with a price target of 205.""All eyes will be on March guidance with fears running rampant on the Street that Apple will guide significantly below expectations for this upcoming quarter,"" he said. ""We continue to believe the Apple bull story for 2018 is well intact and it's time to take a deep breath as, despite soft demand spots from the flagship iPhone X coming out of China and the U.S. over the last month, the monster product cycle thesis out of Cupertino is delayed/elongated rather than gone in our opinion.""RELATED:Apple Stock Dips On Continuing Concerns Over iPhone X SalesApple HomePod Available Feb. 9 After Missing Holiday Season

160,NOV,"The Nasdaq composite paced a fourth straight weekly gain for the major equity indexes Friday as investors shrugged off a lower than expected initial print on U.S. GDP (up 2.6%, below the 2.9% Econoday forecast) and some concerns on the future of President Trump's ""America First"" trade policy.X Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) showed that it's still in deep hibernation mode. The popular Bitcoin-tracking closed end fund pulled below its key 10-week moving average for the second straight week after topping out at 3,522 last month.While Bitcoin Investment Trust saw very dull volume, shares still dropped 2.4% to 1,645 and lost nearly 7% for the week. The weak action is not surprising given that in December Bitcoin showed the same type of climax top action witnessed during the end of the dot-com boom in late 1999.The S&P 500 was not far behind the Nasdaq, racing almost 1.2% higher. The Dow Jones industrial average, which also counts Intel among its 30 components, rose nearly 0.9% as at least 11 of the 30 names gained 1 point or more. Volume edged slightly lower on the Nasdaq vs. Thursday and dipped on the NYSE, according to early data.The Russell 2000 rallied 0.4%. The popular small-cap gauge is up 4.7% since Jan. 1, trailing an 8.7% gain for the big and megacap tech-driven Nasdaq.A big post-earnings gain of nearly 11% for Intel (INTC) helped hoist the Nasdaq composite to a 1.3% gain on Friday, taking shares in the chipmaking giant on its second breakout attempt past a 47.40 buy point in a six-week cup. Notice how the cup base showed lopsided action, a flaw.However, the big gap up on Friday, paired with a 166% increase in volume vs. the prior 50 trading sessions, completely changed the complexion of the Santa Clara, Calif., tech firm.When the stock opened on Friday at 48.30, it traded less than 3% above the 47.40 buy point, and thus was in buy range. Don't chase a stock that has already advanced more than 5% past the proper entry point in a well-formed base.Intel posted a second quarter in a row of accelerating profit growth. Earnings in Q4 rose 37% to $1.08 a share, up from increases of 22% and 26% in the prior two quarters. Sales picked up 4% to $17.05 billion, boosted in part by hot demand for data center chips.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Intel sports an 84 Composite Rating, which combines all of IBD's key metrics on fundamentals, technical chart action, and growth of institutional sponsorship. While that's below the 90 minimum threshold you'd prefer for breakout candidates, Intel's 84 is not terrible. And due to big weekly gains, watch to see if that rating quickly improves.At the start of the year, Intel showed a 90 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, a 91 for EPS Rating, and an 87 for Relative Price Strength over the past 12 months.The Dow transports also joined the fairly broad advance, rising 1.1%. But at 11,125, the sector index still lost 1.6% for the week.The Dow utility average gained 0.4%, but the rate-sensitive index is still in an intermediate correction. At 699, the Dow utilities are still 10.2% below the Nov. 15 peak of 778. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond is at 2.66%, holding at the highest level since April 2014.The Federal Reserve holds its first meeting on interest rates next week, but CME Group fed funds futures show an expectation of no increase in the cost of money. But at the March 21 meeting, bond traders see a nearly 80% chance that the fed funds rate will rise by at least a quarter point to a target range of 1.5%-1.75%.RELATED:The Latest Inside Investor's CornerETF Leaders TodayFinding Excellent Stock Breakouts: A Peek Inside IBD 50

Going into Thursday's session, the bank sector was up 6.31% so far this year.Varian Medical Systems (VAR) rocketed 13% as it cleared a 114.19 buy point in a flat base. Varian reported quarterly earnings growth of 112% vs. estimates for an 86% increase.Spice and herbs provider McCormick (MKC) gapped up 5% in heavy volume. The stock rose above a 104.86 buy point. The company reported quarterly earnings rose 21%. The Street had expected earnings to rise 19.7%.First-time jobless claims rolled in at 233,000 vs. estimates for 240,000. The prior reading of 220,000 was revised to 216,000.New home sales in December came in at 625,000, below the lowest estimate in the range. The consensus view was for 680,000. The iShares U.S. Home Construction (ITB) exchange-traded fund dived 2.3%, its biggest daily percentage loss since Nov. 2.

164,NOV,"Stocks shook off morning weakness and were higher Thursday afternoon, sending the Dow Jones industrial average to a new high.X The Dow was up 0.6% to lead the main indexes. It benefited from 3M (MMM), which leapt nearly 3% to an all-time high after the company's earnings and sales topped views. Megacap 3M also raised its quarterly dividend and announced plans to increase investments this year.Another contributor to the Dow was Caterpillar (CAT), which reversed higher. The heavy-equipment maker breezed past sales and profit expectations. The stock also is near a record high. United Technologies (UTX), which reported earnings Wednesday, and Boeing (BA) also were outperforming.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite were up 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 was flat. Volume was lower compared with the same time Wednesday. Winners and losers were even on the Nasdaq but losers had a slight advantage on the NYSE despite the S&P 500's gain.There was no clear leadership in today's market. A mix of health care, cyclical and consumer stocks led, while transportation, homebuilding, some retail and semiconductor groups were lagging sharply.Shopify (SHOP) broke out past a 124.04 buy point in heavy volume. But the pattern is a risky late-stage base and it lacked a cohesive shape, making any purchase riskier. Shopify, which provides cloud-based platforms for online commerce, said today it will report Q4 results Feb. 15.One reason the Dow transportation average plunged 1.5% was airline stocks, which were weaker again after more earnings reports came out. Some of their charts continued to deteriorate.Alaska Air Group (ALK) gapped down to the lowest level since July 2016 but pared losses. The company reported Q4 adjusted earnings of 83 cents a share and sales of $1.96 billion, which met expectations. Alaska Air also said it's raising its quarterly dividend by 7% to 32 cents a share.American Airlines (AAL) beat profit estimates and gave strong earnings guidance. But higher fuel costs impacted results. The stock erased all gains from its 53.84 buy point but has not triggered sell signals.Southwest Airlines (LUV) tumbled below its 50-day moving average in heavy trading and erased all gains from its breakout at 59.99 Nov. 30. That triggers a round-trip sell signal. Southwest beat expectations, but cited higher labor and fuel costs.United Airlines (UAL) — which sparked a sell-off in the industry with a vow to raise capacity, match low-fare rivals and other strategic moves — fell 2% in intense volume.  The stock is forming a cup-with-handle base but it is faulty because the handle's depth exceeds 12%.RELATED:Dow Leader Caterpillar Just Steamrolled Estimates AgainAmerican Airlines Guides High, Tops Views; Southwest Beats, But Airline Stocks Keep FallingAmazon Price Target Raised On Expectations Of Strong Results

167,NOV,"U.S. companies expect their investment and hiring to grow at a slower pace in 2018, and only a small share say proposed tax legislation is driving their capital-spending decisions, according to a private survey.X The Institute for Supply Management's semi-annual forecast showed factory purchasing managers see capital spending rising 2.7% in 2018, slower than the 8.7% gain reported for this year. Their counterparts at service providers project investment growth of 3.8%, also weaker than this year's 7% advance. Less than half of respondents in both manufacturing and services said they'd raised wages to attract workers.The survey, conducted in November, suggests that the economy will get less of a boost from business investment next year after strong capital spending helped push the pace of growth above 3% in the past two quarters. The findings also raise questions about any impact from the proposed reduction in corporate taxes moving through Congress, even as the Trump administration and Republicans say it will result in a sustained increase in the rate of expansion.The Tempe, Arizona-based ISM also issues the separate monthly surveys with purchasing managers' indexes for manufacturing and service providers.Respondents to a special question in the semiannual poll showed companies were giving less importance to prospects for tax reform or an overhaul of regulations when it came to capital spending. When asked what was behind their investment plans for the next 12 months, about two-thirds in each group of manufacturers and service providers cited the general business outlook, while less than 6% attributed it to business tax reform.At a Nov. 14 speech to the Wall Street Journal CEO Council by Trump's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, the moderator asked business leaders in the audience for a show of hands if they planned to increase capital investment should the tax plan become law. Few people responded. ""Why aren't the other hands up?"" Cohn asked.Economic growth is expected to continue, according to the semi-annual survey. Purchasing managers in manufacturing anticipate sales will rise 5.1% next year, and service providers see revenue gains of 6%. That's in line with other recent reports indicating business sentiment remains elevated.Companies will continue to boost headcounts next year, though at a slower pace, the survey also showed. Manufacturing will see employment growth of 1.2% in 2018, following a 2.3% gain reported for this year since December 2016. Service businesses project a 1.5% increase in hiring after a 2.4% gain in 2017. Both groups predict labor and benefits costs will increase next year, with a 2.1% advance for manufacturing and 2.6% for services.When asked whether companies had raised wages to recruit new people, 53% of responses in the manufacturing panel said no, while 44% answered yes. Among service providers, 57% of respondents said they hadn't lifted worker pay when hiring, while 37% said they had, according to the survey.While factory purchasing managers forecast prices will rise 1.8% in 2018 on average and service businesses expect price growth of 2.2%, both groups anticipate their profit margins will expand next year.

The futures contract, which expires in January, soared 20% to $18,550 in late-afternoon trade. The cryptocurrency's price was recently near $17,200, according to CoinDesk. While the futures launch was seen as a move toward Bitcoin's legitimacy, it could have a ""material negative impact"" on the digital currency's price as investors potentially move to futures and out of Bitcoin, Munster said in a research note.Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) surged more than 12%.Sector rotation is underway as stock market leadership has shifted from high tech to builders and financials over the past few months.The top sector fund, iShares US Home Construction (ITB), gained 25.5% during the three months through Dec. 5. It's one of two funds on the accompanying chart that's been a steady performer this year. On a year-to-date basis, the ETF is up 55.4%, according to Morningstar Direct.ITB, which tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index, has attracted $2.4 billion in assets. The 11-year-old fund is trading at its highest levels in more than a decade and is well extended from its last buy point. Its top holdings include D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN) and NVR (NVR).The other YTD outperformer is VanEck Vectors Rare Earth/Strategic Metals (REMX), with a 61.7% YTD return as of Dec. 5. It came in fourth based on a three-month return of 17.2%. Shares slipped below the 50-day moving average, but could set up a buy opportunity on a solid move above the line. REMX broke out from a cup base in late July and rallied 39% to its Nov. 29 intraday high.SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) came in second with a three-month return of 17.4%. It has been under pressure much of the year — it's down 13.4% YTD. Shares have found support along the 50-day line the past three months but are still 21% off their 52-week high.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Bank stocks have made a nice comeback as traders expect interest rates to rise. SPDR S&P Bank (KBE), up 17.2% over the past three months, is in buy range after clearing a 47.09 entry of a long, shallow consolidation. KBE placed third on the list, while SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE), was fifth with a 16.9% three-month gain. KRE is trading near a 59.78 buy point, also of a lengthy shallow consolidation.First Trust Nasdaq Bank (FTXO), No. 6 with a 16.6% return, is in a buy zone from a 28.59 buy point of a similar consolidation.Friday's pick, First Trust Dorsey Wright Focus 5 (FV), remains in buy range from a bounce off its 50-day line.RELATED:Microsoft Takes Lead On Dow; Why Is Bitcoin Back Down To $15K?Facebook, Tech Stocks Lead Market; Bitcoin Keeps Up Torrid PaceFANG Stocks Lead Tech Recovery; Bitcoin Takes Out $12K And $13K

169,NOV,"When Fidelity Investments needed a new manager of $17.4 billion OTC Fund (FOCPX) in September, it didn't need to look far. The Boston-based mutual fund behemoth tapped its own Sonu Kalra. Kalra was the manager of Fidelity's market-beating $23.3 billion Blue Chip Growth (FBGRX).X With help from leading stocks like Alibaba Group (BABA), PayPal (PYPL) and Five Below (FIVE), Blue Chip Growth gained 34.93% this year through Nov. 30, outperforming 91% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct as well as the S&P 500's 20.49%.He was also the manager from early 2005 through mid-2009 of OTC. Now he remains helmsman of Blue Chip Growth and lead manager of OTC.Kalra is on track to guide both funds to IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner status. As of Dec. 1, both funds had outperformed in all four time periods — year-to-date and trailing 3-, 5- and 10 years — needed to join the elite club, if they maintain those outperformances through year end.In a talk with IBD from his office in Boston, 46-year-old Kalra discussed his investment strategy, his early mentors at Fidelity, why shareholders should not fear that he is stretched too thin by adding OTC to his workload, and more.IBD: You nearly doubled your assets under management by taking on OTC Fund. How do you know you can handle two funds that large?Kalra: I have gotten that question a few times. There are a couple of reasons why I'm not spread too thin. The biggest reason is that I have a co-manager on OTC, Christopher Lin. He was an integral part of the growth team here, a research analyst in the tech sector.List Of Mutual Fund Six Month LeadersBest Performing Mutual Fund CategoriesSome Mutual Funds Get A Boost From Value Stock TiltWhich Stocks Are The Top Fund Managers Buying?Bond Fund Decline In November: Turning Of The Tide?So he covered some of the larger growth stocks in the technology sector, companies like Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN). And those companies have been key contributors to strong performance by both OTC and Blue Chip Growth funds. For him to come on as co-manager makes it possible for us to manage and for me to not be stretched too thin.Another reason is that I ran OTC before, so I'm familiar with this product. And overall, 80% of the assets in OTC I owned in Blue Chip Growth.IBD: Are the funds run the same way?Kalra: There is a lot of overlap in the portfolios. But the nature of the funds differ (at the individual stock level). Their risk profiles are different. There are similar names but different weightings. They are both growth funds. But their mandates differ.Blue Chip Growth is more of a large-cap Steady Eddie growth fund, whereas OTC is more aggressive and has more smaller names as well as some younger, faster growing companies. Blue Chip Growth is benchmarked to the Russell 1000 Growth. OTC is benchmarked to the Nasdaq (Composite). That's why OTC has a larger tech component, given the Nasdaq's larger tech component.IBD: Summarize your overall investment approach for these two funds, Sonu.Kalra: I'm trying to find companies where the market is not only mispricing the absolute rate of growth but also the sustainability of that growth. We think of ourselves as long-term investors, trying to take advantage of the market's myopic short-term focus.IBD: Do you think of all growth stocks as the same?Kalra: I try to look at three buckets. One is the business model, how a company makes money. What's the company's potential to generate free cash flow? At the end of the day, the value of a company is all of its future cash flow discounted backward. Some companies get mispriced by some investors misunderstanding its potential to generate free cash flow in the future.Second, I pay attention to whether a company's incremental business opportunities are going to be better than they are today or are they deteriorating?Last, I focus on revenue growth. It's a number you can't make up. I'm really trying to find companies that can grow regardless of what's happening in the economy.IBD: As of your latest disclosure, tell me why you hold Alibaba in both funds.Kalra: I've owned it in Blue Chip Growth for some time. I introduced it to OTC in September when I took over. They are leaders in China of e-commerce, and e-commerce is growing there. About 15% to 20% of overall retail sales happen in China online. That's higher than in the U.S. because retail infrastructure is not as developed in China. So they don't have to compete with entrenched bricks-and-mortar competitors there.IBD'S TAKE: Alibaba has agreed to let Netflix (NFLX) globally distribute a popular detective drama series owned by Youku, which is owned by Alibaba.IBD: Why have you built your Blue Chip share count in PayPal?Kalra: The investment thesis is about the online growth of e-commerce. They provide the payment mechanism that makes it easy to purchase online. Their hidden gem is Venmo, a peer-to-peer payment mechanism. It lets people share payments with a social twist that's appealing to millennials. If they go out together for dinner with friends, they Venmo each other. It's almost become a verb. Eventually PayPal will begin to monetize it, but now they're piggybacking on the growth of online commerce. My guess is we're still a few years away before Venmo makes a material impact on the parent company from monetization.IBD: Five Below is another name you've been building. Is their secret sauce the fact that they sell products for $5 or less to a teen audience?Kalra: You hit the nail on the head. Brick-and-mortar stores have difficulties. What does work is when you have a great value proposition. That enables companies to drive traffic into stores. Having a price point of $5 says it all. They have iPhone cases, power cords, chargers. They are a beneficiary of the spinner (fad) inside schools.But there's more to their story. They have a fast supply chain. They can spot trends quickly and come to market fast and provide unbelievable value to consumers.They have a differentiated store model and also a store rollout that is growing their square footage more than 10% a year. So that shows healthy top- and bottom-line growth.IBD: Do you like the way Facebook is developing new platforms?Kalra: I started as a media analyst at Fidelity. One of the first things I learned was that advertising dollars follow eyeballs. Facebook has been a key contributor to and beneficiary of the change over the past five to 10 years in how people spend time across various media.Facebook is a core platform, but they also have Instagram and WhatsApp. Those have audiences spending more time on their applications, driving up ad dollars.IBD: OTC also has stocks that are not household names, like Atlassian (TEAM). What's your thesis?Kalra: They provide project management and collaboration software — software as a service. They went public in late 2015. Their software lets teams work on projects. They can seamlessly collaborate inside an organization. They're showing strong revenue growth, in excess of 30% a year for the past two years. They're in an underpenetrated market, and they are one of the leaders.IBD: What made you introduce Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) to OTC fairly recently?Kalra: They use technology to change the way surgery is done. Their system enables doctors to do surgery through robots. The outcomes are better. Fewer injuries. Safer. More cost-efficient for hospitals as well. It's a win-win for everyone, hospitals and patients.IBD: Which Fidelity managers have been your mentors?Kalra: I feel fortunate to be at an organization with a history of great investors and to be able to learn from them, watch how they work.Will Danoff (who runs giant $124.6 billion Fidelity Contra (FCNTX) and $28.1 billion Advisor New Insights (FNIAX)) and Steve Wymer (manager of $41.7 billion Fidelity Growth Company (FDGRX)) have been wonderful mentors. I've watched their work ethic, their ability to identify great growth companies early and stick with them for the long-term.I've worked closely with Steve Wymer. We've been on the same growth team here. We've traveled together, visiting companies, attending trade shows. Same with Danoff — we've been part of the same team.I was a tech analyst starting in 1998. For six years I was part of the research team focused on tech, so I supported guys like (Robert) Stansky (who ran Fidelity Growth Company and now-$16.9 billion Magellan Fund (FMAGX) from 1996 to 2005), Danoff and Wymer. So I've worked with some high profile managers here at Fidelity, identifying great companies.RELATED:Where To Find Income Without Taking Big Risks

170,NOV,"In the wake of a solid month for the broad market and U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, some fund managers are tilting toward value-oriented stocks.X Having lagged growth stocks, value stock valuations are increasingly attractive, says Tom Galvin, lead manager of $4.1 billion Columbia Select Large Cap Growth (ELGAX). Yet their prospects are bright as the U.S. and key foreign economies continue to grow, Galvin added.In November, the broad market got a lift from such Dow Jones Industrial stocks as Boeing (BA), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Walt Disney (DIS) and Home Depot (HD).With the S&P 500 climbing 3.07% last month, the broad stock market made it 13 straight month of gains, according to Lipper Inc. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds rode along, advancing 2.62% on average, their 15th monthly gain in the past 16 months and third positive month in a row. That lifted their year-to-date gain to 17.40%.Both the S&P 500 and Dow hit all-time highs to that point on Nov. 30.List Of Mutual Fund Six Month LeadersBest Performing Mutual Fund CategoriesWhy Fidelity Gave This Mutual Fund Manager More Money To InvestWhich Stocks Are The Top Fund Managers Buying?Bond Fund Decline In November: Turning Of The Tide?The November gain by U.S. diversified stock funds was due largely to ongoing global economic growth, generally better-than-expected corporate profits, benign inflation and heightened prospects for U.S. tax reform with a lowering of the corporate tax rate, said Galvin, whose fund finished among the top 16% in large-cap growth fund performance last month.Wall Street's approval of reforms that lighten corporate regulatory burdens also boosted the stock market last month, said John Rogers, chairman, CEO and chief investment officer of Ariel Investments and lead manager of flagship $2.2 billion Ariel Fund (ARGFX).But market leadership is poised to shift to value-oriented categories of stocks and mutual funds in the coming months, away from growth-oriented ones, added Rogers, whose fund's 7.01% return last month topped 98% of its midcap value rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct.That tilt toward value already seemed underway in November. With a 3.27% gain on average, midcap value funds led all U.S. diversified stock fund categories. Small- to midsize companies tend to derive a larger portion of their revenue and earnings from the U.S., so they're likely to benefit more than large-cap companies from tax reform. ""There was a rotation into smaller stocks and value stocks as the prospect for successful passage of tax reform grew,"" Galvin said.That tax-reform tilt was also why U.S. diversified stock funds outpaced world stock funds, which averaged just a 1.03% gain last month. Japanese funds, averaging a 2.95% advance, led foreign stock funds.Industrials funds averaged a 3.10% gain in November, leading all major sector categories. They were driven by the rotation into value-oriented stocks.U.S. taxable bond funds were slightly above break even on average in November. U.S. Treasury funds led other categories, averaging a 0.08% gain. World income funds averaged a 0.54% gain. Muni bond funds lost ground overall last month.While GDP growth, corporate profits, tax reform and regulatory reform should benefit all corporations, longtime outperformance by growth stocks has left value stocks more attractively valued, Rogers said.The Russell 2500 Value index was trading at 18 times next year's earnings as of the first week of December. In contrast, the Russell 2500 Growth index was trading at a lofty 32 times. ""It's one of the biggest gaps I've seen in my career between value and growth,"" Rogers said. ""And there will be an inevitable reversion to the mean when things go too far.""In addition, the Federal Reserve's widely expected tax hikes should boost margins for banks, which generally are categorized as value stocks, Rogers said.Already, his firm's researchers are getting bullish input from industrial companies. ""A lot are describing recoveries and business momentum building,"" Rogers said.Further, Amazon's (AMZN) widespread competitive influence is helping to keep retail prices low, which is preventing inflationary pressure from growing, he said.In at least the near term, one area in which he expects to see many investment opportunities is among industrials, what he calls light cyclicals and manufacturers. In that group, he holds Kennametal (KMT). ""It's a favorite,"" he said. ""They make cutting tools and cutting blades that are used for everything from coal mines to rebuilding highways and infrastructure. They should be a prime beneficiary whenever we get an infrastructure (spending) bill through Congress.""Going forward, financial services should also outperform, ""especially money managers and private equity funds that are public,"" he said, adding, ""They're cheap because they're not in popular indexes.""Among those, he cites KKR (KKR). ""They are a large private equity firm run by Henry Kravis,"" he said. ""They're cheap and private equity is one of the best performing asset classes.""Rogers also owns Lazard (LAZ). ""They're an investment banking franchise,"" he said. ""They have money management and mutual fund subsidiaries that focus on emerging markets and international investing.""He also likes the beleaguered media space. Many investors are afraid that cable companies are suffering subscriber attrition, which creates downward pressure on fees to content providers. Rogers nevertheless like MSG Networks (MSGN). The New York City-area sports network broadcasts games for nine sports teams including the professional basketball Knicks. ""The fear has been overdone,"" Rogers said. ""Live sports, whether seen on smartphones, computers or TV, one way or another that content will be viewed and monetized.""Health care is his fourth-largest sector. He prefers systems and instruments maker Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO) and clinical testing services provider Laboratory Corp. of America (LH). ""We're not involved in the riskier, more complicated parts of health care,"" he said.Growth-oriented fund managers still see opportunities on their side of the market ledger.""In the consumer space, where we're overweighted, Costco (COST) continues to demonstrate very strong traffic gains and sales growth,"" Galvin said. ""Roughly one-third of their customers are small-to-medium size businesses, which could benefit from tax reform.""Galvin also likes apparel maker Nike (NKE) and coffee-shop chain Starbucks (SBUX). After lagging in 2017, both ""could be potential winners in 2018,"" Galvin said. ""Each has issues, but each could benefit from accelerating GDP growth, helped by fiscal stimulus, stronger consumer confidence fueled by lower consumer tax rates and better jobs growth.""In health care, the CVS Health (CVS) takeover of Aetna (AET) could signal that ""more consolidation is forthcoming,"" Galvin said. Also, a looser regulatory environment and tax reform that motivates companies to repatriate profits held outside the U.S. could increase the attractiveness of more health care companies.And new opportunities could emerge in the tech sector if tax reform and corporate profit escalation encourage more companies to spend on technology. ""For example, Salesforce.com (CRM): it was the fastest company to get to $10 billion in revenues, and it's likely to be the fastest to double revenues within five years as they continue to go broader and deeper in (finding customers among) Fortune 1000 companies at home and abroad,"" Galvin said. ""Salesforce is already by far the market leader in cloud dominance.""The firm's cloud software helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships.And take $1.5 billion Champlain Small Company Fund (CIPSX) — an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner in the growth, small-cap and diversified equities categories. The growth-oriented fund owned Innospec (IOSP) as of July 31, a specialty chemicals firm that has a 92 Composite Rating from IBD and an A SMR Rating. Earnings per share rose 8%, 13% and 28% the past three quarters.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Composite Rating is scored on a scale of 1 to 99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher. Innospec's SMR Rating means it's in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.RELATED:Looking For Winning Stocks?

175,NOV,"Being in phase with the market is a critical component for successful swing trades. This market hasn't made it easy. Sir Isaac Newton and his laws of motion offer an answer as to why.For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, according to Newton's third law. Apply that to stocks and you can see that corrections in prices hold opportunities. Smaller corrections often see smaller bounces back, while steeper corrections tend to precede powerful moves to the upside.Looking at the Nasdaq composite in the last three months is a microcosm into how the year has played out. The index has only crossed below the 50-day a handful of times the whole year and the rallies seem to be quick and short-lived. The last cross below the 50-day for the index was on Sept. 25 after correcting just over 2% (1). Over the next three weeks the index gained over 4% (2).The next drop was only over the span of a week and wasn't even 2% off the high on Oct. 25 (3). The index spent a few days below its 10-day moving average line but never threatened its 50-day line. Another gain just over 4% ensued in the next two weeks (4). A duplicate of that action happened right after that. Less than a 2% correction at the low of Nov. 15 (5) and then a two-week rally of nearly 4% (6).In that latest run, we steadily increased the number of stocks on IBD's SwingTrader to five positions, the most this year. Profit locking and stringent loss cutting put us back down to only three positions one day off the top (6) and two of those were only half positions due to profit taking. The most recent low (7) on Dec. 6 settled at another drop around 2% off the high.So where do we stand now? The index is trying to rally again, but so far it isn't as strong. That's kept the current market action for SwingTrader in a sideways trend.In the scheme of things, these drops are minor and barely blips on a longer-term chart. But the short-term nature of swing trading amplifies their importance. With rallies only lasting a couple of weeks before rolling over, profits not booked swiftly are generally lost. Also with daily moves to the upside remaining small, one sharp move to the downside can wipe out a lot of progress — a point made abundantly clear after an erroneous news report regarding the Special Counsel investigation into Russian interference of the 2016 election unsettled markets.If you have more cushion from a longer-term trade, you have a chance to weather the storm. Barring that, taking profits quickly when entering positions from a shallow correction recognizes the likelihood of a limited rally. The laws of physics are hard to escape.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:How To Navigate A Sideways MarketTo Swing Or Not To Swing: Market Trend Answers The QuestionSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

176,NOV,"It's not often when a bank becomes a winning stock, but Texas Capital Bancorp (TCBI) taught that investors must keep an open mind with any fast-growing company, regardless of background.X In late 2011, the Dallas-based regional bank — one of Leaderboard's early successes — defied the typical profile of a low-margin, slow-growth institution. The bank's earnings were improving swiftly, from a 2010 profit of $1 a share to $1.98 in 2012.The banking sector was still emerging from the catastrophic 2008 financial crisis, and regional banks were moving up in the industry rankings.The stock was added on Dec. 1, 2011, just as shares were clearing a cup with handle with a 29.08 buy point (1). Its Composite Rating was a solid 95 on that date. Volume rose 33% above its average and 44% the day after the breakout. The relative strength line made a new high at the same time the stock did, another reassuring sign.As it often happens with breakouts, shares dipped below the entry just a few days later. But the drop was modest, and the 50-day moving average halted the decline. Soon Texas Capital was back on its uptrend.And what an uptrend it was! Once the hiccup passed, the stock sailed higher with hardly an interruption. All the while, shares traded comfortably above the 50-day moving average. By March 2012, Texas Capital's advance reached 20%, a gain good enough for profit-taking.In April 2012, Texas Capital dipped below the 50-day moving average for the first time in its run (2). It seemed like a harmless pullback, short on heavy volume or big price losses.But there was a larger risk at play: The stock market was rolling over. The Nasdaq peaked at the end of March, and started a correction that eventually cost the composite 13%. Texas Capital was sent to the Cut List on April 9, 2012, with a profit of 20% on Leaderboard's ledger.During the market correction, the stock fell 11% before it climbed back above the 50-day line in a few weeks. That resilience impressed Leaderboard editors, who put Texas Capital right back on Leaderboard June 5 (3). That's another lesson from this stock: that secondary buy areas can be rewarding with leading stocks.The encore was even more impressive than the initial run. Shares continued to rise above the 50-day line for months. On Nov. 15 (4), Texas Capital made its final exit from Leaderboard, after it made a serious break of the 50-day line. The second act of Texas Capital's advance netted a 14% additional profit.RELATED:58.com Showed How A Damaged Stock Can Fix Itself And Be A WinnerHolding Alibaba Was Easy; Buying It Was Tricky

CVS Health (CVS) is buying Aetna (AET) with Amazon (AMZN) a threat while Broadcom (AVGO) is going hostile with its Qualcomm (QCOM) bid.X Home Depot (HD) and Bank of America (BAC) led several big companies announcing new stock buybacks. First Solar (FSLR) led the hot solar group sharply higher.The S&P 500 and Dow lost 0.4% while the Nasdaq pared its weekly loss to 0.1%. Techs sought to reassert their leadership late in the week, with FANG stocks doing well and solar plays surging. But many chipmakers and Chinese internets remain damaged.CVS Health (CVS), a major drugstore and pharmacy benefits manager, will pay $69 billion for the No. 3 U.S. health insurer, forging a new giant with the aim of providing insurance, low-cost clinics and low-cost prescription drugs. UnitedHealth (UNH) already has a PBM. Meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN) reportedly is mulling an entry into the prescription drug business. CVS will pay $145 cash plus 0.8378 share for each share of Aetna. At Friday's close that was equal to $206.23 a share. Aetna rose 0.8% to just 182.73. Investors are worried about whether the deal will win regulatory OK. CVS fell 2.7%UnitedHealth (UNH) will buy the medical unit of dialysis center DaVita (DVA) for $4.9 billion cash, the insurer's fourth notable takeover deal this year. UnitedHealth slid 1.7%, DaVita soared 10.8%.That was more than the 190,000 expected, while the unemployment rate held at a 17-year low of 4.1%.

United Airlines (UAL) also raised its unit revenue outlook and announced a $3 billion buyback. Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (HA) also hiked its fourth-quarter unit revenue forecast, possibly helped by the recent bankruptcy filing of rival Island Air. But Hawaiian's shares slid after the carrier indicated stronger pricing competition was on the horizon in the first quarter of 2018.Broadcom (AVGO) turned its unsolicited bid for fellow wireless chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) into a hostile takeover attempt by announcing a slate of candidates it hopes will replace Qualcomm's 11-member board of directors. It expects to put its board nominees to a vote by Qualcomm shareholders at the company's annual meeting, set for March 6.

179,NOV,"Some of the world's biggest derivatives brokerages criticized plans by U.S. exchanges to offer bitcoin futures and options, saying the contracts have been rushed to market without proper consideration of the risks.The brokerages, who laid out their concerns in an open letter via the Futures Industry Association on Wednesday, said exchanges failed to get enough feedback from market participants on margin levels, trading limits, stress tests and clearing. Highlighting bitcoin's elevated volatility and reliance on unregulated venues for pricing, the brokerages also questioned whether exchanges had the tools to prevent market manipulation.Misgivings among the FIA's members, who include Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), underscore the controversy surrounding bitcoin as it moves from the fringes of finance toward the mainstream. CME Group (CME) and Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) both used an expedited self-certification process to approve the listing of bitcoin futures, hoping to tap investor demand after the cryptocurrency's more than 1,400% rally this year.""A more thorough and considered process would have allowed for a robust public discussion among clearing member firms, exchanges and clearinghouses,"" the FIA said in its letter, which was addressed to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and signed by FIA Chief Executive Officer Walt Lukken.IBD'S TAKE: Are Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies real investments or a speculator's game? Individual investors should be extremely cautious about diving into this new area. Read this feature about Bitcoin risks and possible gains first.  While the letter is unlikely to change the exchanges' plans, it raises questions about how many brokerages will participate once bitcoin derivatives start trading later this month. Some dealers, particularly the so-called clearing members required to stand behind client trades, are concerned about their exposure if the cryptocurrency's extreme volatility leads to trader defaults. There should have been a public discussion about whether a separate guarantee fund — used to limit the impact of defaults — was warranted for the new contracts, the FIA said.The exchanges were allowed to offer bitcoin products after pledging to regulators that they comply with the law. Cboe will start trading futures on Dec. 10, while CME's contracts are set to debut on Dec. 18. The products will be subject to CFTC oversight.Bitcoin, which surged past $17,000 for the first time on Thursday before retreating Friday, has received mixed reviews on Wall Street. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has called the cryptocurrency ""a fraud,"" while Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, said recently that it's too early for his bank to need a bitcoin strategy. Franklin Templeton's Mark Mobius called it a bubble, but added that ""bubbles can last a long time."" Some hedge funds are waiting for futures to bet against it, more than half a dozen people trading the assets told Bloomberg News.The FIA said its members have reservations about the reliability of prices underlying the bitcoin contracts. Some of the venues on which the cryptocurrency trades have suffered hacks and breakdowns. Bitcoin plunged nearly 20% in less than 90 minutes on Nov. 29 after reports of intermittent outages at cryptocurrency exchanges struggling to keep up with user interest.Bitcoin is ""a commodity unlike any the commission has dealt with in the past,"" CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo said in a Dec. 1 statement. ""We expect that the futures exchanges, through information sharing agreements, will be monitoring the trading activity on the relevant cash platform.""CFTC spokeswoman Erica Elliott Richardson said that Giancarlo has been ""clear that market participants should take note that the relatively nascent underlying cash markets and exchanges for bitcoin remain largely unregulated markets over which the CFTC has limited statutory authority, and that investors should be aware of the potentially high level of volatility and risk in trading these contracts.""Some brokerages are skeptical.""We remain apprehensive with the lack of transparency and regulation of the underlying reference products on which these futures contracts are based and whether exchanges have the proper oversight to ensure the reference products are not susceptible to manipulation, fraud, and operational risk,"" the FIA said in its letter.RELATED:How To Decide If Bitcoin Is Safe For You To TradeBitcoin Tumbles From Frenzied Run; JPMorgan's Dimon Still 'Highly Skeptical'This Is When You Can Start Trading Bitcoin FuturesBitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And Trends

A solid advance from here, or at a subsequent bounce off the 50-day, could offer a fresh chance to buy shares. The ETF rallied 12% from a late-September rebound off its 50-day to its Nov. 28 intraday high.XLK was last featured in the June 13 ETF column as it found support at its 50-day line.

It tracks the Technology Select Sector Index, which provides exposure to the technology and telecom sectors of the S&P 500 index.Software made up the biggest weighting as of Dec. 4, at about 20% of assets. Internet software and service contributed 18%; technology hardware, storage and peripherals 17%; IT services 16%; and semiconductors and semiconductor equipment 15%. Smaller positions in telecom-related stocks and electronic-parts makers made up the rest.Apple was the fund's top holding, with a 15% weighting. Microsoft followed at 11% and Facebook at 7%. Apple is trading around 3% off its Nov. 8 high, but remains extended from a 160.97 cup-with-handle buy point cleared in late October.

Its average annual returns over the past three, five and 15 years are 16.1%, 18.7% and 10.9%, respectively. The S&P 500 has returned 10.7%, 15.8% and 9.5% for those same periods.The ETF carries a 0.14% expense ratio.Tuesday's pick, Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP), is still building the right side of a cup base with a 57.46 potential buy point.RELATED:Nasdaq Reverses As Nvidia, Chips Pare Gains; Bitcoin Eyes $12KDisney, Banks Rally, But Nvidia Sinks; Ready For Bitcoin Futures?Stocks Fall On Flynn's Russia Plea Deal, But Bitcoin Rebounds

181,NOV,"Futures for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 rose solidly Thursday morning after the Nasdaq composite slumped Wednesday on Apple (AAPL) and weakness in chips  fueled by Texas Instruments (TXN).Late Wednesday, chip-equipment giant Lam Research (LRCX) and chipmaker Xilinx (XLNX) reported blowout earnings and bullish guidance, sending the stocks near or into buy zones overnight. But chip-gear maker Teradyne (TER) tumbled on guidance that fell short of estimates.X S&P 500 index futures and Dow futures climbed nearly 0.3% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.45%.Apple shares fell 1.6% to 174.22 in Wednesday's stock market trading, dropping back below a 175.34 flat-base buy point. The stock did find support at its 50-day moving average, as it has since the last days of 2017. But volume was the highest since Nov. 3 and was the heaviest trade in a down session since September.Meanwhile, the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, fell yet again. (The RS line is the blue line in the charts below.) Already at consolidation lows, Apple's RS line is now approaching longer-term levels. Apple's stock hasn't made much headway vs. the S&P 500 for several months.Apple shares rose a fraction in early Thursday trading.A growing number of Apple analysts are warning of weak iPhone demand. Perhaps the bad news is being priced, or overpriced, into the stock ahead of earnings next week.Lam Research earned $4.34 a share in its fiscal second quarter excluding various items including a tax-related charge, up 94% vs. a year earlier and well above views for $3.69 according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue rose 37% to $2.58 billion, just above analyst forecasts for $2.57 billion.For fiscal Q3 ending in April, Lam Research expects EPS of $4.20-$4.50 and revenue of $2.73 billion to $2.98 billion. Wall Street was looking for EPS of $3.81 and revenue of $2.66 billion.Lam Research shares rose 4.7% to 219.50 in early Thursday trading after falling 2.5% to 209.73 on Wednesday. The stock had rallied in the prior six sessions.Lam's after-hours action suggests the stock could test its 219.80 cup-base buy point. Lam's RS line remains off its highs near the left side of the consolidation. But the RS line has made some progress, clearing some short-term highs.Lam's results follow strong earnings and a bullish outlook from ASML Holding (ASML) last week, as well as strong preliminary revenue figures and sales guidance from Ichor Holdings (ICHR) and Electro Scientific (ESIO).KLA-Tencor (KLAC), which is at the edge of a buy zone, reports earnings Thursday.Xilinx earned 76 cents a share excluding various items and a tax-related charge, up 46% vs. a year earlier. That was the best gain in four years and easily beat fiscal third-quarter views for 63 cents. Revenue rose 8% to $631.2 million vs. views for $630 million. That's just OK, but is the best top-line growth in five quarters.For the current quarter, Xilinx sees revenue of $635 million to $665 million. That $650 million midpoint is above Wall Street forecasts and would be a 6.7% yearly gain.Xilinx rose 4.8% to 78 in premarket trading, suggesting a move back above a 75.24 buy point. Xilinx fell out of buy range on Wednesday, losing 2.7% to 73.48.The RS line is definitely a concern. It's well below the consolidation's high and hasn't made headway for the past year. A powerful price move Thursday could push the RS line over short-term levels.Teradyne earned 46 cents a share in its fourth quarter on sales of $479 million vs. views for 34 cents and $438 million, respectively. The chip-equipment maker also hiked its quarterly dividend by 29% to 9 cents a share.But Teradyne gave EPS and revenue guidance that, at the midpoint, is below the consensus.Teradyne shares fell 5.7% to 44.99 in late trading but were not yet active early Thursday. The stock had closed down 3.4% to 46.79, moving back into buy range from a 44.72 entry.Extended trading doesn't always carry over to the next regular session, but Teradyne looks set to test its buy point.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: What The Market's Wild Day Tells UsThese 5 Stocks Are Racing To Buys From The Hottest Group Right NowIs This Hot Chip Name Ready To Break Out From Early-Stage Base?Apple Sits As Bulls Run; Another OLED Play Falls Below Buy PointIs This IPO With 322% Growth Following In Facebook's Footsteps?These Are The Top 20 Stocks That Millennials Own, Says Robinhood

TAL Education reports on Thursday.Rise Education (REDU), which offers English language training services on a K-12 level, slid 1.5% to 16.06. The stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a 15.76 buy point on Friday. Rise Education came public at 14.50 a share in October, hitting 17.86 in its Oct. 20 trading debut before hitting a record-low 9.50 on Nov. 21.Tarena International (TEDU) fell 2.7%.New Oriental Education's results come as China's private-education programs become a bigger, more competitive business — thanks to a growing population of primary-school-age students and rising disposable income in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Nomura-Instinet analyst Andrew Orchard wrote in October that a big summer-season course promotion dented margins more than expected, but that the rest of the year looked solid.Separately, Sunlands.com, a Beijing-based education firm backed by New Oriental, is planning a U.S. IPO, Bloomberg reported, citing sources.

184,NOV,"LAS VEGAS — There are two types of buyers of smart home devices: those with the technical know-how and time to set up such connected gadgets and those who'd rather pay someone else to do it.Control4 (CTRL) plays in the latter camp. It is a leading provider of home automation and control systems. It sells its systems through a network of 5,500 authorized professional installers. It provides a platform for controlling music, video, lighting, temperature, security and other systems.The smart home was one of the big themes at CES 2018 with companies showing off everything from connected door locks and security cameras to home entertainment systems and smart toilets. The four-day CES technology trade show ended Friday.""Everything is becoming smart and we're uniquely positioned to be able to orchestrate all of those devices that are coming into the home,"" Control4 Chief Financial Officer Mark Novakovich told Investor's Business Daily. ""What we're not is a $300 DIY (do-it-yourself) solution. We think of our products more as infrastructure for the home, things that people put into their houses and expect to last.""Control4's business can be broken down into four customer segments: luxury, premium, value and basic, he said.Luxury projects cost $25,000 and above and make up 13% of the projects Control4 does, Novakovich said.Premium projects cost $10,000 to $25,000 and account for about 33% of Control4's projects.Value projects cost less than $10,000 and account for 26% or 27% of the company's projects, he said.The rest of the projects are customers that want to buy remote control hub from an installer. The platform costs $800 and is a building block to getting into home automation, Novakovich said.Control4 is proud of the fact that it helped develop and broaden the smart home market by making simpler tools for home automation, he said.CES 2018: See The Latest Technology Trends & Top Tech StocksControl4's goals for the year are to continue to grow at a steady pace and look for strategic acquisitions, Novakovich said.""Our financial strategy has been pretty consistent over the last two years and probably remains the same into next year,"" he said. ""We've seen organic growth in the 10% to 11% range and we think that's sustainable … Then we work to outperform that.""Salt Lake City, Utah-based Control4 also needs to stay innovative and develop new products and systems to sell through its dealer network, he said.""Because we're profitable and have a strong balance sheet and have cash in the bank, we're in the position to be acquisitive,"" Novakovich said. ""We'll look for acquisitions that allow us to leverage our channel, acquisitions that strengthen our solutions stories and grow in an inorganic way.""On Jan. 3, Control4 announced the acquisition of Austin, Texas-based Ihiji, a provider of remote management services for integrators serving connected home customers.Last February, it bought Triad Speakers, a maker of advanced audio technology with customizable speaker systems.Control4 stock is in a seven-week consolidation period after hitting a record high of 35.99 on Nov. 27. It ended the day Friday down 1.2% to 30.50. Control4 is ranked No. 14 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.RELATED:Netgear Stock Jumps On Strong CES 2018 ShowingRoomba Maker iRobot Wants To Map Homes For Connected Devices

186,NOV,"Stocks staged another broad advance in afternoon trading and the major indexes are set to cap another strong week with decent gains.X Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) showed mettle, rebounding more than 12% and avoiding a potential collision course with its rapidly rising 50-day moving average. Volume is light, however, leaving the strength of the rebound somewhat suspect. The average daily volume over the past 50 sessions continues to rise, now at 139,000 shares.The Bitcoin-tracking ETF slid hard four days in a row amid strength in equities across the globe, a sell-off in U.S. Treasury bonds, and reports that the South Korean government is considering a ban in cryptocurrency trading. But on Friday, authorities appeared to tone down the strong rhetoric.At 2:30 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average, led by gains of 2 points or more by at least five of its 30 components, kept gains of more than 0.7%. At 25,776, the blue chip index was poised to rise nearly 1.9% for the week, on top of the prior week's 2.3% surge.Dow Jones industrial stock JPMorgan Chase (JPM) padded its recent advance, rising 1% to 112 in heavy turnover following another quarter of steady top- and bottom-line growth.JPMorgan is now up 17% since surpassing a 95.32 buy point in a base on base on Sept. 21, initially in dull volume. Strong turnover showed up over the next few weeks.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rose around 0.6%. The S&P SmallCap 600 lagged a tad, up 0.3%. Volume is running virtually flat vs. the same time Thursday on both exchanges. Defensive stocks such as dairy, grains, meat, candy and water utilities declined.Breadth continues to improve with advancing stocks exceeding decliners by a 9-to-5 ratio on the Nasdaq. On the NYSE, winners edged losers by around 100 issues.JPMorgan posted an 8% gain in revenue to $38.12 billion, matching the 8%-9% gains seen in the prior three quarters. Adjusted earnings rose 3% to $1.62 a share, according to William O'Neil + Co., missing the consensus view by 7 cents. Net margin fell 220 basis points vs. a year ago to 21.8%.Yet despite the year-over-year drop in after-tax margin, the Wall Street, commercial and consumer banking titan gave numerous signs that the economy is poised to continue growing. Average core loans rose 6% companywide vs. a year ago. In the Consumer & Community Banking unit, net revenue jumped 9.5% to $12.07 billion, leading to an 11.4% rise in net income to $2.63 billion.Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment is making its second test of the 10-week moving average (as seen on a weekly chart) since its Nov. 22 breakout from a deep cup with handle at 985.10. The first and second pullbacks to the 10-week line offer a good chance to either establish a new position or add shares to a winning primary position.The bounce off the 10-week line this week near 1,713 has come in higher volume than the prior week, a good sign. But it's critical to try to buy shares as close as possible to the 10-week line. This is especially the case with Bitcoin Investment because its weekly price swings from low to high are ultra-extreme.Over the past three weeks of trade, including this week, the swing from low to high has easily exceeded 10%.Elsewhere, WTI crude oil futures rallied 0.6% to $64.19 a barrel, the highest level since December 2015, as energy, metal ores and mining related stocks have had a glorious second week of the trading year.WTI near-term futures are now 6.5% year to date, slamming a 4.1% gain by the S&P 500. The Nasdaq composite, at 7255, is up 5.1%.PetroChina (PTR), highlighted in a Stock Market Today column on Thursday, added 0.6% to 76.76 and is now just 6% below the 81.80 high within its gigantic saucer base pattern. The oil and gas integrated firm continues to pad its gains from an early breakout past an aggressive buy point at 72.10.Caterpillar (CAT) is likely to finish an eighth straight week up. It offered a four-weeks-tight entry point at 140.54 during the week ended Dec. 1 last year. Notice how, after a strong run-up, the stock barely budged for weeks, moving sideways and holding on to its gains. Such action creates additional buy points such as the 3-weeks-tight and 4-weeks-tight.Paycom Software (PAYC) broke out of a solid six-week flat base with an 86.20 buy point. Shares gained more than 3% to 87.99 in volume running double usual levels. The 5% buy zone goes up to 90.51.The payroll and HR outsourcing software expert joined Leaderboard as the 11th company with strong potential to outperform the major indexes.The Oklahoma City-based firm is likely to post fourth-quarter results in early February. Wall Street expects earnings to lift 33% to 24 cents a share. That would be an impressive result, given that in Q4 of 2016, earnings vaulted 80% to 18 cents.Revenue is seen rising 29% to $113 million, which would mark a quarterly best.

187,NOV,"Companies that stockpiled trillions of dollars offshore free of U.S. income tax may get one last break before paying up — provided their fiscal years don't follow the calendar year.X A timing quirk in the tax overhaul that President Trump signed last month may be good news for companies such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Cisco Systems (CSCO), all of which began their fiscal years before Jan. 1. Firms including Alphabet (GOOGL), Amgen (AMGN) and General Electric (GE) — with fiscal years that began on Jan. 1 — appear to be shut out of the benefit.Apple alone, which disclosed an offshore cash hoard of $252 billion as of Sept. 30, may be able to lop more than $4 billion off a future tax bill, according to Stephen Shay, a tax and business law professor at Harvard Law School who wrote about what he called the ""potential loophole"" last month. He characterized the boon as a side effect of the speed with which congressional Republicans passed their tax bill.""This bill was passed on a speed train schedule with no time to think,"" said Shay, who was a senior Treasury Department official during the administrations of former presidents Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan. It's up to Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service to create rules to prevent companies from taking advantage, he said.In passing the most extensive tax-code revisions since 1986, Congress scrapped the previous international tax system for corporations — an unusual arrangement that allowed companies to defer U.S. income taxes on foreign earnings until they returned the income to the U.S. That ""deferral"" provision led companies to stockpile an estimated $3.1 trillion offshore.In switching to a new system that's designed to focus on domestic economic activity, congressional tax writers also imposed a two-tiered levy on all that accumulated foreign income: Cash will be taxed at 15.5%, less liquid assets at 8%. Companies can pay over eight years.The timing issue that Shay surfaced stems from a provision that, in effect, gives a company until the end of its fiscal year to measure what's cash and what isn't for tax purposes. Consequently, companies that began new fiscal years before Jan. 1 get an extra chance to reduce foreign cash they'll accumulate this year — which they can do by distributing cash dividends to their U.S. parents before tallying up what's left to be taxed, Shay wrote.Under separate changes that took effect Jan. 1, any such dividends would be tax-free in the U.S., he noted.The law actually specifies two dates that companies should use in tallying their offshore cash piles — and they have to pay the 15.5% rate on whichever tally is larger. The options: The two-year average of foreign cash as of Nov. 2, the date the House introduced its tax bill; or the end of the firm's current fiscal year — if it began before Jan. 1.Here's how Shay said it could work for Apple, which began its fiscal year on Oct. 1: Under the Nov. 2 formula, the company's two-year average offshore cash stash was $234 billion. Shay said Apple's historical earnings suggest that figure could grow to $289 billion by Sept. 30, when its year ends.Therefore, Shay said, if Apple's foreign subsidiaries operate on the same fiscal year, they could distribute as much $55 billion to their parent, taking the overseas cash total down to match the Nov. 2 number. And because there's a 7.5 percentage-point difference in the two tax rates, the company's tax savings thanks to the distribution could amount to $4.1 billion, he said.A spokesperson for Apple didn't respond to requests for comment; nor did spokespersons for Cisco and Alphabet. Spokespersons for Microsoft, Oracle, Amgen and GE declined to comment.The IRS didn't respond to a request for comment. One line in the tax bill says that if federal officials determine that a company has shifted cash or cash equivalents into other assets with ""a principal purpose"" of trying to reduce their tax bills, the transaction will be disregarded. But Shay said that line isn't enough to prevent abuse, and the IRS should produce detailed, concrete guidance for companies.As it stands now, if companies use the strategy to try to reduce their tax bills, it would be up to the IRS to challenge the move — and then see whether its position holds up in court, said Eric Solomon, a co-director of the national tax practice at Ernst & Young LLP.Overall, multinational corporations — including those that don't have the fiscal year advantage — are weighing different ways to mitigate the effects of the repatriation provision, said Solomon, who was a top Treasury tax official in former President George W. Bush's administration.Republican tax writers — who cut tax rates for businesses and individuals — sought to balance the cuts partly with hundreds of billions of dollars from companies paying levies on their stockpiles of offshore earnings. Setting the rates at 15.5% and 8% would generate almost $340 billion in revenue over a decade, according to estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress' official scorekeeper.""Practitioners have all been going crazy trying to figure out how to determine and potentially minimize the transition tax burden,"" said Itai Grinberg, an international tax law professor at Georgetown University Law Center.The IRS issued some guidance on Dec. 29, but companies are still awaiting additional details on many ""pressing questions"" related to offshore earnings, Solomon said.One major question: How cash and cash-equivalents will be defined. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has the authority to write new rules specifying which assets he identifies as being economically equivalent to cash. The IRS said in its notice that commercial paper, foreign currency, certificates of deposit and governmental and state securities would all be considered cash and taxed at the 15.5% rate.The tax bill's international provisions ""were put out in a rush,"" and the IRS notice ""is prime evidence of this and probably a bellwether for other problems to come,"" said Chris Sanchirico, a tax law professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.""Are there planning opportunities?"" said Sanchirico. ""Yes, most likely.""

188,NOV,"Despite its name and a big 41% weighting in tech stocks, AllianzGI Focused Growth Fund (PGWAX) does not aim to focus assets in any one sector. Its tech stock stake at its last count on Oct. 31 came by way of  stock-by-stock analysis at the $1.1 billion fund.X Focused Growth's next biggest sector weighting was 16% in consumer cyclical stocks. The concentration has worked well for the fund's investors. In the past year going into Thursday, the fund gained 33.11%, topping 78% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar. It outperformed 82% of its peers over the past three years with a 15.31% average annual gain. The S&P 500 averaged 23.57% and 12.70% in those time spans.The fund aims for long-term price gains by seeking stocks of what lead fund manager Karen Hiatt calls high-quality companies that she and co-manager Raphael Edelman believe can sustain growth and post earnings surprises as well as generate attractive cash flows. ""We look for companies with strong management, that have a track record of building shareholder value and delivering strong free cash flow,"" Hiatt said.To achieve that, Hiatt and Edelman invest in only their best ideas. The portfolio held just 39 stocks as of Nov. 30. The managers also focus on managing risk. One way they do that is by aiming to buy stocks they like when they are reasonably priced.The fund's focus on its managers' best ideas is reflected in the relatively big weightings for the fund's top positions. Top holdings Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Visa (V) each account for more than 5% of fund assets.Apple is up 46% in the past 12 months and FANG stocks Facebook and Amazon are up 51% and 58%. UnitedHealth is up 39% and Visa is up 46%.""The data points around Apple have been noisy recently,"" Hiatt said. ""But we think that's just from investors' fine-tuning their expectations of the run rate of the new iPhone X.""Also, she calls Apple attractively valued since its forward 12-month price-earnings multiple is trading at about a 25% discount to the S&P 500's.In addition, she says Apple should benefit from the recently enacted tax bill. It will get a lower tax rate, freedom to repatriate its overseas cash cache and more leeway in using that cash.IBD's TAKE: Tax reform should let Apple bring some of its $250 billion overseas money home at a tax rate of 15.5% vs. the old 35% rate. That could make billions of dollars available for stock buybacks, IBD has reported.With Facebook, Hiatt sees a chance of earnings declining as the company continues to invest in itself. But she likes the company's long-term outlook as Facebook finds news ways to monetize assets and as the number of users increases and advertising growth remains strong.Hiatt also sees Amazon's spending as an investment in its own future. Amazon's internal investments have tended to pay off in terms of market share gains, she says. Amazon's investments in its Prime program, for example, is paying off in the form of increased user spending. And Amazon's takeover of Whole Foods Market helps Amazon ""get closer to the customer, (capture) a high income customer base with relatively low merchandise overlap and gaining insights into fresh food distribution,"" she said.She especially likes Amazon's trends outside the U.S., where its revenue last quarter was more than $1 billion higher than expected. ""Add Prime penetration, Amazon's increased capability in video and in groceries, in India, in health care,"" she said. ""There's so much optionality that Amazon's moat grows deeper and wider.""Outside the technology sector, Hiatt likes prospects for UnitedHealth, one of the largest managed care companies. ""What's most exciting is its Optum business,"" she said.Optum provides pharmacy benefits management and technology services and also runs clinics and doctors' offices. ""This unit has significant amounts of data, which gives UnitedHealth a competitive advantage in being able to leverage that data to provide lower costs throughout its supply chain and lower costs to customers,"" she said. ""So it's an area of significant growth.""Hiatt also likes UnitedHealth's acquisition of dialysis center DaVita's (DVA) medical unit, its fourth big takeover since the start of 2017.And Visa benefits from refashioning the company's Visa Europe business, which it acquired in 2016. ""Visa Europe had been run like a co-op,"" Hiatt said. ""They've turned it into a profit-focused business, with a lot of upside.""Visa also gains from the shift to digital payments for transactions. ""They are a toll taker for global spending,"" Hiatt said. ""It's a really scalable business. There isn't much that they have to do for each incremental dollar they bring in.""RELATED:2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains, With A Foreign Tilt

189,NOV,"On business trips, Pete Jameson gets odd looks from fellow airplane passengers when he's in his seat typing on a keyboard with no screen to be seen.X But Jameson is looking at a jumbo-size display, thanks to augmented reality glasses that project images for his eyes only. His headset looks like slightly oversized sunglasses and what he sees is not visible to others.Jameson is chief operating officer of ODG, one of a host of companies pursuing the emerging market of augmented reality, or AR, glasses.""I travel all the time and one of the cool-use cases for me personally is the ability to slip on a pair of glasses and wear my tablet,"" Jameson told Investor's Business Daily. ""I can work on a plane with a rollout Bluetooth keyboard and get on Wi-Fi on a plane. Now I have a 100-inch screen that behaves just like my tablet does, that's totally private. Nobody can see what I'm doing.""Today we have information at our fingertips, but tomorrow it could be right at our eyeballs.That's the promise of augmented reality. Instead of looking back and forth at your smartphone screen for navigation and other situational data, the information would be displayed in your field of vision using AR glasses.Tech companies big and small are racing to take the lead in this new market, which is poised to be the next generation of mobile computing. Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are among the tech heavyweights developing products for this new computing paradigm.The market for augmented reality glasses currently is focused on niche industrial and enterprise applications. Those applications usually have a compelling return on investment, making the purchase of headsets that cost a few thousand dollars each worthwhile.Commuter privacy and productivity likely will be one of the early consumer uses of AR glasses, said Jameson.""How many times have you been traveling on a plane and you're trying to hold your mobile phone to see this little thing or you've got a tablet or a laptop and the person next to you looks at what you're doing or watching?"" he said.The nice part about the experience is that the AR glasses wearer is not disconnected from the environment as they would be with virtual reality goggles. With AR headsets, you can still see and hear what's happening around you, he said.Jameson elicits some raised eyebrows when he's using a wireless keyboard with his AR glasses.""The looks I get are like, 'Dude, what are you doing?' "" he said.For now though, Apple and Google are taking baby steps in the market by developing AR applications for their mobile operating systems for smartphones and tablets. Instead of overlaying digital information on a person's field of view with glasses, the information is presented over what the smartphone camera sees and is shown on the device's display.To spur the market, Apple has come out with augmented reality software development tools called ARKit for the iPhone. Google has followed suit with ARCore for Android smartphones.Still, PricewaterhouseCoopers recently published survey data indicating that AR adoption among enterprises is relatively low at 10%. But 24% of enterprises report interest in investing in AR over the next three years.By industrial market, automotive shows the most AR interest with 18% reporting investment in the technology today, and 31% planning over the next three years. Health care is another industry interested in AR glasses. Auto industry apps include AR-guided assembly and maintenance, while health care is using AR for graphical overlays in surgery.Most of the current AR headset makers, including Daqri, Meta, ODG and Vuzix (VUZI), are focused on enterprise markets because the hardware is expensive, as are the software and services, IDC analyst Tom Mainelli said.""They can see a clear path forward because companies will pay for this,"" he told IBD.Augmented reality was a hot topic of discussion at the CES consumer electronics show, which ran Jan. 9-12 in Las Vegas. Companies like Vuzix, ThirdEye Gen, Skully Technologies and Solos Smart Glasses exhibited AR products at the massive trade show.One company not at CES was closely watched startup Magic Leap. In December, it previewed its long-awaited AR smart glasses, called Magic Leap One. It expects to begin selling the hardware later this year, but hasn't announced pricing or a release date.Research firm ARtillry Intelligence predicts that the enterprise market for AR will mushroom from $829 million in 2016 to $47.7 billion in 2021. It sees the consumer AR market surging from $975 million in 2016 to $15.8 billion in 2021.The enterprise AR market will be fueled by headsets capable of all-day use with a quantifiable return on investment, ARtillry analyst Mike Boland said. He adds consumer AR will be driven by smartphone applications in the near term, then the rumored 2020 launch of Apple's smart glasses could shift the story to headsets.There will be 505 million AR-compatible smartphones by the end of 2017 and 4.2 billion by 2020, ARtillry predicts. AR apps will help seed the market for the eventual introduction of smart glasses.Some useful AR apps for smartphones have emerged such as software for visualizing how furniture would look in your room before you buy it, IDC's Mainelli said.Still, AR on smartphones is a ""tweener tech,"" he said. ""It's not optimum, but it will prove the use case.""Apple CEO Tim Cook told a U.K. newspaper in October that he doesn't think the technology for AR glasses is ready yet. For instance, the field of view for the displays isn't big enough or of good enough quality, he said.By putting AR capabilities into the iPhone, Apple has created a large addressable market for software developers today, Cook says.""AR is going to change the way we use technology forever,"" Cook said on a Nov. 3 conference call with Wall Street analysts. ""We're already seeing things that will transform the way you work, play, connect and learn.""For example, AR apps for education let students interact with virtual 3D models of the human body and solar system, he said. In addition to field of view, other challenges for consumer AR glasses include styling, battery life and the user interface.In work settings, people aren't concerned about what AR glasses look like as long as they help them do their job better, Mainelli said. Commercial users also don't mind hooking their headsets up to an external battery pack or even a notebook computer, he said.""Style is a big issue,"" Boland told IBD. ""When you are asking someone to put something on their face, it's a large barrier to cross. AR glasses aren't there yet in terms of being small enough and sleek enough.""Google experienced significant pushback several years ago when it introduced its Google Glass wearable heads-up display. The complaint was that Google Glass made people look like cyborgs.Apple probably will spend the most time on the user interface, which could include voice commands, gestures and wireless hand controllers, Mainelli said.The first iterations of Apple's AR glasses likely would be sold as peripherals to the iPhone. The glasses would offload processing and cellular connectivity to the iPhone to conserve battery life on the glasses and allow for smaller, lighter frames, Mainelli said.IDC predicts that shipments of AR headsets will reach 24.6 million units in 2021, up from a mere 162,000 units in 2016. In 2021, 83% of AR headsets will be for commercial applications, with the rest for consumer use, it said.Enterprise customers are interested in devices that can save them time and money, ODG's Jameson said.The application getting the most traction now is telepresence, he said. In this application, a worker in the field live-streams video from a camera built into the AR glasses to a remote expert who can help identify and solve problems with equipment. The expert can guide the worker verbally and by using visuals put in the worker's field of view.Another major enterprise application of AR glasses is assistance. A worker with a pair of AR glasses can identify a piece of equipment using a bar code or wireless beacon and call up maintenance checklists and step-by-step repair instructions and videos.When AR glasses make the leap to the consumer market, it is doubtful that people will wear them all the time, Jameson said.""What we're likely to see in the consumer market in the beginning are very purposeful use cases,"" he said. That includes the commuter privacy example as well as cyclists who want hands-free turn-by-turn directions and other information about what's around them, such as coffee shops, restaurants and ATMs, he added.""Certainly this is going to be a major category in the next three to five years from a consumer perspective,"" Jameson said.RELATED:Apple Readying Augmented-Reality Glasses For 2020 Launch: ReportApple Kicks Off Augmented-Reality Era With New iPhones

195,NOV,"T-Mobile US' (TMUS) new buy-one, get one free iPhone promotions include Apple's (AAPL) high-end iPhone X for the first time but still fall short of the aggressiveness some analysts have been looking for from wireless firms.X T-Mobile on Wednesday said new customers that purchase an iPhone 8 Plus or iPhone X as their first device will get $700 via a rebate — that's enough to buy an iPhone 8 outright. The $700 can also be used to buy a second iPhone 8 Plus or iPhone X.The iPhone X starts at just under $1,000, so consumers will still need to pay $300 or more on the second device, depending on the model. Apple didn't get much help from wireless firms in iPhone X promotions in 2017 amid tight supplies, analysts say. Apple reports fiscal second-quarter earnings on Feb. 1 and analysts will be focusing on iPhone X guidance.""We expect solid fiscal Q1 results and while there may be some risk to fiscal Q2 forecasts, due in part to lack of carrier iPhone X promotions, we remain positive on the continuing platform strength,"" William Power, a Baird analyst, said in a note to clients published Wednesday. Power's report came out before T-Mobile announced its new promotions for iPhones and Samsung devices.""We would note that while carriers have offered (buy one, get one) promotions for iPhone 8, we are not aware of any significant iPhone X promotions, which could be one of the elements impacting fiscal Q2, while benefiting carrier margins.""The iPhone X went on sale Nov. 3 after production delays, following the iPhone 8's release in late September.IBD'S TAKE: Finding the best stocks to buy can be tricky. That's why Investor's Business Daily makes it easy with educational tools, stock lists, research, Leaderboard and more.Sprint's chief executive signaled in September that wireless firms would not subsidize all smartphones as prices rise.""I think we should invite the manufacturers to share a little of the cash flow burden that comes with — as the price of devices goes higher,"" said Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure.Neither AT&T (T) nor Verizon Communications (VZ) has offered a buy one, get one deal for the full value of two iPhone X phones.Apple stock was down a fraction to close at 174.29 on the stock market today. T-Mobile fell 2.6% to 63.89.T-Mobile on Tuesday pre-announced that it added 891,000 postpaid phone subscribers in the December quarter, topping consensus estimates of 810,000.RELATED:Camera Makers Converge At CES To Combat 'Porch Pirates'Apple Buyback Scenario May Soothe Worries Over iPhone X DemandBitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet

196,NOV,"Investors continued to deploy more money into stocks Thursday after light declines the prior session. Investors apparently took profits in Bitcoin-related securities Thursday following news that a South Korean justice minister is reiterating pledges to clamp down on local transactions in the alternative digital currency.X Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), an enormous winner in Q4 of last year, dived 8% to 1,805 in light trading and is approaching its critical 50-day moving average. The exchange traded note has fallen 48% below its 3,522 peak.Such a correction is normal for stocks or ETFs that break out of bases and rise 200%, 500% or more. In Bitcoin Investment Trust's case, the move from a Nov. 22 breakout from a very deep cup with handle at 985.10 was 257%.Meanwhile, energy plays gained more steam, and a former huge winner from the mid-2000s, PetroChina (PTR), extended its gains from a recent breakout from a long bottoming base pattern.The Nasdaq composite held a small lead over other major indexes, rising 0.6% in midafternoon trading. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose around 0.5%.In the 30-stock Dow industrial average, at least six components gained 1 point or more, including oil and gas titan Chevron (CVX) (up 3%) and mining and construction play Caterpillar (CAT) (up 2%).Cat broke out in April last year past a 99.56 buy point in a 12-week flat base and has gained more than 69%. Investors could consider taking at least partial profits while holding a core position to give the industrial turnaround and global economy play more room to potentially grow.At least seven of the day's top 10 industry groups among 197 tracked by IBD hail from the oil and gas and solar industries. Market breadth is positive, with winners beating losers on both exchanges by a nearly 3-1 ratio.The Chinese government-controlled PetroChina cleared a 72.10 aggressive entry within its yearlong cup base on Jan. 2 this year, pulled back the next session, then gapped up sharply a day later amid a strong rally in crude prices.Since Jan. 1, near-term WTI crude oil futures — currently near $64.50 a barrel — have risen 6.8% while the S&P 500 has gained nearly 3.4%.At this point, PetroChina is slightly extended from the 72.10 buy point, up 5.5%. An investor can watch to see if the megacap stock ($139 billion in market value) will pull back in normal fashion, ideally in lighter turnover, and return within the 5% buy zone. Or one could wait for a potential handle to form on the existing deep cup base. The correction within the cup from high to low is 26%, falling within normal range.Earnings estimates are rosy for the explorer, producer, refiner, transporter and marketer of oil and gas. Wall Street expects earnings to rise 310% to $2.42 in 2017, rebounding from an 81% plunge in 2016, then rise an additional 29% to $3.12 a share this year.While the Composite Rating is a crummy 51 on a scale of 1 to 99 in IBD Stock Checkup, such ratings are normal for turnaround plays.When Apple (AAPL), one of the finest earnings turnarounds among large-cap techs in 2017, began trading in 2017, its Composite score was a horrid 51. But today, following several quarters of renewed double-digit top and bottom line growth, the Composite has soared to 90.Diamondback Energy (FANG), a Leaderboard member, erased losses in the prior two days of trading with a 3% lift to 131.18. The Permian Basin exploration play was added to Leaderboard on Dec. 20 when shares traded near 117. On that session, the stock broke out, clearing a tightly wound flat base with a 115.03 buy point, and has since rallied nearly 15%.Fourth-quarter earnings are seen rising 63% to $1.47 a share. That's impressive, given that in the year-ago quarter, Diamondback had grown profits by 58%.RELATED:In Stock Market Today: When Is The Right Time To Buy Apple Now?Inside The Big Picture On Wednesday: Could These Sectors Lead In 2018?These Are The Five Strongest Industry Groups In 2018What Is The Bottoming Base, And How This Stock Chart Pattern Makes MoneyThe Newest Stocks In LeaderboardStocks Near A Buy Zone

205,NOV,"While the FANG stocks have been standout performers in 2017, will company performance and industry trends continue to fuel their double-digit growth heading into 2018?X The contingent of those following the tech giants is growing. On Thursday, GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives delivered a report on the FANG stocks to clients, giving all four companies a rating of highly attractive.Ives' report follows the Wednesday missive to investors from Evercore ISI, which gave all the FANG stocks all positive reviews and outperform ratings in new coverage.While there are lingering worries around growth and competition, Ives wrote, ""We believe the underlying fundamentals, spending environment, and consumer/enterprise landscape looks very healthy heading into 2018.""The FANG stocks — social media leader Facebook (FB), e-commerce king Amazon (AMZN) streaming media champion Netflix (NFLX) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL)  — are among the top-performing technology companies globally. This year, Facebook shares are up 56%, while Amazon is up 55%, Netflix 49% and Alphabet 32%.Ives gave two of the four FANG stocks a price-target increase. Ives raised his price target on Amazon to 1,375 from 1,270, while Alphabet was raised to 1,190 from 1,100.Ives said Amazon continues to have an ""iron grip"" on the e-commerce market, despite a clear bullseye on its back from retailers around the world.Bolstering Amazon heading into 2018 is its Prime membership program, now more than 85 million strong, and the various business opportunities surrounding its Whole Foods acquisition. Another pillar of strength is Amazon Web Services.The biggest risk and investor concern around Amazon, Ives wrote, ""is emerging competition from every direction of the consumer and enterprise landscape.""Amazon recently scored two price-target hikes on expectations of a strong holiday sales season and increased optimism about its competitive position.Regarding Alphabet, Ives based his price-target increase on increased confidence in Google's underlying growth drivers.""We believe Google has a number of organic growth investments that will start to bear fruit in 2018 as ad growth, mobile impression strength, and a host of other initiatives lay out a compelling growth story for Google in 2018,"" Ives wrote.Alphabet, in late October, reported third-quarter results that smashed estimates, sending shares in the internet giant to a new high.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook, Amazon and Netflix are currently on IBD's exclusive list of Leaderboard stocks. There are plenty of places on Investors.com to research and find top stocks, but when you're looking to get a broader idea, Check out IBD's Tech Leaders feature.On Netflix, Ives said the streaming media company has a number of initiatives which should fuel the company's next phase of growth in the U.S. and internationally.""While the landscape for original content has become increasingly competitive with new entrants entering the market by the day, we believe Netflix remains in a unique position of strength to grow its content and distribution tentacles over the next 12 to 18 months,"" Ives wrote.Despite growing competition in the streaming video market coming from Amazon, Hulu and others, he added: ""We are not overly concerned that this dynamic will alter the company's growth trajectory in the near-term given the Netflix competitive moat and original content.""Ives has a price target on Netflix of 235.As to Facebook, Ives said the company has strong momentum heading into 2018.""Facebook will continue to grow its massive global installed base in our opinion while importantly monetizing users, especially on the Instagram side of the house,"" Ives wrote.One concern is that Facebook intends to significantly increase spending in 2018, ""which could be a lingering cloud over Facebook's shares in the near term until investors can get further comfort that these investments are fueling the next phase of the company's growth story,""  Ives wrote.Facebook, on Nov. 1, reported third-quarter earnings that topped earnings and revenue estimates by a wide margin.

206,NOV,"The Nasdaq commanded the upside in the U.S. stock market at midday Thursday, rising 0.7%, while the No. 1 industry group among the 197 rated each day by IBD flourished on a fresh breakout by former big market winner First Solar (FSLR).X First Solar rushed more than 7% higher to 68.36 in volume running more than double its usual level. First Solar traded on average 2.5 million shares each day over the past 50 sessions.  The big gain extended a breakout from a new buy point in a massive first-stage cup with handle at 62.67. The 5% chase zone goes up to 65.80. The RS line (painted in blue on IBD charts) shot into new high ground.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) is trying to join the Thursday rebound, rising 0.4% and trying to halt a mild three-day slide. However, as seen on a weekly chart, the iPhone, iPad and digital services marketer is doing just fine, appearing to find support near its still-rising 10-week moving average.Apple, despite being down nearly 1% for the week, still holds a 5% gain past a 160.97 buy point in a shallow second-stage cup with handle and is thus extended in price. And the megacap tech turnaround is still up more than 40% since clearing a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12, starting on Jan. 6.IBD's proprietary ratings for the megacap tech continue to rise. According to IBD Stock Checkup, the 90 Composite Rating is solid on a scale of 1 to 99, especially given that in January, Apple posed as a potential corporate turnaround. In fiscal 2016, ended in September that year, Apple's earnings fell 10% to $8.31 a share and revenue dipped 8%, ending years of vibrant growth.But Apple is back on track with accelerating increases in the rate of top and bottom-line growth.Earnings per share have risen 2%, 11%, 18% and 24% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters through fiscal Q4, ended in September this year. And in the December-ending first quarter of FY 2018, the Street sees earnings rising 12% to $3.77 a share.For all of FY 2018, expect profit to jump 24% to $11.44 a share on a 20% bump up in revenue to $274.26 billion. Strong digital services revenue and the emerging iPhone replacement cycle are helping to paint a bullish fundamental picture for the largest company in the U.S. stock exchanges (currently now at $870 billion).At 12:30 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq 100 is up for a third day in a row, rising 0.5%. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 edged roughly 0.3% to 0.4% higher, weighed down a bit by declines in certain retail and defensive shares.Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) surged nearly 9% to 1,835 in fast turnover, extending its gain from a Nov. 22 breakout at 985.10 to 86%. The ETF produced a deep yet symmetrical cup with handle after sinking fast in early September.As seen in an IBD chart, the 55% drop from head to toe within the 11-week base is much deeper than the ideal range of 12% to 33%. However, Bitcoin Investment regained its 50-day moving average with relative ease, produced a fine downward-sloping handle in light trading in November, then broke out in furious volume.One could decide to sell the ETF for a profit when it undercuts the short-term 10-day moving average significantly. The 50-day moving average, currently near 932, is not helpful as a technical indicator at this point as it sorely lags the price of this highflying ETF.Semiconductor shares continued to rebound in the wake of good quarterly results of Broadcom (AVGO), which also raised its quarterly dividend by nearly 75%. Broadcom, which is attempting a hostile takeover of fellow semiconductor design giant Qualcomm (QCOM), notched a 32% rise in earnings to $4.59 a share in the October-ended fiscal fourth quarter as revenue climbed 17% to $4.84 billion. That's on top of a 38% EPS gain and a merger-fueled 125% top-line leap in the year-ago quarter.Nvidia (NVDA), whose chipsets allow Bitcoin mining, rallied more than 1% to 192.54 and is on a potential path to rebounding back above the rising 50-day average.Nvidia's CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said during a Q3 conference call that while the revenues currently being derived from Bitcoin activities are small, they're ""not zero."" While the Bitcoin-related revenue does not yet compare with the other major markets addressed by the leader in GPUs (graphics processing units) including AI, datacenter, and self-driving cars, Huang seemed to hold a positive long-term outlook for Bitcoin growth.Nvidia is currently ranked No. 13 in the IBD 50. The stock had advanced 25% after a Sept. 15 breakout from a narrow flat base at 174.66. The flat base is one of at least seven key chart patterns that every growth stock investor should know and master to catch excellent stocks at the right time.Going back to First Solar, the utility-scale solar power infrastructure expert had initially broken out of a bottoming base pattern with a 20% gap up on Oct. 27, sending shares hurdling over a 53.10 entry.On that breakout day of Oct. 27, First Solar posted its best quarterly results in eight quarters with earnings vaulting 64% to $1.95 a share on a 60% revenue boost to $1.09 billion. In the year-ago quarter, both earnings and revenue had fallen sharply. Solar companies tend to show extreme boom and bust cycles in their fundamentals.The bottoming base began back in March 2016, when the alternative energy play peaked at 74.29, then slid all the way down to 25.56, flushing out droves of shareholders in a 65.6% correction and setting the base count to zero.But in April this year, First Solar began to rebound and formed the right side of its gigantic cup base before forming a handle from late September to mid-October. That relatively quiet action helped form a handle and created the 53.10 initial buy point.Notice how in the weekly chart below, First Solar posted numerous big up weeks in heavy weekly turnover. That's a telltale signs of institutional investors, including pensions, insurers, banks, mutual funds and large investment advisers, accumulating shares and supporting the stock.Also note that in a first-stage base after a major decline, you want to see the stock to get back above its 50- and 200-day moving average lines. That's exactly what happened with First Solar.Going to the weekly chart of First Solar, and one can spot a 3-weeks-tight pattern, allowing for a secondary buy point at 63.20, or 10 cents above the highest price within the pattern. First Solar moved less than 1% in price during the weeks ended Nov. 24 and Dec. 1. That's very tight weekly action following a four-week 29% rally that began in mid-October.The 3-weeks-tight pattern allows an investor to add a small amount of shares to a winning position in a stock.While First Solar, due in large part to its renewed relative strength, harbors a solid 94 Composite Rating on IBD Stock Checkup, earnings are expected to decline both in 2017 (down 51% to $2.45 a share) and next year (down 40% to $1.47).The Energy-Solar industry group currently ranks No. 1 in IBD's daily rankings for six-month relative price performance.(You can trade the IBD 50 with one vehicle, the IBD 50 (FFTY) ETF, managed by Innovator Capital Management.

213,NOV,"Social media leader Facebook (FB), e-commerce king Amazon (AMZN) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) all received positive reviews and outperform ratings in new coverage initiated by Evercore ISI.X Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet are three of the four so-called FANG stocks,  the other being Netflix (NFLX), with all four internet companies being tech titans of our time.On Facebook, Evercore ISI analyst Anthony DiClemente expects the company to capture the largest share of incremental ad revenue across all global media properties over the next five years. He estimates Facebook's ad revenue will expand at a 30% compound annual growth rate and exceed $100 billion by 2021. By then, he also expects Facebook to reach 3 billion users.""Our conclusion is that Facebook shares are likely to outperform all other advertising companies, as it maintains substantial room for absolute user growth globally,"" DiClemente wrote in a research note to clients.

215,NOV,"The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index fell 1.7 points in December to 51.9, pulling back from an eight-month high but holding above the neutral 50 level for a 15th month. Americans were less upbeat about the outlook for the economy and their own finances despite the S&P 500 index hitting record highs, improving labor markets and tax-cut progress. The reading comes amid a solid start to the holiday season for retailers from Amazon.com (AMZN) to Macy's (M).All three major subindexes declined:X Separately, the Financial Related Stress Index  rose 1.1% to 54.1, indicating more stress, but below October's 56.5 reading.The S&P 500 index and other major averages are trading near all-time highs, in large part on hopes that lower corporate tax rates will boost profits.The U.S. economy added 261,000 jobs in October, with economists predicting Friday's report will show November payrolls climbed by 190,000. The jobless rate is expected to hold at a 17-year low of 4.1%. The share of households with one or more people seeking work fell to 13% from 18% in December 2016 and 27% in December 2015. There are growing signs that wage gains for blue-collar workers are finally picking up as labor markets tighten.Economic conditions and confidence bode well for the holiday shopping season. Online sales have soared, with Amazon seen as the top beneficiary once again.But brick-and-mortar retailers also seem to be faring well vs. expectations. Macy's announced last week that it needs an extra 7,000 seasonal workers amid ""high customer volume."" Five Below (FIVE), a teen-centric discounter, last week predicted strong holiday sales after crushing earnings views in its latest quarter. Young adult apparel chain American Eagle (AEO) guided holiday earnings forecasts higher on Wednesday.December's economic optimism could reflect doubts about the tax legislation, as critics claimed it could raise taxes on many Americans eventually. It could also reflect dissatisfaction with President Trump, at least outside of Republicans. The IBD/TIPP Presidential Leadership Index fell 3.3% in December to 38.5, giving up some of November's gains. Within the Economic Optimism Index, sentiment fell among Democrats and independents while rising among self-described Republicans.But middle-class respondents showed flat to higher overall economic optimism. And the drop in the federal economic policies gauge was relatively small.Perhaps the most likely explanation for December's dip is that it's a half-step back after the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index spiked 6.6% in November.The poll of 901 Americans was conducted Nov. 27 to Dec. 4.RELATED:IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism IndexRetail & E-Commerce Stocks And Industry News

216,NOV,"Alphabet (GOOGL) got a much-needed boost following a five-day slide that ended on Monday as the major indexes showed mostly flat action in afternoon trading Wednesday. The Nasdaq edged 0.2% higher.X The Google search engine giant rose more than 1.2% to 1,032.36, getting buying support near the key 50-day moving average and holding above a recent 1,006.29 buy point in an 11-week flat base.The 5% buy zone goes up to 1,056.60.The Nasdaq composite is trying to halt a three-day slide; at 6775, it stands less than 2% off the 6914 all-time peak set on Nov. 28. The S&P 500, up around 0.1%, is hovering less than 2% below its 2665 peak. Volume is running lower vs. the same time Tuesday on both main exchanges. The Dow Jones industrials was up almost 0.1%, while small caps fell. The S&P SmallCap 600 was down 0.2% after falling as much as 0.5%.At least four members of the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average gained 1 point or more, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Visa (V). Both megacaps are market leaders in 2017, rising 33% and 41% since Jan. 1, respectively. Microsoft has also formed a new flat base since peaking at 86.20.Notice on a weekly chart how Microsoft, which has successfully ventured into new industries outside its flagship operating software, is finding support at the 10-week moving average, a bullish sign.Microsoft has gotten back on track in revenue growth, with the top line rising 1%, 8%, 13% and 12% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. Profit dipped 5% to 84 cents a share in the September-ended fiscal first quarter but is expected to rebound 5% in Q2.

But it still gets the lion's share of its revenue and profits from ads. The strong trends seen in U.S. jobs, consumer confidence and manufacturing all seem to improve the 2004 IPO's prospects for further growth.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see Alphabet's earnings lifting 32% to $9.99 a share in the fourth quarter. That would follow a solid string of quarterly growth, with earnings up 42%, 27%, 7%, 28%, 27% and 32% vs. year-ago levels in the prior six quarters.Revenue is expected to jump 22% in Q4 to $31.85 billion, following top-line gains of 21%, 20%, 22%, 22%, 21% and 24%.According to IBD Stock Checkup, Alphabet's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a low D+ on a scale of A (high accumulation) to E (heavy selling). Watch to see if this rating rises in coming weeks. The proprietary gauge analyzes price-and-volume activity in a stock over the past 13 weeks.Alphabet's Composite Rating is excellent at 96. The stock has a $717 billion market cap and 694 million shares outstanding across all share classes. The float is 295 million for Alphabet's class A shares.Retailing shares continue to shine. In Tuesday's screened new highs list, the retail sector shared the top position with Banks, each with 13 stocks hitting all-time or 52-week highs. Luxury interior goods firm RH (RH), formerly called Restoration Hardware, is now showing leadership, rising more than 2% to 106.44 and has stretched its gain from a cup with handle and a 75.03 buy point to more than 41%.The Street sees outstanding profit growth ahead for RH with earnings rising 133% to $2.93 a share in fiscal year 2018 ending in January and up 65% to $4.83 in FY 2019.RH's Composite Rating has rebounded nicely in recent months to a respectable 93.Elsewhere, another consumer spending play and the largest company on the Nasdaq in market cap is reversing nicely off intraday lows. Apple (AAPL) was practically flat at 169.58 and is still slightly extended from a new 160.97 buy point in a second-stage cup with handle.Apple broke out of a bottoming base and first-stage cup with handle at 118.12 on Jan. 6-9.As noted in an earlier Stock Market Today column, Tuesday's vote in the Senate Banking Committee to reduce some of the Dodd Frank financial industry regulations may be helping to support the recent advance in bank and brokerage stocks.Crude oil futures slumped, sending energy stocks lower.

Shortened wait times for iPhone X deliveries indicate that Apple has worked out the kinks in production of the new handset.""Lead times for the iPhone X have decreased from four to five weeks at launch to just eight days today,"" Rolland said. ""While we believe shipments through October were generally in line with Broadcom's provided guidance, fiscal Q1 (vs. Street expectations) may benefit from the streamlined production process and more builds in the January quarter.""IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom stock broke out of a 10-week flat base with a buy point of 259.46 on Oct. 30. It hit a record high of 285.68 on Nov. 27 before falling in the recent tech stock sell-off.

218,NOV,"Futures for the S&P 500 index were essentially flat early Tuesday morning, while Dow industrials continued to outperform and Nasdaq 100 futures pulled back.X For a second straight session, the S&P 500 dipped Monday as top techs such as chip stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA), Micron Technology (MU), ASML (ASML), Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) crashing through key support in recent days, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index tumbling through its 50-day line on Monday.Losses by chips and leading techs such as Facebook (FB), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Microsoft (MSFT) offset gains by financials, retailers, transports and media companies.It's hard for the market to advance without the chip sector. Not only are key parts of the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index, but they are involved in so many other tech fields. Nvidia is a great example with its graphics chips and cards expanding from PC gaming fields to autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and even Bitcoin mining.S&P 500 index futures were just a fraction above fair value. Dow industrial futures climbed 0.3% after blue chips added 0.2% in Monday's stock market trading. Nasdaq 100 futures sank 0.3% after the composite closed down 1.1%.Nvidia tried to retake its 50-day moving average on Monday, but reversed hard to close down 5.6% to 186.66, nearly 15% off its Nov. 20 peak.The recent heavy-volume retreat suggests investors may consider taking profits in the highflier. The stock is still slightly extended from a 174.66 buy point, but don't let a 10%+ gain turn into nothing or a loss.Nvidia fell 0.9% in premarket trading.Micron Technology has fallen for six straight sessions, starting when Morgan Stanley predicted that memory chip prices will fall. Micron fell below its 50-day line last Thursday and found resistance at the level the past two sessions.Micron edged lower early Tuesday.Chip-equipment makers ASML, Applied Materials and Lam Research plunged through their 50-day moving averages in heavy volume on Nov. 29, flashing clear sell signals. The chip-equipment makers have continued to fall since then.ASML and Lam Research edged lower in early trading, while Applied Materials was not yet active.ASML, Applied Materials and Lam Research have the biggest market caps among IBD's chip-equipment group. The eight largest chip-gear firms are all below their 50-day lines.Not every chip stock is in freefall.Intel (INTC), the world's largest chipmaker and a Dow component, has pulled back modestly in recent weeks, but remains above its 50-day moving average. Intel has expanded from chips for the PC market to data centers and, greatly aided by its Mobileye acquisition, targeting the automotive market.Broadcom (AVGO) also has pulled back, testing a recent buy point on Monday before rebounding somewhat. But it's in better health than most.

219,NOV,"E-commerce leader Amazon (AMZN) is on track to leapfrog Macy's (M) and TJX (TJX) in apparel and footwear sales his year, jumping from the fourth position to second, behind Wal-Mart (WMT), says a marketplace analysis by Wells Fargo Securities.X Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow says Amazon's gross merchandise volume this year will approach $18.5 billion, up 19% from the prior year.

It's essentially a weekly version of the 50-day moving average. The 10-week/50-day line is important because it is often used by mutual funds and other big institutions to add shares. Individual investors can use high-volume rebounds from this support area as a possible buying opportunity.Facebook fell below its 50-day and 10-week averages as well as its 175.59 buy point last Friday, then lost more ground on Monday. Shares quickly fell to 169.01 on Tuesday, but rebounded to as high as 175.38, nearly recovering those key technical levels.

Shares were trading tightly up until Monday, when shares fell 3.8% to 81.08, just above its 50-day line and just below its 10-week. Microsoft rose 0.6% to 81.59 on Tuesday, just retaking its 10-week line.Microsoft appears to be on track to form a new flat base that would offer an 86.30 entry. The tech titan has made a series of consolidations and breakouts, but it's struggling to make much progress before forming yet another pattern. Pullbacks to the 50-day/10-week line might represent better buying opportunities if the stock rebounds strongly in high volume.Microsoft fell a fraction early Wednesday.Intel, the other half of the one-time Wintel duopoly and also a Dow component, has been pulling back constructively since peaking at 47.30 on Nov. 3. But shares fell 2.4% to 43.44 on Tuesday, closing in on the 50-day and 10-week lines.Intel was off 0.5% early WednesdayMany other chip plays, including Nvidia (NVDA) and a slew of chip equipment makers, have undercut their 50-day moving averages amid heavy selling.RELATED:The Big Picture: Tech Sell-Off Faces A Critical TestUgly Close, But Alphabet, Apple Show FortitudeNew Highs: Are Stocks Pivoting To New Leadership?4 Top-Rated Stocks With Earnings Due: Investing Action Plan

225,NOV,"House and Senate Republicans are racing to hammer out a tax cut agreement that blends the House bill passed on Nov. 16 with the Senate version that squeaked through at 2 a.m. Saturday morning with one vote to spare. Failure to compromise is not an option. They must deliver a final bill to the president for signing before Christmas.The stakes are high economically and politically. For too long, America's uncompetitive corporate tax rates have suppressed growth and wages, and driven companies to leave the U.S.If Republicans fail on tax reform, they could lose their grip on Congress in the midterm elections. That would leave President Trump without a legislative partner to push through his pro-growth agenda.Here's the road map for success: The House should adopt the Senate's repeal of the ObamaCare penalty, and the Senate should agree to slash corporate taxes as of Jan. 1, 2018, not a year later as the Senate bill currently says.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveSenators postponed the corporate tax cut until 2019 in order to pare $127 billion from the cost of tax reform and stay within Senate rules. But economist Arthur Laffer warns that delaying the cut will encourage companies to defer production and income for a year until their profits are taxed at the lower rate. That could tank the economy in 2018, and take the GOP majority in Congress down with it.A safer bet to keep the cost of the bill within Senate rules is for GOP Senators to embrace the House's proposal for a $1,600 child tax credit, instead of raising it to $2,000. That compromise would cut $150 billion off the cost.Doubling the child tax credit to $2,000 as the Senate bill does, and paying for it by delaying corporate tax cuts is a whopping mistake.X""Yes, everybody likes kids. But not everyone has them. Only a small segment of the population benefits from that credit,"" explains economist Larry Kudlow, a chief architect of the Trump tax plan. ""Everyone will benefit"" from reducing corporate tax rates immediately. It will ""create an investment boom. There will be no losers.""What should the House take from the Senate's version? According to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, his members are ready to adopt key Senate provisions, including continuing to allow homebuyers to deduct interest on up to a $1 million mortgage. The House plan caps it at $500,000 mortgages.Most important, House members are eager to include the Senate's repeal of the ObamaCare penalty. Bravo.Democrats, meanwhile, are claiming that eliminating the penalty — in effect, making ObamaCare voluntary — will spell disaster for millions of people with ObamaCare plans. That's demagoguery. People who want to stay in ObamaCare won't lose their subsidy or their eligibility.But abolishing the penalty will be a big tax break for the 6.7 million filers currently getting whacked for not buying Obamacare-compliant insurance.Removing the penalty may cause ObamaCare premiums to rise slightly — the Congressional Budget Office speculates about 10% — but most buyers get subsidies that insulate them from premium hikes. Those who don't will finally have the freedom to buy plans without Obamacare's costly requirements and save a bundle on insurance.As the calendar runs out, House and Senate Republicans will have to compromise on a dozen other differences between their tax bills, including the treatment of medical expenses, interest on student loans, the alternative minimum tax and gains on selling stock.There will be winners and losers with each decision. But on balance, Americans will get to keep more of what they earn. And businesses will be encouraged to invest, grow and hire.Tell the prima donnas and fence-sitters in Congress who failed to repeal ObamaCare that it can't happen again. The nation needs tax cuts now.RELATED:This Is Rich: Democrats Fight To Protect A $1.8 Trillion Tax Break That Benefits The Top 1%If Tax Cuts Can 'Change American Life,' Then Gov't Really Is Too BigThe Latest Tax Cut Lie: The Senate Bill Will Hurt The PoorClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

226,NOV,"Amid heightened market uncertainty, your stocks to watch are five high-profile names struggling to find support at their 50-day moving average: Facebook (FB), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Mastercard (MA) and Paycom Software (PAYC).X Facebook has now given back all of its gains from its 175.59 breakout, closing Friday at 175.10. That's also just below Facebook's 50-day moving average.The 50-day line is a key level of support or resistance for stocks, and in some cases, a stock's action at the 50-day could be a chance to buy additional shares.Facebook fell 2.1% to 171.47 on the stock market today after falling as low as 170.79. Facebook briefly rose above its 50-day line and entry point soon after the open.Google parent Alphabet found support above the 50-day line on Friday, closing at 1,025.07. But shares skidded 1.3% to 1,011.87 on Monday, below their 50-day. Alphabet is still above its 1,006.29 entry point, but has fallen for five straight sessions.Nvidia's chart action shows the importance of following proper profit-taking signals. After breaking out of a flat base with a 174.66 entry in September, shares became extended about 25% from that level some eight weeks later, which would have been a reasonable time to take some profits. Now, Nvidia has given back a considerable amount of those gains as it looks to hold near the 50-day. Nvidia fell 1.5% to 197.68 on Friday, closing just below its 50-day for the second time in three sessions.Nvidia briefly retook its 50-day but then reversed lower, tumbling 5.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Looking for the latest chart analysis on more top growth names?

The stock is now extended after clearing a narrow pullback that offered an extra entry point at 223.92.The ideal buy point was triggered on Oct. 26, when the stock lifted past a 191.48 entry in a saucer with handle. The next day, shares soared more than 12% in vigorous volume on an excellent third quarter (earnings up 32% to $2.79 a share, revenue up 22% to $544 million).SVB is one of just three superregionals that sport a Composite Rating on IBD Stock Checkup of 90 or higher. The other two are Comerica (CMA) (91 Comp) and Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) (90).Target (TGT), up nearly 3% to 69.48 in fast turnover,  has formed a bottoming base and could create a new buy point if resistance remains near 70.The discount retailing titan, which reported upbeat same-store sales growth of 3.4% for November and December combined, offered aggressive buy points at both 63.20 and 63.72 within its bottoming base, a bullish pattern after a near-cataclysmic decline.PayPal (PYPL) broke out of a narrow flat base at 79.48 but is stalling. The digital payments expert got as high as 80.39 intraday before gains melted to just 0.4%.

232,NOV,"Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) turned its unsolicited bid for Qualcomm (QCOM) into a hostile takeover attempt Monday by announcing plans to nominate its own slate to entirely replace Qualcomm's 11-member board of directors.X Broadcom's board and other proposals are expected to be put to a vote by shareholders at Qualcomm's 2018 annual meeting, scheduled for March 6.Broadcom said Qualcomm refuses to negotiate so it decided to take its offer directly to shareholders in a proxy fight.""Although we are taking this step, it remains our strong preference to engage in a constructive dialogue with Qualcomm,"" Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan said in a news release. ""We have repeatedly attempted to engage with Qualcomm, and despite stockholder and customer support for the transaction, Qualcomm has ignored those opportunities. The nominations give Qualcomm stockholders an opportunity to voice their disappointment with Qualcomm's directors and their refusal to engage in discussions with us.""In its own news release, Qualcomm on Monday acknowledged receipt of Broadcom's nomination of a slate of candidates to replace Qualcomm's existing board of directors. The San Diego-based company reiterated its go-it-alone strategy.""No company in the industry is better positioned than Qualcomm in mobile, IoT (internet of things), automotive, edge computing and networking and to lead the transition to 5G (wireless),"" Tom Horton, Qualcomm's presiding director, said in release. ""Qualcomm stockholders expect a board that will support this innovation while evaluating objectively the full range of opportunities available to maximize value for all Qualcomm stockholders.""Qualcomm criticized Broadcom's proposed acquisition and highlighted the many uncertainties associated with it, including regulatory hurdles and lack of committed financing.Broadcom shares lost 2.9% to close at 263.61 on the stock market today. Qualcomm dropped 1.4% to finish at 64.56.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on chip stocks, visit IBD's news page Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News.Broadcom remains confident that it can clear any regulatory requirements needed to complete the deal, including satisfying antitrust authorities, Tan said.""In light of the significant value our proposal provides for Qualcomm stockholders, we believe Qualcomm stockholders would be better served by new independent, highly qualified nominees who are committed to maximizing value and acting in the best interests of Qualcomm stockholders,"" Tan said.Qualcomm on Nov. 13 rejected Broadcom's cash-and-stock offer, which at the time of the Nov. 6 bid was worth $130 billion, including $25 billion of net debt. Qualcomm said the offer undervalues the company. Under the proposed offer, Broadcom would pay $70 in cash and stock for each share of Qualcomm.

234,NOV,"Even as Brexit talks lurch from one hurdle to another, the pound is enjoying a rising wave of confidence among investors and analysts.Aberdeen Standard Investments recently added to sterling long positions, betting it will rally in 2018 as Britain and the European Union make better progress in their negotiations than the market expects. The currency will also benefit from the prospect of interest-rate increases by the Bank of England, according to the U.K. firm and JPMorgan Asset Management. Strategists at SEB AB recommend buying the pound while those at Nomura International see room for gains next year.Option-market sentiment on sterling is now the most bullish in two months and it is one of this quarter's top performers among major currencies against both the dollar and euro. Concessions made by Britain last week on the contentious Brexit bill suggests the likelihood of further ""U.K. capitulation"" on other topics, allowing a transitional deal and giving the BOE a green light to raise rates, according to Nomura strategists, including Jordan Rochester.""There is too much pessimism about the path of the U.K. economy,"" said James Athey, a senior investment manager at Aberdeen Standard, which oversees a total of 670 billion pounds ($899 billion) in assets worldwide. ""There's too much pessimism on the negotiations and the future relations with the EU, and I think BOE interest rates will be higher by the end of 2018. I am still long sterling and I've added to that position recently.""The pound slipped 0.4% to $1.3425 as of 10:10 a.m. in London on Tuesday, after the U.K. and the EU failed to get a much-hoped-for breakthrough on Brexit with the issue of an Irish border derailing a tentative deal. Against the euro, sterling was 0.4% weaker at 88.33 pence. Still, three-month risk reversals in the British currency against the dollar, a measure of the appetite for bullish options relative to bearish ones, traded near the highest since Oct. 5 reached on Tuesday.The increased sterling optimism is also evident from Bloomberg currency surveys. About a fourth of the predictions see the pound rising to $1.40, a level not since the Brexit referendum, in the coming year. A year ago, there were no forecasts for that level to be met in 2017.Aberdeen Standard's Athey prefers to express pound optimism against the euro rather than the dollar, saying that there has been ""far too much exuberance"" in Europe's shared currency. He sees sterling strengthening almost 10% to 80 pence per euro ""over the medium term.""Selling the euro against the pound with a target of 80 pence is among the top 2018 trade recommendations from SEB strategists, including Richard Falkenhall. Nomura is ""still short euro-sterling, looking for 0.87 and pound-dollar to break its September highs and approach $1.40 in the new year,"" strategists at the bank wrote in a client note dated Nov. 28.Aberdeen Standard's Athey and Nicholas Gartside, chief investment officer for fixed income at JPMorgan Asset, see room for the BOE to raise its benchmark rate twice next year, compared with current money-market pricing for a single 25-basis-point increase by November 2018.While uncertainties around the U.K.'s exit from the EU still linger, the fact that the pound is set to end the year stronger shows markets are becoming less sensitive to the ups and downs of the protracted Brexit process, according to Gartside. With a little more clarity on Brexit and a likely transition deal, there was ""no reason"" for the pound not to climb toward $1.40 next year, he said in an interview.""A no deal exit"" would be ""accompanied by substantial wealth losses in both the U.K. and EU,"" SEB analysts wrote in a client note last week. ""Given the size of the risk premium, a breakthrough in negotiations would most likely trigger a substantial sterling recovery in 2018. Partly, this may even happen in December if exit talks progress sufficiently to open up negotiations on the future relationship between the EU and U.K.""

235,NOV,"Treading cautiously into the field of kids and social media, Facebook (FB) on Monday unveiled a new messaging app for children with parental controls.X Based on its Messenger platform, which has about 1.2 billion users, Messenger Kids will be available for use on Apple smartphones and tablets, and can be monitored and controlled from a parent's Facebook account. Facebook said an Android version would be available ""in the coming months.""In advance of launching its first app for kids, Facebook spent more than 18 months working closely with leading child development experts and educators, said a blog post on Monday by Antigone Davis, Facebook's public policy director and global head of safety.""We know that when building for kids, we have to get it right and we're taking that responsibility seriously,"" Davis wrote.If all goes well for Facebook, Messenger Kids could be another new market for the social media giant to cultivate and monetize.Using data from research firm Dubit, Facebook said some 93% of kids age 6 to 12 in the U.S. have access to tablets or smartphones, and 66% have their own device. Facebook also said that based on a survey of more than 1,200 parents with children under the age of 13, roughly 60% say those kids use messaging apps, social media or both.In developing its first app for kids, Facebook said it interviewed ""thousands of parents"" and engaged with more than a dozen expert advisors in the areas of child development, online safety and children's media and technology.IBD's TAKE: Establishing a new market, or a new approach to an existing market, is the key to the kind of innovation represented by the N in the CAN SLIM investing methodology.Once a parent sets up an account for their child, kids can start a one-on-one or group video chat with parent-approved contacts. The home screen shows them at a glance who they are approved to talk to, and when those contacts are online.In addition to video chat, kids can send photos, videos or text messages to their parent-approved friends and adult relatives, who will receive the messages via their regular Messenger app, Facebook said.The Messenger Kids app is only available in the U.S. at this time on the Apple App Store. It will be coming to the Google Play Store in the coming months.Facebook shares fell 2.1% to close at 171.47 on the stock market today.

236,NOV,"The U.K.'s Cineworld Group agreed to buy U.S. theater operator Regal Entertainment Group (RGC) for about $3.6 billion to expand into the biggest movie market.X The $23-a-share deal comes a week after the companies confirmed news reports of takeover discussions, jolting cinema-operator stocks. The price represents a 26% premium to Regal's close on Nov. 27, the day before discussions became public.Regal Entertainment rose 7.2% to 22.25 before the opening bell on the stock market today.Cineworld will gain opportunities for growth outside Britain, where consumer spending is falling ahead of the country's exit from the European Union. Movie-theater operators are consolidating to wring out costs and afford reclining chairs and expanded food-and-drink options to entice customers away from their Netflix (NFLX) binges at home.""The joint group is going to create the best place to watch a movie,"" Cineworld Chief Executive Officer Mooky Greidinger said in an interview Tuesday. Cinemas remain the ""key drivers"" of the industry, not home entertainment, he said. ""The place to premier the big movies is in the cinemas.""Shares of Cineworld fell 2.7% to 531.50 pence at 12:32 p.m. in London, bringing their decline this year to about 6%. The stock is down 19% since news of the talks emerged.Cineworld is expanding in the U.S. as the country's theater chains are struggling with stagnating movie attendance. Many films this year have failed to meet expectations at the box office, and the summer season — usually the most lucrative for the industry  — was the worst since 2006.""The fact that if, in a certain year, there is a drop of 2 or 3 percent, it's not the end of the world,"" Greidinger said. Bigger movies still draw larger audiences and those who watch Netflix and Amazon at home are still likely to go to the theaters, he said.Cineworld has been refurbishing movie theaters in the U.K., Europe and Israel to offer ""top of the class"" facilities, Greidinger said, including wider seats, a variety of food offerings, better sound systems and bigger screens.The deal will give the companies $150 million a year in pretax savings and structural synergies, Cineworld estimates. Changes it's considering include modernizing Regal's movie theaters and ticketing systems, people familiar with the offer said last week, asking not to be identified as the deliberations were private.Billionaire Philip Anschutz's Anschutz Corp. has agreed to provide its written consent to back the deal, the only Regal shareholder action required to approve the transaction, Cineworld said. Cineworld is funding the deal with debt and equity sold through a rights issue of about 1.7 billion pounds ($2.3 billion).The equity sale is set to cause ""indigestion"" for Cineworld shares in the short term, Peel Hunt analysts Douglas Jack and Ivor Jones said in a note to clients, lowering their rating to hold from add. ""The long-term investment proposition has fundamentally changed as a result of higher debt and earnings becoming heavily dominated by mature markets,"" the analysts said.The offer follows a buying spree by AMC Entertainment (AMC), the biggest U.S. exhibitor, whose shares have plunged 58% since the start of the year over concerns about its mounting debt. AMC paid about $3 billion including debt to pick up American rival Carmike Cinemas, Europe's Odeon & UCI Cinemas Group. and a smaller Swedish chain called Nordic Cinema.The deal will bring the number of Cineworld screens to 9,542 in the U.S. and Europe, making it the No. 2 theater chain in the world by that metric, the company said in a  statement. In 2014, Cineworld bought Polish Cinema City International for about 500 million pounds and it acquired small, more highbrow U.K. chain Picturehouse for 47 million pounds in 2012.The takeover would leave the two biggest U.S. chains under foreign ownership, as AMC has been controlled by Wang Jianlin's Dalian Wanda Group of China since 2012. Regal unsuccessfully tried to sell itself in 2014.

But Bitcoin bounced back.X PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) fell 0.5%, while SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) gave up nearly 0.2% each. Small caps bucked the decline as iShares Core S&P Small Cap (IJR) and iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) climbed 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively.Apple gapped down and tumbled nearly 3% amid reduced iPhone X shipment forecasts from some analysts, due to weaker-than-expected demand. Shares are now 3% below a 176.34 flat-base buy point and are testing the 50-day moving average. Apple was the biggest loser on the Dow industrials.The Apple news weighed on chip suppliers and other tech stocks. Semiconductor, technology and banks were among the biggest decliners in the stock market today. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) and iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) slid more than 1% each.But oil, gold and retail advanced. SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) surged 2.1%, on track to extend its win streak for a sixth straight session. West Texas intermediate crude prices rose 2.3% to $59.81 a barrel. Gold futures, meanwhile, were up 0.7% to $1,287.50 an ounce.Bitcoin was up 13% at $15,558.02, according to CoinDesk, after a recent spike above the $16,000 level. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) gapped up and soared 21% as it continues a volatile streak. Shares ended Friday with a 12% gain after reversing from an intraday plunge of 35%, which sent the cryptocurrency below $11,000.Top-performing smart beta funds this year are a mixed bag of mostly growth, technology and emerging markets ETFs.PowerShares S&P Emerging Markets Momentum (EEMO) topped the list with a 45.8% year-to-date gain through Dec. 19, according to Morningstar Direct. PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors (PSI) came in second with a 43.5% return.That was followed by a pair of First Trust funds: First Trust Emerging Markets Small Cap AlphaDEX (FEMS) and First Trust Nasdaq 100 Technology Sector Index Fund (QTEC). Up next is Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY), which has gathered $280.9 million in assets since its April 2015 launch.Most of these funds have pulled back recently. But that could help create new buy opportunities in ETFs that have seemed out of reach for much of the year.QTEC could soon put hot Nasdaq 100 names such as Intel (INTC) and Micron Technology (MU) in play. The $2.2 billion fund, which launched in April 2006, has been testing support at its 50-day moving average this month.Shares rallied 17% from a late August rebound off the support line to their Nov. 24 high. The ETF tracks the index bearing the same name; the equal-weighted index is rebalanced four times a year and is reconstituted once a year. But replacements may occur during the year if they take place in the Nasdaq 100 index.Top holdings included Intel, NetEase (NTES), Micron Technology, KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Baidu (BIDU). Three of the top five are chip stocks, which have had a good year. Micron has surged 101%, KLA-Tencor 39% and Intel 29% through Dec. 22. Chinese internet plays NetEase and Baidu have rallied 70% and 45%, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: Are Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies real investments or a speculator's game? Individual investors should be extremely cautious about diving into this new area. Read this feature about Bitcoin risks and possible gains first. QTEC carries a 0.60% expense ratio.Friday's pick, iShares U.S. Medical Devices (IHI), continues to test support at its 50-day line.

It gives you an edge on Wall Street.The elements of an outstanding flat base do not change from bull market to bull market. Arista Networks (ANET) cleared a five-week flat base during the week ended Nov. 18, 2016, just days after the historic U.S. elections that year. The Sector Leader produced a bountiful gain of 180%. The S&P 500 rose 22.8% over the same time frame. Here are some of the major positives of that flat base.One: Look for a 30% prior uptrend or greater. Prefer stocks that prove they can run higher. Arista rallied 67% from a February 2016 low of 52.51 to the base's peak of 87.62.What about a new IPO? Gauge the gain from the initial pricing to the current price. Is it up substantially? Google operator Alphabet (GOOGL) ran up 33% after its August 2004 debut at 85 a share. Then it built the IPO base by which all future IPOs should be judged.Two: Few big weeks down in price. Arista needed only five weeks, the minimum required, to craft a good flat base. Arista dropped 5.5% in the first week (1). Not severe. Volume was light. Total correction within the entire base: just 10%.Three: Look for heavy institutional support. Find evidence that mutual funds, pensions, banks and insurers take advantage of dips, scooping shares. In the week ended Nov. 4, see Arista's bounce off the lows? Nice close in the upper half of the week's range (2). At 83.31, it closed just a dime below the 10-week line.Four: Does a stock have solid ratings? Arista did.Five: Does real volume come in at the breakout, or soon after? It did for Arista.On Nov. 14, turnover jumped 79% above the 50-day average of 665,000 shares. On Nov. 21, volume ballooned 237% above normal as shares soared 7%.

241,NOV,"We hear it all the time from stock market beginners to seasoned pros: Selling is the toughest part of investing.The reason? Emotions run high when facing a sell decision. Will the stock keep running higher without me? Is the recent sell-off a blip or the start of something much more serious?X How do you tame your doubts when locking in big profits or trimming a loss quickly? It all comes down to rules.Alibaba Group (BABA) is a case in point. The Chinese version of Amazon was a top-performing Leaderboard stock that got sent to the Cut List when it broke a simple rule.The removal actually rested on the stock's behavior in the months prior, as much as its action Dec. 1, when it was kicked out of the Leaders List with a profit of almost 60%.Alibaba went on Leaderboard April 10, as it cleared an alternate buy point at 110.55.  It was the next opportunity after a buy point at 101.67 from a cup with handle had passed. No matter, the Chinese online retail and internet powerhouse continued to climb with abandon. In fact, it didn't really break below the short-term 10-day moving average until early August.During the summer months, the stock made a series of modest pullbacks and new highs. That became an ascending base, an unusual pattern that tends to occur when a stock defies a sputtering general market.Alibaba broke out past the 177.10 buy point Sept. 13 (1). From that moment, however, the stock started having difficulties. There was little follow through on the breakout, and shares dipped below the 50-day moving average for the first time in the run Oct. 25 (2).A couple of days later, Alibaba was right back above the 50-day line, so there was no real threat. The company announced quarterly results Nov. 2, which happened to be the stock's peak. Despite a 63% surge in earnings and a 47% rise in sales, Alibaba failed to impress investors. Shares were aimless for several weeks, and Leaderboard editors started contemplating taking profits.The Nov. 29 sell-off in technology stocks shoved the stock below the 50-day line, this time with a deeper penetration below the line than any time in its advance (3). Volume was sharply higher than average that day and several that followed. The relative strength line had flattened out, which was another factor in the decision.But what really triggered the sell was the first close below the 10-week moving average in volume spike 36% above average. It was the first true break of support in the entire run — a clear sell signal (4). Once a stock has run up for more than 18 weeks, such a break of support takes on greater significance.Importantly, the 60% profit was more than sufficient to justify Alibaba's exit on Dec. 1 (5). Since then, Alibaba has remained below the 50-day line.Not all such breaks of the 10-week mean a stock is finished for good. Sometimes a deeper, longer base forms. But look at enough big winners and you'll see this recurring signal that big investors are bailing.With Leaderboard, investors can get the needed guidance, as market specialists study the selected stocks and annotate charts with the latest signals.

243,NOV,"Stocks were quiet ahead of the long weekend as Nike (NKE) weighed and Bitcoin continued a volatile week of trade. Apple (AAPL) was flat.X SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) and PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) fell 0.2% each, while SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) gave up 0.1%. Emerging markets extended their gains for a third straight session as iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) rose 0.8% in the stock market today.Nike provided the biggest drag on the Dow with a 3% tumble. Apple, meanwhile, was flat after entering positive territory. It's less than 1% below a 176.34 flat-base buy point it initially crossed on Monday.Telecom, banks and health care led the downside among sector funds. Gold miners, energy and real estate were among the biggest gainers. Gold futures leapt 0.7% to $1,278.90 an ounce; West Texas intermediate crude prices were about flat at $58.35 a barrel.Bitcoin crashed pared its loss 10% at $13,979.01, according to CoinDesk, after earlier jumping to nearly the $16K level.

"
244,NOV,"Apple (AAPL) continued to trade tightly after a high-volume gap up in price Dec. 18 as the stock market nursed modest losses Friday heading into the Christmas holiday weekend. The equity markets in the U.S. are closed Monday.X Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), which triggered a short-term sell signal Wednesday when it clipped the 10-day moving average in heavy trading, nearly completed a round trip of its mind-blowing ascent after breaking out Nov. 22. On that day, the Bitcoin-tracking ETF hurdled over a 985.10 buy point in a very deep cup with handle, then sprinted as much as 229% higher in less than four weeks' time.But on Friday, the ETF plunged to as low as 1,155, at one point reducing its post-breakout gain to just 17%. But in the late afternoon shares rebounded for a strong gain and got as high as 2,015. Volume at one point raced nearly triple its 50-day average pace.The average turnover is now 120,000 shares a day, up from 60,000 shares just a month ago.For now, Bitcoin traders who wish to find the next proper buy point in Bitcoin Investment Trust should watch to see if the 50-day moving average, which has lagged far behind the ETF's recent rush higher, provides continued support to the upside.Traders should also see if it forms a new proper base that offers a low-risk entry.The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average all posted declines of around 0.1% to 0.2%. At 6949, the Nasdaq remains in a solid uptrend. According to IBD's The Big Picture, heavy selling by institutions has waned as only three key distribution days now remain over the past 25 trading sessions.The S&P SmallCap 600 was also off less than 0.2%. The index, at 940, is up 12.2% since Jan. 1, severely lagging a 19.8% lift year to date for the S&P 500.Over the past four weeks, oil drilling, department store, consumer electronics retail, airline, hospital, coal, steel and auto parts retail stocks were among the biggest winners, all running 11% or higher.Going back to Apple, the stock remains extended from a 160.97 entry in a second-stage cup with handle. It's also tried to clear a new flat base that could be seen as part of a base on base pattern.Apple initially broke out this year by climbing out of a first-stage bottoming base, an excellent cup with handle that supplied a 118.12 buy point. Since that breakout on Jan. 6-9, the iPhone marketer has run up as much as 49%. The S&P 500 has risen as much as 20.4% since Jan. 1.To find the buy point in a cup with handle, look for the highest price within the handle section, then add a dime. The handle should show controlled shakeout, as the stock falls briefly after forming the right side of the cup. In Apple's case, the stock took roughly five weeks to form the left side, six weeks to shape the cup's right side, then six trading sessions, starting with the mild pullback on Dec. 28, 2016, to finish up the excellent platform from which the stock broke out and ultimately reached all-time highs.Prospects for a rosy 2018 for the largest company in the U.S. equity markets by market value look intact.Technically, the megacap tech continues to sculpt a steady uptrend. And the stock has been able to overcome pullbacks to or below the 10-week moving average (roughly equivalent to a 50-day moving average on a daily chart.)Fundamentally, the iPhone and MacBook marketer presents additional reasons for institutions to keep investing in the stock.All of Apple's proprietary ratings on IBD Stock Checkup have improved significantly over the past 12 months. For instance, on Jan. 1, Apple's Composite Rating was a mediocre 51; today, it's 94 on a scale of 1 to 99. The EPS Rating has risen from 45 to 90 over the same time frame.That improvement reflects a new string of double-digit top and bottom-line growth in recent quarters and expectations such gains will continue. Analyst surveyed by Thomson Reuters see earnings in the December-ending fiscal first quarter rising a decent 12% to $3.77 a share on a 10% jump in revenue to $86.23 billion.Among the 32 individual analyst estimates for fiscal Q1, the highest EPS estimate is $3.92, which would mark a 16.7% year-over-year gain.That figure doesn't even compare with the consensus estimate of 39% growth in earnings to $2.91 a share in fiscal Q2 (the January-March quarter).Revenue is seen accelerating in Q2, up 30% to $68.75 billion. The services segment is one big driver, and Apple seems poised to deliver on CEO Tim Cook's pledge to double the company's services-related sales by 2020.Also, Apple pays a dividend that has been rising over the long term. The current annualized dividend yield of 1.4% trails that of the S&P 500, but long-term annual dividend growth is currently 10%.Meanwhile, Nike (NKE) is bouncing hard from steep early losses as it keeps a breakout from a long, deep bottoming base intact. The shoe and athletic apparel titan broke out of a first-stage cup with handle at 57.35 last month and has rallied as much as 13%. It's likely to snap a six-week win streak.Late Thursday, Nike reported an 8% dip in fiscal second-quarter profit to 46 cents a share on a 5% jump in revenue. The EPS dip was smaller than a 22% slide in the August-ended first quarter.Nike's ratings have also shown improvement, including an 83 Relative Price Strength Rating and an A for Accumulation/Distribution, signifying strong fund buying on net over the past 13 weeks.RELATED:This Bitcoin ETF Just Hit A Sell SignalWhat You Can Learn From The Arista Networks BreakoutHot Growth Stocks For 2018: A Peek Inside IBD 50How To Find Outstanding Stock Market Winners: Follow This Simple Routine

245,NOV,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages hit record highs as Congress finally passed the $1.5 trillion Trump tax cut plan. Chevron (CVX) was one of several oil and commodity stocks to moved past buy points. Bitcoin fell sharply as CME futures launched and more companies joined the blockchain craze. Micron Technology (MU), Red Hat (RHT), Nike (NKE), Darden Restaurants (DRI) and Winnebago (WGO) were notable earnings reports while economic data were generally upbeat.X The S&P 500, Dow industrials and Nasdaq set all-time bests on Monday ahead of Congress' approval of tax cuts on Wednesday, then moved sideways. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose 0.3% for the week and the Dow 0.4%. Energy stocks, which could be big winners under the new 21% corporate tax rate, were leaders, with Chevron, Diamondback Energy (FANG) and several other oil plays to hit buy zones. There were several notable earnings reports as companies got ready for the post-Christmas week.Bitcoin futures from CME Group (CME), the world's biggest futures exchange, launched on Sunday with an opening trade at $20,650, but tumbled to just under $14,000 Friday, in sync with Cboe (CBOE) Bitcoin futures. Spot prices tumbled intraday below $11,000. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that Goldman Sachs (GS) was developing a trading desk for cryptocurrencies, with a possible debut in June, which would make it the first big bank to be a cryptocurrency market maker. And amid a growing market fixation on anything blockchain, Long Island Iced Tea Corp. vaulted a cool 183% Thursday after the iced-tea seller said it was rebranding itself as Long Blockchain (LTEA) to focus on ""the exploration of and investment in opportunities that leverage the benefits of blockchain technology.""Diamondback Energy (FANG) broke out in strong volume Wednesday, with Chevron (CVX), Concho Resources (CXO) among those clearing buy points on Thursday. BPBP, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) were among those breaking out in less-impressive trade. Energy stocks are seen as big winners from the tax cuts, while crude prices are holding at two-year highs. U.S. crude inventories fell in the latest week but production hit yet another high. Saudi Arabia reportedly is looking at buying natural gas shale assets in Texas. Meanwhile, several mining stocks, including Vale (VALE) and Rio Tinto (RIO), also broke out.Memory-chip maker Micron Technology (MU) beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal first quarter and guided much higher than views for the current quarter. Micron earned an adjusted $2.45 a share in the quarter ended Nov. 30, up nearly eight times the 32 cents reported in the year-earlier period. Sales rose 71% to $6.8 billion. Analysts expected Micron to earn $2.20 a share on sales of $6.39 billion. For the current quarter, Micron expects to earn an adjusted $2.58 a share on sales of $7 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street had been modeling $1.95 and $6.08 billion. Shares rose 4%.Consumer spending and the housing market turned it up a notch in November as the economy fires on pretty much all cylinders. Third-quarter GDP growth was revised down a tick to 3.2%, still the best pace since the first quarter of 2015, as business investment extended its recent strength. Consumer spending rose 0.6% on the month, while wages rose 0.4%. Consumers saved just 2.9% of income in November, the weakest in a decade, which is probably a reflection of greater optimism in the economic outlook. Existing-home sales surged 5.6% to a 5.81 million annual pace, the best in 11 years, as the supply of homes for sale got even tighter. New-home sales skyrocketed 17.5%.Nike (NKE) reported a 5% sales drop in North America, its second straight quarterly decline. But the No. 1 sports brand comfortably topped expectations as Q2 profit fell 8% to 46 cents a share and revenue rose 5% to $8.55 billion vs. views for 39 cents EPS and $8.39 billion. China sales rose 15%. Adidas (ADDYY), Under Armour (UAA) and Puma are creeping on Nike's tail, but a recent Cowen survey said Nike is still the top sports footwear present expected under Christmas trees this year. Shares fell 2.3% Friday.FedEx (FDX) easily beat Q2 forecasts, delivering 14% EPS growth to $3.18 while revenue grew 9% to $16.31 billion, and raised guidance to $12.70-$13.30 per diluted share for the year, up from prior outlook for $12-$12.80. FedEx Express revenue rose over 8%, Ground segment revenue grew 12%, and Freight sales rose 10%. Shares rose 4.15%. The report come as FedEx and UPS (UPS) are in peak holiday delivery season, having beefed up staffing to meet delivery goals. UPS has encountered some delays in getting packages to customers.Red Hat (RHT) reported Q3 profit that edged views while revenue, operating margin, and billings also topped estimates. The open source Linux software company is ramping revenue from new products — OpenShift and OpenStack — for hybrid cloud computing, analysts said. For the current quarter Red Hat estimated revenue in the range of $758 million to $763 million, above the consensus of $755 million. It projects adjusted earnings of 81 cents, topping the consensus estimate of 75 cents. Full-year revenue guidance was raised by $21 million at the midpoint to $2.906 billion. But shares sank 4.55%.Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants (DRI) reported adjusted second-quarter earnings of 73 cents, up 14%, while revenue rose 14.6% to $1.88 billion, both beating views. Same-restaurant sales rose 3.1% overall. Darden also raised its full-year guidance. Meanwhile, Jack in the Box (JACK) agreed to sell its Qdoba burrito chain to Apollo Global Management (APO), the latest private-equity buyout of a restaurant chain in 2017.RV icon Winnebago (WGO) on Wednesday trounced Q1 earnings views. Shares fell 4.6% Wednesday amid concerns about creeping costs in its motor home segment, but closed up 0.7% for the week. REV Group (REVG), which sells RVs along with an array of specialty vehicles missed quarterly estimates. But the recent IPO rebounded from a steep Wednesday morning loss soar 11% for the week, hitting record highs.Stitch Fix (SFIX) topped estimates in its first-ever earnings report. Analysts said they were impressed with the online tailor's performance, with revenue of $295.6 million, up 25%. Concerns were raised, however, about the Stitch Fix's declining gross margin amid heavy capital expenditures. The recent IPO fell 9.8% on Wednesday but rose 5.6% for the week.Accenture (ACN) reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that topped expectations. The Dublin-based global tech consulting and services said it earned $1.79 a share, up 13%, with revenue rising 12% to  $9.5 billion.Biogen (BIIB) reported that a much-followed experimental Alzheimer's drug did not meet success criteria after 12 months in a Phase 2 trial. The study will continue to 18 months. Shares fell 3.3% on Thursday.Cintas (CTAS) saw earnings climb 14% to $1.31 in its fiscal second quarter. Revenue rose 24% to $1.61 billion. Both beat estimates. Cintas also raised full-year guidance. Shares of the IBD 50 stock and workwear provider reversed from a record high Friday to close the week down a fraction.Boeing (BA) and Embraer (ERJ) confirmed they are in talks, sending the Brazilian jet maker sharply higher. But Brazil's government reportedly is opposed to an outright sale.

246,NOV,"Finding safe income has been tough since the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates in 2008's Great Recession. Stock dividend yields have been stingy lately too. And now the prospect of rising interest rates and a new Fed chief threaten to turn retirees' quest for income into a fresh Rubik's Cube.X But money managers looking at expected market conditions in the coming year have created strategies to squeeze the most income from investments without adding excessive risk.The key is diversification across bond maturities and credit quality while avoiding high-yielding stocks and corporate bonds with weak earnings and balance sheets.You can do it, despite the absence of the average 5.87% yield on 10-year Treasuries dating back to 1953. Recently it's been a paltry 2.5%. And bonds face the added hazard of price declines that erode interest income if rising rates draw away investors to new bonds bearing higher coupons.Top Dividend Fund Manager Expects Growth In These Three SectorsDoes Steady Earnings Growth Lead To Big Dividends?Shifting Global Markets Offer Income Investors Ripening OpportunitiesChase For Yield Risky This Late In Credit CycleInvestors have to hunt for decent dividend yields as well. The S&P 500's trailing 12-month yield has averaged about 2% since the Fed dropped short-term rates to nearly 0% in late 2008. That's way below the average 4.37% dating back to 1871.So how can retirees and other investors build income-producing portfolios for the year ahead?Jim Swanson, chief investment strategist at MFS Investment Management and lead portfolio manager of $4.1 billion MFS Diversified Income Fund (DIFAX), said avoiding risk requires resisting temptation. ""The first message for individual investors is not to be attracted to the highest yielding parts of the world,"" he said.Frontier Communications (FTR) pays a whopping dividend yield of 30.3%, but that's largely due to an 83% cratering of its share price this year through Nov. 24. General Electric (GE) has a 5.2% yield, but the troubled conglomerate's shares have plunged 42%. And it recently announced a halving of its dividend — only its second payout cut since the Great Depression — and plans to restructure the company.By most accounts, with Jerome Powell undergoing Senate confirmation as the next Fed chief, the central bank will remain on a path of small and steady rate increases.Rising rates mean investors should be wary of locking into bonds with maturities longer than, say, one year. ""More reward for taking longer risk is not common right now,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade (AMTD).On the plus side, income investors could get some relief on taxes. ""Whatever Congress does with tax rates, we've been waiting for a long time, so it will be nice to have some clarity,"" said Jane Shoemake, an investment director for Janus Henderson's global equity income team.To diversify and reduce the risk of any one category tanking, money managers like BlackRock's Michael Fredericks have been favoring higher-yielding nontraditional asset classes, which are outside the realm of blue chip stocks and investment-grade bonds.Several nontraditional mutual fund categories offer attractive yields. Preferred stock funds tracked by Morningstar Direct averaged an SEC yield of 4.06% as of Nov. 24, emerging markets local currency funds averaged 5.57%, bank-loan mutual funds averaged 3.74% and U.S. real estate funds averaged 1.96%.IBD'S TAKE: Looking for actionable stocks? Check out our Stock Lists page, where you can find stocks near buy zones, stocks hitting new highs, sector leaders, tech leaders, IPO leaders and more.You can find mutual funds that mix categories like those with traditional categories. Fredericks' $16.4 billion BlackRock Multi-Asset Income Fund (BIICX) had a yield of 4.20% as of Nov. 24, while its Morningstar tactical allocation peer group averaged 1.84%. That topped the 1.02% yield by stock mutual funds tracking the S&P 500.So using tactical allocation funds, which are multiasset portfolios, is one way to crack the income code. But do your homework. Higher yielding funds may have lower total returns.One way to shrink that risk is to invest in more than one tactical allocation, multiasset income-oriented fund.Still, tactical allocation, multiasset funds have a built-in limit. They're best for investors who don't want to put a lot of energy into portfolio construction and periodic rebalancing, says Roger Aliaga-Diaz, Vanguard's chief economist for the Americas.If you want more customized diversification, you can invest in a variety of funds that expose you to additional asset classes with potentially high yields and returns.You could knit together an all-star lineup that includes, say, BlackRock Multi-Asset Income plus, for instance, exposure to the broad stock market through $367.5 billion Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFINX), with its 1.82% yield.You could plug in additional asset classes. Among bank-loan funds, you could add $1.5 billion MainStay Floating Rate (MXFIX), whose 6.08% yield topped its category. Its year-to-date return was 3.64%.You could add REIT funds. At 3.84%, $5.4 billion Fidelity Real Estate Income (FRIFX) was the top yield in its category among funds fully open to investors. Its return so far in 2017 was 7.36%.Among preferred stock funds to consider, $343 million Orinda Income Opportunities (OIOIX) boasted the best yield, at 5.75%. Still, its 6.10% year-to-date return lagged the group average.Want some foreign spice in your portfolio? Among emerging markets local-currency bond funds, $4 billion Pimco Emerging Local Bond's (PELBX) year-to-date return of 13.37% tops the category's average of 12.94%. The fund's 6.22% yield tops the category average.Just remember that the emerging markets peer group is volatile.And putting together your own diversified portfolio of income-oriented funds entails potential hazards of its own. ""The risk is that you may end up with just overall market performance, but end up paying too much,"" MFS's Swanson said. You could also lose track of what one or more funds are doing and end ""up with a random mix of ill-understood or ill-fitting strategies,"" Swanson said.Multi-asset managers also use more exotic strategies, which an individual investor can also use, either in the form of funds or directly, such as closed-end funds (CEFs). Many pay relatively high yield.Mutual funds and ETFs enable investors to fine-tune their portfolios. Just make sure that the strategy and holdings of each fund that you consider accurately reflect the fund's name and match your investment goals, Kinahan says.Do-it-yourself investors can aim for a portfolio custom-tailored to their needs. In contrast, multi-asset funds are designed for a theoretical, average investor, says Vanguard's Aliaga-Diaz. He added, ""Ideally, every investor would construct his or her own custom portfolio using either mutual funds or ETFs in a way that is completely tailored to his or her individual investment goals, risk tolerance, potential liquidity needs and investment horizon.""RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomePsst, Millennials!

247,NOV,"U.S. stock indexes got off to a strong start Monday but were giving back part of their gains at midday. The S&P 500 added 0.5% after being up 0.8%, while the Nasdaq subtracted 0.5%.XThe blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average popped 0.9%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 gained nearly 0.4%. The S&P SmallCap 600 raced almost 1.2% higher.Volume in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges.Blue-chips bank advanced, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) gapped up more than 3% but then eased to a 2% gain. Volume was about 350% above its average pace. Goldman Sachs (GS) glided more than 2% higher and then slowed to a 0.7% gain.JPMorgan is 12% past a 95.32 buy point from a late-September breakout and about 9% above a recent bounce off its 50-day line. Goldman is about 2% above a 247.17 buy point. Goldman and JPMorgan are on track for their fifth straight daily gains.Banks are benefiting from increasing conviction that interest rates will go higher. CME Group's FedWatch Tool pegs the odds of a quarter-point rate hike this month at 90.2%, down from 96.7% Friday. The odds for a half-point hike are at 9.8%, up from 3.3%. The Federal Reserve holds its final meeting of the year on interest rates on Dec. 12-13.A half-point increase remains a stretch, but the mere mention underlines the conviction that rates are going higher. Higher interest rates are expected to boost bank profits.Breakouts in the bank sector Monday included Citigroup (C), which cleared a 76.24 buy point in strong volume. Bank of New York Mellon (BK) was trying to cross above a 55.39 buy point.Citigroup's breakout comes from a first-stage base, which is bullish.Monday's action marketwide appeared to reflect possible rotation out of the chip sector as well as bullishness from the Senate's passage of the Republican tax-cut bill. The chipmaker, chip designer and chip equipment groups were each down 1% to more than 2% at midday.The House and Senate versions of the tax plan need to be reconciled, but there's a chance that the legislation may get to President Trump's desk later this month. Randy Frederick, Charles Schwab's vice president of trading and derivatives, recently pointed out that the tax cuts could be made retroactive, which would apply additional power to the bullish trend.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, more than half of the day's top 16 gainers were from the retail sector. Chip stocks were among the day's leading losers.Chip equipment maker Ichor Holdings (ICHR) dropped 7%. Chip designer Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell 6%. Impinj (PI) also skidded 6%.The chip sector has been slipping as the tax-cut package comes closer to completion. The sell-off could be profit-taking, since the tax package was expected to be helpful to chip stocks. The Semiconductor Industry Association said in a Nov. 29 news release that the tax legislation ""includes several important provisions to make U.S. semiconductor companies more globally competitive. These include lowering the corporate rate to 20%.""Financial reports were on the light side Monday. Factory orders for October rolled in at -0.1% vs. the consensus view for a 0.4% decline.

249,NOV,"The $67.5 billion CVS Health (CVS) takeover of Aetna (AET) will test the Trump administration's approach to far-reaching corporate takeovers, just weeks after the U.S. government sued to block a major telecommunications merger.X The health-care deal unveiled Sunday would create an industry giant with over $240 billion in annual sales with a hand in insurance, prescription drug plan administration, retail pharmacies and corner clinics. The companies said the combination will save $750 million in costs and bring consumers better, more efficient health care.In the past, deals combining companies up and down a chain of business — such as a supplier and a distributor — have been viewed as posing less anticompetitive risk than combinations of direct rivals. Last month, however, the Justice Department sued to block just such a ""vertical"" merger between AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX), saying it would harm consumers and limit their media content options.""We are obviously going to get some scrutiny,"" said Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini. ""We are prepared to deal with whatever comes along to make this work.""Aetna shares were trading at $184.84 at 6:33 a.m. in New York, well below CVS's $207-a-share offer for the company — a sign investors are skeptical the deal will close at the current price.How much scrutiny the deal gets from the government may depend on which federal agency reviews the takeover — the Justice Department, or the Federal Trade Commission.Both scenarios present obstacles.The FTC has typically handled mergers of retail businesses like CVS. While it allowed Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) to buy more than 1,900 Rite Aid (RAD) stores earlier this year, the deal had to be significantly scaled down to gain the regulator's approval. The Justice Department, meanwhile, successfully sued to block insurance mergers between Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI), and Aetna and Humana (HUM).In the past, vertical deals have typically won approval after companies agree to restrictions on how they operate.That may be changing. The Justice Department's new antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has criticized past settlements that allowed vertical deals with behavioral restrictions. In a speech last month, Delrahim said such conditions don't work and force antitrust enforcers to become regulators.That view was behind Delrahim's decision on Nov. 20 to sue to block AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner, a vertical deal that would bring together Time Warner content like HBO with AT&T's pay-TV and wireless distribution.""Most vertical deals don't raise antitrust concerns, and the ones that do generally get approval to close with an agreement containing behavioral conditions,"" said Jennifer Rie, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst who follows antitrust issues, in an email. ""But the Justice Department appears to be rejecting this kind of remedy given its approach to the AT&T-Time Warner deal.""That doesn't mean there's heightened hostility toward vertical deals at the Justice Department, but CVS might prefer the Aetna deal to go to the FTC given Delrahim's criticism of behavioral fixes, said David Kully, an antitrust lawyer at Holland & Knight in Washington and a former Justice Department attorney.""Delrahim was very clear in his concerns about behavioral decrees and then put his money where his mouth is when he brought the AT&T case,"" Kully said.One point in favor of the CVS-Aetna deal is that there's already another large insurer with many of the characteristics of a combined health companies. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) offers health insurance, administers drug benefits and runs a growing network of doctors and clinics.But the CVS-Aetna combination takes integration to a new level with its 9,700 retail drugstores. It would also allow CVS to expand its 1,100 walk-in clinics, saving Aetna's insurance customers money by steering patients away from expensive hospital emergency rooms.A condition to an approval could be measures preventing Aetna from steering patients to CVS pharmacies over competitors such as Walgreens, said Rie, who noted that CVS may be better off if the FTC takes the review.One of the few areas where the companies directly overlap is in the Medicare drug business. CVS is already the largest provider of Medicare drug plans, and Aetna is the fifth largest, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.Michael Newshel, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said Aetna would likely need to divest some or all of its Medicare drug-benefits business in a CVS merger. He anticipates a deal would likely go through in the end no matter who reviewed it.The deal ""would definitely be scrutinized, but ultimately we still see a path for it to get through,"" Newshel said in an email. Evercore worked on the deal and Newshel said he's suspending his analyst coverage of Aetna.RELATED:CVS Will Buy Aetna, Reshaping Health Care As Amazon Looms

250,NOV,"CAN SLIM investing in growth stocks can be a good match with retirement plans? Why?When it comes to generating retirement income from stocks via dividend investing, capital gains still matter. That's the main ingredient of growth stocks, which IBD's CAN SLIM investing method favors.This sounds unconventional if one thinks the only ""sure"" way to generate retirement income from stocks is to load up on century-old blue chip stocks. Either those or big utilities that pay a solid dividend, quarter after quarter.Yet an ""unconventional"" approach to finding, buying and selling stocks can be a gold mine of income for disciplined investors. What does it take? The ability to follow investing rules and don't let opinions interfere with the process.So why not employ the research-driven technique of selecting the best growth stock companies to enhance your annual return? By doing so you can avoid long-term erosion of your nest egg.It takes true commitment to study and monitor the market, learning from mistakes, and some patience to generate income from stocks. Mastering IBD's seven-point CAN SLIM investing paradigm for selecting, buying and selling stocks takes discipline. But the rewards are clear.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSuppose you have a $500,000 retirement account. You need $50,000 a year to live comfortably. If none of that money in your retirement account is invested, the gas tank goes empty in 10 years.You'll get income if you invested the entire wad in a basket of stocks that pay dividends with, say, an annual yield of 3%. That's well more than the 2% the S&P 500 provides today. Assuming no change in underlying stock prices, you could expect to receive $15,000 of cash dividends. Not enough income for your spending needs.Consider this option. Allocate half of the $500,000 toward highly ranked growth stocks. Ranked by what? Earnings growth, sales, profit margin, return on equity, industry leadership and rising fund sponsorship, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. You limit your buys to just six stocks during the year, investing $50,000 each time. Assume none of these stocks pay cash back to shareholders.Suppose three of the stocks turn out to be losers. You cut losses at -5% (equal to a $2,500 loss), -8% (-$4,000) and -8% (-$4,000). The other three make money. You achieve gains of 10% ($5,000 profit), 20% ($10,000) and 50% ($25,000). By year's end, you've amassed a net short-term capital gain of $29,500 before taxes, a return of almost 12% on half of your total portfolio.Now, suppose you place the other $250,000 in investment-grade corporate bonds, ultrasteady megacap blue chips with dividends yields of 2% to 4%. And some of that to perhaps some municipal bonds. Then you might earn approximately $7,500 in interest and dividend payments or more. This boosts your total gain to $37,000. The total return hits 7.4%.IBD's TAKE: The Dividend Leaders screen, part of IBD Data Tables in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com, is one place to look for dividend-rich companies with highly stable earnings, critical for paying out future dividends.Now, withdraw 5% of the total portfolio, or $25,000, for your living expenses. Use Social Security and pensions to get the additional income for living costs. That leaves an extra $12,000 in your portfolio, giving the account a total boost of roughly 2.4%. That's enough to counter a potential loss of purchasing power due to inflation.Rinse and repeat. Chances look good that your nest egg will last a long time.You can start your search by looking at growth stock screens at Investors.com and in the IBD Weekly. IBD Big Cap 20 is a good place to look for stocks with both growth potential and cash payouts. Superregional banks Regions Financial (RF) and Northern Trust (NTRS), as well as investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) and insurer Sun Life Financial (SLF) joined the Big Cap 20 in the Nov. 14, 2016, edition of IBD Weekly. All four pay dividends to shareholders, but capital gains in the months that followed proved more valuable to shareholders.Since then, Regions has done well. Even amid the current market correction, through Thursday's close, the Birmingham, Ala., institution has doubled from a 10.10 long saucer buy point; Northern Trust has climbed 50% past a 73.84 cup with handle entry; Morgan Stanley has rolled ahead 82% since an early October breakout past 32.47. And Sun Life has risen as much as 31% past a 33.93 saucer-with-handle pivot point before correcting again and working on a brand-new base.Sector rotation can hamper traditional income-generating plays. Consider Verizon (VZ). In late January 2016, the telecom rallied past a 47.33 buy point within a long saucer base and gained 20% by July 5. But over the next four months, Verizon gave back all of that gain. In 2017, integrated telecoms turned out to be market laggards.Instead of sitting through the disappointing round trip, use IBD's common-sense sell rule of taking at least some gains at 20%-25%. Redeploy the money in a more promising growth stock investment or park the profits in cash. In some cases, you need to take profits more quickly, especially when the market's ride gets rough.Alphabet (GOOGL) serves up a recent example. The megacap tech broke out of an 11-week flat base with a 1,006.29 buy point on Oct. 11, 2017. After a brief stumble, the stock really got moving a few weeks later, thanks to a strong gap up in price on Oct. 27. That helped spark a nearly 19% run to a new high of 1,197 on Jan. 29 of this year.But as seen in a daily chart, Alphabet succumbed to the sharp volatility and fast correction seen in stocks in early February. By Feb. 8, the Google search engine owner completed a round-trip of those solid gains. Lesson? It's fine to sell and preserve at least some profits before they all disappear. You can always buy a great stock such as Alphabet again.Do not dismiss the strategy of raising cash near major market tops. No matter how great a company's management or how big the cash dividend, you want to sidestep serious damage to any of your growth stocks. You can always buy shares back when market conditions improve. Reading IBD's The Big Picture column will help you spot these all-important junctures in the market.Will you panic and sell late if stocks go into a bear market? At some point, equities will fall hard again. Just look at the equity markets in 1990, 1998, 2000-02, 2008-09 and 2011. In every instance, at least one major index fell 20% or more from its 52-week peak. REITs, utilities and other ""defensive stocks"" were not immune to the sell-offs.(A version of this column was first published on Dec. 12, 2016.)RELATED:Flexibility Is Needed For New Era Of Income InvestingHow To Find Dividend Stocks With Staying PowerWant To Find The Next Nvidia?

251,NOV,"Investors seeking increasing dividend income and long-term capital growth through a proven active management approach should find a lot to like in T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth Fund (PRDGX).X Tom Huber, the fund's portfolio manager since 2000, also seeks companies that are expected to raise their dividend rates at a healthy clip — and that may be undervalued.Huber's approach has served shareholders well as the $8.5 billion fund has risen 16.7% year-to-date through Nov. 24. PRDGX has also posted an annual average return of 9.4% for the last 15 years vs. 8.7% for large blend funds tracked by Morningstar Direct.IBD recently spoke with Huber to discuss his investment process and outlook for dividend stocks in 2018.IBD: What factors have driven your outperformance against other large blend funds?Huber: The outperformance is attributable to leveraging our global research platform, finding good ideas and consistently applying our process. Having a long-term outlook is a strategy that ultimately has led us to pick good businesses that outperform over time through a market cycle.IBD: What is your strategy for selecting dividend-paying stocks?Huber: We look for companies that pay and grow their dividends over time. This leads us to durable business models of companies capable of consistently growing earnings. They are big generators of free cash flow; that is really a hallmark of the strategy and it funds our growing dividend stream.We look for well-managed businesses with management teams that are very good with capital allocation because that is going to drive share prices going forward. Finally, we pay attention to valuation. We're really trying to buy good companies at good prices, and what we end up with is a portfolio of high-quality businesses with a yield that is competitive to the market, but with faster dividend growth.IBD: Why is dividend growth important?Huber: Dividends are an important component of total return. Half of returns over time come from dividends, and dividend growth stocks outperform at lower levels of volatility through cycles.Dividends provide a measure of downside protection in volatile markets, and the growing streams of income protect investors from rising interest rates and inflation. Also, businesses that are growing dividends and cash flows over time tend to be more durable, so their earnings and cash flow streams hold up better in times of stress.Where To Find Income Without Taking Big RisksDoes Steady Earnings Growth Lead To Big Dividends?How Growth Stocks Can Yield Solid Income TooWhat Does Trump Tax Cut Mean For Dividends?IBD: If I am an income investor, how would this fund fit into my portfolio?Huber: We're offering a competitive yield with a higher level of growth and a growing income stream. For periods of rising rates and inflation, dividend-growth stocks tend to perform relatively well vs. pure yield-oriented or bond-equivalent investments.IBD: What has enabled you to maintain a relatively low turnover ratio for the fund?Huber: It really comes down to the type of business we are looking for — we're buying good companies. I feel if we are doing that, we should own them for an extended period and let the investments compound for us. I think it is, by definition, what we do in applying our process that leads us to a lower turnover strategy.IBD: Where are you looking for growth among dividend-paying stocks in 2018?Huber: The payout ratio (percentage of earnings paid out as dividends) of the S&P 500, which bottomed at about 27%, has now recovered to about 42%. So you are getting to a point where, for the market overall, dividends will likely grow with earnings.I think the sectors where you are going to find the best dividend growth, at least in the next few years, will be sectors like financials and technology because payout ratios are relatively low, and fundamentals and earnings growth are above average, so you have a nice combination to drive dividend growth.Another sector we like is health care. It's an area where you are again getting above-average growth and room for good dividend growth as well. Other sectors like consumer staples, telecom and REITs, which are traditionally more defensive, are a little bit challenged right now, so it's tougher to find robust dividend growth there.IBD: Your top position, Microsoft (MSFT), has been a holding since 2000. What aspects of the company have allowed it to be a mainstay in your portfolio?Huber: It was the first big technology company to pay a dividend, so it opened the door for big tech stocks to return capital to shareholders. We have been very impressed with Satya Nadella as CEO. He has brought about a real change in culture at the company. Microsoft is now successfully transitioning its business from on-premises to the cloud. Its valuation, in terms of multiple of enterprise value to free cash flow, has grown from 10 times to 18 times. It is still very well-positioned and capable of growing free cash flow per share well into the double digits for the next several years.IBD: Shares of your No. 2 holding, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), have posted strong gains over the past 52 weeks. How do you like the stock?Huber: I think it is probably the best managed company in the sector with Jamie Dimon running it. The company has an improving returns profile, with returns on tangible equity expected to increase from 13% in 2017 to 16% in 2020. In 2018, we think JPMorgan Chase can return about 105% of earnings to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. We have a business that we think can grow 13% for the next three to four years trading at about 12.5 times earnings, which represents good value.IBD: UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which you have owned since 2012, upped its quarterly dividend by 20% earlier this year. Are there any specific tailwinds you see for UnitedHealth right now?Huber: It's an industry leader, well-positioned with dominant scale in all of its major lines of insurance as well as in health care services through Optum. The synergy between the two businesses drives both better health outcomes and costs. I would also expect midteens growth in earnings, cash flow and dividends from the company going forward.RELATED:How To Generate Investment Income Despite Low Interest RatesFidelity's Top Income Expert Lays Out Opportunities And Challenges In Stocks And BondsBaron Funds' CEO Spies Much Opportunity Amid Current Disruptions

253,NOV,"Major indexes held on to light gains in afternoon trade Thursday while a hot Bitcoin-tracking exchange traded fund ushered its first key sell signal since blasting out of a deep cup with handle on Nov. 24.X Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) got showered by sellers for a third straight session as shares dropped more than 24% in trading running double its 50-day average.At 1,807, it was also the first time for the ETF to slide significantly below the 10-day moving average, a key sell signal for short-term trading.The 10-day moving average represents the average closing price over the past 10 trading sessions and can help determine an early exit for a stock or a highflying ETF that has broken out of a proper base such as a cup with handle or a flat base.Meanwhile, Chevron (CVX) led an impressive rebound among integrated oil and gas firms as the Dow Jones industrial average member surged more than 3% to 125.24 in heavy turnover. That gain hoisted the San Ramon, Calif., energy giant further above a 120.99 buy point in a six-week flat base.That flat base is part of an even longer consolidation. Chevron's buy zone goes up to 127.04.Other strong stocks in the oil patch include EOG Resources (EOG) and Diamondback Energy (FANG), which is one of four stocks to join IBD Leaderboard in December. Diamondback is now 7% past a 115.03 buy point and thus extended in price. The right time to buy a stock following its breakout is when it is still within 5% of the proper entry. In Diamondback's case, the buy zone goes up to 120.78.Other exploration and production stocks breaking out include Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) (flat base, 65.93 buy point), Norway's Statoil (STO) (flat base, 21.12) and Concho Resources (CXO) (base on base, 147.87).At 2:45 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 posted gains of around 0.4% and still look poised for weekly gains. The Nasdaq composite slightly lagged, up nearly 0.3%. Small caps are outperforming with the Russell 2000 up more than 0.7%.The Dow transports cooled off a bit, trading virtually flat, after running up four sessions in a row and rising almost 3.4% over that period. One of Thursday's top industry groups is shipping transport, up more than 4% as a group. But none of the companies in the 31-member industry group holds a Composite Rating of 90 or higher. The highest-rated name is Genco Shipping & Trading (GNK), a thinly traded dry bulk carrier. The stock has formed a handle on a base that resembles a double bottom. The buy point is 13.83, a dime above the handle's high.While Genco sports a lowly Composite of 65 on IBD Stock Checkup, the RS Rating is strong at 89 and the Accumulation/Distribution Rating is positive at B.On the Dow industrials, at least seven stocks are up 1 point or more, including Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs (GS). The investment bank rose 2.2% in active turnover and is aiming to move out of the 5% buy zone after clearing a saucer with handle at 247.84.On an adjusted basis, Goldman has notched five quarters in a row of rising earnings growth. Revenue has increased 22%, 18%, 31%, 6% and 11% vs. year-ago levels over the same time frame.Back to Chevron, the Street sees earnings rebounding 459% to $1.23 a share in the fourth quarter. In the year-ago quarter, profit dropped 38%.Yet amid the recent strength in crude oil prices, boosted in large part by OPEC's success in extending its pact to cut supply through the end of 2018, Chevron's top line has enjoyed a startling turnaround.Diamondback, an expert in the Permian Basin region and West Texas, rallied for a fourth straight session and jumped more than 3% to 120.96 in strong turnover. Mutual funds and hedge funds owning shares in the midcap energy play have risen for at least 18 quarters in a row. In the third quarter, 979 funds owned a piece of Diamondback, up from 584 funds in Q3 of 2015 and 731 funds in Q3 of 2016.Analysts see earnings rising 191% this year to $5.10 a share, which would be an record for the Midland, Texas-based firm that was incorporated in 2011. In 2018, earnings are seen rising another 24% to $6.30 a share.Pretax margin was 25.6% in 2016.The SMR Rating is a top-notch A on a scale of A to E as seen in IBD Stock Checkup.

254,NOV,"While shares of Stitch Fix (SFIX) were plunging on the markets Wednesday following the company's first-ever earnings report, analysts still said they were impressed with the online tailor's performance.Mark S.F. Mahaney at RBC Capital Markets noted that expectations were high for Stitch Fix going into its fiscal first-quarter report.""Stitch Fix reported a solid though unsurprising (first quarter), given that preliminary results were detailed in (an initial report),"" Mahaney said in a note to clients. ""Guidance for (second-quarter) and (fiscal 2018) bracketed our revenue and (earnings) estimates, though at the low end on revenue, and we are modestly raising estimates.""Shares of Stitch Fix plunged as much as 17% in the wake of the company's earnings report, even though the numbers came in ahead of estimates. Shares finished the trading day down 9.8% to close at 22.34.The company's stock went public in mid-November at 15 per share. Stitch Fix reached an intraday peak of 25.98 on Tuesday, a gain of more than 73% from the initial public offering, before falling on the after-hours earnings report later in the day.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Stitch Fix have yet to form a base since going public Nov. 17. Stitch Fix is ranked seventh in IBD's Retail-Internet Group, with Alibaba Group Holdings in the top spot.Stitch Fix said adjusted earnings were 4 cents a share, a penny ahead of consensus estimates from analysts. Revenue was $295.6 million, also slightly ahead of the $295 million average prediction from analysts. The company expects revenue to come in between $287 million and $294 million, ahead of estimates for $296.3 million.Concerns were raised, however, about the company's gross margin, which was off 300 basis points to 44%, said Mahaney.Piper Jaffray's Erinn Murphy reportedly thinks investors are concentrating too hard on missing key metrics, while the company's moves into new product categories is positive.""We are encouraged by commentary around new mediums performing ahead of expectations and sequential improvement around (Stitch Fix's) three TV campaigns launched to date,"" Murphy said in a note to clients, according to Seeking Alpha.RELATED:This Online Tailor Brings A Personal Touch To The Fashion PlateStitch Fix Results Beat On Top, Bottom Lines, But Stock Falls

257,NOV,"Major indexes traded mostly flat in afternoon trading Wednesday, leading some observers to believe that the expected major tax reform legislation has already been baked into the stock market's advance. However, another view could be that U.S. equities are holding on to solid gains for the fourth quarter and are not showing any signs of heavy selling.XMeanwhile, one of the hottest exchange traded funds dropped hard for a second straight session, but the two-day correction for Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) looks normal after a 250% run-up from a Nov. 22 breakout past 985.10 in a deep cup with handle.Bitcoin Investment Trust fell as much as 24.8% intraday and briefly undercut its short-term 10-day moving average. The ETF is now down 16% to 2,518, still holding a 155% post-breakout gain.At 2:30 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite was still trading flat, but at 6964 the tech-rich index is still up nearly 0.4% for the week and holding a 7.2% gain since Oct. 1. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average squeezed out fractional gains. Volume is running mildly lower vs. the same time Tuesday on both main exchanges.Steel, oil and gas, metal ores, air freight and gold mining shares led the market's upside, offsetting sharp drops in desktop software, tobacco, dairy, hospital, restaurant and electric utility stocks.The Dow utility average, sinking 1% and 1.6% on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, sank another 0.4% amid a rebound in interest rates. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note is trying to clear 2.50%.The CME Group's Fed Watch tool now shows a 56% probability that the Federal Reserve will hike the fed funds rate on overnight bank loans by a quarter point to a 1.5%-1.75% target range when it meets on March 21, 2018. As noted in a prior IBD Stock Market Today column, Bitcoin Investment has had such a monster run that the 50-day moving average is irrelevant as a technical tool to determine the right time to sell the hot security. Instead, a clean break of the 10-day line would be a good trigger for holders to capture at least partial profits in a core position.Bitcoin, which now trades a record 112,000 shares on average over the past 50 sessions, broke out of a deep yet satisfactory cup with handle on Nov. 22 by surpassing the high of the handle at 985 by 10 cents. Add 10 cents to the highest price within a handle in good bases such as the cup, saucer or double bottom to determine the correct entry point.Among big and megacap techs, Apple (AAPL) continues to do just fine. However, Monday's breakout from a new flat base at 176.34 has failed to bear fruit so far. Shares are virtually break-even at 174.43, hovering just below the proper entry.While Monday's nice gain showed little gusto in terms of volume, on Friday the iPhone marketer showed heavy institutional activity as shares rose 1%. In that session, 40.2 million shares exchanged hands, 49% above the stock's 50-day average. That's a sign of persistent demand ever since Apple broke out of a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12 in early January.Go to that breakout and volume was limp. But investors were waiting for quarterly results. And volume gushed higher on Feb. 1 after Apple began reporting its string of new year-over-year increases in both the top and bottom lines.Earnings in that December-ended fiscal first quarter edged up 2% to $3.36 a share, halting a three-quarter slide. Then earnings ramped up 11%, 18% and 24% in the next three quarters.Wall Street sees profit rising 12% to $3.77 a share in the December-ending fiscal first quarter of FY 2018 on a 10% pick-up in sales to $86.23 billion.Meanwhile, Concho Resources (CXO), a former big market winner, rose more than 3% to 144.46 in slightly higher than normal turnover and is close to surpassing a new 147.87 buy point in a nearly six-week flat base.That flat base sits on top of a much larger, wilder base that has elements of both a double bottom and a cup with handle. See the mild three-week pullback in October? The 6.2% drop from 137.28 to 128.86 generated a good handle that showed quiet volume and a downward slant along the lows.Both of these elements are necessary ingredients for a good handle, which is essentially a final shakeout of uncommitted shareholders before the stock sees a big jump in institutional demand, sparking a breakout.Concho, which specializes in the Permian Basin and West Texas, is staging a solid turnaround in fundamentals. It showed falling earnings and net losses for eight straight quarters through Q3 of 2016. But in the past two quarters, Concho has boosted profit 100% and 41% on revenue gains of 43% and 46%.The relatively weak 69 RS Rating, as seen in Stock Checkup, reflects the stock's long basing action. Watch to see if that rating improves quickly. The EPS Rating is 68 on a scale from 1 to 99, but that masks Wall Street's consensus estimate for earnings to rise 150% this year to $1.85 a share and up 28% to $2.36 in 2018.West Texas Intermediate near-term oil futures jumped 0.8% to $58 a barrel. Brent crude also rallied 0.8% to $64.33.Elsewhere, some biotechs are making a slow comeback. Biogen (BIIB) rallied and is working on the right side of a new base that so far has the dimensions of a flat base. The potential entry for now is 348.94.RELATED:Hot IPO Stocks: Who Are The Next Home Depot, Microsoft, Cisco And Google?What Is The Cup With Handle, And How It Makes Money For Stock TradersCan You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

258,NOV,"CVS Health (CVS) will buy Aetna (AET) for about $67.5 billion, creating a health-care giant that will have a hand in everything from insurance to the corner drugstore.X CVS will pay $207 a share for Aetna, with $145 a share in cash and the rest in stock, the companies said in a statement Sunday. That's a 29% premium to Aetna's share price on Oct. 25, the day before the companies were reported to be in talks.The deal is among the biggest health-care mergers of the past decade, combining the largest U.S. drugstore chain with the third-biggest health insurer. CVS also manages drug-benefits plans for employers and insurers, a business that could help steer some of Aetna's 22 million customers into CVS drugstores when they fill a prescription. The deal will give Aetna's insurance plans a closer on-the-ground tie to where customers get care.Including CVS's assumption of Aetna's debt, the deal will be valued at $78 billion. It's expected to close in the second half of 2018, the companies said.In a joint interview, CVS Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo and Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said combining the companies would help CVS expand a variety of retail medical services, from vision care to nutrition advice to audiology, making basic care more convenient and less costly for consumers. Aetna will be operated as a separate business unit, and any new services will be designed to appeal broadly to customers of other insurance companies as well, the executives said.The immediate financial benefits of the deal are projected to be relatively modest. The companies said they expect $750 million in synergies, and profit improvements in the low-to-mid single digits the second full year after the merger is completed. The companies are betting on longer-term profit from reshaping how their customers get care, by creating what the executives are calling ""10,000 new front doors for the health-care system'' at CVS's stores and clinics.""Think of these stores as a hub of a new way of accessing health-care services across America,'' Merlo said in the joint interview. ""We're bringing health care to where people live and work.''s into CVS drugstores when they fill a prescription through CVS's drug plans. It will also give Aetna's insurance plans a closer on-the-ground tie to where customers get care.The deal will be financed with a mix of cash and debt. Barclays, Goldman Sachs. and Bank of America have committed to provide $49 billion of financing, the person said. It's expected to close in the second half of 2018 and create cost savings of about $750 million, said the person.After the deal closes, Aetna will operate as a separate unit run by members of the current management. Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini will join the CVS board, along with two other Aetna directors.It comes as the health sector is looking over the horizon at Amazon.com (AMZN), and how the company could shake up the business of buying, distributing and selling drugs and medical products if it gets into health care. The retail industry has been battered by the online giant. Amazon hasn't revealed its plans.""One of the problems with the health-care system is it's so fragmented and there's so little coordination,"" said Steve Kraus, who invests in health firms at Bessemer Venture Partners. ""A better vertically integrated less-siloed system is a good thing in my mind.""It could also set off a new round of takeovers as CVS and Aetna's competitors look at the reshaped landscape. On Nov. 30, the CEO of Express Scripts (ESRX) said the pure-play pharmacy benefits manager would be open to a deal at the right price, though wasn't actively looking for one.""We don't need to sell to be very successful in the future, but we are always open to others who may all of sudden conclude they want what we have,"" Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth said in an interview. He also mentioned the possibility of partnering with Amazon on a drug distribution arrangement.Express Scripts is just one company in a universe of independent drug plans, insurers and supply-chain middlemen. WellCare Health Plans (WCG), Humana (HUM) and Centene (CNC) could become merger targets after the CVS-Aetna deal, according to Matthew Borsch, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. Drug distributors like Cardinal Health (CAH) or McKesson (MCK), and retailers such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) could also face pressure to find partners.CVS, which operates about 9,700 retail stores and 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, has been moving beyond it drugstore roots for years. In 2007, it bought pharmacy-benefits manager Caremark Rx — a business that made up almost half of the Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company's operating profit in the third quarter. In 2014, CVS stopped selling cigarettes and added ""Health"" to its name.""Aetna has emphasized its desire to move care closer to the consumer,"" Brian Tanquilut, an analyst at Jefferies, said on Oct. 26. ""CVS's capabilities, including Minute Clinic and the Coram home infusion business, could enable the health plan to improve health outcomes and reduce cost trend.""Consolidation is picking up among health-care suppliers and administrators, as insurers seek more control over how their consumers get care. But two proposed megamergers among insurers — including a deal between Aetna and Humana — were blocked this year on antitrust grounds, leading the companies to look beyond rival insurers to different types of health-care companies for potential deals.The CVS-Aetna deal antitrust prospects may depend on which U.S. regulator is tasked with reviewing it, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Rie. The Federal Trade Commission has been less critical of consolidation among companies in adjacent businesses, known as vertical consolidation. The Justice Department, on the other hand, last month sued to block the merger of AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX), a vertical deal.Michael Newshel, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said the DOJ effort to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal does raises concerns but a CVS-Aetna deal does have a path forward. Aetna would likely need to divest some or all of its Medicare drug plan business, he said.The biggest U.S. health insurer, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), is also the most diversified. United owns doctor clinics and an outpatient surgery chain, and also has a pharmacy-benefits management, called OptumRx, built on the acquisition of Catamaran Corp. in 2015

274,NOV,"The swift revolution against sexual harassment is ending the careers of a series of media ""icons,"" left and right. But perhaps nowhere is this hypocrisy more notable (and deeper) than at PBS and NPR. These were the entities that made sexual harassment the boiling feminist issue when Anita Hill testified during Clarence Thomas' confirmation hearing in 1991.Here's an easy question: Why didn't this sudden spirit of self-discovery and investigation happen back then? Or in any year since? It could have happened when then-President Bill Clinton settled with Paula Jones in 1998, or even last year as these networks enjoyed reporting on sexual harassment scandals inside Fox News. All along the way, it appears that very same sexual harassment was alive at both PBS and NPR.And mum was the word.In case you missed the trend — and with all the other scandals breaking, who could blame you? — on Nov. 1, NPR first forced out its vice president of news, Michael Oreskes, following accusations of sexual harassment during his tenure at NPR and The New York Times. Soon after he stepped down, five complaints were filed by women of NPR. On Nov. 3, The Washington Post said that ""NPR's employees unleashed their fury"" at CEO Jarl Mohn ""over his handling of a sexual harassment scandal that appears to have spread."" A few days later, Mohn took a medical leave.The TV folks at PBS followed on Nov. 21, when they abruptly ended its broadcasts of longtime talk-show host Charlie Rose.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveOn Nov. 29, NPR followed that by firing Chief News Editor David Sweeney, who'd been at the taxpayer-subsidized radio network since 1993, for allegedly harassing subordinates.That same day, Minnesota Public Radio cut all business ties with star Garrison Keillor of ""A Prairie Home Companion"" for alleged sexual misconduct. Keillor was especially dismissive of the charges, which came right after he wrote a Washington Post commentary in which he ridiculed the demands for Sen. Al Franken to resign over allegedly groping women as ""absurd."" Confident of his sex appeal at age 75, Keillor boasted, ""If I had a dollar for every woman who asked to take a selfie with me and who slipped an arm around me and let it drift down below the beltline, I'd have at least a hundred dollars.""Indeed, there seems to have been something smarmy about Keillor all along. Meet Garrison Keillor: sexual harassment victim. Howard Mortman of C-SPAN tweeted out an old National Press Club address by Keillor from April 7, 1994, in which Keillor proclaimed, ""A world in which there is no sexual harassment at all is a world in which there will not be any flirtation.""XThis line did not make the press accounts at the time. Instead, the Associated Press reported the part of the speech where Keillor ""chided the press"" for trying to keep from the American people the ""terrible truth"" that ""America gets along pretty well,"" and the fact that Clinton ""is a soulful man"" who ""enjoys his work.""Bill Clinton, soulful harasser ... meet Garrison Keillor, soulful harasser.The bifurcated public funding/private business nature of public broadcasting made men like Rose and Keillor less accountable, as there was not always a human resources department to handle complaints. They are profit-making multimillionaire contractors who acted as their own bosses. Their female employees were sitting ducks.In what way, then, is ""public"" broadcasting morally superior to corporate broadcasting? And how deep is the hypocrisy on the left considering it waited decades to hold sexual harassers in its own taxpayer-funded ideological sandboxes accountable? They don't deserve one more red cent from taxpaying Americans.Bozell is the president of the Media Research Center. Graham is director of media analysis at the Media Research Center and executive editor of the blog NewsBusters.org.RELATED:Big Bird Is Rich, So Why Does He Need Taxpayer Money?More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.

275,NOV,"Semiconductor-equipment stocks have been hammered recently, but the sell-off has created a buying opportunity in several companies that have sunk in recent weeks, a Wall Street analyst maintained Friday.Needham analyst Edwin Mok pounded the table for Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS), FormFactor (FORM) and Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT) in a report. He likes those stocks for their ""solid fundamentals and the buying opportunities created by lowered expectations.""""While there are some negative data points around Nand (memory chip) supply, we see those as seasonal factors and as excuses for investors to lock in the solid gains in semi-cap stocks, which on average are up 54% year to date (the S&P 500 is up 18% over the same period) despite the recent pullback,"" Mok said.But the stocks mentioned have all been downtrodden as of late. Advanced Energy Industries hit an all-time high of 95 on Oct. 30. Since then, through Thursday's close, it has fallen 21%. FormFactor notched a more than seven-year high of 18.65 on Nov. 3, but has retreated 12% from that peak as of Thursday's close. Ultra Clean Holdings reached a record high of 34.59 on Oct. 18, but has tumbled 39% since then as of Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: Advanced Energy, Ultra Clean Holdings and FormFactor all have been identified by IBD as triggering sell signals in recent days. All three raked in 20% gains after forming bases in recent weeks and subsequently surrendered those gains. The three are seen as trying to form new bases and several steps away from reaching new buy points. By the closing bell on the stock market today, all three had sunk sharply. Advanced Energy Industries dropped 3.2% to close at 72.55; FormFactor fell 4.9% to finish at 15.60; and Ultra Clean tumbled 2.7% to end the regular trading day at 20.41.Semiconductor capital equipment stocks have been under pressure lately because of fears that Nand memory chip demand is peaking as well as year-end profit-taking by some investors, Mok said.RELATED:Synopsys Jumps To Record High On Beat-And-Raise Quarterly ReportChipmaker Marvell Beats Third-Quarter Targets; Shares ClimbRecent IPO Aquantia Jumps On Quarterly Results, Bullish Reports

276,NOV,"For desktop software companies, the rise of cloud computing has meant change or die.

277,NOV,"It's never fun to take a loss in a swing trade, but it's a lesson that is best to learn early. Taking a small loss in Alibaba protected your portfolio from a 10-point drop that followed over the next week and brings up a critical element of investing: make sure you live to fight another day.As an investor, you will make mistakes and you will have losing trades. It happens to the best traders. A key component of swing trading is keeping those losses small, especially in relation to your winners. Since we take profits quick, we need to take losses even quicker. Do that and you can make money even if half your trades are losses.Having sell rules is critical in this endeavor because you will often need to fight your emotions: The hope that a stock will come back, the fear that you will miss out on a big move, or the ego that doesn't want to admit defeat.Don't be concerned if the stock immediately goes up without you, it's going to happen. But you will also see numerous occasions where the quick sell will save you money or, just as important, time. A stock that goes sideways always carries the risk of another sell-off, plus the opportunity cost of not being in a better stock.That was the case with Alibaba (BABA), a recent trade on IBD's SwingTrader. The giant Chinese online retailer was already a leading stock, and we were looking to capture a short-term profit. Alibaba pulled back to its 50-day moving average and bounced, a clear sign of support. It then followed through on that bounce the following day (1). That set up the swing trade opportunity.Two days later, on Nov. 20, Alibaba cleared a previous area of resistance at 188 and joined SwingTrader (2). Volume was the highest level in more than 10 days (3) but the close was in the lower half of the trading range. Not an ideal finish, but not a deal breaker either.After a few days in profitable territory, Alibaba triggered a sell rule by closing decisively below its 5-day moving average line (4). We exited the stock before the close that day with a loss just over a half percent.The 10-day moving average could be used in some market environments, but this year we've gravitated toward the 5-day line. That's been a function of small shallow corrections followed by relatively small rallies in the market.It turned out to be a good sell since the stock lost another 7% over the course of the week. That kind of loss could wipe out a lot of progress in swing trading. IBD's Leaderboard, which also counted Alibaba as a member at the time, treated the stock differently but it's important to realize the distinction in strategy between the two products. Leaderboard put Alibaba on the Leaders list back in April at 111, so had a profit cushion of around 70%. That kind of cushion changes the math on how much room you can give a stock to correct.More details on Past Trades, like Alibaba, are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Cutting Losses Quickly Is Key To Long-Term Stock ProfitsHolding Alibaba Was Easy; Buying It Was TrickySwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

278,NOV,"Extreme Networks (EXTR), the one-time highflier from the dot-com era that crashed and disappeared from radar screens for more than a decade, is now one of the top stocks in one of the market's strongest-performing industry groups.X After a second attempt at reinventing itself in 2015, Extreme is now ranked No. 2 by IBD Stock Checkup — based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance trends — in the Computer-Networking group, which is ranked No. 6 among 197 industry groups.Extreme's resurgence began after it installed board member Ed Meyercord as chief executive. Meyercord pared down the company, narrowing its focus and stabilizing its finances, before beginning to build it up piece by piece.""They decided the acquisition strategy was the right strategy,"" said D.A. Davidson Co. analyst Mark Kelleher, even after high hopes for its $180 million acquisition of Enterasys Networks in 2013 were largely dashed.Now, Extreme has shown that it has the right team in place to execute on its vision. It's pushing past the $1 billion annual revenue threshold and is throwing off enough cash to make key technology acquisitions that have broadened out its product set.Extreme bills itself as the only pure play end-to-end enterprise networking company with software-driven solutions that go from the wireless edge to the data center. It's the clear No. 3 in the enterprise network market, behind the dominant leader Cisco Systems (CSCO), and No. 2 Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), and growing faster than the mature market in which it competes.That position doesn't just reflect its third-place revenue share, still only about 4% of the market, but also its ranking by Gartner, which puts Extreme a close third behind Cisco and HP — and well ahead of the rest — both in its ability to execute and the completeness of its product vision.Gartner's September report also highlighted Extreme's ""strong customer service through a 100% insourced service and support team.""Meyercord said on a Nov. 7 fiscal first-quarter earnings call that Extreme is leveraging its recognition from Gartner, which he called ""one of the most relied-upon resources for enterprise customers"" and ""the best marketing we have,"" according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.Extreme is ""taking share from our larger competitors,"" Chief Financial Officer Drew Davies told a Needham networking and security conference on Nov. 14. He highlighted business wins in the past couple of weeks, including the Wynn Boston Harbor resort and a competitive bidding win at Raytheon.In its latest acquisition, which closed in October, Extreme bought Brocade's data center switching, routing and analytics assets for $55 million in cash. The deal is on track to add $230 million in revenue for Extreme in the first year.Broadcom (AVGO), which acquired the rest of Brocade, was willing to part with that portion of its business so as not to compete against the networking vendors such as Extreme that use Broadcom chipsets to power their switches, D.A. Davidson's Kelleher told Investor's Business Daily.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Extreme Networks were whipsawed in a volatile week for technology stocks. The upshot from a technical perspective is that the stock will have to work on a new base with a 14.44 buy point, the point at which an investor has the best opportunity for significant near-term gains. A leading stock in a leading industry group can be a recipe for a winning stock if bought at the right time.Kelleher said Extreme's strategy to build a complete enterprise networking offering by putting together pieces such as Brocade's data center business makes a lot of sense.Because of various mergers — and, in the case of Avaya, a bankruptcy — Extreme has been able to pick up ""all of these embedded assets that weren't being optimized,"" Kelleher said.Kelleher expects there will be more such acquisition opportunities ahead, though he expects Extreme to take about six months to digest its latest purchase.In July, Extreme strengthened its competitive position when it closed on its purchase of Avaya's networking assets, which it won with a $100-million bid. Extreme said the deal would add to earnings and produce $200 million in annual revenue.In October 2016, Extreme finalized its purchase of the wireless local area network business of Zebra Technologies (ZBRA), which is expected to generate more than $115 million in fiscal 2018 revenue.Those three acquisitions have essentially doubled the total addressable market opportunity for Extreme from $8 billion to $16 billion.""(Extreme's) strong (first) quarter was driven by the better than expected results of the Zebra and Avaya transactions,"" wrote Needham analyst Alex Henderson. ""The new employees are delivering better-than-expected productivity.""Henderson said Extreme's staff is now unencumbered by the constraints of their prior company structures. In Henderson's view, the new Extreme is proving through the ""exceptionally smooth integration of the Zebra acquisition"" that the company can execute on its acquisition strategy.On the fiscal first-quarter earnings call, Meyercord called the Brocade deal an ""important piece of the puzzle that helps us complete our enterprise networking solutions portfolio,"" enabling it to meet the large-scale data-center needs of Fortune 500 customers.Extreme now has 30,000 customers, after a picking up a large base of blue-chip clients via acquisitions, and one of its keys to growth will be cross-selling opportunities. Gartner says government and education have been Extreme's main vertical markets, but that customers in retail, hospitality, manufacturing and healthcare also ""should consider Extreme.""Henderson noted that Extreme more than doubled the number of $1 million-plus deals in its past two quarters.Outside of acquisitions, Extreme has been generating positive organic revenue growth in the low-single digits in recent quarters, an improvement after the retrenchment in 2015, and analysts see some potential for further improvement. Yet, Extreme's target market is only expected to grow an annualized 2% in coming years, so acquisitions and market-share gains will have to be growth drivers.For the December quarter, Extreme offered revenue guidance of $236 million to $246 million, well above the $224 million consensus. The guidance for EPS of 10 cents-14 cents was below the 18-cent estimate, but analysts have downplayed that as a function of timing of the Brocade deal.The quarterly results won't include October, always a relatively big month for the Brocade data-center business. That means Extreme will get more of a cost bump than a revenue bump for this one quarter.Shares of Extreme were down Friday by 0.9% to 12.74.RELATED:Extreme Networks In Buy Range, With NFL Wi-Fi Season In Full-SwingWhy This Networking Firm's Shares Jumped To A Two-Month HighEarnings Beat, Buying Spree Are Driving This 'Extreme' BreakoutStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

279,NOV,"U.S. stock indexes deepened their losses midday Friday, as Senate Republicans scrambled to salvage its tax-cut package. The indexes rallied Thursday on belief that the bill would pass, but doubts delayed a vote late Thursday.X The S&P 500 dropped 1.1% midday Friday, while the Nasdaq slipped 1.5%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.9%. The small cap Russell 2000 fell 2.5%.Volume in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges.The Republican tax-cut package stalled Thursday after the Joint Committee on Taxation said the bill would not generate enough tax revenue to avoid increasing the deficit. That along with a parliamentarian snag derailed the vote Thursday evening. With additional fixes, a Senate vote is expected this morning.Selling picked up midday Friday after an ABC news report that former national security adviser Michael Flynn would testify against President Trump in a plea deal with special counsel Robert Mueller.Concerns over tax cuts and tax revenue is an old and tiresome story on the Hill. When Reagan sought passage of a tax-cut bill in 1985, the New York Times reported that the Joint Committee on Tax Revenue said it would reduce tax revenue. Reagan prevailed and the tax revenue rose in each of the next five years, proving the panel's projections wrong. The panel, though, always has a challenging job. Dynamic factors are difficult to predict, and economics is all but dynamism.In midday stock-market action, blue chips were roughly even between winners and losers. On the plus side, Merck & Co. (MRK) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) each initially rose about 1% before gains faded. On the negative side, General Electric (GE) sagged 1.4%.GE has been a laggard this year. The diversified manufacturer's stock is down 43% this year.In S&P 500, the biggest gainer for the day was oil and natural gas explorer Apache (APA). The stock rose about 6% in heavy volume. Apache is on track for its fourth daily gain in a row. The stock has gained 11% since Monday's close. Light sweet crude popped 1.31 to 58.71 per barrel.The Street expects Apache to turn in a profit of 4 cents a share in 2017 after two years of losses. In 2018, analysts expect a profit of  54 cents a share for Apache.Meanwhile, the exchange-traded fund Innovator IBD 50 Fund (FFTY) slipped about 1% as it tested its 50-day line. The ETF is based on the IBD 50 and is up 38% for the year. The stock  recently pulled about 5% off its Nov. 22 high.Money center banks, which are up almost 4% for the week, stirred midday Friday. Citigroup (C) rose 0.63 to 76.13 in brisk trade. Citigroup is trying to clear a 76.24 buy point. The stock crossed above an alternative entry at 74.95 in strong volume Wednesday.Bank of New York Mellon (BK) added nearly 1% in average turnover, then dropped 1%. The stock is in a shallow, cuplike pattern. The potential buy point is 55.39.Superregional bank KeyCorp (KEY) rose 1% to 19.21 in moderately higher volume, then lost its gains. The stock is just above a 19.13 buy point in a cup-with-handle pattern.The bank stocks launched a nice rally about a year ago, rising from November to March. The banks then traded in a shallow, mostly sideways channel until recently. On Thursday, the money centers and superregionals hit 52-week highs.The superregional group is No. 44 among 197 industry groups. Six weeks ago, superregionals were No. 140. Money centers are No. 75, up from 94 six weeks ago.RELATED:This Stock Chart Trick Can Help Peg Time To SaleWhy The 10-Week Line Is Worth WatchingHow To Find Excellent Stocks: Start With A Simple Routine

280,NOV,"Stocks jumped at Wednesday's open as markets awaited a final, procedural House vote on Congress' massive tax overhaul package. Gains by Intel (INTC), FedEx (FDX) and Micron Technology (MU) also factored into early trade.X The Dow Jones industrial average,the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 all opened to gains of 0.3%. All three indexes traded just shy of new highs.Senate approval of the GOP's tax reform legislation early Wednesday gave markets some early lift, as a re-vote expected in the House later in the day was broadly seen as a technicality. Markets remained wary of the ongoing need for a budget agreement, without which federal offices would be required to shut down after Friday.Real estate data continued to roll in, with the Mortgage Bankers Association reporting a 4.9% drop in total mortgage applications activity last week, putting the week 8% below last year's level. Estimates for sales of existing homes in November are expected from the National Association of Realtors at 10 a.m. ET. The Energy Information Administration offers up its weekly oil inventories report at 10:30 a.m. ET.Chipmakers were showing strong early action, as Intel headed the Dow, up 1.1%, although JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (UTX) also traded near the head of the list. Intel's move followed news reports of a company memo in which Chief Executive Brian Krzanich declared the company was set to take more risks, as it boosts the amount of its revenue coming from growth markets, vs. its legacy PC business.Intel's gain sent just above a 47.40 buy point in a flat base.Micron Technology leapt 5% at the open. The Boise, Idaho-based chipmaker reported a triple-digit surge in fiscal first-quarter earnings and a 71% revenue increase, easily topping analyst estimates. The stock ended Tuesday poised for a possible rebound from its 10-week moving average, which would offer a follow-on buying opportunity.Among other chip-related stocks, Applied Materials (AMAT) rose 0.8% and Lam Research (LRCX) gained 2%.Tesla (TSLA) shares dropped 0.8%, deepening Tuesday's slide of more than 2%. The maker of battery-powered luxury cars received the largest order to date for its new autonomous tractor-trailer vehicles, a UPS (UPS) order for 125 trucks.FedEx opened 3% higher after reporting strong fiscal second-quarter results late Tuesday. A 15% profit gain and a 9% rise in revenue topped analyst forecasts, and an increase in full-year earnings guidance beat expectations. FedEx shares are extended above a 220.09 buy point in a flat base.November initial public offering Stitch Fix (SFIX) dived 14%, despite reporting better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter sales and earnings. The stock ended Tuesday 65% above its Nov. 17 IPO price.Open source software leader Red Hat (RHT) dumped more than 3% in premarket action. The Raleigh, N.C.-based cloud play reported a solid third-quarter performance late Tuesday, and shares ended the session up 58% from a breakout in February.Bitcoin dropped back to near the $17,000 level, after approaching $18,000 in early trade. Futures traded lower on both the CBOE and the CME.Among bitcoin-related stocks, Riot Blockchain (RIOT)  gained 4%, after ending Tuesday with a 185% gain so far in December. Marathon Patent Group (MARA) posted a 2% gain. Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) stumbled 10% lower and Overstock.com (OSTK) also reversed losses to a 4% gain.Longfin (LFIN), the IPO that launched Friday just after announcing it had acquired Ziddu.com, a small lender using blockchain ledger accounting technology, made a sharp turn higher, surging 8%.

282,NOV,"A Wall Street analyst's downgrade of megacap tech leader Apple (AAPL) didn't ruffle the feathers of institutional investors, even as major stock indexes cooled mildly Tuesday. Apple, down 0.9% to 174.79, still hovered only 1% below its newest buy point, 176.34 in a flat base.X Apple is also still extended from a prior buy point at 160.97, stemming from an eight-week cup with handle.Apple is also up more than 47% since it broke out of a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12 in early January. That cup with handle was part of a long bottoming base pattern, one of the most bullish chart patterns that help an investor time a new buy correctly after a stock has made a devastating correction.Nomura Instinet cut its rating on Apple to neutral on concerns that iPhone X sales are already incorporated into the stock's price. Jeffrey Kvall also noted a ""historically full multiple.""Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) took a well needed break, showing wild action as the Bitcoin-tracking exchange traded fund careened from a new all-time high of 3,523 to an intraday low of 2,630.With an intraday range of 33.9%, Bitcoin Investment is definitely not for the faint of heart. Yet for those who embrace time-proven chart patterns that have shown up in the greatest stock market winners going back to the late 19th century, Bitcoin Investment is acting just as one would expect after it bolted out of a deep yet well-formed cup with handle at 985.10.The gain from that Nov. 22 breakout has now exceeded 257%. The buy point is derived by adding 10 cents to the highest price within the two-week handle, or 985.00.At 3:40 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite rebounded a bit to cut its losses to around 0.4%. The leading U.S. equities index is also still up for the week following Monday's 0.8% boost. Investors are showing unwillingness to dump stocks as the House of Representatives passed a major tax reform package on Tuesday. The Senate is expected to do the same as early as Tuesday evening and send it to the White House for President Trump's signature before Christmas.The S&P 500 eased almost 0.2%. Finance, REIT, utility, solar and automaker stocks led the downside.Volume is running lower vs. the same time Monday on both main exchanges.The Dow Jones industrial average was off nearly 0.1%, with just two more components in addition to Apple down 1 point or more: Visa (V) and Goldman Sachs (GS). Goldman has gained nearly 4% since clearing a 247.84 buy point in a nine-month saucer with handle.Notice on a daily chart that Goldman broke out past the proper entry on Nov. 30 with a 2.6% gain in volume that expanded 148% higher than its 50-day average, a good sign. The Street expects the giant in fixed income and commodity trading and mergers and acquisitions to increase Q4 profits 2% to $5.16 a share.Microsoft (MSFT), one of the tech components within the Dow 30, dropped 1% to 85.53 in light trade and is mildly below an 86.30 buy point in a new flat base. The cloud computing, business software and Xbox giant initiated its slow yet steady advance with a late-July 2016 breakout past a 56.87 buy point in a three-month flat base that's part of a longer saucer pattern.As noted in this Investor's Corner column, the saucer pattern requires patience on the part of the investor before a proper new buy point finally emerges.Microsoft holds a solid 91 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. Apple sports a 94 Composite, supported in part by a stronger EPS Rating than Microsoft (90 for Apple on a scale of 1 to 99, 68 for Microsoft). A 90 EPS Rating means that Apple is superior to 90% of all companies in IBD's database in terms of near-term quarterly and long-term annual profit growth.Back to Bitcoin Investment Trust. While the ETF has simply skyrocketed amid a surge in interest in the alternative currency, one reason why Bitcoin perhaps has not yet reached bubble conditions is the fact that both the Cboe and CME Group have only recently begun trading futures on their respective exchanges.Two, the total value of Bitcoin being traded globally is said to be only a fraction of the total value of trading in bonds, stocks, commodities and forex.A third reason why Bitcoin could see future growth is that professional money managers are showing an increasing appetite. The Bitcoin.com news website reported that hedge fund manager Bill Miller, a former star of the Legg Mason Value Trust mutual fund, currently has half of its assets in Bitcoin.While biotech shares have not had a merry fourth quarter, Biogen (BIIB) stands out as one large-cap firm that could potentially break out.The stock got hammered after so-so Q3 results (earnings up 22% to $6.31 a share, revenue up just 4% to $3.08 billion), but the sell-off was limited to 13% after Biogen notched a 52-week peak of 348.48. Since then, the stock has been forming a flat base that could also stretch into a saucerlike pattern.Biogen's earnings have nearly quintupled from $4.12 a share in 2009 to $20.22 last year. However, growth is expected to slow amid stiff competition in treatments for multiple sclerosis and other chronic medical conditions. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising just 9% to $22.06 a share this year and up 8% to $23.81 in 2018.Within the IBD Big Cap 20, the current list showcases just one medical stock, AbbVie (ABBV).In other financial markets, investors dumped U.S. government bonds following the Federal Reserve's third hike in short-term interest rates of the year. On Dec. 13, the fed funds rate rose to a target range of 1.25%-1.50%, up from 0.25%-0.50% in December 2015.Utility stocks fell en masse, with the Dow utility average sinking 1.6%. The Dow transports edged 0.2% higher despite a bump up in crude oil prices. WTI near-term futures rose 0.5% to $57.42 a barrel.RELATED:Can You Identify Major Stock Market Tops?

283,NOV,"E-commerce titan Amazon (AMZN) received a price-target increase from JPMorgan on Monday, which also placed Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) on its list of top stock picks.X JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth raised his price target in Amazon to 1,375 from 1,220, bringing it up to what amounts to roughly a 15% premium from where the stock currently trades. Amazon shares were up 1% to close at 1,190.58 on the stock market today.""We believe Amazon is set to outperform in 2018 with numerous major growth opportunities driving revenue,"" Anmuth wrote in a research note to clients.Amazon shares hit a record high of 1,213.41 on Nov. 27, also known as Cyber Monday, following strong sales on Black Friday that continued through the weekend as consumers responded to a raft of promotions.Anmuth also raised his price target on Yelp, to 55 from 52, a 25% premium. Yelp shares surged 3.3% to finish the regular trading day at 43.81. Yelp reported third-quarter results last month that topped expectations.""We believe Yelp is well-positioned into 2018 as the transition to Yelp 2.0 remains on track (i.e. greater sales efficiency, attribution through transactions, and performance marketing), the core ad business is stable, and importantly we expect margin expansion in 2018,"" Anmuth wrote.Further, Twitter was upgraded to overweight from neutral and had its price target raised to 27 from 20. Twitter shares jumped 11% to 24.68, hitting levels not seen since October 2016..IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is an IBD Leaderboard stock with a Composite Rating of 77 out of a possible 99, and is extended from a 1,083.41 buy point. Leading IBD's Retail-Internet Group is Alibaba Group (BABA) with a Composite Rating of 99.""We believe Twitter is uniquely positioned as the real-time broadcast and communications network, making Twitter complementary to all other forms of media, including TV,"" Anmuth wrote.Twitter also received new coverage and a buy rating on Monday from Redstone Summit Partners, saying Twitter usage and advertising are moving in the right direction.Anmuth placed Facebook, Amazon, Twitter and Yelp on his list of ""best ideas for 2018.""Anmuth has an overweight rating on Facebook and price target of 225.Facebook last week was rated a top stock pick for 2018 by Needham analyst Laura Martin.

285,NOV,"Dow Jones industrial average component Apple (AAPL) paced a broad rally in stocks Monday on Wall Street's confidence that President Trump will sign major tax reform legislation that will help U.S. corporations become more competitive with their overseas peers and help many working Americans across the country.X Apple rose more than 1.6% to 176.89, barely surpassing a 176.34 entry in a new flat base in mildly lower-than-average turnover.At 3:45 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average saw at least eight stocks rise 1 point or more and nearly 0.6% in late-afternoon trading. The S&P 500 — boosted by retail, consumer-electronics, steel and internet-networking shares — matched that gain.The Nasdaq composite led with a 0.8% gain and hit as high as 7003.89, stretching its year-to-date advance to 30%. Volume is running lower on both main exchanges due to Friday's quadruple witching of expiring options and futures.The S&P SmallCap 600 rallied 1.3% while the Dow transports rolled 1.2% ahead.Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) had one of its best gains in recent months as the Bitcoin-tracking ETF soared 27% to 3,448.90 in heavy trading and leapt past 3,000 for the first time. The exchange traded fund has now risen 250% from a Nov. 22 breakout past 985.10 in a deep cup with handle. Average volume over the past 50 sessions now tops 100,000 shares a day.At this point, it would be dangerous to try to short Bitcoin given the strong interest in the futures market and the overall ebullience of buyers. While technically Bitcoin Investment Trust is meeting the textbook definition of a climax run by running 25% or more in less than two weeks, the breakout just occurred less than one month ago.Based on IBD research, the climax run serves as a classic topping signal only after a stock has broken out of a good base and run up at least for 18 weeks.Going back to Apple, the megacap tech also is staging its fourth breakout of the year.The first breakout came out of a stage-one bottoming base as the marketer of iPhones, iMacs and cellular-enabled wearables busted out of a good cup with handle at 118.12 on Jan. 6.Volume on Monday is running at a mild pace, but that doesn't necessarily mean the current breakout will fail. Indeed, a heavy increase in volume, 40% above average or more, is ideal at the moment a stock surpasses a correct buy point. But in some cases turnover may be muted because fund managers are awaiting important news or an earnings report. In other cases, volume may be dull throughout the entire market.More important, investors should keep an eye out for clear sell signals that reflect a notable change in a stock's character. So watch in case Apple breaks down sharply below the 50-day or 10-week moving averages in furious volume, cracks through the long-term 200-day moving average, or falls 8% below the latest buy point, in what's known as the golden rule of selling stocks.The other two breakouts for Apple came on Aug. 2, when the stock lifted past a 156.75 entry in a flat base, and on Oct. 27 as shares raced past a 160.97 entry in a narrow cup with handle. Volume on that session jumped 64% above its 50-day average.Apple's current average turnover of the past 50 sessions is 27 million shares.Apple is reportedly seeing healthy demand for its ultraluxury iPhone X model in China, one of the company's major markets. Meanwhile, Apple's proprietary IBD ratings look good, ranging from a 95 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 on IBD Stock Checkup to an 86 Relative Price Strength Rating and an A for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity). On Jan. 1, the Composite was a lowly 51, the RS a 59.Apple's return on equity in its September-ended fiscal 2017 was a fabulous 36.9%. However, long-term debt as a ratio to shareholders equity has been rising, and that usually helps boost return on equity. As debt grows, equity gets squeezed, which lowers the denominator in the ROE ratio.Apple has staged a wonderful turnaround, with earnings rising 2%, 11%, 18% and 24% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. Revenue grew 3%, 5%, 7% and 12% over the same period.Fiscal Q1 profit is seen rising 12% to $3.77 a share.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Indian lender HDFC Bank (HDB) lost early gains to trade flat at 98.55. The stock has made a nice recovery back above the 50-day moving average after diving 5.6% in triple normal turnover on Oct. 25. Shares fell hard that day despite a robust third-quarter report in which earnings increased 22% to 73 cents a share on a 19% rise in revenue to $3.56 billion.Now, HDFC is back near a stubborn upside resistance level near 100. A new four-month flat base has formed with a 100.36 entry.HDFC, which holds an $84 billion market cap and has superior IBD Ratings vs. industry compatriot Icici Bank (IBN), has a solid RS Rating of 84 on a scale of 1 to 99. IBD research of past great stock market winners has found that the average RS Rating at the start of a big run is 87.In contrast, Icici sports a decent Relative Price Strength (RS) Rating of 77, meaning it's outperforming 77% of all publicly traded companies over the past 12 months. But the Composite Rating on IBD Stock Checkup is disappointing at 45.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see HDFC's earnings rising 32% to 87 cents a share, which would be a quarterly record.RELATED:Hot Growth Stocks Today: A Peek Inside IBD 50How To Invest: Should You Invest In India Now?Can You Spot Major Market Tops?

291,NOV,"A price war that threatens to upend the airline industry likely began this spring, after thousands of Spirit Airlines (SAVE) passengers in May learned their flights were canceled. The low-cost airline blamed pilots, who were entangled in a pay dispute, for engaging in a ""pervasive illegal work slowdown"" — an account the pilots disputed.X Customers were furious, and a fight broke out at a Spirit counter in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. People were arrested. After passengers booked elsewhere, Spirit cut fares to try to lure them back. As it scrambled to contain the damage, United Airlines (UAL) swooped in, matching some of Spirit's prices in several of the legacy carrier's biggest, most prized airport hubs.United, American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) in years past might not have always seen no-frills, bargain-hunting customers as their own. But flush with cash, they now look to tighten their grip on the skies above the U.S. and drive out ultra-low-cost challengers, potentially limiting competition further in an industry that has already seen dramatic consolidation.The shift has prompted analysts to question if passengers have any reason left to fly airlines like Spirit if the legacy network airlines are copying their strategy — either with bare-bones, high-restriction ""basic economy"" seats or fares that cost as little as dinner and a drink or two.""I don't know that the basic fact has changed: that low costs tend to win in the airline industry,"" said Seth Kaplan, managing partner at Airline Weekly. ""But this is maybe the most interesting moment in history to test that, now that the big three airlines are so successful and now that they have such good balance sheets.""IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review them.
"
292,NOV,"Following 40 bankruptcy-riddled years, the airline industry has consolidated into four airlines that control about 80% of the U.S. market: United, American, Delta and Southwest (LUV). Such market sway has helped improve earnings, and the big airlines have vowed not to let ultra-low-cost carriers (ULCCs) beat them on price.The carriers' path to greater market dominance will be tested in the year ahead. Costs are rising for everything from employee pay to fuel prices to the landing fees that will fund airports' efforts to add parking and transportation and renovate terminals to look more sleek or at least less depressing.The higher expenses to run an airline will threaten profits and the willingness to match bargain fares of the ultra-low-cost carriers, who face some of the same cost pressures.""If your costs are going up, it's not sustainable that you keep lowering your fares,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said of United's discounting onslaught, adding: ""I don't know that I would say (United) would back off first. I would just say that you will see fares trend higher in general.""In years past, the U.S. legacy carriers and the discounters viewed the passengers they pursued as existing in more clearly separated markets, Kaplan says. An airline like Spirit saw itself attracting a more price-sensitive bunch who might otherwise spend their money on, say, going to the movies rather than another airline, he says.Ultra-low-cost carriers generally operate with lower structural costs than their larger rivals do, meaning they can offer super-low fares more easily. Spirit tends to skimp more on seat space, allowing the carrier to cram in more seats and spread costs across more passengers. ULCCs also tend to fly point to point, without guaranteed connections, cutting down on the time — and money — spent on the ground waiting for connecting passengers.As the big three carriers rolled out basic economy, their vast networks offered an advantage on connections, even if the fare class didn't guarantee that, say, a family of four can sit together.With Spirit, you can still sit together. But when United tried to match ULCCs on fares last summer, Spirit had to back off from plans to raise fares to stay competitive with the giants. Spirit stock tanked 18% in a single day in July.""Clearly, the ULCC model is being questioned by the Street,"" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay wrote in a research note following that dive.Shares of the network carriers weren't faring much better. When a bigger, higher-expense rival like United tries to emulate Spirit, United either loses more money than Spirit or makes less money.In particular, plans by low-cost Frontier Airlines to push into Denver were seen by United as a shift away from its point-to-point model and toward a more costly and complex hub-and-spoke model. In hub and spoke, passengers are routed to big airports and then put on connecting flights.""I've believed for many years that the ultra-low-cost-carrier business model can't work when a network carrier decides to compete on price,"" United President Scott Kirby said in July. ""This is the first public validation that one of the ULCCs has thrown in the towel on the point-to-point business model.""Frontier denied it was changing the way it flies. But ULCCs face tough questions about their future.Asked at a conference in September whether ULCCs were doomed when a major carrier cuts prices, Spirit CFO Ted Christie replied ""absolutely not."" He said ""rumors of the death of the ULCC model are clearly overstated"" and that people like low fares.New concerns over industry costs have since recast the debate. In October, United management unnerved investors by making cagey responses to questions about the airline's 2018 outlook.The carrier said that health care costs, pensions and airport fees were rising. But it offered no specifics, saying only that it was ""in the middle"" of mapping out 2018 costs and taking a ""very different approach"" to them.The remarks signaled that expectations set last year may be softening. Those targets included keeping nonfuel unit cost growth under 1%, producing $4.8 billion in ""earnings improvement"" by 2020, and lopping roughly $1 billion off the carrier's capital expenditures this year.Worries grew about United's ability to catch up with Delta on margins. Investors laid into United's stock, sinking it 12% in one day.""Making it worse was poor commentary on the (third-quarter earnings) call where UAL wouldn't address, even qualitatively, 2018 (unit costs),"" Wolfe Research's Keay said in a research note. ""In fact, we felt warned on it.""A week later, Alaska Air Group (ALK) shares tanked as Wall Street worried over its ability to manage costs as it brings Virgin America under its wing.  Concerns included its efforts to resolve a pilot shortage with higher pay amid rising competition.Then American got hit. Shares tumbled after it forecast greater capacity growth and higher-than-expected costs in 2018, with pay raises, benefit hikes and increased maintenance costs weighing.Southwest forecast higher-than-expected costs in the fourth quarter due to ad spending, tech expenses and costs related to getting the OK to fly to Hawaii.The prevalence of cost fears distracted Wall Street from the only industry statistic it generally cares about: unit revenue, which tries to gauge an airline's efficiency by measuring sales in relation to an airline's available supply of seats and flights. That metric, actually, has been OK.The market had a ""sobering recollection that airlines also have cost structures,"" JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker observed wryly in a research note. He pointed out that management isn't typically ready to talk about unit costs and capacity for the year ahead in October. But he said ""we still wish that most had been better prepared.""Now it was Spirit's turn to gloat.""Consolidation didn't really improve the cost structure"" of legacy airlines, Spirit CEO Bob Fornaro said in October. ""It improved the networks, but the costs are going higher.""Spirit hasn't been spared these cost concerns. Costs are certain to rise if management can strike a deal with its employees. The big three airlines all agreed to pay hikes for employees last year.But some ULCCs have support in high places, and are getting new planes that will enable them to compete even harder.Investor Bill Franke, whose Indigo Partners owns Frontier and other ULCCs, agreed on Nov. 15 to buy 430 new Airbus (EADSY) jets for his carriers, including Frontier, in a deal valued at $49.5 billion at list prices.Frontier will get 100 A320neo jets and 34 A321neos. The narrow-body planes are increasingly popular with airlines, as their range and fuel efficiency have opened more direct routes that previously weren't economical.At a press conference after the pact was announced, Franke, who helped transform Spirit into a ULCC, argued that adding loyalty programs, amenities and other things that raise an airline's costs opens up ""a path to hell,"" according to Bloomberg.""We're firm believers in the ultra-low-cost model,"" Franke told reporters at the Dubai Airshow, where the order — Airbus' largest ever — was announced. ""At the end of the day, in a competitive environment, the lower the cost, the lower the fares, is a winning strategy.""But the big airlines also appear to be firm believers in offering passengers a low-fare option, and American Airlines CEO Doug Parker sees an endgame on the horizon. He said in October that the industry was in the ""final stages of a maturation process,"" in which ULCCs, seeking new markets, run into trouble moving into the nation's big airport hubs.RELATED:New Flights Signal Spirit Airlines Is Still Taking Fight To United, RivalsAmerican Signals Higher '18 Capacity; Another Carrier Warns On CostsAirline Stocks To Watch And Industry News

293,NOV,"Most cybersecurity stocks seem to be in a funk heading into 2018 but a pickup in initial public offerings — and, perhaps, mergers — next year might pique the interest of investors.X Venture capital funding for possible new players continues to be strong, says CBI Insights. Among well-funded startups are these names: Tanium, Lookout, Illumio, Cybereason, CrowdStrike, Netskope, Cloudflare, Stackpath, Draktrace and Cylance.Illumio and Cloudflare bear watching in particular as possible IPOs. Other computer security providers that may go the IPO route in 2018 are Zscaler, Tanium, AlienVault, Centrify and ForgeRock, says Renaissance Capital.""There have been some 1,300 startup companies that have been funded in the cybersecurity world overall the past 3 to 4 years,"" said Jonathan Ho, analyst at William Blair. ""So there's increased competition. A lot of those startups are generating revenue, they're starting to eat into the market opportunity of the bigger (public) companies.""The reason for the prospective onslaught? Weak December quarter guidance from several computer security providers generally led to a recurrence of malaise in the sector, analysts say. One exception was an above-consensus outlook from Palo Alto Networks (PANW), which drove its shares higher.What's perplexing to some investors is that security has underperformed other software sectors and the S&P 500 for over two years. That's despite a steady stream of reports over computer hackers like those who breached 3 billion accounts at Yahoo, data breaches similar to those at Equifax, and ransomware attacks just like those at WannaCry.The shift to cloud computing may be one reason for slower revenue growth at security vendors. As large companies shift computing workloads from private data centers to the likes of Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN), they're reassessing what security technology they need. Another factor could be an overcrowded market.This year's crop of security IPOs has been mixed. Okta, which went public at 17 in April, is trading above 30 a share. Okta, a provider of identity management services, raised $187 million. Still, investors have been cool to two other smallish IPOs, Sailpoint (SAIL) and Forescout Technologies (FSCT).IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Computer-Software Security group is ranked No. 128 out of 197 industry groups, down from No. 63 two months ago. Qualys has the highest Composite Rating at 96 out of a possible 99, followed by Fortinet at 94 and Palo Alto Networks at 91. No other companies are above 90. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.Some IPOs over the next 12-18 months, however, could be bigger. Tanium, Lookout, Illumio, Cloudflare and CrowdStrike are among security startups called unicorns by CBI Insights because their valuations top $1 billion.One problem for public cybersecurity vendors that might want to acquire a hot startup is that valuations are running high.""The public companies are being selective in terms of what they're acquiring,"" said William Blair's Ho. ""They're more willing to look at companies that are struggling, that can be plugged into their sales channel, as opposed to buying the market leader at a high multiple.""Proofpoint (PFPT) in November acquired Cloudmark for $110 million. McAfee, recently spun off by Intel (INTC), in November acquired Skyhigh Networks, a specialist in cloud security. Terms weren't disclosed.One problem for public companies is that as startups go forward with IPOs, they could undermine confidence in existing technologies as they make their case to investors.""The shift to Cloudflare is likely pressuring some of the traditional firewall, web application firewall vendors and other providers,"" Adam Holt, analyst at MoffettNathanson, said in a note to clients. ""We'd expect to see an IPO in the next 12-18 months."" Cloudfare provides content delivery as well as security products.Brad Zelnick, a Credit Suisse analyst, has a similar view.""We expect that a pipeline of security IPOs will educate investors on the declining role of firewalls,"" Zelnick said in his note to clients.Firewall network products are the biggest part of the cybersecurity market. Palo Alto, Fortinet (FTNT), Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and others compete in the firewall market. Firewalls are located between private networks and the internet and block unauthorized traffic.There's been speculation 2018 could be the start of an upgrade cycle, with companies buying next-generation firewall products. Spending on firewalls and threat detection technologies popped in 2014-15 after a few well-publicized cyberattacks.Zelnick is among analysts that say firewall vendors are in trouble because of cloud computing.""The cloud dissolves the concept of network perimeter,"" he wrote. ""As the corporate network disintegrates we anticipate spend will be redistributed away from the network to the detriment of incumbent firewall vendors."" Some firewall vendors are adapting to cloud computing by focusing on software-as-a-service rather than network appliances that plug into networks.One firewall vendor avoided the recent sell-off. Shares in Palo Alto jumped on Nov. 21 after it reported earnings and revenue that topped views.""Given the overall malaise in the security market, evidenced by the weak guidance for Q4 from nearly every vendor, we believe Palo Alto's strong growth rate and impressive guidance suggests the company is taking share across the board,"" Andrew Nowinski, Piper Jaffray analyst, said in a note.Palo Alto looms as an industry consolidator as it develops a broader product line,  say analysts. William Blair's Ho says Palo Alto's platform provides customers with access to third-party security tools,  giving it a view into what startups are gaining traction and might make a good purchase.If growth slows in the firewall market, security vendors may expand into identity and access management or target artificial intelligence tools that aid in external threat detection, analysts say.Andrew Nowinski, analyst at Piper Jaffray, says startups Carbon Black and CrowdStrike are battling incumbent FireEye in the endpoint security market — detecting threats from smartphones, laptops and other devices connected via the web to corporate networks. The endpoint detection market is expected to reach $1.5 billion by 2020, says research firm Gartner.Mountain View, Calif.-based Symantec (SYMC) has been busy. Symantec acquired Blue Coat Systems in 2016 for $4.65 billion and also purchased LifeLock, a provider of consumer identity-theft protection services, for $2.3 billion.Acquisitions by private equity firms slowed in 2017 amid uncertainty over corporate tax reform. Thoma Bravo in November said it will acquire Barracuda Networks (CUDA) in a cash deal valued at $1.6 billion, perhaps a sign of PE firms being more active again, analysts say.RELATED:2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New YearIn AI Technology Race, U.S. Chips May Be Ace-In-The-Hole Vs.

294,NOV,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose solidly early Monday morning as Wall Street continues momentum with Congress likely to approve tax cuts before Christmas. ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" topped most opening weekend estimates with Walt Disney (DIS) already entering buy range Friday following its deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox (FOXA). Netflix (NFLX) and Comcast (CMCSA) are near buy points while Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T) are in buy ranges.X Meanwhile, CSX (CSX) could come under further pressure after CEO Hunter Harrison died Saturday. Oracle (ORCL) on Sunday agreed to buy Aconex, an Australian cloud-based software maker for construction projects, for $1.2 billion, a 47% premium.S&P 500 index futures rose 0.4% above fair value. Dow futures climbed 0.5%. Nasdaq 100 futures rallied 0.6% vs. fair value.  The major averages hit record highs Friday as Republicans unveiled their final tax bill with apparently enough support to pass. Congress is expected to vote on the legislation this week.Bitcoin futures were at $19,230 on Cboe Global Markets (CBOE), near session lows but up from Friday. CME Group (CME) Bitcoin futures opened above $20,000 in their debut but then pulled back $19,390.Walt Disney is one of three Dow stocks to claim buy points on Friday.Disney climbed 0.6% to 111.27 on Friday, closing above a 110.93 double-bottom entry after a few intraday moves above that level this month. Disney jumped 6.75% for the week as it agreed to buy key Fox entertainment assets and more for $66 billion, including assumed debt.""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" will reap an estimated $220 million this weekend in the U.S. on top of $45 million in its Thursday's night openings. That's above Disney's estimate for $205 million.Disney is gearing up to launch a stand-alone subscription streaming service in 2019, with Star Wars films and a new live-action Star Wars series among the key content.Disney's upcoming streaming service, and its planned removal of Marvel and Star Wars content from Netflix, will make Netflix more reliant than ever on its own original content. But Netflix is increasingly becoming a must-have for households, even if they subscribe to other streaming or traditional pay-TV services. Netflix is a major reason why many traditional media players are scrambling.Netflix shares rose 0.3% to 190.12 in Friday's stock market trading. Netflix is in a flat base with a 204.48 buy point, but is currently trading below its 50-day moving average. A strong retaking of that support level in high volume could offer a buying opportunity.Comcast held out better than most media and entertainment stocks, but finally broke down in September before finding a bottom in early November. Comcast has formed a handle in a six-month consolidation, creating a 40.83 buy point.Comcast's Relative Strength line has been weak for months, as the stock has retreated while the S&P 500 index continued to march higher.Comcast is the leading U.S. cable and internet provider. It also owns NBCUniversal, making it a major content creator.Verizon is the No. 1 wireless operator. Telecom giants are often seen as distinct from cable and media stocks, but there is growing overlap. Americans, especially teens and young adults, increasingly use their smartphone as their screen for content. Also,Verizon offers pay-TV and internet service via Fios. Verizon also plans to launch 5G wireless broadband in select U.S. markets, competing with Comcast's landline broadband.Verizon bought Yahoo earlier this year following its purchase of AOL. Verizon owns Huffington Post and Tech Crunch.Verizon cleared a 51.28 bottoming-base buy point on Dec. 4, but then fell back down. But the Dow industrials component retook that entry on Dec. 11, closing Friday at 52.67.AT&T has an even better claim as a media claim than Verizon. In addition to being a wireless giant, AT&T owns the DirecTV satellite service, along with the streaming DirecTV Now. AT&T also is trying to buy Time Warner (TWX), which would make a major content player, with CNN, TNT, HBO and more.The Justice Department is fighting to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal, saying it would be anti-competitive.AT&T has cleared a 37.64 cup-with-handle buy point last week, ending Friday at 38.24. But there are definitely reasons to be cautious. AT&T fell to a two-year low on Nov. 6. It's rallied since then but the stock has no prior uptrend before the current consolidation. Shares have closed above their 200-day moving average for the first time in eight months.CSX CEO Hunter Harrison died Saturday from complications from an undisclosed illness. Harrison took an unexpected medical leave late Thursday, a move that sent the rail stock plunging 7.6%, below a recent buy point.RELATED:The Big Picture: Tax-Cut Bill Ignites Stocks, But Breakouts ScarceGOP Takes Bigger Bite From Apple, Microsoft, Google To Seal Trump Tax CutsWhich Companies Are Now Outperforming 95% Of All Stocks?

He called FormFactor his ""top pick for 2018"" based on expectations for solid demand and market share gains in the foundry and logic chip businesses.FormFactor was up 11.7%, near 16.65, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. It touched its 50-day moving average of 16.80 in intraday trading and was just below that key technical level late in the regular session.Livermore, Calif.-based FormFactor makes test and measurement equipment for manufacturing integrated circuits. It is the top maker of analytical probe systems.IBD'S TAKE: FormFactor stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 95 out of 99. But it ranks No. 9 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group.

296,NOV,"The major market averages were modestly higher in early morning trade Friday ahead of the GOP's scheduled unveiling of its reconciled tax-overhaul plan. All three major indexes — the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced about 0.5% apiece.X Meanwhile, Bitcoin futures — which debuted this week on the Cboe (CBOE) — rose nearly 8%.Among the Dow Jones industrial components, Boeing (BA) extended a win streak to four trading sessions, rising another 0.8% to a fresh record high.

Amazon (AMZN) rose 0.1%, as expectations rose for the e-commerce giant to emerge as the undisputed leader of holiday spending. Amazon is just 3% off its all-time high and still nearly 10% from a 1083.41 entry.Finally, Netflix (NFLX) reversed from nice gains to trade around its break-even mark, as the IBD SwingTrader member is shaping a new, flat base with a 204.48 buy point. The video-streaming giant broke out to a brief rally past a 190.05 cup base buy point in October, before surrendering those gains.Among companies reporting earnings, Adobe Systems' (ADBE) beat-and-raise Q4 results sparked a 1% gain early Friday. Shares continued to rebound from their 50-day line, where they have been finding support the last two weeks.Oracle (ORCL) dropped over 5%, as a double-bottom formation broke down. The company reported solid fiscal-Q2 earnings results late Thursday, but its cloud-computing revenue and total revenue outlook fell short of the Street's targets.

299,NOV,"D.C. news moved markets during the week. The Dow and S&P 500 index hit record highs as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and other financials rallied on tax-cut hopes and rising bond yields. Stocks dipped Friday on a report that Michael Flynn, briefly President Trump's national security adviser, is willing to testify against Trump as part of a plea deal.Tech leaders, including many chip stocks and China internets, struggled. Bitcoin frenzy continued amid growing acceptance and concerns. General Motors (GM) said it will launch a robotaxi service for big cities in 2019.X The Dow and S&P 500 rallied to record highs as tax-cut hopes lifted stocks generally, with the Flynn-Trump news only paring gains. The Dow rose 2.9%, its best weekly gain of 2017. The S&P 500 advanced 1.5%. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup (C) and other financials also rallied on rising bond yields while many retailers rebounded on holiday sales hopes. The Nasdaq fell 0.6% as tech leaders struggled, including China internets, many chipmakers and FANG stocks Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB.)Bitcoin's roller coaster ride continued this week, clearing $10,000, then $11,000, then face-planting closer to $9,000 before moving back to around $10,700. The jolts came as smaller investors get more active in trading the much-hyped cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, big financial names continued to weigh in on the prospects of digital currencies: Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles called digital currencies a ""niche product"" that could pose ""serious financial stability issues"" if adopted more widely. Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein told Bloomberg that something that ""moves up and down 20% in a day doesn't feel like a currency."" But derivatives regulator CFTC OK'd Bitcoin futures at the CME (CME) and CBOE (CBOE), with CME saying it'll launch futures on Dec. 18. Cantor Fitzgerald and reportedly Nasdaq (NDAQ) also are moving toward offering futures in the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rose 55% for the week.Cyber Monday was the biggest yet: Adobe Analytics said shoppers spent $6.59 billion online, up 16.8% from the prior year, with nearly a third of that spent via mobile devices. Amazon (AMZN) also announced that this was its single biggest shopping day in history, overtaking the most recent Prime Day; the Echo Dot proved most popular. Adobe believes this will be the first holiday season to surpass the $100 billion mark in online sales. But shares of many brick-and-mortar retailers rallied on expectations of a strong or at least better-than-feared year-end performance. Macy's (M) said it will hire extra holiday workers due to strong demand.General Motors (GM) said it will launch a robotaxi service for big cities in 2019. The top carmaker in the U.S. sees self-driving vehicles as a cornerstone of future mobility — and a potential profit driver. It faces a slew of new entrants in a rapidly transforming auto sector, not least Alphabet (GOOGL) and its Waymo self-driving unit. Waymo — often seen as being furthest along on autonomous technology — said it will soon put passengers in driverless cars — without even a ""safety driver"" to take over the controls if things go wrong. But GM says its ability to both develop self-driving solutions and manufacture cars gives it an edge vs. tech rivals in the race to put self-driving cars on public roads on a commercial scale. GM shares look set for a 4% weekly drop but are up 22% on the year.Marquee auto and tech companies also looked to the future at Automobility LA, a curtain-raiser for the LA Auto Show. Intel (INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich sees self-driving cars as one of the biggest data collectors in the next decade or so. Intel's self-driving partner BMW (BMWYY) said its autonomous cars will hit the road in 2021. SUVs and crossover utility vehicles — the autos in hot demand today — dazzled on the floors of the auto show.General Motors reported a surprise decline in U.S. auto sales, while Ford (F) had stronger-than-expected gains. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) sales fell, largely in line, as the automaker slashes fleet sales.The Federal Reserve is on track for a December rate hike, Jerome Powell, the current Fed governor who will replace Janet Yellen as chair in February, signaled in a Senate hearing on his nomination. Powell also said that he sees the current 4.1% unemployment rate as about the lowest it can go without putting upward pressure on inflation. His remarks suggest that the Fed's hawkish-but-patient tilt probably won't change much after Yellen's exit. Powell also hinted that he favors a lighter touch on bank regulation.Meanwhile, the economy continues to show broad strength. New home sales in October surged to a 685,000 annual pace, a 10-year high. On Friday, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index was a robust 58.2 in November.RV maker and towables maker Thor Industries (THO) slam-dunked on Q1 forecasts with 63% growth to $2.43 diluted EPS on 31% sales gains to $2.23 billion, as millennials, Gen X-ers and Baby Boomers generate demand. The IBD 50 stock leapt nearly 11%. Fellow IBD 50 RV maker Winnebago (WGO) rose 4.45%.As expected, OPEC and Russia agreed to extend their current production cuts to the end of 2018. The deal includes caps on OPEC members Libya and Nigeria for the first time and provision to review the cuts at the June 2018 meeting. Saudi energy minister Khalid Al-Falih said that U.S. shale production growth will be ""manageable"" next year.Earnings per share rose 80% while sales grew 29%, both better than expected. The teen-and-tween-centric discounter also guided holiday quarter views higher. Five Below (FIVE) shares dipped Friday after hitting fresh highs.

VMware's virtualization software lets data center servers run multiple operating systems, thereby increasing flexibility and lowering costs. But, many customers are shifting to cloud computing — renting IT resources via the internet from Amazon.com (AMZN) and others.Workday (WDAY) earned 24 cents a share, up from 5 cents a year earlier, with revenue rising 34% to $555.4 million, both easily topping consensus third-quarter estimates. While its core business has been selling human capital management software, Workday added 37 financial customers in the quarter for a total of 430, up 60% year-over-year. But Q3 billings and bookings decelerated. Shares fell more than 13%.Ambarella (AMBA) earned 75 cents a share excluding items on sales of $89.1 million in its third quarter, vs. consensus views of 67 cents and $89 million. Microchip (MCHP) reaffirmed its prior guidance for the December quarter. Marvell Technology (MRVL) earned 34 cents a share ex items on sales of $616 million in its fiscal Q3, vs. views of 33 cents and $614 million. Semtech (SMTC) topped on Q3 earnings, but missed on sales and gave weak EPS and revenue guidance for Q4.In the design software sector, Autodesk (ADSK) tanked on disappointing third-quarter results and guidance, including a corporate restructuring, while Synopsys (SNPS) surged to a record high on its beat-and-raise report. Autodesk missed views on subscriber additions and lowered its guidance for new subscribers in the current quarter. Autodesk plans to slash its workforce by 13%, cutting about 1,150 jobs, and close some non-core facilities. Synopsys earned an adjusted 69 cents a share on sales of $696.6 million in its fiscal fourth quarter, vs. views of 57 cents and $653 million. For the current quarter, it expects to earn $1 a share, up 6% year over year, on sales of $752.5 million, up 15%, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street was modeling 85 cents and $669 million. Autodesk shares tumbled 17%, while Snyopsys rose a fraction.Guidewire Software (GWRE) reported a narrower-than-expected adjusted fiscal Q1 loss of 6 cents vs. consensus estimates of a 14-cent loss. Revenue rose 15% to 108.2 million, topping views of $100 million.  Management forecast  full-year revenue of $631 million to $641 million, up 24%.

300,NOV,"Apple's (AAPL) current iPhone upgrade cycle looks like it will last longer than usual and should give the consumer electronics giant time to prepare for its ""next big thing,"" a Wall Street analyst said Thursday.X Apple could be facing a strong multiyear iPhone upgrade cycle, rather than a short-lived supercycle, which many anticipated with the launch of the OLED-screen iPhone X, Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said in a report.This ""superlong cycle"" will include the iPhone X launched on Nov. 3, plus an expanded assortment of OLED-screened iPhones rumored for fall 2018, he said.""We believe an elongated iPhone cycle in fiscal 2018, followed by a wider array of iPhone X 'offspring' in fall 2018, along with growing awareness and interest in augmented reality, will all push out the need for Apple to answer the question of 'what's next?' "" Olson said.The rollout of augmented-reality apps with compelling-use cases will help the iPhone X upgrade cycle, he said. Plus, Apple is looking to add a 3D sensor on the back of next year's iPhones to help gauge distances and ultimately improve AR capabilities, Olson said.Olson reiterated his overweight rating on Apple stock with a price target of 200.Apple shares climbed 1.4% to close at 171.85 on the stock market today.Apple on Thursday launched the Apple Heart Study app for a research project in partnership with the Stanford University School of Medicine. The study will use the heart-rate sensor on the Apple Watch to collect data on irregular heart rhythms and notify users who may be experiencing atrial fibrillation (AFib).""AFib, the leading cause of stroke, is responsible for approximately 130,000 deaths and 750,000 hospitalizations in the U.S. every year,"" Apple said in a news release. ""Many people don't experience symptoms, so AFib often goes undiagnosed.""IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 87, meaning it has outperformed 87% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more analysis on Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.As part of the study, if an irregular heart rhythm is identified, the participant will receive a notification on their Apple Watch and iPhone and get a free consultation with a study doctor and an electrocardiogram patch for additional monitoring, Apple said.Shares of medical services firm BioTelemetry (BEAT) jumped on Thursday after it announced it is participating in the Apple Heart Study.

311,NOV,"As the current bull market approaches its ninth year and signs of sector rotation and a possible top emerge, now is a good time to see who joins Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC) and Bank of America (BAC) on IBD's latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds.X Over the last three months, these leading fund managers have continued to pick up shares in semiconductor-related stocks like Intel and Texas Instruments (TXN), building sector names like leading homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM) and construction products manufacturer Masco (MAS), as well as several industrial machinery companies, including Parker-Hannifin (PH) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW).With tensions around North Korea's nuclear missile program rising, it's not surprising that these funds have also been investing in defense contractors, including Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD) and Heico (HEI).Apple, Intel and BofA topped the list in terms of money invested. Seventy-four funds invested an estimated total of $2.3 billion in Intel, while 97 funds scooped up nearly $2 billion of Apple shares. Eighty-nine funds put $1.3 billion into Bank of America.Apple broke out on Oct. 27, but after a short rise has eased back to form a new flat base showing a possible 176.34 entry. Intel has pulled back after making a solid gain from an early October breakout. The chip giant is now testing support at its 10-week line and appears to be setting up a new base with a possible 47.40 buy point.BofA remains extended after clearing a 25.45  entry on Sept. 27. The financial titan is currently 13% above the buy point.Several stocks on this month's list are in or near a potential buy zone, but keep in mind that recent selling pressure in the major indexes and pullbacks by several leading stocks means the current uptrend could be starting to roll over into a correction. If that happens, it will be difficult for individual stocks to make a sustained upward climb.Orthopedic implant maker Stryker (SYK) is working on a first-stage base-on-base with a 160.72 entry. Look for the relative strength line to get closer to new high ground and for the stock to find support at its 50-day moving average. Stryker closed below that benchmark line on Thursday in rising volume.Heico has found support at its 10-week moving average as it tries to complete a flat base with a 93.10 entry. The pattern is part of a long, first-stage base-on-base formation.Fellow defense contractor Aerojet Rocketdyne is also working on a base, but is trading below its 10-week moving average with a lagging RS line.Regional bank stock Synovus Financial (SNV) jumped past a 47.77 entry on Nov. 28, but has now pulled back to test that buy point once again.Three stocks on the list currently pay a dividend yielding at least 2% on an annualized basis: Texas Instruments (2.5%), Intel (2.5%), New Mexico-based electricity utility PNM Resources (PNM) (2.4%) and Dover (DOV) (2%).For a look at how to generate income with stocks and mutual funds without taking on undue risk, see IBD's new special report on income investing.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) topped the list of new sells, with 94 net sellers (163 funds selling minus 69 buying). But recent chart action may be telling a different story.Like BofA and other big bank stocks, JPMorgan has gotten a bump as the likelihood of Donald Trump and Republicans passing tax reform has risen.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) had 55 net sellers (130 selling, 75 buying), while Aetna (AET), which will merge with CVS (CVS) if the deal clears regulatory hurdles, had 35 (94 selling, 59 buying).Johnson & Johnson is working on a flat base as part of a longer first-stage, base-on-base formation.

312,NOV,"Express Scripts (ESRX) on Thursday offered profit guidance that outstripped Wall Street estimates, as Amazon (AMZN) and CVS Health (CVS)-Aetna (AET) threaten to shake up the drug sector.X The pharmacy benefits manager expects adjusted earnings of $7.67-$7.87 per share for 2018, above consensus estimate of $7.66 among analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.That would represent 9% to 12% growth from the midpoint of Express Scripts' new guidance for 2017 of $7.00-$7.08, which was revised up from its previous estimated range of $6.97-$7.05 and above the Zacks consensus of $7.01.Next year's earnings growth should benefit from the pending eviCore acquisition. The eviCore purchase will generate EBITDA of $265 million to $285 million in 2018, Express Scripts said. That purchase, as well as a pending sale of United BioSource, are expected to be complete by December, the company added.Shares of Express Scripts rose 0.7% to 69.02 on the stock market today after hitting 71.25 intraday. their highest level since March. Among other drug-related stocks, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) fell 1.9%, CVS Health gave up 1.1% and Aetna dipped 0.35%, while Amazon rose 0.9%.IBD'S TAKE: The medtech space has been less affected in 2017 by drug-pricing worries than the pharma and biotech spaces. Can the space climb higher still this year? This Industry Snapshot takes a closer look at the group and strong stocks within it.Pharma stocks got whacked in October on reports that Amazon could wade into online prescription drug sales. In another blow to Express Scripts that month, health insurer Anthem (ATHM) said it will tie up with CVS on pharmacy benefit management in 2020, after its current contract with Express Scripts ends.Express Scripts stock has since recovered amid speculation that Amazon may be hunting for a pharmacy benefits manager to gain a foothold in the $300 billion business.On Nov. 30, Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth said he would be open to a deal at the right price, though he wasn't actively looking for one, telling Bloomberg that, ""We don't need to sell to be very successful in the future, but we are always open to others who may all of sudden conclude they want what we have.""He added that a partnership with Amazon on a drug distribution arrangement is also possible.But CVS, which is a major pharmacy benefits manager in its own right, said earlier this month that it will buy health insurer Aetna for $69 billion, with the deal coming as it braces for Amazon to enter the retail prescription business.Some analysts also say the deal would give the combined company an edge over rivals, with stronger negotiating leverage vs. drug manufacturers.RELATED:Amazon: Your New Online Drug Retailer?

313,NOV,"Turnout would be the key to which of the wildly conflicting polls would best presage the result of Alabama's special Senate election, wrote Republican consultant Patrick Ruffini earlier this week.XThat proved correct. Statewide, turnout was down 37% from November 2016. It was down less, 31%, in the five metropolitan counties around Birmingham, Huntsville, Montgomery and Mobile, with their black communities and most of the state's highly educated whites.Turnout was down by even less, 28%, in the 10 rural counties where the majority of voters are black. But it plunged 42% in the remaining 52 small counties. As the returns came in, you could see Republican Roy Moore reaching his target percentages — but not the raw votes he needed. Donald Trump carried those counties by 568,000 votes. Moore did so by only 149,000.So Democrat Doug Jones, with big majorities in the metropolitan (61%) and black-majority (76%) counties, beat Moore by a 50-48% margin in a state that has voted 60 to 62% Republican in the past four presidential elections.Moore was a problematic candidate from the outset. He was twice ousted as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court for disobeying federal court orders, in violation of the supremacy clause in Article 6 of the Constitution. He also argued that Muslims cannot take the oath of office, in violation of Article 6's ban on religious tests for office. In 2012, he was elected chief justice with 52% of the vote, far behind Mitt Romney's 61%.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveMoore might still have won but for The Washington Post's scrupulously vetted Nov. 9 story reporting that in his 30s, he dated teenage girls and sexually molested a 14-year-old. Moore's denials were ham-handed and unpersuasive.The majority of Alabama voters are evangelical Christians. Many white evangelicals were clearly sickened by the charges and stayed home, voted for Jones or, like the state's senior senator, Richard Shelby, wrote in someone else. Black evangelicals streamed into the polls in large numbers.Liberal commentators like to chide white evangelicals by noting that many heavily white evangelical areas have high rates of divorce and unmarried births. The same could be said of black evangelicals. Nonetheless, many such voters lament breaches of traditional morality and seek candidates who uphold their higher, though often violated, standards.There are multiple losers from the Alabama result. One is Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota, who promised to resign in ""coming weeks"" while denying misconduct far short of that alleged against Moore. Minnesota's governor has announced his replacement, and Franken will surely be gone soon.Gone also are Democrats' hopes of capitalizing on what would have been an inevitable Senate Ethics Committee investigation of Moore and a probable vote to expel him from the Senate. Mainstream media, which carefully avoided coverage of the bribery trial of Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, would have joined gleefully in portraying Moore as the face of the Republican Party.Republicans are losers, as well. Their Senate majority is reduced to only 51-49, so Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can afford to lose only one colleague on partisan roll calls. Democrats' chances of winning a Senate majority next year increase, though perhaps not to the 50-50 level some claim. They need wins in marginal Nevada and Arizona, and their chances of saving their 10 incumbents in states carried by Trump — five by wide margins — look better.But the biggest loser is surely Breitbart News leader and former Trump aide Steve Bannon. He has been operating under the delusion that as a private citizen, he can spark a national rebellion aimed at somehow removing McConnell as majority leader. Now it's clear that the only possible replacement is Democrat Chuck Schumer.Bannon campaigned actively for Moore, who would probably have won the nomination even without his help, while Trump endorsed appointed incumbent Luther Strange. Given Jones' small margin, it's obvious that Strange or Rep. Mo Brooks, who finished third in the primary, would have won Tuesday.Jones deserves credit for a flawless campaign, but his example of taking ultraliberal positions on abortion and immigration may lead Democrats to nominate similar candidates in races against less problematic Republicans. And would Jones have beaten Moore if the Senate had been 50-50 and his win would have led to Democratic control?Jones' victory depended on multiple Republican mistakes, enumerated in an amusing tweetstorm by The New York Times' Alexander Burns, much as a lock picker depends on getting every tumbler to fall into place. The result is consequential but won't be easy to replicate.RELATED:Moore And GOP Lost In Alabama, But Did The Democrats Win?More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

317,NOV,"Recent IPO Roku (ROKU) saw its stock leap higher Monday after getting a bullish report from a Wall Street brokerage firm.XNeedham analyst Laura Martin reiterated her buy rating on the streaming video platform and upped her price target on the stock to 50 from 28. Roku shares finished the regular trading day up 17.9 to 46.52 on the stock market today.Martin cited five reasons for her upbeat outlook on the stock: attractive valuation, strategic positioning, active user growth, expanding average revenue per user and profit margins, and a rising competitive moat.""Like Netflix (NFLX), we view Roku as a pure play on over-the-top (OTT) TV-viewing growth, but Roku has no content risk,"" she said in a report. ""Recent announcements and press reports that Disney (DIS), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), etc., are launching new OTT services helps Roku but hurts Netflix.""Martin now expects Roku to hit break-even on an adjusted basis in the third-quarter of 2018, one quarter earlier than her prior projection.IBD'S TAKE: Roku stock has a below-par IBD Composite Rating of 43 out of 99. It ranks No. 3 in IBD's Consumer Products-Electronic industry group. To see which companies lead the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""Roku's engagement lengths are hours per day per user, well above any internet company, suggesting higher monetization potential per user,"" Martin said.

It also gets revenue from selling advertising on its home screen and takes a share of pay-per-view movie sales and subscriptions sold through its platform.The Los Gatos, Calif.-based company went public on Sept. 28 at 14 a share.

322,NOV,"More than 90% of Tesla (TSLA) Model S and X autos rolling off the assembly line have defects that need repair, a report from Reuters says, citing unnamed employees of the automaker.X The alleged defects include doors not closing, water leaks, missing parts, loose objects and more, the report said, attributing  nine current and former Tesla workers.Tesla disputed the workers' portrayal of the automaker as struggling to produce defect-free vehicles. The report on production defects comes as Tesla is in the midst of ramping production of its Model 3 sedan, which is aimed at the mass market.According to Tesla workers interviewed by Reuters, while production snags are normal with any new launch, chronic defects with Tesla's established Models S and X show a company still struggling to master basic manufacturing. Tesla began manufacturing its first car, the Model S, in 2012 but has been notorious for missing production deadlines.Tesla responded to Reuters, saying the majority of its post-assembly defects are minor and are resolved in a matter of minutes. A spokesperson said Tesla has a rigorous process that requires all cars to pass more than 500 inspections and tests. Rework on cars after assembly reflects the company's commitment to quality, the spokesperson said.""Our goal is to produce perfect cars for every customer,"" Tesla said in a prepared statement. ""Therefore, we review every vehicle for even the smallest refinement.""IBD'S TAKE: Tesla has an IBD Composite Rating of 44 out of a possible 99 and is trading below its 50-day moving average. Check out IBD's Tech Leaders feature to get a broader idea on top tech stocks.Tesla in October said it delivered 26,150 vehicles in the third quarter, up 4.5% from the year-ago period, but added that ""production bottlenecks"" were crimping its planned ramp-up for the Model 3. Tesla said it made just 260 Model 3 cars, short of an expected 1,500 units for the quarter.Tesla posted third-quarter results on Nov. 2  that missed earnings expectations by a wide margin and revealed that production woes with its new Model 3 continue, as it pushed out production targets. Tesla had intended to build 5,000 Model 3 sedans per week, starting in the fourth quarter. It now expects to hit that target by late in the first quarter of next year.Tesla shares closed down 3.2%, to 307.54 in the stock market today.

In a statement following a two-day meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee omitted prior language saying it expected the labor market would strengthen further.""Gold moved up in its initial reaction because Fed is dovish in terms of a rate hike vision for 2018, and it sees only three rate hikes, not four,"" Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at TF Global Markets in London, said in a note.After surging through much of the first nine months of 2017, gold is on course for its worst quarter in a year. Demand for the metal as a haven has languished amid surging equity markets and improving economic data, which boosted expectations that the Fed would tighten monetary policy this month. Higher rates make bullion less competitive against interest-bearing assets.Gold for immediate delivery advanced 0.7% to $1,252.67 an ounce at 2:30 p.m. New York time.

332,NOV,"The Dow Jones industrial average edged nearly 0.2% higher in afternoon trading Monday, thanks in part to strength in 3M (MMM), Home Depot (HD) and insurance giant Travelers (TRV), all of which rose 1 point or more. The other major indexes showed tiny pullbacks after nifty advances during Thanksgiving Week.X Meanwhile, the IPO market continued to bolster investors' returns as streaming video hardware pioneer Roku (ROKU) surged more than 10% to 44.71. The small-cap member of IBD's Consumer Products-Electronics industry group is up 49% since charging out of a first-stage IPO base at 29.90 on Nov. 10.Roku has lost money in all but one of the past 11 quarters, but sales have been brisk, rising 17%, 28%, 19% and 40% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. The Street sees the Los Gatos, Calif., firm losing 10 cents a share in Q4 vs. a 3-cent profit in the year-ago quarter.At 2:45 p.m. ET, the S&P 500, up nearly 1% during last week's four-day session, was virtually flat as gains by consumer electronics retail, homebuilder, solar, internet content and select food stocks offset declines in the oil and gas, cement, metal ores, generic drug, outpatient and home care, and long-term medical care industries.The small-cap S&P 600 lost 0.4%; it was down nearly 0.6% in the early going. The Nasdaq composite was virtually flat after lifting more than 1% last week.Volume is running higher on both main exchanges following Friday's half-day session.On the NYSE, Square (SQ) slid more than 11% to 43.44 in massive turnover. At 2 p.m. ET, more than 49 million shares had already changed hands, vs. its 50-day average turnover of 11.5 million and running at more than six times the usual pace. The midcap tech has a market value of $16 billion and a float of 255 million shares.The 5.42-point drop in heavy volume is Square's largest in a single session since the stock initially broke out in late February. That stands as a mid- and near-term sell signal. (On the IBD daily chart, the red line running across the volume bars is the 50-day moving average.)As noted in a Big Picture column last week, Square has been a truly outstanding performer in 2017. Briefly noted on IBD Leaderboard, the point-of-sale, data analytics and financial services firm for small and midsize businesses has climbed as much as 75% since breaking out of a nearly seven-week flat base with a 28.07 entry in September.However, the rally gained a near-vertical slope in recent weeks, and a 42% jump over just 10 sessions (from the Nov. 9 intraday low of 34.83) was one sign of climax-run-type action.Notice how on Friday, despite the market being open just 3-1/2 hours, Square saw heavy turnover but failed to make further headway. Such stalling action indicated that some institutional investors were selling into strength.Shareholders who prefer to make short- or midterm trades may decide to sell, especially if Square closes below its short-term 10-day moving average. (The IBD Leaderboard charts show the 10-day line in green.)Others with more conviction may decide to be patient and see if a new base will form. Meanwhile, the 50-day moving average is still trying to catch up, currently near 34.72. A drop to the 50-day line's current level from a 49.55 high would be equal to roughly a 30% correction, and that's not out of line for a new base to form after such a powerful advance.On Feb. 23, Square bolted out of a first-stage flat-base pattern with a 15.59 buy point in massive volume after the hardware and software tech play posted Q4 earnings of 5 cents a share, its best quarterly result ever, and a 21% jump in revenue to $452 million.The Street sees earnings rising 40% to 7 cents in the fourth quarter this year. Square currently gets a top-notch 99 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup and a 99 for Relative Price Strength on a scale of 1 to 99; but keep in mind that the Composite, EPS, RS, SMR and Accumulation/Distribution ratings are best used to determine which stocks to buy, and not when to sell.Elsewhere, Dow Jones industrial components Microsoft (MSFT) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) also showed healthy action, with the former rallying nearly 0.5% to 83.78 and keeping a healthy upward price gap that it produced four weeks ago. The software, cloud-computing and Xbox giant is up 47% since hauling out of a saucerlike base sitting next to a longer base over a few weeks in late July.Microsoft also produced tight trading after the breakout, yielding follow-on buy points at the 10-week moving average and ultrashallow flat bases.Cisco rallied more than 1% and gained further ground after a recent breakout from a saucer with handle at 34.20. The data networking and telecom gear giant recently gave a bullish sales forecast for the current fiscal year that ends in July 2018. Wall Street currently expects FY 2018 sales to rise just 1% to $48.5 billion, but that would mark a slight turnaround after a 3% drop in FY 2017.CFO Kelly Kramer noted in a Nov. 14 news release that the company returned $3.1 billion through share buybacks and cash dividends. On an annualized basis, that would be equivalent to 6.8% of the company's $182 billion market value.Elsewhere in other markets, WTI crude oil futures slumped 1.4% to $58.21 a barrel on the Nymex. Last week, oil fell short of retaking the $60 level, last seen in late May of 2015.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond edged up to 2.33%, unchanged since the start of October.

He said the market ""lacks steam"" for further gains.The CSI 300 consumer staples subgauge fell 1.5% Monday, deepening a 6.8% decline posted in the final three sessions of last week. Yonghui Superstores was hardest hit Monday, with a loss of 7.2%. The consumer discretionary index fared even worse, falling 2.1% as BYD weighed.Others felt the pain as well. China Lodging Group (HTHT) dropped more than 4%. Tech firms got hit, as YY (YY), Momo (MOMO) and Sina (SINA) each dropped 2%.The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.9% and the Shenzhen benchmark dropped 1.6%, with losses accelerating through the afternoon.Shares were also lower in Hong Kong as some of the year's best performers declined. BYD's H shares were among the biggest losers on the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, falling 3.4%. Ping An Insurance — the strongest stock on the index in 2017, with a 110% gain — also fell Monday.The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index lost 1.1% and the benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 0.6%. Airlines were among those hardest hit after oil's rise at the end of last week, led by China Southern Airlines Co., which slid 5.7% in Hong Kong on Monday, its biggest loss since August last year. The company's H shares climbed 26% over the last two weeks. China Eastern Airlines Co. on Monday fell 4.7%, the most in seven months.""The slides continue as blue chips have gained significantly this year,"" said Shao Rui, analyst at Shanghai Securities Co.

336,NOV,"At the ceremony to break ground last year on a new Toy Story Land in Shanghai, Walt Disney's (DIS) Bob Iger was beaming. To his right, and dressed similarly in a black sweater, was the man who could very well take his place as chief executive officer: Bob Chapek.X Shanghai Disneyland went on to exceed 11 million visitors in its first year. That was a big boost for Chapek, who has delivered steady returns as head of the parks and resorts division. In Disney's fiscal year-end results announced Nov. 9, Chapek's business was the only one of four major units to post an increase in sales and profit.Chapek, whose 24-year career at Disney has included roles in the film studio and consumer products, is now viewed as a likely successor to Iger, according to people familiar with the company. While no formal decision has been made, Disney is under pressure to find a replacement because Iger is scheduled to retire in July 2019, leaving 19 months to complete a transition. If history is any guide, Disney may soon name a chief operating officer or president, currently unoccupied roles that Iger held for five years before becoming CEO in 2005.Chapek's well-rounded experience is appealing for a company whose business ranges from selling toys in malls to churning out ""Star Wars"" films. He stands out at a time when other parts of the business are sputtering. Disney's once-vaunted TV division, home to ESPN, ABC and other channels, reported its second straight year of declining profit this month, as consumers shift to online viewing. The company's film studio, while still the envy of the industry, was dealt a blow last week when Pixar's chief creative officer, John Lasseter, took a six-month sabbatical following allegations of inappropriate behavior.Since taking over the theme-park division in February 2015, Chapek ensured the Shanghai resort, Disney's largest foreign investment, turned a profit in its first year of operation. He also guided the openings of an ""Avatar""-themed attraction in Orlando, Florida, and a ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" ride in Anaheim, California, that have led to attendance gains this year at the company's domestic theme parks.In July Chapek unveiled a flurry of new projects at the parks, including a ""Star Wars""-themed hotel in Orlando and Marvel superhero rides in Anaheim. Disney told investors on Nov. 9 that its budget for investments in the parks will expand this fiscal year by about $1 billion.Fortunes rise and fall within Disney all the time, and a leading contender can quickly lose favor. Iger, 66, has thrice postponed retirement with contract extensions, but said last month that ""this time I mean it."" While Disney has conducted a multiyear succession process in the past, a number of senior managers who would have been candidates to replace Iger have left the company, among them former Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo and Thomas Staggs, another former parks chief.Disney was little changed at $102.67 at 9:41 a.m. in New York. The stock has declined about 1.4% so far this year.Staggs was seen as the likely heir given his promotion to COO in February 2015, more than two years in advance of Iger's then-scheduled retirement. But last year he stepped down after being told the board had lost confidence in him.Chapek joined Disney after working in marketing at H.J. Heinz Co., the food-processing company, and at agency J. Walter Thompson. At Disney, Chapek reorganized the consumer-products division, cutting jobs and focusing the business on brands rather than lines of merchandise.At the parks division, Chapek has focused on pricing, introducing a tiered system of tickets that cost more during peak times and eliminating some annual passes. He's searched for ways to get patrons to pay extra for perks such as nighttime events and passes to get to the head of the line in the company's California parks.An Indiana native, Chapek cultivates palm trees at his homes in California and Florida. He said in an interview earlier this year that when he was growing up, his family went to Walt Disney World as an annual holiday outing.""I was sort of umbilically tied to it from the time I was really young,"" Chapek said. ""So, coming to Disney was a dream for me.""Investors are likely to find out in the coming months whether he's exceeded even his wildest dreams.

338,NOV,"When millennials aren't buying avocado toast or paying off their student loans, they're spending their money at places like Austin City Limits, Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza — and Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) is capitalizing on it.X For anyone who hasn't been paying attention, those are not vacation resorts on anyone's bucket list. They're music festivals, and they've grown enough in size, scale and stature in recent years to become big business.Forget the free-love, free-music gatherings of the Woodstock era — there's money to be made from these megaconcerts. Millennials even were eager to attend the failed Fyre Festival in the Bahamas, where tickets ranged from $1,500 to $12,000 apiece.""Millennials want experiences and are prepared to pay for them,"" said John Tinker, an analyst at Gabelli.Live Nation is dominating the festival, promotion and management space — as well as ticketing, since its purchase of Ticketmaster in 2010. The Beverly Hills, Calif.-based company, which went public in 2005, said it sold 483.7 million tickets last year, up from 463.2 million in 2014.Live Nation makes it easy for concert goers to buy their tickets anywhere via app purchases.Those purchases may come via Facebook (FB) or from an advertisement on another website without having to go to the Ticketmaster page.The way to boost revenue then is to sell more tickets. Most concert tickets are still priced in the low-$80 range, affordable for most fans and music festivals are like splurging on a minivacation, with plenty of picture-taking opportunities for social media.Earlier this month, Live Nation announced a deal with Alphabet's (GOOGL) YouTube to offer concert tickets from Ticketmaster under YouTube videos of artists touring.Sponsoring events and festivals is a higher margin business. In 2014, Live Nation Entertainment bought a controlling stake in C3 Presents, the promoter for Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits, and other major festivals.""Millennials get in some festival (time) for several days and you get their attention. It really works,"" Gabelli's Tinker said.Live Nation offered a new Festival Passport for $799 this year to get general admission into any festival it sponsors for 1,000 lucky fans. General tickets for an event like Bonnaroo typically cost over $250 per person for the four-day festival.Live Nation also has its own venues like Jiffy Lube Live, a 25,000-seat amphitheater outside Washington, D.C., as well as the smaller House of Blues restaurants and bar venues.In its third-quarter report out Nov. 2, Live Nation reported a 12% jump in revenue to $3.56 billion, but earnings only rose 8.2% to 53 cents per share, under Wall Street estimates.For lesser-known acts it can be hard to sell out entire venues. But Live Nation isn't afraid to use Groupon (GRPN) and other discount sites to offload tickets.Live Nation also manages 350 artists from U2 to Nicki Minaj to Lady Gaga. Further, it has operations in 40 countries mostly in the U.S. and Western Europe and its website boasts that there is a Live Nation concert somewhere in the world every 20 minutes.""They bring scale, this is what they do, they manage 350 artists,"" Tinker said, noting that world tours for some superstar artists could be formidable for a smaller firm.""Can you imagine how difficult it would be to manage Jay Z and Beyonce?"" Tinker said.There isn't much room to grow in the U.S., but Live Nation has opportunities to expand internationally especially to Asia and Latin America, said Brandon Ross, a media analyst at BTIG.""There are a lot of dollars to be had in the rest of the world,"" Ross said.Foreign direct investment in China is difficult with high tax rates and competition from domestic firms. But major players in Latin America that are ripe takeover targets that would give Live Nation a strong foothold in the market, Ross said.IBD'S TAKE: Live Nation fell into sell range after the third-quarter report, then retook its 43.95 buy point on Nov. 6 before falling out again. Live Nation is part of IBD's Leisure-Services Group, which is led by Planet Fitness (PLNT), and includes hotels and cruise lines.""Most of the growth for them is going to be abroad,"" he said. ""It's much more difficult to go market by market abroad and roll that up, than it is to roll up your home country.""The vertical integration between the different business segments as well as its massive scale globally has made Live Nation nearly untouchable to rivals trying to enter the space in established markets.The failed Fyre Festival in the Bahamas in April serves as an example. Billed as a luxurious ""Coachella in the Bahamas,"" concertgoers shelled out thousands of dollars each, only to end up staying in humanitarian aid tents instead of the beach bungalows they were promised. It showed that not everyone can put on a concert or festival, but did prove that demand is strong.While the Fyre Festival was not sponsored by Live Nation, the company does encounter its own troubled events. It was a promoter for the Oct. 1 Mandalay Bay concert in Las Vegas in which a man armed with automatic weapons fired on the crowd, killing 58 and injuring more than 500. At least one lawsuit has been filed in which Live Nation has been named as a co-defendant. The company's shares have grown more volatile since the incident.Shares of Live Nation ticked up in afternoon trading Monday, and have been in buy range for most of November.Independent of that, the only outsider that has a chance to take on Live Nation is Silicon Valley behemoth Amazon (AMZN), which has upset everything from booksellers to cable companies to television studios.Ross said a company would need to come in and undermine Live Nation's vertical integration and if anyone could do that, it would be Amazon.Competition could also come from inside the ticket selling space. While Ticketmaster and Live Nation rules primary ticket sales, eBay's (EBAY) StubHub is the go-to site for secondary market sales and could pose a risk if it expands its primary ticket sales because of its brand equity, Ross said.But overall short-term risks are limited in the ticket and concert promoting space.""Tailwinds are at their back with more people that want to go to shows and more artists are touring,"" Ross said.RELATED:FANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google

In Japan, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 0.5%, while South Korea's Kospi Index in Seoul ended a fraction lower. Benchmarks in China ended narrowly mixed.Trade in Europe was more sharply mixed in afternoon action, with London's FTSE 100 down 0.4%, Frankfurt's DAX 0.9% higher and the CAC-40 in Paris up 0.8%.Federal Reserve Chief Janet Yellen goes before the Congressional Joint Economic Committee in Washington, D.C., this morning, in what could be her final testimony before lawmakers.

The company also announced restructuring plans, including the layoff of more than 1,000 workers. The loss drove Autodesk shares back below a 114.78 buy point from a flat base breakout in October, triggering a sell signal.The Commerce Department revised its estimate for third-quarter GDP growth upward to 3.3%, in line with consensus expectations and vs. its initial 3% growth estimate. Inflation pressure was slightly more tame than initially thought, with the GDP price index revised to a 2.1% gain, compared to the earlier growth number of 2.2%.

It's also above the 50-day line.More than half the names in the IBD 50 lost 2% or more.Retail stocks also outperformed in the stock market today, helped in part by news that the economy grew at a rate of 3.3% in the third quarter, mostly in-line with estimates.

344,NOV,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose slightly early Monday morning. Several top-rated stocks that were notable winners in 2017 are moving toward fresh buy points. Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), IPG Photonics (IPGP) and Arista Networks (ANET) are five stocks that have formed bases recently and are approaching entries.XWal-Mart Stores and UnitedHealth are both Dow industrial components, each doubling the S&P 500's performance in 2017.  The latter three all more than doubled last year. Tencent Holdings is one of a slew of top-rated Chinese stocks near buy points. Laser maker IPG Photonics is on IBD's Rising Profit Estimates list while Arista Networks is an IBD 50 member.S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures rose less than 0.1% vs. fair value. Dow futures were up 0.2%.Wal-Mart Stores has been trading in a narrow range since hitting 100.13 on Nov. 17, a day after gapping up 11% on third-quarter earnings. Shares have trended up slightly for the past four weeks, rising as high as 100.38 on Friday, just exceeding a 100.23 flat-base buy point, before settling to close at 100.13.As Wal-Mart has consolidated, the Relative Strength line has drifted lower, reflecting the S&P 500 index's modest outperformance over that time. But the RS line did rise modestly for most of last year, as booming online sales and other steps convinced investors that Wal-Mart would be a survivor in the age of Amazon (AMZN) and even pose real challenges to the e-commerce giant.Wal-Mart rose 43% in 2017 vs. the S&P 500's 19% advance.Ideally, Wal-Mart would blast past its buy point in heavy volume, pushing the RS line to confirm the breakout and signal institutional support.Tencent Holdings is a Chinese messaging and online gaming giant, operating the uber-app WeChat. Tencent is the archrival of Alibaba (BABA) and owns a stake in JD.com (JD) and several other notable Chinese companies, as well as Tesla (TSLA).Tencent shares shot up 114% last year. Not surprisingly, the RS line climbing steadily during the year, reaching a recent peak on Nov. 21, when Tencent hit a record 56.05.  Shares fell sharply to the 50-day line but found support and quickly rebounded.Tencent rose 7.6% last week, far outpacing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, closing at 55.87 and finishing a 6-week cup base.UnitedHealth has just carved out a short flat base with a 231.87 buy point. Shares rose 3.75% last week to 228.73, setting a record close on Friday.The stock's RS line gradually rose from late February to the end of November. UnitedHealth's RS line is moving closer to that old high.IPG Photonics has just completed a cup-base pattern going back the minimum six weeks, giving it a 248.33 buy point. IPG Photonics tumbled from record highs in late November and early December. Shares then began to rebound, but for the rest of 2017 held below the still-rising 50-day line. IPG retook its 50-day line on Tuesday and then kept rising, surging 13% for the week to 242.34.IPG Photonics' RS line advanced in 2017, especially from July to late November. IPG shares leapt 117%Arista Networks was a huge 2017 winners, sprinting 143%.The stock is now in a cup-with-handle base with a 241.60 buy point. Handles offer a chance to shake out weak holders before the stock blasts out of a base. But the handle largely formed as the rest of the market had big gains, pushing the RS line lower last week despite a fractional stock gain. Ideally, the RS line should confirm at least a short-term high, like a handle, on a breakout. That might be challenging for Arista, unless it advances while the market pauses.Arista Networks closed Friday at 236.77.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:These 5 Top Techs Are Near Buys — Now Study The ChartsAdobe, PayPal Lead 5 Stocks Near Buy Points With Rising Earnings EstimatesThe Top 16 China Stocks Surge, In A Fast-Moving Start To 2018Bitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing YetDepartment Stores, Malls In 2018: Amazon Will Let You Live — For Now

345,NOV,"Square (SQ) popped on Friday, reclaiming its 50-day moving average as it claws back from a sell-off that followed a Bitcoin-related run-up.Digital payment processor Square rose 8% to close at 41.14 on the stock market today. Square is still well below a buy point, though, and investors should be cautious about where the stock might be headed in the short term before making a long-term commitment to the electronic payment processor.Square announced Nov. 15 that it had set up a Bitcoin exchange so that users of its Square Cash app could buy and sell the digital cryptocurrency.Square shares were in the midst of a big move after breaking out of a cup base on Sept. 14. That turned into a climax run, topping at an all-time high of 49.56 on Nov. 24.Shares quickly plummeted the very next session, dropping 16% on Nov. 27, and hit a low of 34.14 Dec. 22 before starting to climb back up.Investors may want to wait until Square shares become less volatile and start to consolidate before making a move. A good example might be that of LendingTree (TREE), which constructed several bases on its way to bigger and better gains.In August 2015, the stock hit a high of 139.58 during a climax run and quickly plunged more than 62% to a low of 52.11, reached the following February.LendingTree then built several wide, loose and deep bases before building a tight, eight-week flat base in March 2017. It then embarked on a 173% gain and reached an all-time closing high of 355.75 on Friday.San Francisco-based Square makes credit card readers that plug into mobile phones and tablets.Square has expanded into providing financing and bank loans to small businesses.RELATED:Bitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing YetPayPal Among These 5 Top Techs Within 2% Of Buy PointsChart-Reading Basics: How To Find The Correct Buy Point For Leading StocksHow Did New America Stocks Do During 2017?

346,NOV,"Tesla (TSLA) helped push the Nasdaq composite into higher ground after a fantastic start to the new year last week. Meanwhile, a top Bitcoin play cut initial losses and continues to begin what may eventually become a new base pattern.XTesla scored its biggest single-session gain in months, rising 19.22, or more than 6%, to 335.80 in volume running more than 50% higher than normal. The rebound was strong enough to hoist the electric vehicle innovator back above two important technical levels: the 50- day moving average (near 317) and the still-rising long-term 200-day moving average (currently at 332).At 3:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite gained roughly 0.3% while the S&P 500 was up less than 0.2%. Last week the Nasdaq powered 3.4% higher for the week, its biggest weekly gain since a 3.8% surge during the week of the pivotal U.S. elections in November 2016.The Dow Jones industrial average inched barely higher. Volume is running virtually unchanged vs. the same time on Friday on both exchanges.The S&P SmallCap 600 kept apace, rising nearly 0.2%.Despite a strong gain for Tesla, it should not be bought now if you are following IBD's system for selecting and buying stocks 100%. The simple reason: It has yet to truly break out. The stock needs more time and work to fashion the right side of an emerging new base.Other stocks that broke out today include trucking play Forward Air (FWRD) (cup with handle showing a 58.90 buy point), sleep disorders treatment specialist ResMed (RMD) (flat base, 87.91 entry), fiber optics gear expert IPG Photonics (IPGP) (six-week cup, 248.33) and longtime Sector Leader Arista Networks (ANET) (245.75 in an odd shaped cup).Forward Air is part of the leading Transport-Truck group, which has been in the top 20 among 197 IBD industry groups for months in terms of six-month relative price performance. A strong leading stock market leader tends to be part of a top-performing industry group or sector.The Greenville, Tenn., firm has grown profits at a slow yet steady pace after a tiny dip in 2013. Earnings fell 5% in the fourth quarter of 2016, then grew 9%, 12% and 14% the next three quarters. The Street sees earnings lifting 7% to 62 cents a share for a full-year gain of 12% to $2.32 a share.2018 profit is seen rising another 13% to $2.62 a share.The Dow transportation average is leading the major indexes on Monday, rolling ahead 0.6%.Tesla has certainly grown into a big cap within the Automakers industry group. Yet with a market cap of $56 billion, it still isn't one of the largest companies on the Nasdaq. You can see the tickers of the 30-some largest companies by market value at the top of the Nasdaq chart on the large ""General Market Indicators"" page, accessible via the Market Trend section of Investors.com, or via The Big Picture.Tesla surged from its initial breakout near 40 in the first week of April 2013 as the company proved it can turn a profit. The stock galloped more than 625% to a high of 291.42 by September 2014, then jumped out of a new base on base pattern at 287.49 during the week ended April 7 last year.That breakout, essentially from a first-stage base given how long the stock took to digest its first huge advance, produced a solid return of 34.6% before Tesla peaked at 386.99 in June. Since then, the stock has been in basing mode.In September, Tesla attempted a new breakout past 370.10 in a somewhat wide and loose cup with handle. Wide and loose action is a clear flaw. You want to see controlled, relatively tight action as a stock declines significantly, bottoms out, then builds the right side of a new base.Given that in November, Tesla dropped below the low of 303.12 in the prior cup with handle, one could argue that the company is now forming a new first-stage base. Early-stage bases tend to have higher rates of success than late-stage ones.The company is forecast to loss $3 a share in the fourth quarter as it invests heavily in production capacity for the Model 3 entry level all-electric sedan and other new products.According to IBD Stock Checkup, the Palo Alto, Calif., firm gets an awful 36 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, but that mostly has to do with a tamped down EPS Rating of 22, caused by net losses in 11 of the past 12 quarters. However, the bright spot in Tesla's proprietary ratings can be found in its Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which is a positive B- on a grade scale of A (heavy institutional buying on net) to E (huge selling).The Accumulation/Distribution Rating tracks price-and-volume action over the past 13 weeks and serves as a good indicator when deciding which stocks to buy. In general, prefer those stocks with an Accumulation Grade of C+ or higher. Sometimes, a terrific winner will break out with a lowly Accumulation grade, caused by a few instances of sharp declines in steep turnover. In such situations, look closely at the daily chart of the stock; it may have bounced off the lows during a big sell-off, and that can be bullish.Also, the Stock Checkup shows the up/down volume ratio, which tracks price and volume over the past 50 sessions. If this ratio is 0.9 or higher, that can offset a poor Accumulation rating.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), a huge winner in the fourth quarter of 2017, shaved losses to 5% at 2,220 in bone-dry turnover.The ETF is still in early basing mode. As noted in a prior Stock Market Today column, the Bitcoin play will need more time to build a new base and stage a breakout in the way that it did on Nov. 22, when it hauled out of a deep cup with handle at 985.10.RELATED:IBD's The Big Picture: What The Current Rally Says About This Bull RunStock Market Today: When To Buy This Hot Bitcoin ETFDo You Know How To Spot The Next Major Market Top?

347,NOV,"Many stock mutual fund managers are basking in the warm glow of 2017's hot performance numbers for the broad market. The S&P 500 index rose 1.11% in December, lifting the fourth quarter's gain to 6.64% and capping a 21.83% year. The Dow Jones industrials surged 28.11% for the year, on the way to topping 25,000 for the first time ever on Thursday.X The S&P 500 is already up another 2.63% so far this year. The Dow is up 2.20%.U.S. diversified stock mutual funds edged up 0.73% on average in December to extend their gains in Q4 to 5.13% and in 2017 to 18.26%, according to Lipper Inc. World equity funds, powered in part by a weaker dollar, turned in gains of 2% in December, 4.92% in Q4 and 28.52% last year.General domestic taxable bond funds averaged a Q4 gain of 0.57% on top of a 0.39% December move. They finished the year up 4.86%.But fund managers and investment strategists have also turned their eyes to 2018, where many expect more-modest gains overall.List Of Mutual Fund Six Month LeadersTop Mutual Funds In Q4Mutual Fund Category PerformanceWhy Buffalo Discovery Fund Keeps OutperformingWhich Stocks Are The Top Fund Managers Buying?Fund managers and strategists expect to rely more on foreign stocks and on value equities for their gains. Still, fund managers certainly have not abandoned U.S. equities totally, having 2018 bets on stocks like First Solar (FSLR), part of the S&P 500; Amazon (AMZN), a key piece of the Nasdaq Composite; and Boeing (BA), the best performing Dow Jones industrial average stock in 2017.One reason fund managers and strategists expect to search further afield overall for big returns in 2018: history. Since 1963, the S&P 500 has rallied more than 15% annually in 19 years. And each time it did that, in the following year the broad market's gains averaged just 7.5%.Two more reasons for the expected rotation into more foreign stocks and value equities: Cheaper valuations for many foreign equities give them more room to run in '18, and forecasts for faster economic growth abroad.""We're in a synchronous growth pattern,"" said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist for Nuveen Asset Management and manager or co-manager of seven of its stock mutual funds with a combined $1.7 billion in assets. ""It's rare that we have growth in the U.S. as well as in key markets abroad. In this sort of economic environment, value (stocks) overall should beat growth (stocks).""Stocks should also continue to get a tailwind from the Federal Reserve's slow tempo of interest rate hikes. ""The slow pace is reassuring to investors,"" said Allen Bond, a manager of $6.6 billion Jensen Quality Growth Fund (JENSX), which outperformed the S&P 500 in 2017 as well as the past three and 10 years, and just fell short over the past five years.One key reason why Doll expects value to outperform is that corporate earnings have been on a roll and should remain that way. That's indicative of a rising economic tide that lifts stocks of all stripes, including modestly priced value-oriented ones, Doll said. Further, as the strengthening economy lifts earnings of both types of stocks, investors are likely to flock to value stocks, which are more attractively priced than growth stocks.""Inflation and interest rates have been behaving themselves and letting earnings growth go to the bottom line,"" he added.Doll added that U.S. tax reform should boost corporate earnings. Also, both corporate CEO and consumer confidence is up. And demand is strong for many goods and services, especially in the technology, health care and certain consumer areas.IBD'S TAKE: To see how tax reform impacts individuals like you, check out this IBD report.""Much of the consumer area has been doing OK, with capital spending improving before the tax bill, (enactment of which) will accentuate capital spending,"" Doll said. ""That should be good for industrials and many tech stocks.""Within the tech space, Doll likes software companies and credit card companies, which use software to facilitate digital payments for transactions. Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) were among the top four holdings of Doll's largest portfolio, $563.8 million Nuveen Large Cap Core (NLCIX), as of Nov. 30.Among health care stocks, ""I would highlight diversified biotech companies and managed care providers,"" he said. ""I'm less interested in pharmaceuticals and some equipment companies. . . . We prefer diversified biotech to pharma as they have faster growth and similar valuation characteristics.""Nuveen Large Cap Core also held cloud computing services provider Red Hat (RHT). Red Hat enables a client's noncloud enterprise software to jibe with cloud infrastructure like Amazon's AWS or Microsoft's Azure.Managed care provider UnitedHealth Group (UNH) was a third holding. UnitedHealth benefits from membership growth, driven by rising employment and by increased use of managed care by the U.S. government to control costs. The firm also benefits from its use of data analytics.Additional holdings included First Solar, Amazon and Boeing. Solar energy company First Solar was new to the fund in November. It posted Q3 results on Oct. 27 that crushed analysts' expectations. After four quarters of declining earnings per share, EPS grew 0% and 64% the past two stanzas. Hot as a solar flare in 2017, the stock gained 110.41%.Trading around 125, First Solar is extended. It has a very strong IBD Composite Rating of 98. IBD's Composite Rating is scored on a scale of 1 to 99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher. Its IBD SMR Rating is A. That means it's in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.Amazon soared nearly 56% last year. The e-commerce leader slid on Dec. 29 amid reports that President Trump had called for Amazon — also a leader in cloud services — to pay the U.S. Postal Service higher fees for package deliveries. Separately, the FAANG stock says it shipped more than 5 billion items in '17 through its Prime program, for which customers pay $99 a year.Amazon is near a buy point. Shares broke out Thursday but closed just below the flat base's buy point. Now the stock is back above its proper entry of 1,213.51.And aerospace and defense titan Boeing gapped up more than 2% on Dec. 12 after saying it would raise its dividend 20%, to $1.71 a share, up from $1.42, giving shares a 2.3% dividend yield. Boeing also increased its stock buyback program.In 2018, Dow-component Boeing is up 4.19%.In the tech sector, Jensen's Bond likes stocks that benefit from the ongoing transition to cloud computing. He likes companies that help themselves by making the switch or that make money by helping others shift to the cloud.Microsoft (MSFT) is a dual beneficiary, he says. Oracle (ORCL) enables customers to use on-premises enterprise software or to shift to cloud computing. ""They are a go-to database software provider for companies with extremely sensitive information that can't have things go wrong,"" Bond said.He also likes Alphabet (GOOGL). ""GOOGL is more of a player in the cloud infrastructure space,"" he said. ""If a customer needs access to a cloud structure, they sell that. But most of their business is from their core advertising model, resulting from their ubiquitous position in online search and online ad buying.""Bond also likes specific themes in health care. One such theme is growing affluence in emerging markets. That enables patients to be able to afford better health care.""When a health care system starts to grow and develop in an emerging market, needles and syringes are some of the first things they need to make that work,"" he said. As a result, he likes Becton, Dickinson & Co. (BDX), a leading maker of needles and syringes.The company acquired CareFusion, a maker of infusion pumps (which deliver medical liquids over time), in 2015.And last month Becton Dickinson said it and C.R. Bard had agreed to divest two product lines to win regulatory approval for their merger. Bard makes catheters and biopsy devices.Bond also likes Stryker (SYK), whose orthopedic implants, surgical tools and medical devices enable it to capitalize on aging populations in the U.S., Europe and Japan.The $174 million Kinetics Internet Fund (WWWFX) was one of the top performing U.S. diversified stock mutual funds in 2017, posting a 57.43% gain, according to Morningstar Direct.The fund had 36 holdings as of Sept. 30, including a 12% stake in Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC). The cryptocurrency, which is volatile, rose about 1,166% last year. ""We're not afraid to be wrong,"" said co-manager Peter Doyle. ""A lot of people won't participate in the upside of 'consensus money' and cryptocurrencies because they need outside reinforcement. We don't say cryptocurrencies can't fail. But we control our risk by controlling the size of our position.""Doyle said the fund's stake is ""much higher"" than what it has formally disclosed, due to appreciation.For investment opportunities in general, the fund is looking beyond many popular large caps that enjoyed large run-ups in 2017 and other recent years. Their high valuations leave them insufficient room to post additional gains, said co-manager James Davolos.For one thing, the fund holds stock in nine companies in which noted investor and Liberty Global (LBTYK) chairman John Malone holds large blocks of shares, including Liberty Media (LSXMK), Liberty Broadband (LBRDK) and Liberty Global. ""If you've trusted John Malone (by owning shares in his companies) over the years, almost without exception you've done well,"" Doyle said.Kinetics Internet also likes Live Nation Entertainment (LYV). The company helps popular music performers earn a living through live performances and through concession sales, corporate sponsorships and advertising, Doyle said.The fund managers also like Copart (CPRT), which conducts salvaged vehicle auctions. ""This company keeps gaining market share by providing value to both buyers and sellers of vehicles by providing price transparency and lower transaction costs,"" Davolos said.S&P 500 index funds led all U.S. diversified categories in Q4 with an average gain of 6.76% after tacking on 1.28% in December.World equity funds trailed U.S. diversified stock funds in Q4, averaging a 4.92% advance after a 2% December return. India region funds paced all foreign stock fund categories by soaring 12.64% in Q4, helped by a 4.77% December romp.Global natural resources funds beat other major sectors by posting a 6.45% Q4 gain, aided by a 4.96% December geyser. That gave them an 8.49% return for the year. But commodities base metals funds did even better with gains of 7.68% in December, 10.97% in Q4 and 28.69% for the year.Consumer services funds added 2.52% in December, which lifted its gains to 8.42% in Q4 and 18.23% in 2017.Loan participation funds were tops in Q4 among general domestic taxable bond categories, rising 1%. Their December gain was 0.35%.Among world income funds, emerging markets hard currency funds enjoyed the best Q4, gaining 0.73%, a shade better than their December return.Municipal bond funds averaged a Q4 gain of 0.44% after returning 0.81% in December.RELATED:Stock To Watch: Who Joins Apple, BofA On List Of New Buys By Top FundsHow Did Mutual Funds Perform In 2017?You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

348,NOV,"Autohome (ATHM) is on the move, and as the company focuses on big data to drive future growth, analysts believe there could be more room for the stock to run.X Initiating coverage on China's online destination for all-things-automotive with a buy rating on Jan. 2, Citi said that Autohome is ""gaining share in auto ad budgets.""Not only does the website — with content ranging from professional to user-generated to informational listings — make money from advertising, it's also growing sales in two other segments: auto finance and data products. Citi expects these newer areas to drive the ""next leg of growth.""""Big data is one of our key competencies,"" Chief Executive Min Lu said during the company's quarterly earnings call on Nov. 7. ""Being a leader in the market, we're positioned to build and unify our comprehensive database of auto consumers and vehicles in China and leverage this vast amount of data to offer vehicle planning and design, consumer acquisition and sales leads conversion, highly targeted marketing solutions and detailed competitive analysis and sales projections.""Over the last three quarters, earnings growth has accelerated from 15% to 39% to 58%, and that upward trend is projected to continue in the fourth quarter.Analysts expect Autohome's next quarterly earnings to hit 75 cents a share, which would be a 60% rise year over year according to Zacks Research.After consolidating for over four months, Autohome shares surged nearly 11% in heavy volume on Jan. 2, sailing beyond a 67.79 buy point. The stock is continuing to extend its gains and is now trading roughly 7% above the entry. Looking at a weekly chart, the Relative Strength line is hitting new high ground, which confirms the move.The recent pop not only coincided with Citi's initiation of coverage, but it also came as positive economic data out of China lifted the nation's internet stocks as a group.Out on Jan. 2, the December reading for the Caixin/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index for manufacturing reached 51.5. That not only surpassed estimates, but it marked a four-month high for the metric that focuses on small and midsize businesses.""Manufacturing operating conditions improved in December, reinforcing the notion that economic growth has stabilized in 2017 and has even performed better than expected,"" according to Zhengsheng Zhong, the director of macroeconomic analysis at Caixin's subsidiary CEBM Group.But amid ""tightening monetary policy and strengthening oversight on local government financing,"" according to Zhong, will Autohome as a company continue to perform better than expected?IBD'S TAKE: Autohome ranks No. 1 in Investor's Business Daily's Internet-Content industry group with a highest-possible Composite Rating of 99, meaning the stock outperforms 99% of all other stocks on a variety of fundamental and technical factors, including earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and price performance.Even though Autohome's full-year earnings per share growth rate expectation sits at a strong 22% for 2018, not all analysts have a rosy outlook for the stock. UBS maintained its sell rating in the wake of Autohome's quarterly report in early November, saying there's a ""lack of visibility in (the) 2018 growth outlook.""In particular, analyst Ming Xu noted concerns about a potential slowdown in advertising revenue growth and is cautious about ""revenue contribution from the auto finance platform due to limited value add.""On the other end of the spectrum, CLSA analyst Man Ho Lam said in a Nov. 14 research report that the auto finance platform has the ""potential to begin contributing meaningfully"" to revenue this year, according to StreetInsider.

359,NOV,"Shares of Tesla (TSLA) dipped Thursday after reporting fourth-quarter Model 3 car deliveries that fell far short of estimates and raised questions of whether the company will need to raise more cash.X The Tesla report gave fodder to both bulls and bears, with bulls cheerful that Model 3 production accelerated late in the fourth quarter. Bears growled that Tesla again missed production goals and is chewing through cash at a rate of $1 billion a quarter.Tesla reported fourth-quarter delivery estimates after the market close Wednesday that showed it continues to struggle with production on its Model 3 sedans. Production of its two other models, the S and X, were in line with expectations. But Tesla again pushed back production schedules on its Model 3, based on previous projections. The Model 3 is Tesla's first car aimed at the mass market.Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch said both bulls and bears got what they wanted in Tesla's report.Tesla's production guidance ""will give bulls some hope, but bears will see support for the thesis around persistent production delays, near-term cash needs, and an overextended organization,"" he wrote in a research note to clients.""We also believe equipment providers are likely looking for payment which could pressure Tesla to run into a challenging cash position. We remain on the sidelines,"" wrote Rusch.Tesla said it manufactured a total of 2,425 Model 3 sedans in the fourth quarter, which is well short of where it had intended to be at this time. Of those, it delivered 1,550 Model 3s, with the remainder in transit. Analysts had expected Tesla to deliver about 4,100 Model 3s.""Model 3 volume fell short of expectations which, to be fair, were largely guesswork given the absence of guidance,"" Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois wrote in a research note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Tesla have been consolidating since the company's stock hit an all-time high of 389.61 on Sept. 18. During this consolidation, it hit a low of 292.63 on Nov. 2. The stock is stuck under its 50- and 200-day moving average lines.A bigger concern is that Tesla pushed back production guidance, which suggests the company will need more capital, he wrote.Tesla now expects to reach production of 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of the second quarter, instead of the first quarter as previously planned.""We see only moderate downside risk to estimates from today's disclosure,"" wrote Houchois, who maintained a rating of underperform with a price target of 240.Tesla shares initially fell 3.6% during morning trading, then won back some of those losses as the session wore on. By the closing bell, Tesla shares were off 0.8% to 314.62 on the stock market today.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson said he detected ""a noteworthy tone change"" in the Tesla announcement as it is ""opting for a more gradual ramp in Model 3 production to focus on quality and efficiency rather than just volume.""""With the 5,000/week production target pushed out a quarter, management is effectively buying itself another quarter of blaming the lack-of-scale for would-be sub-par margins,"" Erickson wrote.""While in the long run (and in the eyes of many bulls), this does not drive that big of a volume change, it does appear there is increasing risk to the Street's 174,000 Model 3 estimate for next year,"" Erickson wrote.Nomura analyst Romit Shah said he was encouraged by the progress on Model 3 production ""and continue to expect Tesla to deliver substantial (+100%) revenue growth in 2018.""He maintained a buy rating on Tesla and a price target of 500.""Importantly, we believe that Tesla is prioritizing quality control,"" Shah wrote. ""While Tesla's repeated guidance revisions could begin to risk damaging its elite brand, a mass-recall would probably be far more damaging.""Tesla acknowledged production woes with its Model 3 when it reported third-quarter results on Nov. 1 that missed earnings expectations by a wide margin. Production delays at Tesla are among the reasons a large amount of Tesla shares are sold short.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Self-Driving Cars: Why 2018 Will Be The Year The Rubber Hits The RoadTesla Receives Largest Order For Big-Rig Semi Truck From UPS

361,NOV,"Shares of China-based Momo (MOMO) plummeted Tuesday after the mobile-based social networking platform reported third-quarter results that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines, but its revenue projections fell short of views as the number of paying users of its live video-streaming business stayed flat.X Shares plunged 18.8% to close at 25.08 on the stock market today, dropping to a 10-month low.Momo estimated fourth-quarter revenue to be in the range of $370 million to $385 million, a year-over-year increase of 50% to 56%. The midpoint of $377.5 million, however, is short of the consensus estimate at $383 million.Momo also ended the quarter with 94.4 million monthly active users, up 22% from the year-ago period. But Momo said it ended the quarter with 4.1 million paying users of its live video-streaming business, the same as the previous quarter.Other China companies are also targeting live video streaming, including YY (YY), which reported third-quarter results on Nov. 14 that soundly beat estimates on the top and bottom line, as did its revenue guidance for the fourth quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Momo carries an IBD Composite Rating of 85 out of a possible 99, though that is down from a previous rating of 98.

363,NOV,"Like clutch hitting in baseball, IBD's investment strategy works best when the wind is blowing out and the bases are loaded.X That's essentially what has happened so far this year. The market has provided a tailwind: The Nasdaq is up 27% year to date; the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average, 22%; the S&P 500, 17%; and the small cap Russell 2000, 14%.Meanwhile, the IBD screens are doing exactly what they are supposed to do in good times: Outperform the indexes. Rounded off, here's how the year-to-date gains looked as of Nov. 30:All seven of the above yardsticks topped the broad stock indexes by solid margins. Two additional IBD screens beat the S&P 500 but were roughly even or modestly behind the Nasdaq's pace:The Stocks On The Move table can be seen on the homepage of Investors.com, as well as in Stock Lists; a weekly version of this screen is printed in the second section of the IBD Weekly print newspaper.What can be concluded from this? Three things:First, give thanks where thanks is due: the stock market itself. The M in CAN SLIM — which stands for ""market direction"" — is the most important ingredient to investing success. A tailwind can make a huge difference in investing.Second, the folks who say ""You can't time the market"" deserve a similar reply with a different inflection, ""No, you can't time the market.""If you're not already an IBD member, get instant access to these stock lists with this special offer.There are markets that IBD-style investors will sit out because the bear is on the prowl. There are rolling, sideways market that will frustrate even the best growth investors, which is what happened in 2016. But a market that marches steadily upward, as it has in 2017, can be timed for profits.Monitoring IBD's ETF Market Timing strategy and reading The Big Picture stock market column on a daily basis will quickly advance your market-timing prowess.Third, no matter what kind of market an investor is playing, wise stock-picking and sound rules are essential. For example, in the first month of 2017, nine stocks appeared in the Sector Leaders screen for at least one week.Some never broke out but sagged to losses. Others were choppy, difficult holds.But two of the nine stocks scored exceptional gains. Stamps.com (STMP) broke out May 25 and eventually scored a 71% gain in five months.Broadcom (AVGO) retook a buy point in January and, for those who sat through a 3% initial pullback, rang up a 57% gain in about 10 months.Zeroing in on the best isn't always an easy exercise in real time. But a general market that serves up a tailwind for stocks can often be counted on for fresh opportunities.The investor doesn't have to handle every breakout perfectly in order to find success.IBD's TAKE: To further improve your timing in the purchase of any stock, deepen your knowledge of what the relevant bases are from which great companies break out and rush into new high ground.

Ten of the 30 Dow components rose more than 1%, but a couple made noteworthy moves.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) rose more than 1% and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) nearly 2% as both stocks rose from support at the 50-day moving average.

The S&P 500 climbed 0.7%, but the Nasdaq composite lagged with a 0.3% gain.

366,NOV,"Roark Capital Group has agreed to buy restaurant chain Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) for about $2.4 billion, adding to the private equity firm's stable of eateries that includes Arby's and Cinnabon.X Roark agreed to pay $157 a share in cash for the Minneapolis-based restaurant operator, representing a 34% premium to the stock's Nov. 13 closing price, the day before Roark's opening bid of about $150 was reported. Roark will also take on Buffalo Wild Wings net debt, the companies said Tuesday.The deal caps a tumultuous year for Buffalo Wild Wings, which lost a proxy fight with activist Marcato Capital Management in June. The battle caused longtime Chief Executive Officer Sally Smith to announce her resignation. The chain came under fire after a sales slump was exacerbated by higher prices for chicken wings.Buffalo Wild Wings shares climbed as much as 6.8% in pre-market trading to $156.30. The stock had dropped 5.2% this year through Monday's close.Under the terms, Buffalo Wild Wings will become a closely held subsidiary of Arby's and will continue to be operated as an independent brand, the companies said. Paul Brown, chief executive officer of Arby's Restaurant Group, will serve in that role of the expanded company.Funds advised by Marcato, which owns about 6.4% of Buffalo Wild Wings, have agreed to vote in favor of the acquisition, according to a statement.Barclays served as financial adviser and White & Case LLP as legal counsel to Arby's. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. provided financial advice to Buffalo Wild Wings, while Faegre Baker Daniels LLP was its legal counsel.Roark Capital is a prominent player in the food industry, with investments in chains such as Carl's Jr., Carvel and Auntie Anne's. The private equity firm earlier this year backed an unsuccessful attempt to buy fried-chicken chain Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen Inc., which instead was sold to Restaurant Brands International (QSR) for about $1.8 billion.

367,NOV,"After strong 2017 gains, the S&P 500 index and other major averages rose sharply to new highs to start 2018. Chip stocks were strong even with Intel (INTC) disclosing a big flaw in many processors. Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) were among many breakouts, but often with some issues. Tesla (TSLA) struggled to get Model 3 out the factory gate while other auto stocks rallied despite U.S. auto sales capping their first annual decline since the financial crisis. Bitcoin had a relatively calm week of solid gains as rival cryptocurrencies surged ahead. Economic data were solid but shouldn't spook the Federal Reserve.X The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 index and Dow industrials rose sharply to start 2018, with oil, steel and chip groups among the big winners, while utilities sold off. Facebook, Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) were among those breaking out, but many were in low volume or had other notable flaws. Crude futures rose to a three-year high. The Treasury yield spread continued to narrow.Intel (INTC) fell as low as 42.69 after a security issue was revealed on its PC and server processors but rallied to close down 3.1% at 44.74.  The security issue could allow hackers to gather sensitive data from the memory of computing devices, but not modify, delete or corrupt data through the exploit, Intel said. The chipmaker said it has developed and is rapidly issuing software patches and firmware updates to correct the problem. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) saw its shares rally because its processors reportedly are not vulnerable to the same security exploit.Bitcoin prices rose to above $16,000 on Friday, capping a solid weekly gain in what was a relatively calm period for the fast-moving cryptocurrency. Alternative digital currencies Ripple and Ethereum surged to new highs. Founders Fund, co-founded by early Facebook investor Peter Thiel, invested $15 million-$20 million in Bitcoin — an investment worth hundreds of millions now, according to the Wall Street Journal reported. The Journal also reported that Merrill Lynch barred its financial advisors from making trades for clients in Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) or proposing any Bitcoin related investments. Russia is looking at creating its own cryptocurrency after President Vladimir Putin meet with Vitalik Buterin, the Russia-born founder of Ethereum, to figure out how to regulate them. China is reportedly looking to regulate power usage for Bitcoin mining after closing exchanges last year to reduce spreading financial risks.Nearly all automakers saw U.S. vehicle sales fall in December despite heavy incentives and a year-end sales push, but Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) topped estimates, with Ford eking out a 0.9% gain. For 2017, U.S. auto sales fell 1.8% to 17.2 million vehicles, according to Autodata, marking the first decline in eight years. Both analysts and carmakers see a drop below 17 million in 2018. Despite weak auto sales, auto stocks continue to perform well, as investors expect the momentum in higher-margin SUV and truck sales to continue. GM rose 7.4% for the week, Ford 5.7% and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) 22%.Tesla continues to struggle with production on its Model 3 sedans, with overall vehicle output stagnant in recent quarters. Tesla made 2,425 Model 3 sedans in the quarter, vs. consensus of 4,100. Tesla claimed it made ""major progress"" on bottlenecks but now expects to reach production of 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of the second quarter, instead of the first quarter as previously planned. Tesla shares rose 1.7% but are still near seven-month lows.Shares of BlackBerry (BB) jumped 24% to their best levels since June 2013 in large part as the one-time smartphone leader signed a deal with Chinese internet giant Baidu (BIDU) to work together on automotive software for self-driving vehicles.A Goldilocks jobs report for December quieted talk that labor markets are at risk of overheating. Payrolls rose a moderate 148,000, well below the 190,000 expected, as the jobless rate held at 4.1% and average hourly wage gains remained stuck at 2.5%. The data may help Federal Reserve policymakers follow a slow pace of interest rate hikes, at least for now. Yet other indications suggest the economy ended the year with a strong head of steam. Holiday sales were strong. And the ISM manufacturing index unexpectedly rose 1.5 points to 59.7, signaling accelerating factory growth.

368,NOV,"Tesla (TSLA) on Wednesday reported fourth-quarter delivery estimates that show it continues to struggle with production on its Model 3 sedans, while production numbers of Model S and Model X were in line with expectations.X Tesla announced it manufactured a total of 2,425 Model 3 sedans in the fourth quarter, which is well short of where it had intended to be at this time. Of those, it delivered 1,550 Model 3s, with the remainder in transit. Analysts had expected Tesla to deliver about 4,100 Model 3s.In total, Tesla said it delivered 29,870 vehicles, of which 15,200 were Model S, 13,120 were Model X, and 1,550 were Model 3s.""This was once again our all-time best quarter for combined Model S and X deliveries, representing a 27% increase over Q4 2016, and a 9% increase over Q3 2017, our previous best quarter,"" Tesla said in a prepared statement.But Tesla again pushed back production schedules on it Model 3, based on previous projections.""As we continue to focus on quality and efficiency rather than simply pushing for the highest possible volume in the shortest period of time, we expect to have a slightly more gradual ramp through Q1, likely ending the quarter at a weekly rate of about 2,500 Model 3 vehicles,"" Tesla said. It now expects to reach production of 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of the second quarter, instead of the first quarter as previously planned.Tesla has had a hard time getting the premium sedan off the factory floor with just 222 delivered in the third quarter. Production started in July and Tesla initially planned to be delivering 5,000 vehicles per week sometime during the fourth quarter, but that was delayed to the first quarter after encountering production bottlenecks.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Tesla have been consolidating since the company's stock hit an all-time high of 389.61 on Sept. 18. During this consolidation, it hit a low of 292.63 on Nov. 2. Tesla has an IBD Composite Rating of 37 out of a possible 99, and ranks ninth among stocks in the automotive group, behind first-place Fiat Chrysler (FCAU).Shares of Tesla lost 1% during the regular session to 317.25 and were down another 1.7% in after-hours trading to 312 on the stock market today.During the fourth quarter, Tesla said, ""we made major progress addressing Model 3 production bottlenecks, with our production rate increasing significantly toward the end of the quarter.""In the last seven working days of the quarter, Tesla said it made 793 Model 3's. Tesla said it hit a production rate, over the last few days, on each of its manufacturing lines that extrapolates to more than 1,000 Model 3's per week.""As a result of the significant growth in our production rate, we made as many Model 3's since December 9 as we did in the more than four months of Model 3 production up to that point,"" Tesla said. ""Model 3 deliveries to non-employee customers are now accelerating rapidly, and we're confident our customers will love them.""Tesla has struggled to get its Model 3 out the door, during what Chief Executive Elon Musk has called ""production hell.""Tesla acknowledged production woes with its Model 3 when it reported third-quarter results on Nov. 1 that missed earnings expectations by a wide margin. Production delays at Tesla are among the reasons a large amount of Tesla shares are sold short.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Self-Driving Cars: Why 2018 Will Be The Year The Rubber Hits The RoadTesla Receives Largest Order For Big-Rig Semi Truck From UPS

370,NOV,"E-commerce leader Amazon (AMZN) added about 10 million subscribers to its Prime membership program in 2017, raising the total number by 20% to a record 60 million. according to a Wall Street analyst.X ""In our view Prime remains the most critical driver of Amazon's e-commerce business long term,"" wrote Cowen analyst John Blackledge in a research note to clients Wednesday. His estimate of 60 million Prime members was derived from Cowen's survey of 2,500 consumers.About 54% of U.S. households are now Prime subscribers, up from 18% in 2013, Blackledge said.""We expect rising Prime penetration in 2018 to continue as we have seen no clear indications of slowing demand for Prime,"" Blackledge wrote.Shares of Amazon went back above the 1,200 level for the first time since Nov. 28. Shares ended the regular session up 1.3% to 1,204.20.Amazon doesn't reveal how many Prime members it has, and analyst estimates vary widely. In October, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners issued a press release saying Amazon had 90 million Prime subscribers, which it based on a survey of 500 Amazon users.Subscribers to Amazon Prime pay $99 a year. With it they get free shipping, free access to Amazon's streaming TV service and streaming music, exclusive discounts and other perks.The perk for Amazon is that Prime subscribers spend more and buy more frequently than non-Prime members. In December, about 85% of Prime members made a purchase on Amazon, accounting for 65% of total Amazon purchases that month, Blackledge wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon has been a big winner, with the stock up 56% in 2017. Amazon is an IBD Leaderboard stock with an IBD Composite Rating of 77 out of a possible 99. Looking for the next big thing? Start with this simple routine.Amazon on Tuesday boasted of record holiday sales, putting a spotlight on Prime subscribers with its ""Best of Prime 2017.""

376,NOV,"Let's face it. There's nothing better than owning shares of an emerging leader in the early stages of a powerful move.X Recognizing when a stock is forming a bullish chart pattern that could yield more upside is a great skill to have when scouring the market for buy candidates.But it's not always chart patterns that yield ideal entry points in a stock. Downward-sloping trend lines, found by connecting a stock's recent highs, can also yield actionable buy points that are often earlier than buy points in a classic base. When a stock breaks out over a trend line, in many cases, it's also breaking out of a downtrend.In many cases, stocks breaking out of downtrends will still be far off highs, as opposed to stocks building bases, which tend to be closer to new-high ground.In hindsight, Applied Materials' (AMAT) strong price performance in recent months was in anticipation of improving fundamentals, and the semiconductor industry bellwether certainly has delivered in recent quarters. Over the past five quarters, year-over-year sales growth has ranged from 20% to 45%; earnings have jumped 41% to 158%. That's impressive for a company with a market capitalization north of $60 billion. And it's organic growth, too, not fueled by recent acquisitions.The accompanying chart shows how a trend line on a weekly chart can be used to identify an entry point. In this example, just two highs were connected, but there will be weekly charts where connecting three or four recent highs is easy to do.Applied Materials broke out over the trend line in late February 2016, just ahead of a breakout from a standard buy point of 19.51 in the long base. It continued to show relative strength with two more breakouts.Trend lines can be drawn on daily or weekly charts. The best trend lines on a daily chart are found when at least a few recent highs can be connected over a time frame of at least several months. As Applied Materials showed, connecting a couple of recent highs on a weekly chart can also result in a clean trend line.Applied Materials' price performance remains impressive even though its last breakout in late September this year was from a late-stage base. Shares were volatile Nov. 17 after the company delivered another strong quarter of growth. But after rising 5% intraday, sellers came into the stock, knocking shares lower by 2% by the close. Volume was the heaviest for a down session in many months, a clear sign of institutional selling. More gains could be tough to achieve from here.RELATED:Best Stocks To Buy And Watch How To Invest In The Stock Market Using A Simple RoutineWhen To Sell Stocks: Look For The Single Biggest Point Decline In Heavy VolumeWhen To Sell Stocks II: Why A Big Undercut Of The 50-Day Moving Average Is A Topping Signal

Netflix has formed a new flat base, a base-on-base formation, with a 204.48 entry.JPMorgan rose 3.5% to 101.36, moving bullishly off its 50-day moving average.

JPMorgan had been in a buy range from a 95.32 entry but is now extended from that.Bank of America leapt nearly 4% to 27.64, also rebounding from its 10-week line in strong trade. BofA had been hovering right at the edge of a buy zone from a 25.45 entry.Citigroup shot up 3.2% to 73.70, moving back above its 50-day line in above-average trade. Citi had been in range from a 69.96 buy point.

All of that is as expected, but the news seemed to buoy JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup and other banks.Big bank stocks have struggled to outperform the broader market for extended periods.

386,NOV,"In pursuit of major economic growth-inducing tax reform and simpler, fairer personal taxes for our nation, we now have the details. The Ryan-Brady version came out of the House Ways and Means Committee on Nov. 2 and the Senate version was presented by Sen. Orrin Hatch and his Senate Finance Committee one day after.XThese plans differ in many (minor) respects but are the same in their central themes: Let's grow the American economy rapidly as we cut taxes and simplify the tax code and its rules on American workers and businesses.  Unfortunately, they both retreat from their bold elimination of the hated ""Death Tax.""We could get enmeshed and distracted by minor brush fires as the DC lobbyists pound their chests and flex their muscles for their clients.  But we should remember the lead lines of an old popular song that sets the stage: ""You've got to accentuate the positive, eliminate the negative, but don't mess with Mister In-between."" (In this case, the Death Tax is the ""Mister In-between"" that has profound implications on wealth creation, business development and jobs).Since we are all singing virtually off the same sheet on both major business and personal/family tax reforms, let's consider how we can  reconcile the differences:Business Taxes:Family and Individual Taxes:The Death Tax:The most spectacular example of killing the Death Tax occurred in — of all socialist places — Sweden in 2004. The results have been stunning, as reported by Anders Ydstedt and Amanda Wollstad in their recent book, ""Mourned by No One — Missed by Few"":Conclusion: Now is the time for draining as much of the tax lobbyist swamp as possible because the momentum is with us.  But remember, ""Don't mess with Mister In-between"" — kill the Death Tax now — must be part of this amazing tax reform package.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

388,NOV,"In what is now the largest single day of shopping worldwide, China e-commerce leader Alibaba (BABA), in the first six hours of its ""11.11 Global Shopping Festival,"" managed $13 billion in sales, the company said, putting it on pace to easily surpass last year's sales of $17.8 billion.XThe 24-hour event started at midnight on Saturday in Shanghai, or 11 a.m. ET Friday morning, starting with festival events that launched on Oct. 31.The company is expected to generate sales of about $24 billion when the event is completed, according to SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.The Alibaba 11.11 Global Shopping Festival initially began as ""Singles Day,"" in which college students picked Nov. 11 to celebrate being single, with the idea of inviting Chinese consumers to buy themselves gifts in the spirit of an ""Anti-Valentine's"" Day.Alibaba adopted and promoted the theme starting in 2009. It has since evolved into a day when consumers in China — single or not — buy gifts and celebrate. Alibaba also transitioned the event from being a 24-hour online sale into a 24-day festival, along with celebrations, shopping specials, concerts and other events.This year, Alibaba says more than 140,000 brands will be available for purchase through its e-commerce platforms, including Tmall and Taobao, up from 98,000 last year.The theme of this year's festival is ""New Retail,"" which describes the numerous ways that Alibaba attempts to engage consumers, both online and offline. Alibaba has used 11.11 to experiment with new forms of retail and customer engagement that lean heavily on interactivity, technology and consumer analytics.IBD'S TAKE: Alibaba is one of four stocks currently on the exclusive IBD Leaderboard list of top-performing stocks. Alibaba shares are up 76% after a breakout from a 104.67 cup-with-handle buy point in February. Here's a simple routine about how to invest in stocks.The Alibaba festival towers over U.S. shopping events known as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Black Friday last year had gross merchandise volume of $4.5 billion, and Cyber Monday had $3 billion, which when combined add up to less than half the take from Alibaba's event.Amazon (AMZN) appeared to take notice of Alibaba's one-day shopping event and created one it its own. In 2015 it launched Amazon Prime Day, also a 24-hour shopping event loaded with specials and promotions. Amazon said Prime Day, when it first launched, was a celebration of its 20th anniversary. Prime Day has since become Amazon's single largest shopping day of the year. It has also been used as opportunity to sign up more Prime members, who pay $99 a year and get free two-day shipping on most goods in addition to access to streaming video, music and other perks.Alibaba shares were up 0.4%, near 185.90 during morning trading in the stock market today. Shares have more than doubled this year.Alibaba has received several price-target hikes in the past week, following a quarterly report that was roundly applauded by Wall Street.Alibaba reported revenue of $8.285 billion for its fiscal second quarter, up 61% from the year-ago period and maintaining a string of double-digit growth per quarter going back more than four years. Adjusted earnings rose 63% to $1.29 cents per share. Revenue from cloud computing rose 99% from the year-ago period to $447 million.RELATED:Amazon Pushes Holiday Shopping With 'Black Friday Deals'Earnings Calendar, Analyst Estimates And Stocks To Watch

390,NOV,"Chipmaker Marvell Technology Group (MRVL) on Monday officially announced plans to buy industry peer Cavium (CAVM) in a deal worth $6 billion, creating what it called an ""infrastructure solutions powerhouse.""XSanta Clara, Calif.-based Marvell agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of Cavium common stock in exchange for $40 per share in cash and 2.1757 Marvell common shares for each Cavium share. The exchange ratio was based on a purchase price of $80 per share, which is a 21% premium to Cavium's closing price on Nov. 2, before media reports about the transaction first surfaced.Marvell intends to fund the purchase with a combination of cash on hand from the combined companies and $1.75 billion in debt financing.Cavium shareholders are expected to own about 25% of the combined company on a pro forma basis. The deal has been approved by the boards of directors at both companies and is expected to close in mid-2018.Upon completion of the transaction, Marvell will have annual revenue of about $3.4 billion.""This is an exciting combination of two very complementary companies that together equal more than the sum of their parts,"" Marvell Chief Executive Matt Murphy said in a news release. ""This combination expands and diversifies our revenue base and end markets, and enables us to deliver a broader set of differentiated solutions to our customers.""IBD'S TAKE: Cavium is currently ranked No. 40 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.The transaction will combine Marvell's portfolio of storage drive controllers, networking systems and wireless connectivity products with Cavium's portfolio of multicore processing, networking communications, storage connectivity and security products.Marvell on Monday also updated its fiscal third-quarter sales and earnings estimates. The company expects adjusted earnings of 32 cents to 34 cents a share on revenue of $610 million to $620 million, above the midpoint of guidance it provided on Aug. 24. Analysts were modeling earnings of 32 cents a share on sales of $611 million, according to Zacks Investment Research. Marvell will release fiscal third-quarter results on Nov. 28 after the market close.Marvell shares added 6.4% to close at 21.59 on the stock market today. Cavium shares soared by 10.8% to close at 84.02.The Marvell-Cavium deal is the second big chip transaction to be announced this month. On Nov. 6, Broadcom (AVGO) made an unsolicited offer to buy Qualcomm (QCOM) for $130 billion. Qualcomm rejected the bid on Nov. 13, saying it undervalues the company, but Broadcom plans to continue to pursue the acquisition.RELATED:Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News

392,NOV,"Investors shrugged off the 2 p.m. ET release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's Dec. 12-13 meeting that ended with a new hike in short-term interest rates. Instead, they seemed focused on deploying more capital into stocks that appear to have further upside in 2018.X The Nasdaq composite, a 1.5% winner on Tuesday, rose another 0.9% in late-afternoon trading on Wednesday and was virtually at session highs.At 3:30 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 was up 0.6%; the Dow Jones industrial average continued to lag for a second straight session, but still rose more than 0.4%. At least nine of the 30 components of the Dow industrial average gained 1 point or more. IBM (IBM) paced the Dow with a 2.9% gain. Big Blue appears to be building a first-stage bottoming base; for now, the potential entry point is 162.61.The S&P SmallCap 600 rose just 0.2%.Volume is rising vs. the same time Tuesday on both exchanges, a clear sign that institutions seek to continue accumulating shares. On the Nasdaq, turnover is particularly higher.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) continued its steady rise, begun when the stock showed a major change in character in January 2017. Exactly one year ago, the iPhone marketer staged a sound breakout from a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12. Since then, Apple has made at least three tests of support at its rising 50-day moving average and survived all three tests by rising into new all-time highs.At its recent all-time high of 177.20, Apple has achieved a 50% gain since the breakout a year ago. With earnings expected to continue growing at a decent double-digit pace, there's no reason to doubt that the premier smartphone and digital device giant can continue to pad those gains.A 100% gain from the 118.12 primary entry would send Apple to the 236 level. If Apple were to achieve that milestone, its market cap would reach $1.2 trillion (236 share price multipled by 5.09 billion shares outstanding).Apple achieved a key turnaround in fiscal 2017 (ended in September that year) as earnings grew 11% to $9.21 a share, reversing from a 10% drop in FY 2016. Wall Street now sees earnings growth picking up in the current fiscal year, rising 24% to $11.46 a share on a 20% jump in revenue to $274.28 billion.The 20% rise would mark the second biggest year-over-year revenue jump in six years. In FY 2015, the top line increased 28% to $233.72 billion.Meanwhile, interest in Bitcoin appears to remain solid, even amid intensifying competition for dollars going into alternative digital currencies. The Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rallied 3% to 2,334, one day after testing support at the 2,000 level.At 33% below its all-time peak of 3,522, the ETF is now in base-building mode.Notice on a daily chart how Bitcoin Investment continues to keep a large air pocket above the 50-day moving average, a bullish sign. Average volume, meanwhile, continues to rise and is now at 133,000 shares a day.Elsewhere in the stock market today, IBD's Stocks On The Move table is showing a plethora of tech, energy and consumer-oriented stocks with strong IBD Ratings and rising in heavy volume. This table is a good source of ideas for your watch list. Learn how to spot key chart patterns, such as the cup with handle and the flat base, to identify the right time to buy a stock.Ideally, you want to buy a market leader on strength, rising in heavy volume and busting through prior resistance levels. Such action signals that demand from mutual funds, banks, hedge funds, insurers, pension funds, college endowments and the like is far outweighing the supply of shares being offered by willing sellers.Keep an eye on the downside portion of Stocks On The Move as well; stocks that make this screen are showing big declines in unusually heavy turnover, and thus may be signaling a future correction in the works.For instance, Dominion Energy (D) is making the Stocks On The Move screen to the downside after gapping down more than 4% to 77.21 in six times its normal turnover. The electric and gas utility had recently fallen below its 50-day moving average last month and now has plunged below the long-term 200-day moving average. Dominion, however, has shown in recent years a capacity to recover after taking out the 200-day line.The Dow utility average, which slid nearly 1.1% on Tuesday, lopped off another 1.2% on Wednesday.Meanwhile, the biggest decliner on a points basis among the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average is Goldman Sachs (GS), off 2.12 to 253.55. However, volume is below average, and so the Wall Street investment bank does not appear in IBD's Stocks On The Move.Goldman Sachs has thin gains of just 2% after clearing a 247.84 buy point in a long saucer with handle on Nov. 30.RELATED:Stocks Near A Buy ZoneCan You Spot Major Stock Market Tops?

393,NOV,"In July, MSNBC host and former Rep. Joe Scarborough showily announced on Stephen Colbert's CBS show that he was leaving the Republican Party. No one on the Republican National Committee flew a flag at half-mast. The announcement was at least a decade behind the reality. In 2006, he basically called then-President Bush an idiot. Last week, he did the same to President Trump. There is consistency here from the man who craves attention.XScarborough is the MSNBC equivalent of David Gergen, someone always twiddling his spit-covered finger in the wind and switching his allegiances depending on which option benefits him the most. He announces a new position with a big ""Look at me!"" flourish.Scarborough can boast egotistically just like the president he despises. In a Politico interview with Glenn Thrush in 2016, he actually said: ""when I walk into a Southern Baptist Church -- I can be anywhere in the world, I could be, like, smoking pot when I'm going down, like, the center aisle. It doesn't matter. People still know I'm one of them, instinctively.""In the early days of the Republican primary race, from mid-2015 into the early contests, Scarborough was a Trumper. In January 2016, he proclaimed that the sight of Trump's plane landing in Des Moines, Iowa, ""was like the Pope had landed with the Middle East peace pact to end 3,000 years of war."" In November 2015, he touted Trump's ""gut instinct and strength,"" and in January 2016, he even acted bashful with Hugh Hewitt on the radio and refused to reject Hewitt's suggestion that it would ""make sense"" if he were named Trump's running mate to help win the Florida vote.But soon, Trump would become the second coming of both Hitler and Stalin. By June 2016, Scarborough scalded Trump, saying: ""he had been talking about a Muslim registry. He's even talked in the past about making Muslims carry cards. Sounds a lot like Nazi Germany.""No Muslim registry has materialized, but Scarborough's loathing has continued -- and deepened. On Nov. 30, he claimed, ""people close to him during the campaign told me had early stages of dementia.""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveOn Dec. 22, the headline on the Washington Post Opinions email sounded like a serious left-wing attack: ""The Stench of Trump's Self-Dealing."" Was it Sen. Bernie Sanders or Sen. Elizabeth Warren? No, it was Scarborough, who proclaimed that there is a ""stench of self-dealing that engulfs all things Trump."" He added, ""Like autocrats across the world, the 45th American president has perfected the art of the self-deal.""This is hilarious coming from Scarborough. In his pro-Trump phase, he provided cover when Trump refused to release his tax returns, asking, ""Why are Donald Trump's taxes relevant?""On Dec. 29, Scarborough doubled down in the Post, suggesting Trump is guilty of foreign affairs based on ""malignant idiocy"" and transforming into a ""tyrannical president"" with a compliant Republican Congress. Trump even ""used Stalinist barbs to attack the free press,"" proving only that thin-skinned Scarborough cannot discern the difference between assault and mockery.In the same piece, Scarborough quoted the late British Prime Winston Churchill's ""Gathering Storm"" speech. Yes, indeed, but the wicked threat is now Trump: ""The malice of the wicked was reinforced by the weakness of the virtuous.""This man is seemingly blinded by rage. He claimed that ""America's dangerous retreat from the world continues"" while neglecting to mention the crushing of the Islamic State group, or the bombing of a Syrian airfield (which seemed to end what American intelligence reported was President Bashar al-Assad's chemical warfare on his own people), or the approval of arms assistance for Ukraine (so much for being Russian President Putin's plaything).Scarborough shouldn't be attacking Trump or anyone else for basing their political analysis on emotional bluster instead of facts. He specializes in it.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market? Start with IBD University.

The Energy Information Administration provides its weekly view into oil inventories at 10:30 a.m. ET.HP Inc. opened down 5%, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise sliced 6% lower at the starting bell, the worst early declines among S&P 500 stocks, after reporting fiscal fourth-quarter results late Thursday.

"
400,NOV,"Apple (AAPL) is working on using a light-based technology to make it easier for self-driving cars to identify pedestrians and cyclists, putting it in the camp of several big-name proponents of the tech but against Tesla (TSLA).A new Apple research paper discusses an object detection method for self-driving systems that is based purely on LiDAR, or simply Lidar. Lidar is a method to gauge distance by illuminating a target with a pulsed laser light, and measuring how long it takes to return.The technology is being implemented in self-driving cars and systems to create an accurate, 3D picture of a physical environment that is then harvested and capitalized on by machine learning software.Big Three automakers such as General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F), along with Alphabet's (GOOGL) Waymo unit, are backing Lidar. Meanwhile, Tesla is throwing its weight behind radar instead.In October, General Motors announced the acquisition of a California-based company, called Strobe, to beef up its Lidar efforts in self-driving technologies.GM at that time described Strobe as ""a company that has quietly been building the leading next-generation Lidar sensors"" that will significantly enhance the capabilities of its self-driving cars and drive down the costs of implementing the technology.Good thing about radar is that, unlike lidar (which is visible wavelength), it can see through rain, snow, fog and dust— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 15, 2016
"
401,NOV,"Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk once tweeted that radar, unlike Lidar, ""can see through rain, snow, fog and dust."" The Tesla Autopilot system is said to rely on radars and cameras for object detection.While GM complements its Lidar technology with cameras and radar sensors, a GM executive has said that getting to the highest levels of autonomous driving ""with just cameras and radars is not physically possible.""The research by Apple computer scientists Yin Zhou and Oncel Tuzel was submitted to the online journal arXiv Nov. 17.IBD'S TAKE: General Motors earns a solid Relative Strength Rating of 88, which is high among automakers. Learn which top stocks are showing superior relative price strength.While Apple is famously secretive about its autonomous driving efforts, it has a permit from Californian authorities to test self-driving cars. Recently, CEO Tim Cook called self-driving systems the ""mother of all AI projects.""Shares of GM lost 1.5% to close at 44.29 on the stock market today. Apple rose 1.1% to 174.96. Ford dipped 0.4% to 12.07, while Tesla ended the regular trading day down 1.6% to 312.60.RELATED:Tesla's Electric Truck Arrives Amid 'Production Hell,' Hot Competition

402,NOV,"Facebook (FB), under congressional scrutiny for the role its social network played in the 2016 U.S. election, took a step Wednesday to inform users if they were fooled by misinformation from Russian operatives.XFacebook said it will soon create a portal to enable people on Facebook to learn which Facebook pages or Instagram accounts they may have liked or followed created by Russian actors between January 2015 and August 2017. The new tool will be available for use by the end of this year in the Facebook Help Center.""It is important that people understand how foreign actors tried to sow division and mistrust using Facebook before and after the 2016 U.S. election,"" Facebook said in a post on its website. ""That's why, as we have discovered information, we have continually come forward to share it publicly and have provided it to congressional investigators.""In September, Facebook announced it found more than 3,000 ads addressing social and political issues that ran in the U.S. between 2015 and 2017 and that appear to have come from accounts associated with an entity known as the Internet Research Agency — a Russian company that engaged in an online operation on behalf of the Russian government. The ads were shared with congressional investigators.Russia's campaign to meddle in the U.S. election reached 126 million people through 80,000 posts on Facebook.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook is an IBD Leaderboard stock with an IBD Composite Rating of 99 out of a possible 99 and remains in buy range from a 175.59 buy point. Here's a simple routine to help you understand how to invest in the stock market.Facebook had said the ads and accounts ""appeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum — touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.""Facebook shares dipped 0.5% to close at 180.87 on the stock market today.

404,NOV,"Facebook (FB) was rated a top stock pick for 2018 by one analyst who based it on the social media leader's strategic position, strong revenue growth, dominance in mobile and revenue diversification, among other reasons.X Facebook, with 1.4 billion daily active users and 2.1 billion monthly users, is the dominant mobile platform for finding and connecting people globally, wrote Needham analyst Laura Martin.""As advertisers follow younger audiences to smartphones, demand for Facebook's mobile ad inventory is growing,"" she wrote in a research note to clients Tuesday.Martin has a buy rating on Facebook and price target of 215, which is a 21% premium from where the stock currently trades.Facebook shares fell 1.2% to 176.96 on the stock market today.Martin expects Facebook and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) together to amass more than 90% of all online advertising revenue growth in 2018, as they have over the last two years.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook is on the exclusive list of IBD Leaderboard stocks, with an IBD Composite Rating of 99 out of a possible 99. Facebook reclaimed the 50-day moving average last week and is in buy range from a prior 175.59 flat-base buy point.""We are buyers of Facebook based on our belief that digital markets are 'winner take most markets' and that Facebook is the biggest winner in the mobile advertising market,"" Martin wrote.She said Facebook has 4 core global platforms: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, of which the latter three have yet to be fully monetized, although Instagram is growing rapidly.Facebook reported third-quarter earnings on Nov. 1 that topped earnings and revenue estimates by a wide margin, sending shares higher. Mobile ad revenue of $8.9 billion made up 88% of total revenue, up from 84% a year ago.RELATED:FANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, GoogleFacebook Sets Sights On Kids With New Messenger App

405,NOV,"Stocks rallied Tuesday as the Fed kicked off its two-day meeting, but the Nasdaq lagged as Apple (AAPL)weighed. Bitcoin surged yet again.X SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) led with a 0.6% gain, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) added 0.3% and PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) was barely negative. Emerging markets underperformed as  iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) fell 1%.Financials, real estate and consumer staples led the upside among sector plays in the stock market today.But oil, utilities and chips lagged. SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) fell 1.4%; PowerShares DB Oil (DBO) slid 1.4% and United States Oil (USO) gave up 1.3%. West Texas intermediate crude prices slid 0.9% to $57.46 a barrel. Gold funds were also mostly lower as gold futures dipped 0.6% to $1,239 an ounce.Bitcoin continued its torrid run as its price jumped back above $17K and was recently trading around $17,375, according to CoinDesk. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) surged 16% to hit a new all-time high. Talk about a bubble has increased as the cryptocurrency keeps skyrocketing.Among blue chip stocks, Boeing (BA), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Verizon (VZ) gained more than 2% each. On the flip side, Apple and Intel (INTC) were among the decliners. Apple is extended from a 160.97 cup-with-handle entry, but may be forming a new base.No doubt about it, foreign stock markets have been hot this year, on both the developed and emerging-market fronts.And iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA) has been no exception. It's outperformed the U.S. equity market with a year-to-date gain of 23%, vs. 20.7% for the S&P 500. The ETF has set up a new potential buy opportunity — it's still in buy range from a rebound last week off its 50-day moving average.EFA climbed 2% from a mid-November bounce off the support line to its Nov. 29 intraday high. Before that, it advanced nearly 6% from the low of an early-September pullback to a Nov. 1 high. The fund was featured in the June 28 ETF column as shares sought support at the 50-day line.The $82.2 billion fund, which tracks the MSCI EAFE Index, marked its 16th anniversary in August. The index is considered a barometer for the equity-market performance of developed international markets. It's composed of more than 900 large and midcap stocks outside of the U.S. and Canada.Its biggest geographic weighting as of Dec. 8 was 24% in Japan, followed by 17% in the U.K., 11% in France, and about 10% in Germany. Switzerland and Australia made up 8% and 7%, respectively. Financials accounted for the largest sector weight at 21%, industrials nearly 15%, consumer discretionary 12%, consumer staples 11% and health care 10%.IBD'S TAKE: Making money catching ETF uptrends requires knowledge about how to read charts. You can learn how at IBD University.Top holdings included Swiss food giant Nestle, the U.K.'s HSBC Holdings, Switzerland-based drugmakers Novartis (NVS) and Roche, and Japan's Toyota Motor (TM).While the fund has outpaced the broader domestic market this year, it's lagged over the longer term. Its average annual returns of 7.8%, 1.3% and 7.7% over the past five, 10 and 15 years trail the S&P 500's 15.7%, 8.1% and 9.6% gains during those same periods.EFA carries a 0.32% expense ratio. Foreign stocks can lend diversity to portfolios that are heavily weighted in domestic equities.RELATED:Apple, Disney Lift Dow To Record Close; Will This Hurt Bitcoin?Microsoft Takes Lead On Dow; Why Is Bitcoin Back Down To $15K?Facebook, Tech Stocks Lead Market; Bitcoin Keeps Up Torrid PaceNew Innovator IBD ETF Leaders Fund Geared To Capture Market Trends
"
406,NOV,"Stocks finished mixed Tuesday, but Tesla (TSLA) had a very important session. Shares in the electric vehicle firm gained more than 3% in heavy trading and continued Monday's rebound back above the key 50- and 200-day moving averages.XA healthy growth stock tends to rise ahead of its 50-day moving average, which in turn is higher than the long-term 200-day moving average. The 200-day line covers roughly 10 months' worth of trading action. IBD daily charts show the 50-day moving average as a red line.Tesla, a June 2010 new issue, is getting an order of 100 electric semi trucks from soda and snack maker PepsiCo (PEP). Watch to see if the innovative transport and energy storage firm can form the right side of a potential first-stage base.Meanwhile, Bitcoin fever was unabated. The Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) shot 22% ahead to 2,273, breaking the 2,000 barrier for the first time. Volume zoomed 155% above the 50-day average to 232,500 shares.Bitcoin Investment Trust broke out of an extreme cup with handle that offered a 985.10 buy point, or 10 cents above the handle's intraday high of 985 seen on Nov. 3.The ETF has since gained more than 130% in the space of 14 sessions. At this point, Bitcoin Investment would have would have to fall more than 30% just to test the short-term 10-day moving average.Judging by the near-vertical slope of the recent move, it would not be a surprise if Bitcoin Investment Trust, which seeks to mirror the price movement of the actual digital currency, took a break soon and succumbed to profit-taking. However, the strong start of Bitcoin-related derivatives trading in the Chicago Board Options Exchange serves as a positive factor for potential rising demand.Gold futures, meanwhile, sank 0.4% to $1,241.70 a troy ounce on the Comex. Gold has now corrected 8% since hitting a high of $1,351 in early September.The Nasdaq fell nearly 0.2% amid weakness in Chinese internet and select retail firms as well as software and semiconductor shares. Biotech, homebuilding, mobile home and RV and biotech stocks also fell 1% or more.The S&P 500 advanced nearly 0.5%; the Dow Jones industrial average rose nearly 0.2% and the S&P SmallCap 600 eased nearly 0.2%. Volume ran higher on both exchanges, according to early data.The Dow utility average dropped more than 1.9% to 748, marking its worst decline since a 1.9% slide on Feb. 1.Tesla broke out of a sloppy cup with handle with a 370.10 buy point in October, but did not hit new highs and flopped.The stock then undercut the low of that base, thus resetting the base count, a good thing. But Tesla will still need to prove to institutional investors that it will return to a path of profitability.Long-term shareholders who bought when the company broke out in the spring of 2013 near 40 still hold a marvelous profit cushion and have no reason at all to sell. Even at the Nov. 2 low of 292.63, the Elon Musk-led company stood just 25% below a 389.61 all-time high.Many great stocks fall that much in price and eventually form a solid base that spurs a breakout to fresh highs and profit opportunities for those who bought at the correct buy point.A typical cup with handle, cup without handle, or double bottom will feature a drop from head to toe of 12% to as much as 33% or more. These base-building activities reflect profit-taking by a certain group of holders. But in the best stocks, such sell-offs become short term in nature.Tesla is expected to post a 44% rise in revenue to $3.29 billion, but Wall Street analysts on consensus see the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company losing $3.08 a share vs. the 69 cents lost in the year-ago period.For 2018, the Street sees a net loss of $3.79 a share despite a 69% jump in sales to $19.82 billion.RELATED:When Is The Right Time To Sell Bitcoin?Can You Make A Million Dollars Trading ETFs?

407,NOV,"Stock futures edged higher early Wednesday morning after Democrat Doug Jones won Alabama's special election Tuesday, reducing the GOP's already-narrow Senate majority. Meanwhile, investors are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's 2018 outlook and an expected interest-rate hike Wednesday afternoon.X Alabama is normally a deep-red state, but accusations of sexual misconduct involving teens hurt Republican Roy Moore.Tuesday's vote will complicate President Trump's agenda by cutting the GOP Senate majority to just 51-49. However, Jones likely won't take office for a few weeks, giving Republicans some time to pass tax cuts with the current 52-48 split.Details of the evolving GOP tax-cut plan appeared after Tuesday's close. Meanwhile, the Fed is virtually assured of raising rates at 2 p.m. ET, but the question is how many hikes that policymakers will forecast for 2018.S&P 500 index futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value after briefly falling following the Alabama election results. Dow and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced about 0.15%.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) is close to carving out a flat base. But Apple chip plays are not faring as well, with Broadcom (AVGO) undercutting its buy point Tuesday, joining Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Applied Materials (AMAT), Analog Devices (ADI) and Qorvo (QRVO) below the 50-day line as chipmakers continue to slump.The GOP tax plan being hashed out between the House and Senate now has a 21% corporate tax cut, down from the current 35%, but up from prior  plans for 20%. There would be a 37% personal income rate and the mortgage interest deduction would  be capped at $750,000, down from the current $1 million but above the House's $500,000.Apple shares fell 0.6% to 171.70 in Tuesday's stock market trading, but they're still holding support slightly above the 50-day moving average.Apple appears to be headed toward a flat base, which needs a minimum of five weeks. That would occur at the end of this week. This hypothetical bullish consolidation, with a potential buy point of 176.34, would be a base-on-base formation above a prior cup-with-handle pattern.Apple is investing $390 million in Finisar (FNSR) to help the optical components maker revamp a Texas plant to make key iPhone chips. Finisar shot up in premarket trading on Wednesday's news.Apple, a member of the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow industrials, has shaken off iPhone X supply concerns.But such worries may be affecting key iPhone-related chip plays, which are also struggling due to general weakness in semiconductors.Broadcom had been one of the stronger Apple chipmakers, holding above its 259.46 buy point for the most part since the late-October breakout, becoming somewhat extended in late November.Broadcom, which is mounting a now-hostile bid for fellow wireless-chip giant Qualcomm (QCOM), reported strong earnings and guidance as well as a big dividend hike last week.Shares popped intraday Dec. 7 on the report, but closed flat. In the last three sessions, shares tested their buy point and 50-day moving average, finally closing below both levels with Tuesday's 0.4% loss to 258.81.Because Broadcom wiped out a 10% gain from its buy point, that entry is now invalid. A strong, high-volume retaking of the 50-day line could present a new buying opportunity.The chip-equipment giant is not a direct Apple supplier, though it's been deemed an iPhone X play for its work with OLED screens.Applied Materials fell 2.2% to 50.47 on Tuesday, continuing to hold below its 50-day moving average.In fact, just one of the 22 largest chip-gear stocks by market cap is current above that key support line, Kulicke & Soffa (KLIC). That's despite the record chip-gear sales in 2017 and 2018 seen by industry group SEMI.Among top chipmakers, Intel (INTC) and Texas Instruments (TXN) are slightly above their 50-day lines, but not many others are, outside of M&A-related plays.Analog Devices successfully broke out in late September/early October, unlike many other Apple suppliers. Shares rose more than 9% above an 85.81 buy point by Nov. 20. But shares then reversed lower on the company's latest earnings report and soon undercut their 50-day line.In recent sessions, Analog Devices has been holding just above or below the 85.81 entry, which is technically still valid. Shares fell 0.4% to 85.48 on Tuesday.Skyworks broke out in late October and Qorvo in early November, with both rising for a few sessions but then quickly tumbling through their buy points and 50-day lines.Skyworks fell 0.5% to 96.47 on Tuesday, about 18% off its high. Qorvo lost 1.3% to 67.70, hitting a four-month low intraday.RELATED:The Big Picture: This Key Tech Sector Shows Unusual Weakness5 Truck Stocks Set Up Buy Points Despite Tesla Semi: Investing Action PlanBullish Chart Patterns: Do You Know The Basics Of A Cup With Handle?Bullish Chart Patterns II: How To Find The Exact Buy Point

410,NOV,"The major market averages kicked off the first trading session of 2018 on a high note, as they advanced solidly higher in early morning trade.X In early Tuesday trade, the tech-heavy Nasdaq led the way with a 1% surge, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average followed up with gains of 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively.Among the Dow Jones industrial components, Walt Disney (DIS) rose 1.5% after the stock was upgraded from neutral to outperform at Macquarie Research. Shares remain below a 110.92 double-bottom entry.Elsewhere in the Dow, Apple (AAPL) found much-needed support at its 50-day line early Tuesday. The stock rose 1%, but remains about 3% below a 176.34 flat-base entry.On the downside, Travelers Companies (TRV) dipped 0.8%, but its decline stopped right at its 50-day line. The stock remains within buy range from a 130.47 cup-shaped base buy point.FANG stocks were all higher in the stock market today with Netflix (NFLX) setting the pace. The video streamer advanced 3.5% after being upgraded from neutral to outperform at Macquarie Research with a 220 price target. Meanwhile, analyst firm Loop Capital called Netflix their best idea of 2018 with a 241 price target — a 25% premium to Friday's closing price. Netflix's newest cinematic release ""Bright"" received 11 million views in the first three days after its release, according to Nielsen data.The stock jumped back above its 50-day line — which it has been trading under since Nov. 29 — and is approaching a 204.48 flat-base buy point.Meanwhile, Facebook (FB) and Amazon.com (AMZN) moved up 1.1% and 1.2%, respectively. The social media giant has built a new flat base with a 184.35 buy point, while the e-commerce giant has etched its own flat base with a 1213.51 entry.Alphabet (GOOGL) moved up 1%. The stock is extended from a 1006.29 buy point after a recent test of the 50-day moving average line.Inside the IBD 50, Alibaba (BABA) rose 3%, as the Chinese e-commerce giant attempted to regain its 50-day line. The stock is building the right side of a potential base.Elsewhere in the IBD 50, Nvidia (NVDA) looked to get back on track following Friday's 2% decline. The graphics-chip firm moved up 1.6%, as it once again approached its 50-day line where it found resistance last week.On the downside, gym operator Planet Fitness (PLNT) was downgraded from buy to hold at Jefferies, sparking a retreat of about 4%. The stock is still well-extended from a 27.32 flat-base buy point.RELATED:Dow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisThe FANG+ Stocks Are All At Key Technical Levels2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New YearTesla's Big Test, Jobs Data, Pot's Contact High: Investing Action PlanFANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google

411,NOV,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose slightly early Tuesday morning, as markets prepare for the first trading day of 2018. For the new year, here are five leading stocks that just formed flat bases at the very end of 2017: Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Mastercard (MA), Splunk (SPLK), RingCentral (RNG).X Facebook and Mastercard are members of the IBD 50 list. Facebook boasts a best-possible 99 Composite Rating while Mastercard has a 98. Splunk (96) and RingCentral (95) also have 95+ Composite Ratings. That's important, because all-time stock winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of their runs.Amazon.com, for its part, has a 78 Composite Rating, reflecting its uneven profits.S&P 500 futures climbed 0.2% vs. fair value. Dow futures rose 0.2%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.1% above fair value. Bitcoin futures retreated.Amazon, like all the stocks on this list has a five-week consolidation, the minimum for a flat base. It's really a base-on-base formation above an October base. The e-commerce giant has a buy point of 1,213.51. Shares closed Friday at 1,169.47.Amazon appears to have been a big standout in the best holiday shopping season in years. The stock's Relative Strength line is near record highs. The RS line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. Ideally an RS line should lead or confirm a breakout by at least hitting a short-term highOn the downside, Amazon is in a late-stage base. Late-stage bases can work, but are more apt to fail than first- or second-stage bases.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon, Facebook and Splunk are all on Leaderboard, IBD's premium service offering annotated charts of a handful of stocks, usually growth names at or near buy range. Take a free Leaderboard trial today.Facebook rose 53% in 2017. But its standout performance peaked at the end of July and the RS line has trended slightly lower since Nov. 1. The stock hasn't made much headway since late July either, while the broader averages continue to add to gains.Facebook, which closed Friday at 176.46, technically is still within range of an older 175.59 buy point from an October breakout, but hasn't made much progress since then and is currently below its 50-day line.Facebook has now created a new flat base with a 184.35 entry. That may be what investors should focus on now.Facebook and Amazon are both members of the FANG group of stocks. Including AppleAAPL, the FANG+ stocks are all at key technical levels right now.Mastercard's stock gradually outperformed the S&P 500 index for most of 2017, consolidating since late November. The RS line is modestly below record highs. Payment stocks, from traditional peers like Visa (V) to PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ), were big winners in 2017.Mastercard tumbled through its 50-day line in early December, but was back above that key support within a few days. Since then it's been holding just above that moving average, closing Friday at 151.36. The buy point is 154.75.The data analytics firm began forming its latest consolidation shortly after gapping higher on strong earnings released Nov. 20. The stock's RS line is near record highs.Splunk ended 2017 at 82.81. The buy point is 84.98.The cloud-based business communications software maker has found support at its 50-day moving average several times in the past few months.RingCentral has a 50.05 buy point. Shares closed Friday at 48.40, with its RS line holding near highs as well.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Seven Investing Tips For 2018 2018 Stock Market Forecast: Why You Should Expect Smaller GainsWhy This Profitable New IPO Should Be In Your InboxNew Highs: This IBD 50 Leader Broke Out Into Buy RangeArtificial Intelligence Software To Grow Nearly 30 Times By 2025

412,NOV,"The Nasdaq ran ahead of the major market averages Friday, up 1.2% as rising optimism regarding a GOP tax reform effort helped drive blue chip tech names including Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT) and United Technologies (UTX) to the head of the Nasdaq 100.X Electronics makers and staffing companies, metals and drug distributors were among the many industries to post gains of better than 3% during the session.The advance was sufficient to lift the Nasdaq past its Nov. 28 peak to its first new high in three weeks. The S&P 500 gained  0.9%, also scratching off a new high as Under Armour (UA) took the index's largest gain, surging 9% after Stifel Nicolaus upgraded the stock to buy, from hold.That put Under Armour shares back above their 10-week moving average and up 32% from a November low, although still deep in a 20-month correction.Railroad CSX (CSX), Barbie-maker Mattel (MAT) and chipmaker Oracle (ORCL) turned in the S&P 500's worst losses, down 8%, 5% and 4%, respectively.The Dow ran not quite as hot as its peer indexes, up 0.6%, but plenty strong enough to once again make news highs. Intel was the leader, up 3% on what appeared to be primarily a tax plan-related move.Small caps also did well with the Russell 2000 up 1.5%.Intel's gain put shares in a buy range on a rebound from support at the stock's 10-week moving average. The rebound occurred in only modest volume, and the chart pattern is also a flat base, so investors have the option of waiting to see whether shares climb past the 47.40 buy point.Microsoft took out its 86.30 buy point, rising nearly 3%  in powerful trade, moving to a new high but remaining well within buy range.Bitcoin drew heavy attention, with the cryptocurrency jumping 10% — back above $17,800. Related stocks were also busy, with Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) up 14%, bringing its gain since the start of the month to 79%. Riot Blockchain (RIOT) also vaulted 14%. Marathon Patent Group (MARA) thumped out a 6% gain and bitcoin friendly online retailer Overstock.com (OSTK) soared 11%.Nearly one-third IBD 50 names scored gains of 2% or better. At the top of the list, Planet Fitness (PLNT), SVB Financial Group (SVB) and Atlassian (TEAM) all sparked up more than 3%. Planet Fitness and SVB are extended. Atlassian is fighting to beat resistance at its 10-week line and start up the right side of a 19% deep consolidation.RELATED: Will The 'Big Six' Retailers Nab All The Holiday Shopping Cheer?These 3 Tech Giants Are In Bullish Patterns, Nearing Buy PointsThe 5 Biggest Ways The Disney Merger Could Affect YouWill The 'Big Six' Retailers Nab All The Holiday Shopping Cheer?

413,NOV,"One big challenge of swing trading is that when market turmoil hits, you generally have less cushion to ride out the storm. Shorter-term trading requires quicker action on the defensive side but also justifies being on offense by taking profits methodically on the way up.Take Illumina (ILMN), a stock originally under consideration on Nov. 22 (1). It broke out of a short consolidation that was part of a larger consolidation, with resistance just above 214. Volume came in at the highest level in 10 days (1), but since the resistance went back further we were looking for volume above its 50-day average. Being the day before the Thanksgiving holiday, light volume wasn't unusual, but still warranted waiting for heavier trade.On Nov. 27, after the holiday, the stock came out strongly on volume more than twice its average (2). That earned Illumina a spot on IBD's SwingTrader. By the day's close, the stock was already up nearly 2% from our entry. That type of early lead usually indicates a winning trade, if you can handle it right.Three days later, Illumina hit the 5% profit goal and we took half profits at 230.63. That's our offense. Booking the profits early protects your trade from potential sharp drops that could threaten your overall gain. As it turned out in this case, that profit-taking transpired less than 10 cents from the top (3).As is customary, we also raised our stop to a 1% profit level from our entry. Once we've seen solid gains, we don't want to let them wither away. That's our defense.A couple days later, markets got a scare. An erroneous report came out that Trump top national security advisor Michael Flynn's guilty plea to the FBI would also implicate the president concerning contacts with Russia during the campaign.  The market reaction threatened to take away profits in our trades, and we focused on defense by locking in those gains. We didn't wait for a breach of the raised stop but took profits on the remaining position while we still had a 1.7% gain (4).Markets and Illumina recovered ground by the end of the day, but turmoil continued the following day (5). For those that were still in the stock, rather than taking the early profit, a breach of the raised stop at 221.85 demanded attention. While profits were lost, it was certainly better than the day's close at 213.45. The lows of the day breached the original stop loss and there was no reason to let a good trade go bad. As it stood, our profit for the entire trade averaged out to a respectable 3.3% in five days.There was also no reason to waste time holding the stock and hoping for a comeback. A month later, Illumina is still below our final exit price and our original entry (6).More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:A Rule To Prevent Good Trades From Going BadTaking Profits Early Is A Key Tenet Of Swing TradesHow Much Trading Volume Is Enough In Swing Trades?Swing Trading Strategies And Lessons

414,NOV,"Wisconsin's Supreme Court can soon right a flagrant wrong stemming from events set in motion in 2014 at Milwaukee's Marquette University by Cheryl Abbate. Although just a graduate student, she already had a precocious aptitude for academic nastiness.XOn Oct. 28, in an undergraduate course she was teaching on ethics, when the subject of same-sex marriage arose there was no debate because, a student said, Abbate insisted that there could be no defensible opposition to this. (Marquette is a Jesuit school.) After class, the student told her that he opposed same-sex marriage and her discouraging of debate about it. She replied (he recorded their interaction) that ""there are some opinions that are not appropriate that are harmful ... do you know whether anyone in the class is homosexual? ... in this class homophobic comments ... will not be tolerated."" The student's appeals to Abbate's superiors were unavailing (the chairman of her philosophy department referred to the student as an ""insulin (sic) little twerp"") so he gave John C. McAdams his recording of Abbate rebuffing him.McAdams, a tenured professor then in his 41st year at Marquette and a conservative who blogs about the school's news, emailed Abbate seeking her version of the episode. Without responding to him, she immediately forwarded his email to some professors. She has called McAdams ""the ringleader"" of ""extreme white (sic) wing, hateful people,"" a ""moron,"" ""a flaming bigot, sexist and homophobic idiot"" and a ""creepy homophobic person with bad argumentation skills."" This aspiring philosopher's argumentation skills can be inferred from her reliance on epithets.Before McAdams had written a syllable, she claimed for herself the coveted status of victim, branding as ""harassment"" his request for her side of the story. Striking a pose of bravery, she accused him of trying ""to scare me into silence."" When, on Nov. 9, McAdams blogged, his post took no position on same-sex marriage but said this should be a debatable issue. The next day, Abbate drafted a letter asking that McAdams be disciplined. He was.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveAfter this matter earned national media attention, she received some critical emails, some of them vile, and Marquette rightly branded them ""hate mail."" However, for these, and for the unspecified ""harm"" that they supposedly caused Abbate, McAdams was held to be somehow blameworthy. Marquette, however, offered no evidence that he had anything to do with the emails. After a committee drawn from the university's monochrome culture recommended suspending McAdams without pay for two semesters, Marquette's president insisted that McAdams also express in writing ""deep regret"" and confess that his blog post was ""reckless and incompatible"" with Marquette's mission and values. McAdams refused and has been unemployed ever since.Being a private institution, Marquette had a right to be as hostile as it obviously is to the First Amendment — except for this: Its contract with tenured faculty says no one shall be disciplined for exercising ""legitimate personal or academic freedoms of thought, doctrine, discourse, association, advocacy, or action"" and that the threat of dismissal shall not be used to ""restrain"" constitutional rights. A circuit court, ignoring Marquette's ignoring of a Wisconsin contract, refused to adjudicate this dispute. Deferring to Marquette, the court essentially held that a professor's academic freedom exists only until some other professors, and university administrators, say it does not. So, the deferential court allowed Marquette an unconstrained right to settle a contract dispute in which it was an interested party.Because there is almost no Wisconsin case law concerning academic freedom that could have guided the circuit court, McAdams is asking the state supreme court to bypass the appeals court and perform its function as the state's ""law-developing court."" He is also asking the court to be cognizant of the cultural context: Nationwide, colleges and universities ""are under pressure"" — all of it from within the institutions — ""to enact or implement speech codes or otherwise restrict speech in various ways.""This episode, now in its fourth year, began because McAdams tried to assist a student who suffered unprofessional behavior by a bullying instructor. Abbate has moved on. Now at the University of Colorado, she is still a (perhaps career) graduate student, writing a doctoral dissertation on the importance of the rights of ... animals.The wreckage she left in her wake illustrates how rights are imperiled when judicial deference becomes dereliction of judicial duty. Prospective Marquette students, and Marquette alumni, must decide whether this school, awash with the current academic hysteria and corruption, merits their confidence and support. Wisconsin's Supreme Court must lay down the law that can stop some of the rot that this case illustrates.RELATED:College Costs Got You Down?

415,NOV,"Tesla (TSLA) will be closely watched as the electric-car company sometime this coming week is expected to report fourth-quarter vehicle deliveries, which could have a big impact on the stock if it misses or exceeds expectations.X The focus will mainly be on the mass-market Model 3. Tesla has had a hard time getting the premium sedan off the factory floor with just 222 delivered in the third quarter. Production started in July and Tesla initially planned to be delivering 5,000 vehicles per week sometime during the fourth quarter, but that was delayed to the first quarter after encountering production bottlenecks.KeyBanc Capital Markets recently slashed its estimate on Model 3 deliveries in the fourth quarter to 5,000 from 15,000. It also lowered its forecast for 2018 to 108,000 from 120,000.Tesla has struggled to get its Model 3 out the door, during what Chief Executive Elon Musk has called ""production hell.""Tesla has projected it would deliver 100,000 Model S and X cars in 2017, implying about 27,000 deliveries in the fourth quarter, a slight uptick from the 25,915 Model S and Model X deliveries in the third quarter.Tesla shares fell 1.3% to 311.35 on the stock market today. Tesla shares are down 20% from a record high of 389.61 set on Sept. 18, as reports of Model 3 production woes surfaced.IBD'S TAKE: Tesla undercut its 200-day line on Friday and its 50-day line on Tuesday. The stock has been showing a great deal of whipsaw action, as it tries to rebound from its recent lows and build the right side of a potential base. Looking to invest in the stock market? Start with this simple routine.As Tesla struggles with Model 3 production, Musk said in a tweet on Tuesday that a pickup truck is in the planning stages. Tesla last month announced plans for a futuristic big-rig truck, called Semi, and a new Roadster sports car. Adding the Tesla pickup to the Model Y, the Semi big-rig and new Roadster means that Tesla has more models planned than are being made.Tesla acknowledged production woes with its Model 3 when it reported third-quarter results on Nov. 1 that missed earnings expectations by a wide margin. Production delays at Tesla are among the reasons a large amount of Tesla shares are sold short.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Self-Driving Cars: Why 2018 Will Be The Year The Rubber Hits The RoadTesla Receives Largest Order For Big-Rig Semi Truck From UPS5 Things To Watch For Tesla, GM, Ford Other Carmakers In 2018

416,NOV,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose modestly early Tuesday. Facebook (FB) remains in buy range, but smaller rivals Twitter (TWTR) and Snapchat operator Snap (SNAP) closed in on buy points on Monday. Meanwhile, Weibo (WB), sometimes touted as China's Twitter, retook a key support line.X During Monday's session, the Nasdaq composite rose for a fourth straight session, leading the modest rally. The S&P 500 index and Dow industrials set record closes.S&P 500 index futures climbed 0.2% vs. fair value. So did Nasdaq 100 and Dow futures.Facebook rose 4 cents to 179.04 in Monday's stock market trading, comfortably in the buy zone from a 175.59 flat-base entry. Facebook decisively cleared that buy point in late October and rose to the top of the 5% chase zone by late November, when shares sold off over several days. The stock undercut the entry and its 50-day line, but didn't fall too far to make the buy point invalid. Shares quickly rebounded last week.Facebook's earnings and sales growth remains huge despite the social network's size, even accelerating in the third quarter. Morgan Stanley touted Facebook, other FANG stocks and Apple (AAPL) on Monday, citing their ""substantial competitive moats.""Meanwhile, Twitter's revenue is falling while Snap is reporting big losses, and both Facebook rivals are struggling to increase users.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook is part of Leaderboard, IBD's premium service offering annotated charts of a select number of stocks, usually growth names in or near buy zones. Take a Leaderboard free trial.Snap came public at 17 in March and shot up to 29.44 intraday on its second day of trading. But shares fell sharply on concerns about user growth and Facebook's successful cloning of key Snapchat features, notably via Instagram Stories.Snap hit a record low of 11.28 on Aug. 14 and hit a short-term low of 12.10 on Nov. 8. Since then shares have been moving higher, working on a first-ever proper base with a 16.98 buy point.Snap shares shot up 7.6% to 18.22 on Monday, helped by a bullish note from Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. analyst James Cakmak, who sees the Snapchat app operator's stock near a turning point. Snap executives seem to recognize the company's challenges, Cakmak noted. He also cited Snap's relationship with Chinese messaging and gaming giant Tencent (TCEHY). Tencent bought a sizable stake in Snap in November.As for Tencent, its shares rose 3.25% to 52.13, continuing a strong rebound from their 50-day line late last week.Twitter popped 4.5% to 22.05 on Monday. That's approaching a 22.58 buy point in a cup-with-handle base that goes back to October 2016.Twitter previously broke out past a 20.98 entry on Oct. 27, but within a few days had reversed and soon was down enough to invalidate the buy point.Keep in mind that both Snap and Twitter are well off 2017 highs, so there could be notable overhead resistance if the stocks break out.The Chinese short-messaging giant rose 3.75% to 104 on Monday, moving back above its 50-day moving average. Volume was below average, so investors should treat Weibo's move as a buying opportunity.Weibo does not have a buy point currently. Shares broke out from a 105.60 entry on Nov. 8, rising to 123 on Nov. 21. Shares then fell sharply, wiping out a 16.5% post-entry gain and then some. You should never let a 10% gain turn into a loss.Weibo is majority-owned by Sina (SINA). Sina rose 2.6% to 99.55 on Monday, below its 50-day line and above its 200-day.RELATED:The Big Picture: Why Tesla's Action Today Was So Bullish36 Top Funds Just Bought Shares In This Potential Breakout StockThese 2 Stocks Reclaimed Buy Points; 3 Others Are CloseFANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, GoogleBest Chinese Stocks To Buy And WatchHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

417,NOV,"The main indexes erased small gains and were trading near session lows as selling extended into afternoon trading Thursday.X The Nasdaq composite was off 0.3% and continues a weeklong pattern of minor moves. The S&P 500 eased 0.4%.The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2%, but Disney (DIS) shares leaped nearly 3% after it finalized a deal to acquire 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) entertainment assets with a value of about $66 billion.But small caps got hit harder, as the Russell 2000 tumbled 1.2%. Two weeks ago, the Russell was looking promising as it ran to new highs. But it has given up all gains since then and has been volatile, indicating uncertainty about this class of equities.Volume was tracking higher on the NYSE compared with the same time Wednesday and almost unchanged on the Nasdaq. Declining stocks led advancers by about a 2-to-1 ratio across the board.Internet, semiconductor, mortgage, jewelry and video game software industry groups were some of the leaders in today's market. That showed there was no clear sector in command of the session. Some retail, health care, steel and food industry groups were in the bottom of the day's performance table.Delta Air Lines (DAL), hosting its investor day, forecast solid 2018 and a fourth-quarter results, including more bullish expectations for unit revenue. Delta broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a buy point at 54.16. Volume was tracking about double its average, a positive sign.Delta also confirmed it would buy 100 A321neo jetliners from Airbus (EADSY). The decision is a blow to rival Boeing (BA), but the Dow component still rose 0.2% to a new high while also registering as one of the stocks moving in highest volume above average.IBD's airlines industry group is lagging, but a few stocks in it have been performing as leaders. Southwest Airlines (LUV), which is in IBD Leaderboard, is extended from a breakout Nov. 30.Sanderson Farms (SAFM), a member in IBD Stock Spotlight, plunged 12% after the poultry producer missed earnings estimates. The stock broke below the 50-day moving average in heavy trading and fell 11% below a 167.42 buy point. That was enough to trigger sell signals.The company's adjusted profit of $3.20 a share was below the consensus estimate of around $3.50. Sales rose 16% to $919 million, above expectations. The company cited lower seasonal prices after Labor Day, hurricane disruptions and a glut of chicken production.TopBuild (BLD) climbed back above the 67.37 buy point, from where the stock initially broke out Nov. 28. Shares did not fall enough from the entry to cause a sell signal, and there's been support at the 50-day moving average.RELATED:Delta Jumps Into Buy Zone On Bullish Revenue Outlook At Investor DayThis Is Disney's 'Highest Priority' As Fox Deal Transforms Media Sector

419,NOV,"Oracle (ORCL) reported quarterly earnings after the market close Thursday that beat on the top and bottom line but turned in a cloud computing report that fell short, as did its revenue outlook.XThe company said total cloud revenue during the quarter rose 44% to $1.52 billion, below the consensus estimate of $1.56 billion.The software-as-a-service portion of its cloud platform rose 55% to $1.12 billion but that was short of the $1.14 billion consensus. Oracle said cloud revenue plus on-premise software revenue in the quarter rose 9% to $7.8 billion from the year ago period.

420,NOV,"Oracle is undergoing a multiyear transition from traditional on-premise software licensing and maintenance support to a model driven by cloud subscriptions. Oracle began pushing aggressively into cloud computing about three years ago, negatively impacting sales and earnings.""Overall cloud revenue growth of 44% drove our quarterly revenue and earnings higher,"" Oracle's Chief Executive Safra Catz said in prepared remarks. ""I expect the business to continue to grow and strengthen over the coming quarters.""But Catz, in the earnings conference call, said cloud revenue in the current quarter should rise 21% to 25% from the year-ago period. Analysts were forecasting a 42% increase to $1.69 billion.IBD'S TAKE: During after-hours trading Oracle fell to a level close to its 50-day moving average. Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The database software company reported revenue of $9.6 billion, up 6% from the year-ago period and beating the consensus estimate of $9.57 billion. It reported adjusted earnings of 70 cents, up 14% and beating the consensus estimate of 68 cents, for its fiscal second quarter ended Nov. 30.For the current quarter Oracle said it expects revenue growth of 2% to 4% from the year-ago period, which is below the consensus for 4.3% growth.Oracle shares were down 6.5%, near 47 during after-hours trading on the stock market today.The Oracle board of directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by $12 billion.

421,NOV,"Recently, the closest thing to a riot in the stock market has been Bitcoin. Riot Blockchain (RIOT) is one way to play the wild  trend, but should you?X The Colorado-based company calls itself a ""first mover"" in blockchain technology, the networks used to make cryptocurrency transactions. The small-cap company's primary focus is on the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin is a new decentralized currency that is digital money.Riot Blockchain broke out of a 10-month base in early October, crossing a 5.38 buy point. The low-priced stock was thinly traded. Average volume was 16,700 when the stock broke out.By November, average daily volume was more than 400,000. Riot Blockchain broke out in November in heavy volume. The consolidation, though, was too short to be a valid base. On Tuesday, Riot Blockchain stabbed 22% higher in torrid volume as it scored a new high.Riot Blockchain has never posted an annual profit, making this an all-momentum play. The IBD-style investor isn't a momentum investor. Earnings matter. For that reason alone, prudent investors should stay clear of unprofitable Riot Blockchain. Stay with companies that have profits.Sensor maker Sensata Technologies (ST) swung 8% higher in heavy volume, adding 3.76 to 51.66. The midcap company makes sensors for aircraft and autos.Tuesday's action constituted a new high and a breakout. Sensata cleared a 50.93 buy point in a base-on-base pattern. Sensata grew earnings 11%, 16% and 5% in recent years. The Street expects growth of 10% in 2017.Railcar maker Trinity Industries (TRN) popped decisively above a 36.07 buy point Tuesday, as the stock made a new high, rising 1.08 to 36.88. The midcap stock had been dancing above and below the buy point recently.The Street expects Trinity's earnings to decline this year and in 2018.Specialty chemicals and wood preservatives provider KMG Chemicals (KMG) posted a new high in strong volume after the company beat profit estimates late Monday. Adjusted earnings were 83 cents per share, an increase of 73%, and sales rose 45% to $110.7 million.The stock cleared a wedging handle in October, clearing a 57 buy point.

424,NOV,"Oil prices stuck near a two-year high as a drop in U.S. crude stockpiles added optimism to a rally underpinned by hopes for an OPEC deal extension.Futures in New York surged as much as 2.2% to trade above $58 a barrel for the first time since mid-2015. Crude inventories fell by 1.86 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. Prices briefly dipped after the report as the draw came in smaller than the 6.36 million decline posted by the American Petroleum Institute. Meanwhile, an outage on TransCanada Corp.'s Keystone pipeline has led inventories to contract in the Cushing, Okla., distribution hub.""For better or for worse, Keystone being down is bullish for U.S. prices,"" Matt Sallee, who helps manage $16 billion in oil-related assets at Tortoise Capital Advisors, said by phone. Prices had softened a bit due to ""a little disappointment in that we got a draw, but not nearly what API was signaling,"" he said.The U.S. benchmark has jumped about 6% this month amid signals that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies may agree to prolong supply curbs beyond March when producers meet in Vienna next week.OPEC will extend its deal through the end of 2018 when the group meets Nov. 30, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts and traders.

425,NOV,"Federal Reserve officials meeting earlier this month saw an interest-rate increase in the near term even as divisions persisted over the policy path forward amid tepid inflation.""Many participants thought that another increase in the target range for the federal funds rate was likely to be warranted in the near term if incoming information left the medium-term outlook broadly unchanged,"" according to minutes from their Oct. 31-Nov. 1 gathering, released in Washington on Wednesday.Policy makers held rates steady at the meeting but are expected to hike next month as they continue with gradual tightening. Unemployment is at a 16-year low, although inflation remains well beneath their 2% target.The minutes showed that while Fed officials remain confident in the labor market and above-trend economic growth, several are looking for stronger signs that price gains will pick up. A few even want to see inflation on an upward path before lifting rates again, underlining a persistent divide on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.Officials have been projecting three rate increases in 2018, but that outlook could be called into question if economic data fail to meet Fed expectations. Analysts are watching closely for any signal that central-bank officials will mark down their outlooks when they submit economic projections at their Dec. 12-13 meeting.""How far are we from the end? That's really the unanswered question in this market,"" Gennadiy Goldberg, a rates strategist at TD Securities in New York, said before the minutes were published.

436,NOV,"Dow Jones industrial average component Apple (AAPL) posted its biggest gain in more than a month, gaining 1.9% to 172.61 in brisk volume and reaffirming the strength of its latest breakout as the Nasdaq composite gained nearly 0.5% at midday Monday.X Other major indexes are trying to rally despite a bombing incident that occurred early Monday at a major commuter hub just a block away from Times Square in New York City.At 1 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both edged 0.1% to 0.2% higher. Volume is running mildly lower vs. the same time Friday on both main exchanges.The S&P SmallCap 600 was off slightly.In addition to Apple, at least three more of the 30 components of the Dow industrial average gained 1 point or more, including Walt Disney (DIS), Microsoft (MSFT) and Big Pharma play Merck (MRK).Microsoft has the best IBD RS Rating among the quartet of mega-cap stocks with an 86, meaning it's outperformed 86% of all publicly traded companies over the past 12 months. Apple is second best with an 83, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. Disney (RS Rating 38) is working on a new base and Merck has the weakest RS Rating at 13.The Nasdaq composite is close to wiping away the nearly 0.7% losses incurred over the prior two weeks.Solar energy and certain biotechs, particularly gene therapy plays, led the upside thanks to strong gains from names such as gene therapy play Bluebird Bio (BLUE) and China's Daqo New Energy (DQ), which has been highlighted in IBD's Stock Spotlight screen, while retail and defensive food stocks (think dairy, meat, food preparation) sank.Bluebird, which now has a $9.7 billion market cap, qualifies as a mid-cap company despite having only $33 million in revenue over the past four quarters. However, 2017 marks a watershed moment for companies that are addressing difficult diseases and conditions with therapies that strive change the genetic makeup of cells.Bluebird broke out of a 10-week cuplike base at 123.85 in double usual volume on Aug. 21. Shares gapped up 23% to 211.20 and reached as high as 222.00 intraday. On Monday, the Cambridge, Mass., firm presented updated data that showed meaningful clinical improvement for patients with severe sickle cell disease that received its LentiGlobin gene therapy product.Meanwhile, the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rallied nearly 8% to 1,790.50 in slightly below average trade. The exchange traded fund continues to ride the strength of interest in the alternative currency, which on Sunday saw the start of related derivatives trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Expect the CME Group to also launch Bitcoin-related futures this month.Liquidity is decent for the individual investor, as Bitcoin Investment Trust trades on average nearly 90,000 shares each day, equivalent to $161 million in dollar turnover. The ETF initially broke out of a very deep cup with handle at 985.10 on Nov. 22 in quiet trade initially.Volume really kicked in on Nov. 27, when shares rocketed more than 23%.At this point, the 10-day moving average acts as a useful chart tool in which one may sell the ETF if Bitcoin Investment drops sharply through it. As noted in a prior Stock Market Today column, the ETF's 50-day moving average is lagging too far behind and is thus not useful for determining a short-term exit point.Apple, meanwhile, is likely rising on anticipation for a strong holiday shopping quarter. New products from the tech giant are apparently seeing robust demand worldwide, ranging from the ultra luxury iPhone X to a new Apple Watch that can receive and send phone calls.Apple is now up nearly 7% past a 160.97 buy point in a second-stage cup with handle, and is thus extended.But notice how the stock is holding above its rising 50-day moving average, a good sign.The Accumulation/Distribution Rating is also positive at B-, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. Meanwhile, a 90 Composite Rating is also solid, indicating that all of Apple's ratings and recent stock action has been superior to 90% of all stocks in IBD's database. At the start of the year, the Composite was a poor 51 on a scale of 1 to 99.Going back to Microsoft, the cloud computing, business software and Xbox giant has excelled since climbing out of a 56.87 entry in a flat base in late July 2016.

437,NOV,"Expect Tesla (TSLA) shares to be extremely volatile in 2018, as shares could hit a record high of 400 before facing headwinds and collapsing, a Morgan Stanley analyst said Tuesday.XIn a note to clients, analyst Adam Jonas maintained an equal weight rating on Tesla with a price target of 379. But it came with a warning.""From a shorter-term trading perspective, we anticipate Tesla's stock price may reach highs in the range of $400 or more over the next few months before facing some more serious headwinds later in the year that could take the stock significantly below current levels,"" Jonas wrote.Tesla shares gained 2.9% to close at 317.81 on the stock market today. Tesla's record high of 386.99 was set on June 23.Jonas estimates Tesla shares could rise to 400 as it resolves battery production issues and alleviates other bottlenecks that have slowed production of the Model 3. But shares could fall to 200 due to mounting concerns that Tesla might lose its competitive position, he wrote.Tesla shares rose Friday following the splashy debut Thursday evening of a futuristic big-rig truck and a new sports car, at a time when the company is burning cash and hasn't met delivery schedules for its new Model 3.Equity analysts who follow Tesla seemed impressed by the splashy product announcements overall but also expressed concerns about production on the Model 3 and the way Tesla used the event as a cash-raising opportunity.IBD'S TAKE: Despite skeptics and safety questions, the era of electric cars and trucks and self-driving vehicles is clearly underway. Automakers and tech companies are plowing billions of dollars into research and forging alliances in a rush for the inside lane on the automobile's most revolutionary track since the Model T.Taking a more optimistic view on Tesla was Nomura analyst Romit Shah who, on Monday, reiterated a buy rating on Tesla and price target of 500.""Ultimately, we believe Thursday's event will only further strengthen Tesla's brand and luxury appeal,"" Shah wrote in a research note to clients. ""And while the business model and operations still need figuring out, we believe that Tesla has expanded its addressable opportunity by tens of billions of dollars, thus, paving the way for exponential revenue growth potential for at least the next five years,"" Shah wrote.Tesla reported third-quarter results on Nov. 1 that missed earnings expectations by a wide margin and revealed that production woes with its new Model 3 continue.RELATED:Tesla's Electric Truck Arrives Amid 'Production Hell,' Hot CompetitionTesla Stock Quotes, Company News And Chart Analysis

438,NOV,"Major stock indexes were slightly lower near midday Wednesday on the eve of the Thanksgiving holiday, but Apple (AAPL) continued to warm investors' hearts as it recouped more of its moderate losses seen over the prior week and a half. Shares rose nearly 1% to 174.36 in active trading.That extends Apple's gain from its latest breakout from a new cup with handle at 160.97 to 8%, so it's out of the proper buy zone for now. The 5% chase zone goes up to 169.02.XMeanwhile, banking shares continued to show good action this quarter, with a new breakout coming from New England-based Meridian Bancorp (EBSB). Shares bolted more than 2% higher to 20.42, rising past a 20.25 buy point in a long cup with handle.Meridian is a thinly traded small cap with an average daily volume of 181,000 shares over the past 50 sessions.At 1 pm ET in New York, the Nasdaq edged less than 1 point lower, keeping virtually all of Tuesday's solid 1.1% advance. At 6864, the tech-rich composite index holds a 5.7% gain since Oct. 1.The S&P 500 eased nearly 0.1%, and the Dow Jones industrial average is off 0.2%. Small caps fell by a similar amount, with the S&P SmallCap 600 down 0.1%.Volume was running sharply lower vs. the same time Tuesday on both main exchanges. The stock market will be closed Thursday and open until 1 p.m. ET on Friday.Apple has done very well for long-view-minded investors over the past year. As repeatedly noted in IBD's Stock Market Today column late last year and early in 2017, the iPhone, iPad and digital services titan broke out of a first-stage cup-with-handle base on Jan. 6-9, rising past a 118.12 buy point.Volume came in a little higher than normal in a few up days over the next three weeks, then gushed higher on Feb. 1 after Apple reported a solid turnaround in quarterly results (fiscal Q4 profit up 2% to $3.36 a share, halting a three-quarter streak of year-over-year losses, and revenue up 3%).The gain from that first-stage bottoming base has now reached 49% to a new all-time high of 176.24.Apple has certainly delivered on the fundamentals over that period. Growth has accelerated. After that 2% rise in earnings, Apple has posted EPS increases of 11%, 18% and 24% on revenue gains of 5%, 7% and 12%. Growth is expected to continue accelerating.While no sell signals have triggered for investors who bought on the January breakout or have even larger capital gains, Apple at one point will be vulnerable to a correction, just like the greater market itself. When this occurs, expect the megacap tech to test support at its long-term 200-day moving average, currently near 152.A big collapse through that 200-day line would likely mean that a significant new base-building period is in the works. See the 200-day moving average painted in black on a MarketSmith daily chart. The 200-day line tracks the average closing price for a stock over the past 200 trading sessions, or roughly equivalent to 10 months. A rising 200-day line means the overall long-term price trend is up.While institutions are clearly bullish about the current fundamentals in Apple, some are expressing concern over the company's ability to keep raising the cash payout.Alex Crooke, head of global equity and income strategies at Janus Henderson, notes that Apple likely has had to raise debt in order to pay the dividend since the company is not making any move to repatriate profits from overseas businesses. Indeed, long-term debt vs. shareholder equity has gone up to a still manageable 73% in FY 2017 (ended in September) vs. 45% in FY 2015.""The margins might stay up, but the (dividend and profit) growth rate may moderate,"" Crooke told IBD, adding that he sees some limitations in the volume sales for the latest iPhone X, which can cost more than $1,000 per handset.The Street sees strong growth in FY 2018 (ending in September), with earnings jumping 24% to $11.44 a share on a 20% leap in sales to $274.3 billion. A 24% EPS pickup would be the strongest increase since a 43% bulge to $9.22 a share in FY 2015.For FY 2019, the estimates are 5% EPS growth and 2% revenue growth, but keep in mind that Wall Street analysts tend to be very conservative with forecasts that far out into the future.Crooke manages the Bankers Investment Trust, a closed-end fund started in 1888 and currently traded on the London Stock Exchange. The fund is on track to achieve 51 years in a row of increasing dividends paid to fund holders. Apple was the second largest holding in the $1.2 billion fund, according to data as of Oct. 31. Total return over the past five years is 123.3%.Apple paid a quarterly cash dividend of 63 cents a share on Nov. 16. The stock has a 1.5% annualized yield, below the 1.9% yield for the S&P 500.On IBD Stock Checkup, the SMR Rating for Apple is currently at a top-notch A on a scale of A to E and signifies leadership in terms of sales, profit margins, and return on equity.Going back to Meridian, the handle in Meridian's base began with a decline on Oct. 27, and the 7.2% correction within the handle portion is normal for a good cup with handle pattern.The operator of savings and loans in three counties of Massachusetts boasts a top-notch 99 Earnings Per Share Rating in IBD Stock Checkup. Earnings per share have risen 64%, 69%, 29%, 100% and 39% vs. year-ago levels in the past five quarters.Other banks acting well lately include Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), both of which recently found buyers during the latest pullback to the 50-day moving average.BofA is in the proper buy zone since clearing a 25.90 buy point in a seven-month-long flat base. That flat base may also be interpreted as a shallow saucer base.The stock is trading flat on Wednesday at 26.67, up nearly 3% from the proper entry.The 5% chase zone for BofA goes up to 27.20.The money center bank is expected to grow fourth-quarter profit by 20% to 48 cents a share. That would mark a second straight quarter of acceleration following EPS gains of 12% and 17% in the prior two quarters.Q4 revenue is seen slipping 3% to $21.96 billion.B of A's Composite Rating on Stock Checkup is a respectable 82 given that the bank is continuing a turnaround in fundamentals.JPMorgan, at 98.82, has climbed modestly since clearing a 95.32 base-on-base buy point in late September.RELATED:Also In Stock Market Today: 5 Reasons To Keep Holding AppleLooking For Top Large-Cap Firms: Inside Big Cap 20Which New Public Companies Will Emerge As The Future Cisco, Google and Microsoft?How To Find The Next Great IPOs: Check This ScreenThe Big Picture: Why The Future Of The Market Rally May Lie HereHow To Search For The Best Growth Stocks: Start Here

439,NOV,"As the media elites roll their eyes and sigh at people who deny the apparently inevitable approach of traumatic climate change, there's one category of denial they always endorse: a liberal bias in the ""news."" Chest-pounding journalistic activism defines the Trump era, and yet shameless journalists still claim media bias is a myth.James Warren, a former managing editor and chief of the Chicago Tribune Washington, D.C., bureau, now works at The Poynter Institute for media studies (or media denial?). He posted a commentary on Nov. 20 headlined ""How Mega-Media Deals Further Erode the Myth of a 'Liberal' Media.""Liberals made fun of Mitt Romney when he claimed that ""corporations are people,"" but they subscribe to the cartoonish idea that ""corporations are all conservative."" Corporations have a profit motive, so that somehow inexorably translates to Republican propaganda?Rupert Murdoch is looking at unloading some of his Hollywood assets, and among the suspected potential buyers are The Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA). To Warren, this somehow heralds a new era of ""not just unceasing consolidation but the unceasing influence of folks of distinctly conservative ideology."" The Murdochs explore selling off assets, and that's conservative consolidation?Not only that, Warren says the ""caricature"" of a liberal media is ""dubious"" and can be rebutted by the fact that the ""aggressively conservative"" Sinclair Broadcasting Group ""is primed to become the biggest local TV broadcaster."" Yet Sinclair stations are routinely airing network news and entertainment content from ... ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox.Warren then rounds up academics who sound like they never read or watch the liberal media. Matthew Baum, the Marvin Kalb professor of global communications at the Harvard Kennedy School, claims that conservatives ""mostly point to the political views of journalists at mainstream media outlets, who tend to lean Democratic."" He adds: ""Of course, the core journalistic norm of balance and objectivity run directly counter to that. So at minimum it isn't obvious why personal political views would trump professional norms."" He then argues that some ""research"" shows that ""news reporting tends to reflect the interests of ownership,"" so that predicts ""a more pro-conservative bias.""It's official: This professor sounds dumber than a grade schooler.XHe seems to have ignored every story written or broadcast over the last two years about President  Trump and his allegedly racist, sexist, homophobic, Islamophobic voters, as the ""professional norms"" have included demeaning Trump and the Republicans as a dangerously ignorant gang shredding democracy.Warren then cites Danny Hayes, a political scientist at George Washington University who doubles down on the idiocy. ""The debate about ideological bias in the media is not productive at all,"" he says. That's true ... if you're a liberal who wants the average (and, apparently, ignorant) media consumer to think the news is objective. Hayes insists ""the social science research finds virtually no evidence in the mainstream media of systematic liberal or conservative bias.""Hayes should be teaching geology because, clearly, he is living under a rock. We've been churning out daily evidence of a dramatic liberal bias in the ""objective"" news media for 30 years, and this ""scientist"" in Washington, D.C., thinks there's ""virtually no evidence""?This is a little like arguing that ""research"" shows there's virtually no evidence of pro football players kneeling during the national anthem this season. Everyone's seen it. No one is fooled. The only fool is the one who thinks denying the obvious just might work.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

443,NOV,"Oil held near $56 a barrel as markets digested political uncertainty in Germany and anticipation about OPEC's next move.Futures slipped as much as 1.7% in New York after rising 2.6% Friday. In Germany, the breakdown of talks to form a new government coalition raised questions about the future of Europe's biggest economy. That led the U.S. dollar to rally, reducing the appeal of commodities. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, meanwhile, will be briefed this week by oil-service provider Schlumberger Ltd. as well as Citigroup as the cartel debates whether to extend output cuts at a summit in Vienna Nov. 30.The political turmoil in Germany helped strengthen the U.S. dollar, which depresses oil prices, said Bill O'Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis. Data released Friday showed wagers on lower Brent prices rose by the most in five months through the week ended Nov. 14 as doubts persist about whether the Saudi Arabia-led cuts will be extended.""Politically, around the world, there are just a lot of plates spinning,"" O'Grady said in a telephone interview Monday. ""There's potentially a lot of supply out there and the only thing keeping it off the market right now is OPEC discipline.""Traders may also be closing out some bullish bets on crude ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S., when light volumes could make it harder to adjust to any bearish news, O'Grady said. ""What you're seeing is a lot of position squaring,"" he said.West Texas Intermediate for December delivery, which expires Monday, slipped 66 cents to $55.89 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 1:05 p.m., after declining 0.3% last week. Total volume traded was about 10% below the 100-day average.

The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $5.80 to January WTI.Saudi Arabia has had extensive consultations with Russia, Saudi energy minister Khalid Al-Falih said Thursday. OPEC will ensure that its exit strategy from the current accord will be a gradual adjustment that prevents the return of any glut, he said. Oil inventories are unlikely to drain to average levels by the time the OPEC agreement expires at the end of March, the minister added.The U.S. drilling-rig count was unchanged at 738 on Friday, data from Baker Hughes showed.Oil dipped slightly last week on a weaker demand outlook while Russia cast doubts on the timing of a decision to extend supply cuts. An extension still remains likely, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd.""It is widely believed that OPEC, together with 10 non-OPEC countries, will roll over their production for the whole of 2018,"" said Tamas Varga, an analyst at PVM in London.

449,NOV,"Bitcoin's relentless and volatile rally shows no sign of abating, with the world's largest cryptocurrency defying growing bubble fears to hit yet another milestone.XBitcoin rose as much as 6.7% to a record $8,224 as of 9:27 a.m. in New York. It's been a tumultuous year for the virtual currency, with three separate slumps of more than 25% all giving way to subsequent rallies.""The inflation in this thing is massive,"" Luke Hickmore, a senior investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments in London, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. ""When will it collapse? Who knows. It will cause a lot of pain.""Even as many skeptics call the asset a bubble waiting to pop, it's becoming too big for many on Wall Street to ignore. CME Group (CME), the world's biggest exchange, will start offering futures trading on bitcoin next month, while senior executives at Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citigroup (C) have said they are researching cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology that underlies them.Recent volatility has stemmed from a pickup in people switching to alternative virtual currencies, notably bitcoin cash. That's gaining popularity due to lower transaction costs and faster speed. New cryptocurrency iterations are springing up as disagreements over bitcoin's design persist and opportunities for making a quick buck prove hard to pass up.Bitcoin cash dropped 0.6% on Monday to trade at $1,184, down from a high of $1, 388 on Nov. 12, Coinmarketcap.com prices show. Bitcoin has advanced more than 700% this year and now boasts a market value of more than $130 billion.""I find it remarkable and somewhat frightening how, no matter how much bitcoin is pummeled by sellers, it simply bounces back even stronger,"" said Lukman Otunuga, an analyst at currency brokerage ForexTime Ltd. ""Will bitcoin hit $10,000 before year end? This is the question every investor is asking.""RELATED:Before You Buy Bitcoin, Read ThisBitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And Trends

450,NOV,"China e-commerce leader Alibaba (BABA) on Monday said it will invest $2.88 billion for a 36.16% stake in Hong Kong-based Sun Art Retail as part of a strategic alliance to expand opportunities in the nation's food and grocery retailing sector.XSun Art Retail operates 446 ""hypermarket complexes"" in 224 cities across 29 provinces, regions and municipalities in China, under the RT-Mart and Auchan banners. As part of the deal, Alibaba formed a strategic alliance with Auchan Retail and Ruentex Group.France-based Auchan Retail is an international food retailer that operates in 17 countries. Auchan will hold a 36.18% stake in the venture while Ruentex will hold a 4.67% stake. Alibaba's 36.16% stake in the venture was acquired from Ruentex.Ruentex Group is led by billionaire Samuel Yin and owns a wide range of businesses in the retail, property development, textile, insurance and biomedical industries.Alibaba said the partnership is part of its ""New Retail"" strategy that integrates online and brick-and-mortar retailing into a cohesive strategy to boost sales and convenience. Two years ago, Alibaba decided to start its own chain of supermarkets called Hema, of which there are now 18. Hema is a chain of digitized physical supermarkets where shoppers use a mobile app for online orders and in-store purchases of groceries or freshly prepared foods, as well as to research products while shopping, and to pay digitally or with facial recognition.Alibaba shares climbed 1.6% to close at 188 on the stock market today, near its record high of 191.22 set on Nov. 2. Alibaba shares have more than doubled in price this year.IBD'S TAKE: Alibaba is on the IBD Leaderboard list of top-performing stocks, with an IBD Composite Rating of 99 out of a possible 99. The stock is getting solid buying support at the 50-day moving average.In June, Alibaba agreed to purchase an 18% stake in Hong Kong-listed Lianhua Supermarket with the aim of boosting business efficiencies and enhancing customer experience. Alibaba also led a $300 million, D-round investment in Yiguo.com, China's largest online provider of fresh produce, in August.In September, Alibaba announced plans to invest $15.2 billion over the next five years to strengthen and expand its global logistics and delivery network.RELATED:Alibaba Kicks Off Festival Leading To Biggest Shopping Day Of YearBest Chinese Stocks To Buy And Watch

451,NOV,"Alphabet's Google (GOOGL) has cut prices on cloud-computing services — including those that use superfast number-crunching processors from Nvidia (NVDA) — a  week ahead of Amazon.com's (AMZN) annual conference for software developers.XGoogle's cloud platform unit announced the price cuts in a blog. According to website Tech Crunch, Google cut prices by as much as 36% for customers that rent Nvidia's superfast ""GPU"" processors. Using Nvidia's most advanced processors will cost $1.46 per minute, said Tech Crunch.Cloud service providers are battling to provide superfast computer processing as artificial intelligence software proliferates. Google aims to help cloud customers become more competitive using data analytics and AI tools. Nvidia's electronic chips are well-suited for AI's need for parallel-processing, analysts say.Amazon Web Services' conference kicks off on Nov. 27. AWS is by far the biggest provider of cloud computing services, where companies rent computing resources, followed by Microsoft (MSFT) and Google.Since 2006, AWS has consistently slashed prices for cloud services, aiming to attract new customers that normally process business workloads in their own data centers. Google, a latter entrant in the market, has cut prices aiming to grab share from AWS and Microsoft.Customers pay cloud service providers as little as pennies an hour per server or as much as $1-$2 an hour, depending on the type of workload.IBD'S TAKE: Alphabet stock has been consolidating after climbing above a technical buy point of 1008.71. The stock is trading above its 50-day moving average, a positive sign. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.AI software needs computing power to find patterns and make inferences from large quantities of data.

452,NOV,"Apple (AAPL) paced a hearty gain for the Dow Jones industrial average at midday Tuesday, rising more than 2% to 173.49, amid a broad stock market rally.XApple is now extended past a 160.97 proper buy point in a cup with handle that formed from Sept. 5 to Oct. 26. The iPhone giant broke out on Oct. 27, ramping up 3.6% and past the handle's high of 160.87.Apple is also now up nearly 47% from a 118.12 buy point in a longer first-stage cup with handle. That base was part of a long bottoming base pattern, signaling a turnaround in the megacap consumer tech and digital services play.At 1 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average, up nearly 0.8%, also saw at least 10 other components within the 30-stock average rise 1 point or more.The S&P 500 rose a little less than 0.7%, and the Nasdaq composite led with a nearly 1% lift, courtesy of not only Apple but other megacap techs including Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL).Industry groups among the 197 tracked by IBD that led Tuesday's upside included automation machinery, residential construction, automaker, data storage, computer hardware, heavy construction and security software stocks, all up 1.8% or more.Chip equipment, fabless semiconductor, RV and mobile home, jewelry retail, farm machinery, agricultural chemical and truck transport firms also rallied 1% or more.The S&P SmallCap 600 advanced 1%, taking its year-to-date gain back into double-digit territory, up 10.4%. The S&P 500, at 2598, reached all-time new highs and is up 16% since Jan. 1.Alphabet, up almost 1% to 1,045.52 in below-average turnover, remains in buy range after clearing a well-formed flat base with a 1,006.29 buy point.The proper buy range for any breakout goes up to 5% past the buy point; in Alphabet's case, it's 1,056.60. The reason: IBD's system of buying and selling great stocks definitely involves grabbing shares when the stock is rushing into new high ground, showing outstanding relative strength.But if one buys more than 5% past a proper buy point, the risk of getting handed a fast loss goes up sharply as many top-notch market leaders often pull back after a brief run, sometimes even falling below the proper buy point.Alphabet went public at a split-adjusted 42.50 a share in August 2004. The first breakout arrived just two months later when Alphabet soared past a 56.05 buy point in a first-stage IPO base.IBD Stock Checkup scores good ratings for the megacap tech. Alphabet gets a sterling 98 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 (terrible) to 99 (terrific), while the B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating points to net buying by large funds over the past 13 weeks.The Street expects Alphabet, which still gets the lion's share of its revenue from ads, to post a 32% jump in fourth-quarter profit to $9.98 a share. Profit rose 7%, 28%, 27% and 32% vs. year-ago levels in the prior four quarters, marking a bullish accelerating trend.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Tesla (TSLA) continues to rebound mildly after a big gap-down on Nov. 2. The electric-car leader rose nearly 2% to 314.55 in fast turnover, but still remains below the 200-day moving average. According to report on CNBC Tuesday, Morgan Stanley on Tuesday said Tesla could reach 400 a share but that a sharp pullback could follow after that.Notice on a daily chart how Tesla's 50-day line has been sloping markedly lower for more than four weeks. Watch to see if the big-cap transport play gains enough strength to potentially test upside resistance at not only the 200-day line but the medium-term 50-day.While Wall Street still largely expects the Elon Musk-led company to lose money at least through full-year 2018, the company continues to show robust revenue growth and strong operating cash flow.While Tesla lost $2.87 a share in 2016, it actually posted a positive cash flow from operations of $3.84 a share.Meanwhile, several stocks have triggered IBD's offense-type sell signal.Agilent Technologies (A) had a wild day, rising off early-morning lows to gain a smidgen to 70.09 and notch new highs. The scientific and electronic measuring instruments giant has rallied more than 20% to 25% since clearing a narrow five-week flat base at 54.92 in late April.However, those with supreme conviction in the stock can decide to hold longer and take profits when a defense-type sell signal triggers, such as a sharp break through the 10-week moving average in huge weekly turnover.Agilent is likely to extend its streak of low-double-digit profit growth as Wall Street sees earnings rising 13% to 60 cents a share in the January-ending fiscal first quarter. Earnings have risen 12%, 16%, 11%, 18%, 15%, 32%, 20% and 14% vs. year-ago levels in the past eight quarters.Chinese high-growth companies continued to shine amid a nearly 2% lift for the Hang Seng benchmark in Hong Kong.E-commerce facilitator and Leaderboard stock 58.com (WUBA) jumped for a fourth day in a row, rising nearly 3% to 78.50 in heavy trading. As noted in Leaderboard, the midcap consumer-spending play gave investors a follow-on entry point when it burst back above the 50-day moving average near 65 on Oct. 30 and 31.Shares have since rallied more than 20%.IBD's TAKE: Taking many gains when your stock has risen 20% to 25% past a proper buy point is an excellent way to build a strong overall return. Not only are you locking in gains in a stock on the way up, but you are also freeing up cash to possibly put into another top market leader. Read more about this offense-type sell signal in Investor's Corner.In other financial markets, Germany's DAX 30 stabilized, rising 0.8% amid struggles by German Chancellor Angela Merkel to form a ruling coalition following recent elections. The equities benchmark, at 13,168, pulled back 5% from an all-time high of 13,525 in recent weeks but is finding support at the rising 50-day moving average.WTI crude oil futures rebounded 0.5% to $56.71 a barrel, maintaining its torrid run since late June's low near $42.53, up 33%. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note held steady at 2.37%, still below a year-to-date high of 2.62%.RELATED:Which New Public Companies Will Emerge As The Future Cisco, Google and Microsoft?How To Find The Next Great IPOs: Check This ScreenHow To Search For The Best Growth Stocks: Start Here

453,NOV,"To get ready for earnings season, focus on stocks in or near a potential buy range ahead of their next quarterly report. One company that meets that criteria is IBD 50 member Guidewire Software (GWRE). It's expected to release its latest numbers around Nov. 29. It's trading right around an 81.56 buy point from a second-stage flat base.X Keep in mind that jumping into a stock right as it gets ready to report means you likely won't have enough time to build a profit cushion before the release. That leaves you exposed to a sudden downturn if the company disappoints investors with poor numbers and/or weak guidance. You can minimize your exposure by waiting to see how the company reports and how the market reacts. You can also use an options strategy to limit your potential downside.Looking For Winning Stocks?

Look no further: $1.8 billion Robo Global Robotics & Automation Index (ROBO) and $1.2 billion Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence (BOTZ) are there to serve your needs.Believe that electronic payments are the way of the future? $213.4 million ETFMG Prime Mobile Payments (IPAY) will show you the way. Would you like to capitalize on the recent wave of data breaches? $1.1 billion ETFMG Prime Cyber Security (HACK) gives you access to firms that are there to fix the mess. For exposure to Bitcoin: $1.2 billion Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) and $208.9 million ARK Innovation (ARKK). The list goes on.Top Performing ETFs In 2017This Is Where ETF Leader Sees The Biggest Opportunity In 2018Nvidia, Top Tech Stocks Power Gains For Innovator IBD 50, SOXX3 Ways To Benefit As Economy Accelerates In The U.S. And AbroadWhat do all these ETFs have in common? They're all focused on a theme or a subsegment of a growth industry; they're up between 15% and 647% through Nov. 15; and many feature company names you've never heard of.But as appealing as all this sounds, are these funds outperforming just because they're trendy, or do they have longer-lasting potential?""Increasingly, investors have been adopting certain thematic ETFs to gain exposure to trends that they think have growth prospects to round out their portfolios,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA's Director of ETF & Mutual Fund Research. ""As opposed to buying individual stocks that offer exposure to some of these trends, these thematic ETFs offer the benefits of diversification, which can be particularly important because stocks don't all go up just because they're in a certain industry.""He believes there is a hot-money theme to this: ""Money tends to, wrongfully, chase performance in the investment world ... . The trend is your friend until it's not."" It's impossible to forecast when a theme will stop being a positive for the stock market, he notes, ""but when that happens, I don't think the money will be as sticky.""That said, ETF.com CEO Dave Nadig points out that thematic ETFs often fill a particular need. ""The traditional classification systems are often really laggy: It takes a long time for any company classifications to catch on,"" Nadig said. ""The thematic ETFs are a way of grabbing stocks that exist across a couple of different subindustries and grouping them together in a way that's investable.""Nadig also says thematic ETFs allow speculative investors to react to headlines really fast, whether going long or short on these funds. ""What they really are replacing is not traditional sector investing, they're replacing single stock selection,"" he added.The funds also provide access to global names that individual investors may not know of or can't easily trade. For example, SOCL's top holdings include social media giants such as Tencent (TCEHY), China's largest internet service and social network provider, Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR). But the fund also holds lesser-known names such as Mail.ru, a social networking and communications portal for Russian speakers worldwide, and Mixi, a Japanese social networking service.Typically, niche ETFs hold between 30 and 80 stocks, resulting in a rather concentrated portfolio as many of these stocks share quite a few similarities, points out Nadig. This can make them more risky vehicles to own.He believes that over time, ""more of these funds will get brought to market ... with more institutional support, by larger, more well-known ETF issuers — and those will stick around for quite some time.""On the other side of the equation are thematic fund and index issuers themselves.""We don't think it's a fad. We think this is actually a natural evolution of how classical sectors are changing, and we're trying to remain at the forefront of it,"" said Kris Monaco, managing partner at Level ETF Ventures and co-founder of Prime Indexes, the indexing company behind several ETFMG ETFs.IBD'S TAKE: PayPal has delivered a solid performance this year, but how do its fundamentals and technicals rank in its industry group? Find out now at IBD Stock Checkup.Earlier this summer, ETF Managers Group, advisor on 13 PureFunds ETFs, took over as the funds' sponsor, rebranding the entire family with the ETFMG name and changing the index on three funds to Prime Indexes. Funds in the family include HACK, IPAY and other niche ETFs. A 14th fund, AI Powered Equity (AIEQ), was launched last month by ETFMG and EquBot.For funds such as HACK, ""I think certain thematic ETFs are very popular partly because the general investing population realizes things like cyber security are in demand and only going to increase as the amount of cybercrime across the globe continues to increase,"" said Chris Yeagley, managing partner at Level ETF Ventures and co-founder of Prime Indexes. ""But I don't think those investors generally know who are the companies that are fighting the war against cybercrime."" HACK gives them exposure to a basket of firms involved in this area.Because of their niche focus, thematic ETFs tend to charge higher fees. The above funds all carry expense ratios between 0.60% and 0.95%. But competition has been pushing some of the fees down, and experts believe this trend will continue.To help manage risk, investors need to understand what kind of index those ETFs follow, what securities they hold and whether they track the index closely or not, Rosenbluth points out. Two similar-sounding ETFs may have the same fees, but different performance, he notes.Fund size and liquidity are also important factors. Funds with less than $50 million in assets ""are more likely to close than other products,"" he said. ""I think equally important is looking at the trading volume of the ETF in relation to the trade you're looking to make.""ETFs that don't trade as much or don't have as much in assets tend to have a high trading cost due to the wider bid-ask spread, he adds.In general, investors should still consider the same factors with a niche fund as with any other ETF, such as fees, tradability and how closely it tracks the underlying index, industry experts say.""The way you approach a niche ETF should be the same way you approach any ETF — but on steroids,"" said Nadig. ""You still have to ask those questions with a niche ETF, but they matter even more.""RELATED:Chips Rally But Bitcoin Drops; Airlines Lift Stock Play Near BuyWhat's Your Flavor?

463,NOV,"Crude closed at its lowest level in almost two weeks as Russia is said to be less than convinced that OPEC should extend output curbs in a meeting this month.The U.S. benchmark slipped 0.7% Wednesday as Russia believes it's too early to announce a possible extension at OPEC's meeting at the end of the month, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The limits, sealed in a deal between OPEC and other producers in 2016, are scheduled to end in March. Meanwhile, U.S. government data showed that production climbed to a fresh record.""It sounds like there is some discourse between OPEC and non-OPEC in terms of not committing to something at the end of the month, and maybe kicking the can down the road,"" said  Nick Holmes, an analyst at Tortoise Capital Advisors, which manages $16 billion in energy-related assets.Oil rallied above $57 a barrel to a two-year high last week on escalating tensions in the Middle East and amid signals of a potential extension of supply curbs by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies. Since then, futures have slid about 3.5%.OPEC has yet to show it has convinced Russia, one of its partners in the deal, that a decision to prolong output cuts is needed when the group meets in Vienna later this month. Another issue is how long any extension should be, with options including an added three months being considered.The Russian government has yet to reach a consensus with the nation's oil companies on extending the deal, according to the people familiar with the discussions.""We expect prices to remain soft and move related to any rhetoric that comes out prior to those meetings from all of the involved parties,"" Adam Wise, who oversees an $8 billion energy portfolio at John Hancock Financial Services Inc. in Boston, said by phone. ""You've certainly seen Russia's comments weighing on the market.""West Texas intermediate crude for December delivery fell 37 cents to settle at $55.33 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest close since Nov. 2. Total volume traded was about 11% below the 100-day average. December WTI options contracts expire Wednesday.Brent for January settlement dropped 34 cents to end the session at $61.87 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark was at a premium of $6.35 to January WTI.American crude stockpiles climbed by 1.85 million barrels last week to 459 million barrels, and production extended gains to an all-time high 9.65 million barrels a day, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. The inventories build came in smaller than the 6.51-million-barrel rise that the American Petroleum Institute was said to report Tuesday.Crude exports rose by 260,000 barrels a day, while inventories at the key Cushing, Okla., pipeline hub fell by 1.5 million barrels, the largest draw since July. Distillate stocks were at the lowest since February 2015.

464,NOV,"The liberal narrative on President Donald Trump assumes his election is evidence that America is returning to its racist roots. In the angst-ridden aftermath, the media found vindication by reporting all kinds of ""hate crime"" incidents, lurching so eagerly that they fell for a few that turned out to be hoaxes. Any media outlet that leaps on a small incident of vandalism as a grand statement on Where America Stands ought to have the courage to make a public acknowledgment when the story is fraudulent. To do otherwise is to stoke racial fires with dishonesty.And that's precisely what they're doing.On Sept. 29, a shocking story came out of Colorado Springs, Colorado. Five black cadets at the Air Force Academy Preparatory School found racist messages like ""Go home, (N-word)"" written outside their rooms. The head of the Air Force Academy, Lt. Gen. Jay Silveria, had the entire student body stand while he demanded that the racist perpetrator(s) leave. It was humiliating. Put yourself in the shoes of the cadets forced to endure this tongue-lashing.This turned into a national story. On CNN ""Newsroom,"" Brooke Baldwin offered 11 minutes of airtime to a news report on the story and an interview with Silveria. And CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" added another seven minutes that included another Silveria interview. ""CBS Evening News"" offered two minutes and 45 seconds on it, and ""NBC Nightly News"" gave it about two minutes. PBS ""NewsHour"" offered a minute.It confirmed a liberal narrative: The U.S. military has a racism problem. But on Nov. 7, the academy reported that one of the black cadet ""victims"" had written the messages. It was a hoax, a vicious, ugly hoax. Some of the news outlets reported this. Baldwin offered three minutes, but not the Burnett program. PBS gave it 22 seconds. But CBS and NBC couldn't find the time. They were comfortable just leaving the fake news of racism uncorrected.XAt Kansas State University, Dauntarius Williams reported that his car had been vandalized with graffiti that said ""Go home (N-word) boy"" and other messages. The Kansas City Star reported the story on Nov. 1, complete with a headline that said ""students are fed up"" and a quote from an outraged black student who complained the college campus doesn't have a multicultural center.This story was another lie. On Nov. 6, the Riley County Police Department reported that Williams confessed to doing the graffiti himself and he would not be charged with filing a false report, since he ""expressed sincere regret that his actions had resulted in the negative media attention."" Williams said, ""It was just a Halloween prank that got out of hand."" He had called the Star after the incident and said he was a Kansas State student. He lied about that, too.On Sept. 8, 19-year-old Yasmin Seweid pleaded guilty to lying to police last December when she claimed that she had been harassed by drunk white men on the New York City subway who yelled anti-Islam slurs and chanted ""Donald Trump!"" The CBS News website, New York Daily News and BuzzFeed had all fallen for the lie.On Fox's ""The Five,"" Greg Gutfeld blasted BuzzFeed for its response to the hoax. The headline was ""Woman Arrested For Allegedly Making Up Story of NY Subway Attack by Trump Supporters."" Now compare that to the original BuzzFeed headline of the incident: ""Drunk Men Yelling 'Donald Trump' Attempt to Remove Woman's Hijab on NYC Subway."" There was no ""allegedly."" According to BuzzFeed's headline, the hoax itself was ""alleged"" and might be real. Even today, while its stories admit the reality, the awful headlines keep lying.And then the press wonders why America has more trust in used car salesmen.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

The Street anticipates Q3 earnings will grow 52% to 97 cents a share.China Lodging's earnings growth for 2017 is expected to increase 56%.

(TJX), down nearly 5%, after their earnings reports.Boeing (BA), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and other leading defense stocks have eased from their highs, but will they find support and offer a new entry?That's what investors watching iShares U.S. Aerospace (ITA) want to know. The ETF is holding at the support line — a solid rebound off the 50-day moving average would mark a potential buy opportunity. Last time it bounced off the line in late June, shares advanced as much as 19% to an Oct. 23 intraday high.The $4.8 billion fund, which launched in May 2006, tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace & Defense Index. It's trended higher since the presidential election last year, when defense, bank and building-related stocks took off amid expectations for a Trump bump.ITA has been no slouch over the longer haul, either. Though it endured a 61% drop from 2007 to 2009, as the Great Recession took its toll on the market, it's headed mostly higher since.The fund has soared 28.6% this year through Nov. 10, according to Morningstar Direct, outperforming the S&P 500's 17.3% year-to-date gain.

473,NOV,"The major market indexes posted mounting losses through Tuesday morning trade. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.6%, weighed down by General Electric (GE), which continued to fall after Monday's dividend cut. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq also declined 0.6% apiece.X Among the Dow Jones Industrial components, Home Depot (HD) edged lower, falling 0.6%, despite topping Q3 estimates and raising its full-year outlook early Tuesday. Shares are still in buy range from a 160.96 entry, and are hovering just above the 50-day line —  a key support level.Elsewhere in the Dow, Apple (AAPL) was set to decline for a fourth consecutive trading session. Shares fell almost 1%, but the iPhone maker remains extended from the cup with handle's 160.97 buy point.On the downside, General Electric fell another 3%, following Monday's over-7% decline. Shares are hitting fresh multiyear lows.Among analyst actions, graphics-chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) was upgraded from underperform to market perform by BMO Capital Markets.

474,NOV,"Major stock indexes suffered modest losses Tuesday, but it was a constructive session as indexes closed near session highs.XThe Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1% and the S&P 500 gave back 0.2%. The Dow's performance wasn't too bad considering that shares of General Electric (GE) lost 6% to 17.90. Shares are down close to 13% this week after the company on Monday outlined its turnaround plans and announced a 50% cut in the dividend to 12 cents a share.Weakness in GE was offset by strength in Dow components Coca-Cola (KO), United Technologies (UTX) and Home Depot (HD), which all ended with gains of more than 1%.Home Depot righted itself after a soft start, rising nearly 2% to 168.10 . It's been getting support at the 50-day moving average after a breakout from a base in early September. Profit, sales and same-store sales growth all topped expectations. Competitor Lowe's (LOW) reports next week.The Nasdaq composite and Russell 2000 small-cap index eased 0.3%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in slightly higher than Monday.Apple (AAPL) lost 1.5% on reports that a growing number of iPhone X users have reported eye fatigue and headaches from using the new handset.Another notable mover Tuesday was iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB). It lost 1.6% to 305, breaking longer-term support at the 200-day moving average. At the other end of the extreme, Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) cleared a base with a 56 buy point, rising 1.3% to 56.88.Oil and gas groups lagged amid a 2% drop in benchmark crude oil. Prices were weak after the International Energy Agency cut its demand forecast for this year and next, citing warmer temperatures as well as rising production outside of OPEC. U.S. shale output, for example, has risen for 11 straight months.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude oil futures for December delivery settled at $55.70 a barrel, down nearly 2%.Other gainers included Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD). Shares of the restaurant chain soared 24% to 145.60 after private equity firm Roark Capital offered to buy the company for $2.3 billion, or 150 a share. CEO Sally Smith was dealt a setback in June when activist hedge Marcato Capital won a proxy fight that put three of its directors on Buffalo Wild Wings' board. Smith is stepping down as CEO at the end of the year.Group peer Wingstop (WING) added nearly 2% to 39.67. Volume has been heavy in the stock after a Nov. 3 breakout over a 36.01 buy point. The early-November surge was fueled by strong earnings that saw profit up 31% from  the year-ago quarter. Sales rose 19% to $26 million.Elsewhere, Cantel Medical (CMD) cleared a flat base with a 99.93 entry, but volume was light. Shares rose 1.5% to 100.61.

475,NOV,"American Airlines (AAL) on Tuesday said it will add seasonal service between Dallas and Iceland, while ultra-low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE) announced new service from Richmond, Va., to Orlando and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.XThe announcements come as American and legacy rivals Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) look for ways to compete against budget long-haul carriers in Europe, and as Spirit positions itself for Spring Break.American said that it would begin offering its seasonal service from its Dallas-Fort Worth hub to Iceland's Reykjavik-Keflavik airport on June 7. Tickets go on sale on Nov. 20. The move would pit American against WOW air, a low-cost, long-haul carrier in Iceland that also offers flights between those two airports.Reykjavik, American noted, has become ""a very popular leisure destination"" and complements its ""continued growth from Dallas-Fort Worth, including Rome and Amsterdam.""WOW Air in August said it would add flights from four Midwestern U.S. cities to Reykjavik starting this coming spring for as low as $99.99 one way.During its third-quarter earnings call last month, American said that unit revenue in the trans-Atlantic market, where competition from European discounters is intense, rose during the third quarter. Better pricing and ""easing comps from past terror events"" in 2016 helped with the improvement.Still, management said that they expected to see more of the same in the region for the fourth quarter, with discounting from expanding low-cost carriers still ""aggressive."" However, the company said premium-cabin fare offerings, and the carrier's Premium Economy fare class, would help prop up results.Delta last month said also said that its trans-Atlantic business would show a bigger quarter-to-quarter improvement than any other segment in Q4. The carrier cited stronger business travel and Europe's rebound from a recession as reasons.Shares of American were up 0.15% in the stock market today, while Delta edged  0.1% higher, and United dipped 1.1%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Spirit, meanwhile, said it would begin daily, nonstop service from Richmond International Airport to Orlando International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on March 15.""Our commitment to low fares will bring more travel opportunities to the area, whether it be a family theme park vacation or last-minute beach getaway,"" the company said in a statement.The carrier last week said it would broaden its service in New Orleans. Spirit at that time also said it would start flying from Chicago and Baltimore to Cancun.Shares of Spirit climbed 2.8%, Southwest Airlines (LUV) added 0.9%, JetBlue (JBLU) rallied 3.6% and Alaska Air (ALK) lost 0.1%.RELATED:American Signals Higher '18 Capacity; Another Carrier Warns On CostsUnited Airlines Dives On Disastrous Earnings Call; Rival Carriers FallWill Delta Air Lines' Spat With Boeing Weigh On Massive Plane Order?

478,NOV,"Loxo Oncology's (LOXO) deal with Bayer (BAYRY) had a bigger impact on the biotech sector than you'd expect, an industry observer told Investor's Business Daily on Tuesday as key exchange traded funds fell out of flat bases.XEarly Tuesday, Loxo announced a deal with Bayer to co-develop two of its cancer drugs in an agreement that could pay Loxo up to $1.55 billion. Under the terms of the deal, Loxo and Bayer will split profits equally on drugs known as larotrectinib and LOXO-195 in the U.S.But the sector was hoping for an outright buyout, said Brad Loncar, portfolio manager for Loncar Investments, in an interview with IBD. The Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR) toppled alongside its fellow ETF peers, falling 3.4% to 23.30.""(Loxo) has been one of, if not the, most successful small biotech companies this year,"" he said. ""Some people were hoping for an outright buyout, and even if they weren't hoping for a buyout they gave pretty clear guidance they were going to hold on to those rights.""Loxo stock was up 159% for the year as of Monday's close, easily outperforming IBD's 458-company biotech industry group, which has climbed 25% year to date. On the stock market today, Loxo toppled 4.1% to close at 79.84, though shares were down as much as 12.8% earlier in the day.Collectively, the biotech group dove 2.6% and neared a three-month low after hitting its highest point since December 2015 in October. But the third-quarter earnings season was rough for a number of players like Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), which weighed heavily on the group.Biotech-centric ETFs also took pitfalls. The S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) fell out of its flat base with a buy point at 89.08, diving 2%. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) had been forming a flat base with an entry at 342.60, but fell 1.6%. ProShares Ultra Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (BIB) dove 3.3%.IBD'S TAKE: Loxo has an IBD Composite Rating of 51 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it performs in the middle of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at better-rated players in the biotech group.Loncar says mergers and acquisitions could really help the biotech group.""If (Loxo) had been bought out today, everybody would be saying, 'What's the next smaller company that's going to be bought out?' and they would probably be bidding up all of the stocks,"" he said.The fact Loxo was willing to give away 50% of its profits on these two drugs, both of which work to target gene fusions in cancer, suggests the biotech's negotiating was a bit weaker than expected, Loncar said. This ""revaluation"" is hurting the sector.He puts Tesaro (TSRO) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) into the same bucket. Both have approved drugs, known as PARP inhibitors, that target ovarian cancer. Loxo's larotrectinib isn't yet approved.Big pharmas, which struggled in the quarter, need to buy revenue growth, Loncar says. But it's possible ""the market (has) pushed their valuations so high that an outright buyout doesn't make sense"" for the likes of Loxo, Tesaro and Clovis, he added.The biotech industry group is now ranked No. 19 out of 197 groups tracked by IBD, down from first just a month ago. Gilead's acquisition of Kite Pharma — announced in August and completed in October — helped spike the group to a nearly two-year high.Since then, the group has pulled back. Investors either reacted harshly or surprisingly to news out of the group, Loncar said. Five Prime Therapeutics (FPRX) dove nearly 41% on Nov. 7 after unveiling the abstracts for its immuno-oncology combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) for pancreatic cancer.Overall, 13% of patients responded to the combination of Five Prime's cabiralizumab and Bristol's Opdivo. Pancreatic cancer is particularly hard to treat. Typically, doctors would have expected no response from the combination. Now, the duo has time to refine its treatment regimen.""We Wall Street people demand instant gratification and instant success out of drugs,"" Loncar said. ""It would be disappointing if this was a big Phase 3 trial at the end of the road. But this is literally the first in-human trial.""Dynavax Technologies (DVAX) also has suffered following the Food and Drug Administration's approval of its drug dubbed Heplisav-B to treat hepatitis B. The stock fell 9.4% on Monday. Loncar says investors are looking for Dynavax to either be bought or find a partner.""I think they probably will find a deal like that,"" he said. ""But you can't expect it literally the day after the approval. So between now and the first quarter when they're actually launching the drug, I think there's a chance for some good news there.""He added: ""A lot of investors expected a big pop, and as soon as there wasn't they ran for the exits. I don't think that's reflective of the quality of the company.""RELATED:This Biotech Just Neared A 17-Year High On Strong Cancer RegimenWhy Tesaro's $2 Million Cancer-Drug Miss Prompted Its Rivals To ToppleThis Biotech Just Rose By A Third On Its Earnings — But Is It In Trouble?

480,NOV,"The major market indexes held modest gains Monday ahead of a federal tax reform vote later this week, as General Electric (GE) weighed on blue chips.PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) was up 0.2%, while SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) were up 0.1% each. Foreign stocks lagged with iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA) fell 0.5%.General Electric weighed on the Dow with an 8% drop after the diversified giant offered weak profit guidance and slashed its dividend by half. But Procter & Gamble (PG), McDonald's (MCD) and Home Depot (HD) added about 1% each.Banks, utilities and metals miners led the upside among sector funds in the stock market today. SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) and SPDR S&P Bank (KBE) rose more than 1% apiece as they traded near their 50-day moving average lines.SPDR Utilities (XLU) added 1%, clearing a 56 flat-base buy point. Shares advanced 2% from a mid-August breakout from a flat base to the start of the most recent pattern.SPDR Consumer Staples (XLP), which holds P&G and Wal-Mart, gained 0.5%. It retook its 50-day line on Friday and is 4% below its 52-week high as it works on the right side of a five-month flat base.Energy, retail and biotech underperformed.If you like dividends, here are several funds to check out, including one that owns big yielders like AT&T (T) and IBM (IBM).The top two dividend exchange traded fund performers this year are focused outside the U.S. WisdomTree Europe SmallCap Dividend (DFE) led with a 28.9% year-to-date gain through Nov. 8, followed by WisdomTree Japan SmallCap Dividend's (DFJ) 28.1% return. Both funds have outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin.The rest of the list is predominantly composed of U.S. ETFs. Two other foreign plays made the 13-fund cut: SPDR S&P Emerging Markets Dividend (EDIV) and SPDR S&P International Dividend (DWX), with respective YTD returns of 18.1% and 15.8%.The No. 3 spot was claimed by WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth (DGRW), which was up 21% through Nov. 8.

Check out IBD's weekly ETF Leaders column for a featured fund and a list of highly rated ETFs.Most of these dividend funds are extended from a buy point. But SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY), the last name on the list, is pulling back toward its 50-day moving average. If it finds support there and stages a solid rebound off the line, that would set up a potential buy area.Shares advanced 3% from a late September breakout to its Oct. 24 intraday high. Or, taken from its last touch of the 50-day line in early September, SDY rose more than 5%.While the fund's 9.8% YTD gain lags the S&P 500 index, its three-year average annual return of 10.2% is in line with the broader index's 10.8%. SDY offers a higher annualized yield of 2.4% vs. the S&P 500's average 1.9% payout.Consumer staples accounted for SDY's biggest sector weighting as of Nov. 8 at nearly 16% of assets. Industrials made up 15%, financials 14%, and utilities and consumer discretionary, 11% each. Top holdings included Tanger Factory Outlet Centers (SKT), AT&T and IBM. Those three stocks yield annualized dividends of 6%, 5.9% and 4%, respectively.The 12-year-old fund, which tracks the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index, has amassed $16 billion in assets.

484,NOV,"Many investors are asking: Should I buy Bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies? And if not, why?X Bitcoin, the leading digital money, surged to a new record high above $17,000 Dec. 7 and was recently trading around $15,000. It's now risen nearly 1,550% this year and is up 6,540% since a low in January 2015. Nearly every day Bitcoin and other cryptos are making headlines. Some experts call them the new gold.But are Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies real investments or a speculator's game? And what about initial coin offerings, a hybrid of initial public offering and crowdfunding that has spawned Etherum and other projects? Even Wall Street is divided, so many experts warn Main Street investors to stay away or proceed with great caution.No less than Goldman Sachs (GS) is said to be considering a cryptocurrency trading operation, according to the Wall Street Journal. Yet JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said Dec. 8 he remains""highly skeptical"" of the cryptocurrency. Dimon in September called Bitcoin ""a fraud"" in September and said it would likely stay on the black market.Far from being safe for widows and orphans, like utilities, the Bitcoin market — which hit $150 billion in August — looks more like the 1840s gold rush. Many rushed in, but few got rich.On Nov. 12, Bitcoin fell to around $5,500, wiping out a rally on news that a plan to split the crypto currency was called off. It's bounced back since and was trading around $15,800 late Dec. 8.One risk is that governments likely will limit the currencies' use, such as barring them for tax payments, which would keep them out of the mainstream, according to UBS. China recently banned initial coin offerings and trading in cryptocurrencies, and it may not be the last government to act on concerns about giving up control over the flow of funds, the ability to monitor taxable gains or appearing vigilant in protecting investors.But many retailers are accepting Bitcoins as payment, including Microsoft, Target, Home Depot and Subway. And more uses are in the works.Only a handful of ETFs and other exchange traded products have significant exposure to Bitcoin or other cryptos. One is Grayscale's Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC). It's attracted $2.5 billion in assets and is up more than 1,250% this year.With a Bitcoin futures launch just around the corner, more vehicles could emerge soon. CBOE will start trading futures Dec. 10, followed by CME on Dec. 18. Earlier in the year, ETF provider VanEck's SEC filing to create a Bitcoin ETF was withdrawn because of a lack of futures.The surge in Bitcoin's value is a boon for Coinbase, an exchange where crytpocoins can be bought, sold and stored in wallets. Coinbase added more than 100,000 users Nov. 2 in a 24-hour period after CME Group announced its plans to introduce Bitcoin futures by the year's end, Bloomberg reported.In a picks-and-shovels move vs. actually holding Bitcoins, ETF provider Reality Shares in November filed to offer Reality Shares Nasdaq Blockchain Economy ETF, which would invest in companies that commit significant resources to blockchain technology, the Street.com reported. Blockchain is the technology behind Bitcoin and other cryptos. Also in November, Amplify ETFs also filed for Amplify Blockchain Leaders ETF and Horizons ETF Management filed for Horizons Blockchain Index.Bitcoin arrived on the scene in 2009. The digital currency is created and held electronically. Its value stems partly from the fact that it's decentralized; no single institution or government controls the network. It was developed based on a proposal from a software developer called Satoshi Nakamoto, according to CoinDesk, which tracks cryptocurrency prices and reports on events in the crypto space. Low transaction costs are another feature along with instantaneous transfers.Perhaps its biggest attraction is that its supply can't be increased or decreased at the whim of a controlling entity. Similar to gold and other precious metals, Bitcoins can be ""mined,"" but it's done by using computing power in a distributed network. And like gold, Bitcoin supply is limited. And it's headed toward terminal creation.Bitcoin rules state that only 21 million Bitcoins can ever be created, though the coins can be split into smaller parts. That could make Bitcoin, like gold, an attractive inflation hedge, backers say. There are 16.67 million Bitcoin in circulation now.On the other hand, the potential creation of new digital currencies creates ""the possibility of limitless supply of different cryptocurrencies,"" undermining the value of existing ones, UBS warned recently.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), an ETF that tracks the price of gold bullion, is up about 8% this year. That might look meager next to Bitcoin's surge. Hence, internet news searches for Bitcoin now outnumber those for gold.But cryptocurrencies have been volatile. On the way to its all-time high this year, Bitcoin plunged 28% from $2,682.59 on June 12 to $1,938.94. And it plummeted 35% from $4,950.72 on Sept. 1 to $3,336.41 on Sept. 14.Critics warn of a bubble. ""The relatively high volume of cryptocurrency turnover, against limited real-world use, suggests that many buyers are seeking speculative gain, never intending to use cryptocurrencies to make a real-world transaction,"" UBS analysts said in report quoted by CNBC.The blockchain software behind Bitcoin makes the digital currency a method of transferring value, but unlike at, say, a bank or real estate company. With blockchain, those expensive middlemen are no longer needed to ensure a transaction takes place as intended, a protection supplied by the blockchain software itself. The result: faster and cheaper transactions.And since blockchain and cryptocurrencies offer various layers of anonymity, they are seen as attractive to those living in countries where transfer of wealth is restricted. Detractors say cryptos also draw drug dealers, money launderers and tax dodgers along with legitimate investors.Coinbase is involved in a lawsuit in which it's trying to fend off IRS attempts to scan customer accounts for unreported taxable gains, Bloomberg reported.Those who want to own cryptocurrencies directly can go to exchanges to buy and trade them. Some of the largest are U.S.-based Coinsetter, Coinbase, Cryptsy, London-based Bitsamp and Bulgaria-based BTC-e.They'll need what the industry calls a wallet to store the private keys that give access to cryptos. Major exchanges offer soft, or hot, wallets for customers. Such wallets are available for desktop computers and mobile devices and include Bitcoin wallet, Mycelium, Xapo and Blockchain, according to Coindesk.Hard wallets in the form of flash-drive like devices bring an extra layer of security, by limiting exposure to the internet. They have to be plugged into a computer or phone before they can be spent. Three popular ones, according to Buybitcoinworldwide.com, are Ledger Nano S, KeepKey and Trezor. Just remember, don't lose it, forget your password or fail to back it up, or you might lose your cryptocurrency forever.While proponents extol the fraud-proof safety of blockchain technology, wallets have proved vulnerable. In the latest mishap, an estimated $280 million of Ethereum ether coins were locked up after a user accidentally deleted the code needed to access digital wallets hosted by Parity Technologies. The freeze affects all multisignature wallets created on Parity after July 20.Ethereum has jumped 5,628% this year from $8.03 on Dec. 31, 2016, and was at $459.99 Dec. 8. It surged as high as $464.99 early in the day.Meanwhile, the financial industry is moving ahead.In other moves by financial companies to bring Bitcoin to investors, on Sept. 6, CoinIRA, Goldco's digital currency unit, launched its new Digital IRA Bundles. The bundles, available in amounts of $25,000, $50,000 and $100,000, come prepackaged with digital currencies. Investors can choose from three portfolios based on their risk appetite: conservative, moderate or aggressive. The conservative bundle is made up of 50% Bitcoin, 41% Ethereum and 3% each in Ether classic, Litecoin and Ripple.Could exchange traded funds make digital cash more widely accessible?""A diversified ETF that has some exposure to cryptocurrencies will likely be somewhat less risky than direct investment,"" Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar, told IBD. ""But that's a bit like comparing the risks associated with juggling knives to those you'd face juggling chain saws.""Thus far no exchange traded funds trade on a major exchange like SPDR Gold Shares or iShares Gold Trust (IAU). Grayscale Investments' Bitcoin Investment Trust, which launched May 4, 2015, trades over the counter. Grayscale had filed for SEC approval to trade GBTC on NYSE Arca, but on Sept. 27 withdrew the application, remaining as a less-regulated investment trust.Morningstar Direct lists GBTC with its ETFs, but there doesn't appear to be an efficient arbitrage mechanism that keeps the price and NAV in balance. GBTC recently traded at a 44% premium to its holdings.GBTC shares fell as much as 54% from an Aug. 31 high but have rebounded to hit record highs and are up more than 1,500% this year. They started tumbling 20% Sept. 1 after short-seller Citron Research called GBTC the ""most dangerous way to own Bitcoin"" and said it should trade no higher than $550 a share.""Right now, many investors are using the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which is arguably even riskier than Bitcoin because it trades at high premiums, which means you could lose money even if Bitcoin doesn't go down,"" Eric Balchunas, ETF Analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, told IBD. ""In contrast, the ETF structure and its creation/redemption process would give investors the best possible chance to get A fair deal on investing in Bitcoin. ETFs have proved themselves in terms of being able to handle all kinds of non-equity holdings, such as bonds, physical gold and derivatives.""Potential ETFs under review by the Securities and Exchange Commission include Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, which the SEC rejected in March amid concerns including lack of liquidity and regulation. Officials are again reviewing the ETF candidate, a seemingly recurring process over the past three years.ETF provider ProShares on Sept. 27 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a ProShares Bitcoin ETF and ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF. Instead of owning the currency, both ETFs plan to track Bitcoin futures contracts.But the same day, VanEck withdrew its Aug. 11 application for VanEck Vectors Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which would have also invested in Bitcoin futures. According to VanEck's application withdrawal letter, the SEC's policy is to not review a registration statement until the underlying instruments (Bitcoin futures contracts) become available.Even Fidelity Investments is dipping its toes in the cryptocurrency field by teaming up with Coinbase. Fidelity's innovation unit on Aug. 9 said it will allow Fidelity customers to view their Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin balances in their Coinbase wallet accounts.Balchunas puts the odds at about 50/50 of a new ETF option in the next two years.""There have been two key developments since the SEC rejected it in March,"" he told IBD. ""One is the likelihood of a regulated Bitcoin futures and options markets, and the second is that the SEC's changing with the new administration, and its brand-new head of the division of investment management was a lawyer at the same firm that represented the Winklevoss twins' Bitcoin filing.""Still, caution is warranted.""In an ETF wrapper, volatility of Bitcoin could prove higher than alternative currency-based products and investors will need to be prepared,"" Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA's Director of ETF & Mutual Fund Research, told IBD. ""Interestingly, ARK Innovation (ARKK) and ARK Web X.0 (ARKW) provide exposure to Bitcoin, but have diversification to more traditional equity investments such as Amazon.com, Tesla and Twitter, dampening the risk.""ARK Investment Management, which runs six ETFs, offers exposure to Bitcoin and was the first ETF to own GTBC shares, which has helped boost the funds' performance.ARKK and ARKW were the top two sector ETFs based on their year-to-date returns through Dec. 7, according to Morningstar Direct, with respective gains of 83% and 80%.ARKK has attracted $295 million in assets since its October 2014 launch; ARKW has gathered $193 million since September 2014. Both funds bear a 0.75% expense ratio.Kinetics Internet (WWWFX) and Kinetics Market Opportunities (KMKNX) are among several Kinetics Mutual Funds that also own GBTC.Even as more options unfold for investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, investors should keep in mind potential risks.""If market prices retain any useful informational content, which theory suggests they do, then the 10x run-up in the crypto market capitalization over the last year signals there is something important taking place,"" ZenCash co-founder Rob Viglione said. ""Whether that something ends up being radically transformational, or simply a speculative delusion is yet to be seen.""This article was first published Nov. 13.RELATED:How To Invest In Stocks For Free With New Apps For BeginnersThe IPO Market's Hidden Gems: Can You Find The Next Google?Here's The Latest Bitcoin Rival That's About To Hit The MarketFidelity Starts Test To Let Customers See Their Holdings In Bitcoin, Other Digital CurrenciesMore Than Bitcoin: Blockchain's Links Reach JPMorgan, IBM, Wal-Mart
"
485,NOV,"Nothing adds more sparkle to your portfolio than capturing the enormous gains of a truly innovative new company through timely investing in recent IPO stocks.XThink of Google, now known as Alphabet (GOOGL) and up more than 2,300% from its 2004 initial public offering. Or Microsoft (MSFT), which ran up 67,282% from a post-IPO trading low in March 1986 to a peak nearly 14 years later. Not to mention Cisco Systems (CSCO), the greatest stock of the 1990s bull market, which shot up 118,741% in less than a decade.In comparison, the pickings may seem slim in today's IPO market. Although the number of initial public offerings year-to-date has increased from 2016's meager pace, it's low on a historical basis.Yet sharp-eyed investors can still find jewels among new IPO stocks. There's no guarantee that these companies will match the long-term gains of Alphabet or Microsoft. Yet some are off to an impressive start and could add some shine to your portfolio.Consider: Among companies that debuted in the past 24 months, at least 23 stocks that currently trade at 25 or higher are up 40% or more this year, based on Investor's Business Daily research. That's hearty outperformance in a year when the Nasdaq is excelling, rising around 26%, and the S&P 500 has rallied 15%.This elite group includes Ichor (ICHR), Square (SQ), Atlassian (TEAM) and Argentine lender Grupo Supervielle (SUPV). (A list of top-performing IPOs to watch is provided at the bottom of this article.)Though new to the stock market, these companies have shown strong fundamentals, giving investors confidence in their business strategy. All four are highly profitable. The combined trailing 12-month revenue for this quartet of new market maestros? A stately $4.6 billion.NYSE-traded Square, whose software lets small businesses and mobile merchants take credit-card payments via a tabletop device or a smartphone, came public at 9 a share in November 2015. Today, its stock is trading near 41, up 355%. Atlassian, which sells project management and collaboration software, trades near 53 and has jogged more than 150% higher since holding its initial public offering at 21 in December 2015.In addition to the 20 or more stocks up 40%-plus in 2017, at least 25 more companies that went public this year already have risen 20% or more. Eight of these stocks hold an IBD Earnings Per Share Rating of 80 or higher. They range from retailer Floor & Decor (FND) and auto shopping site CarGurus (CARG) to Warrior Met Coal (HCC), a coal miner, and Gardner Denver (GDI), an industrial equipment maker.Greg Eisen, senior research analyst and market strategist at Los Angeles-based Singular Research, notes that roughly half of recent IPOs hail from the speculative biotech sector.""Pharmaceuticals and biotech is still one of the largest areas of innovation,"" he said. But note: Many of the newly public companies are working on new medicines and treatments that don't have any significant sales, much less profits.That's true of at least two top IPO stocks this year: Pulse Biosciences (PLSE) and BeiGene (BGNE). Pulse, which is working on devices that use a proprietary ""Nano-Pulse Stimulation"" technology  to attack solid tumors, has no sales. BeiGene, a biopharmaceutical firm registered in the Cayman Islands with operations in Cambridge, Mass., and China, posted just $1.1 million revenue in 2016.So-called clinical- or development-stage companies are risky and demand greater scrutiny, yet they too should be closely watched. One sign to look for: Do top-performing mutual funds own shares of the stock? Better yet, are they showing confidence by adding to their holdings over time? Funds have deeper research and expertise than individual investors. You can judge a fund's performance by its IBD rating; those rated A have performed in the top 15% over the past 36 months and are listed in the IBD Weekly newspaper. (Information on fund ownership of specific stocks can be found on IBD's MarketSmith service.)More IPOs are hitting the market, presenting new opportunities for investors. The first two weeks of November combined for 18 new issues, the most in any two-week period this year and raising nearly $4 billion in proceeds, according to Dealogic.On Nov. 9, Chinese internet content play Sogou (SOGO) had a positive debut, finishing the session at 13.50, up 23% from its IPO price of 11 and raising nearly $500 million before bankers' fees. The company, which has Sohu.com (SOHU) as its controlling stakeholder, notched a 60% jump in third-quarter profit to 8 cents a share on a 55% revenue gain to $257.4 million. Watch to see if it can form an initial base.The same day, Apellis Pharmaceuticals (APLS) priced 10.7 million shares at 14 each. The stock is trading near that IPO price.Year to date through Nov. 13, IPOs listed on U.S. exchanges have totaled 166 companies, together raising $45.5 billion, according to Dealogic. In all of 2016, 111 companies raised a total $24.3 billion in capital. This year's total is also higher than the $36.2 billion raised by 174 firms in 2015, but it's likely to fall well short of the $96 billion raised by 292 companies in 2014.As of Nov. 10, the number of new issues within the past 12 months as a ratio of total companies listed on the NYSE had hit a 12-month peak of 6.1%.But that's well off the five-year high of 11% seen in August 2014. (Track this statistic by going to the Psychological Indicators & Volume link in the Stocks section of the IBD Data Tables.)IBD's TAKE: Using stock charts correctly can help you time your purchases in leading stocks so that you can maximize your gains and minimize losses within a relatively short period of time. Watching for breakouts from key chart patterns during earnings season is especially helpful. In addition to the flat base and the saucer base, the cup with handle stands out as one of the most critical patterns of human psychology; it visualizes investor fear and greed, hope and denial. Learn more about the cup with handle so you can gain an extra edge.Robert Maltbie, president and founder of Singular Research, thinks optimism over new issues is not yet at a boiling point and thus good for the future of U.S. equities.In 2018, ""We could have a snowball effect in an inverse sort of way, in that as the market goes higher, it would extend into the small caps. Plus, if a tax cut occurs, that would only accelerate the issuance of IPOs,"" Maltbie said. The reason? U.S. corporations stand to benefit from Congress' plan to lower taxes sharply to 20%.Singular Research notes that the pipeline for the rest of the year is decent at around 80 potential IPOs. Both Maltbie and Eisen, however, expect upcoming market debutantes to fall within the small-cap range, unlike bigger offerings such as Snap (SNAP), which quickly hit $35 billion in market cap after its March 2 debut but is now valued at $15 billion.Despite the market's strong rebound on Thursday following passage of a massive U.S. tax reform bill in the House of Representatives, some companies have decided to wait before going public.Argentine food producer Molino Canuealas (ticker MOLC, target range of $14 to $17)  filed for registration of American depositary receipt shares on Oct. 27. On Thursday, Renaissance Capital reported that the flour, oil and biscuits giant is postponing its IPO that would offer 19.5 million shares, potentially raising up to $331 million before fees.Specialty silicone and chemical additives play MPM Holdings is also delaying a potential $350 million IPO. The Waterford, N.Y.-based company posted $2.3 billion in 12-month sales through Sept. 30.Late on Thursday, SailPoint Technologies (SAIL) priced its offering of 20 million shares at 12 apiece, raising $240 million. On Friday the Morgan Stanley, Citi and Jefferies-led new issue finished the day at 13.Investors will have a higher likelihood of picking winners if they focus on companies with large year-over-year increases in earnings and sales. Look for companies that have the best pretax and after-tax profit margins in their field.Occasionally, a company with zero earnings can still become a giant winner, particularly if revenue is growing rapidly. It may have other positive attributes, including a well-regarded management team and a Wall Street banker with a proven track record of backing highly successful new stocks. Over the past two decades, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs have successfully brought numerous outstanding companies public.Business software firm Workday (WDAY), a 2012 IPO, comes to mind. In the year the Pleasanton, Calif., firm went public, it racked up $274 million in revenue for fiscal 2013 (ended in January that year) but also lost 56 cents a share.Yet the stock climbed 143% in 14 months. Investors knew Workday founder David Duffy as the man who built PeopleSoft, a former software giant and stock market leader that eventually got acquired. Workday continued to post fast growth, with revenue soaring to $1.57 billion in fiscal 2017. The company also bagged its first net profit, earning 12 cents a share. Wall Street expects earnings to jump 592% to 83 cents in the current fiscal ending in January.Companies with that kind of growth are rare, even in the case of biotechs. Only the best companies have outstanding earnings and sales and show the potential to become as big as an Amgen (AMGN) or Gilead Sciences (GILD).While it may be tempting to buy shares of a promising new company on the first day of trading, it's usually best to wait for the stock to establish a trading range. That can take weeks, but it's time well spent. Why? An investor can, with the help of charts, get a sense of the supply-demand balance.Does the stock peak at, say 20, but seem to find a floor near 16? Such information is useful, especially when an investor uses a chart. If the stock has strong demand, it shouldn't fall below 16. And when the stock rises past 20, an investor can buy shares on the breakout to new highs. That strength suggests institutional investors such as mutual funds, banks, pensions and hedge funds are backing up the truck and desiring large amounts of shares.Technical analysis of IPO stocks is a bit different than for established stocks. IPO-style bases, or stock chart patterns, can form in just three or four weeks. That's much shorter than common bases for established stocks, such as the flat base, which must be a minimum of five weeks in length, or the cup with handle, which must be at least seven weeks long. Look for a proper entry price, which is typically 10 cents above the narrow IPO base's left-side peak, in higher volume, and buy within 5% of that buy point.When luxury goods retailer Michael Kors (KORS) debuted in December 2011 at 20, shares raced higher in less than two weeks to as high as 27.58, then pulled back gently. Over the course of just 11 sessions, Kors dropped to 25.50, pulling back just 7.5% and building a narrow new IPO base.On Jan. 17, 2012, the maker of stylish handbags, watches, sunglasses and high-end apparel shot out of that narrow base, rising nearly 6% and clearing the 27.68 buy point in the fifth-heaviest volume in a single session. That breakout spurred an 83% gain in less than two months. Kors produced another new base, then broke out again near 50 in August the same year. Shares eventually reached as high as 101 in February 2014 before peaking.Patience and chart analysis can keep you from being swept into the euphoria over IPOs in supposedly hot businesses.Money-losing social network Snap is the latest example. The company got plenty of media coverage when it debuted on the NYSE on March 2 at 17 a share.Snap rose with fury in its first two days. But it's mostly fallen since then. On Nov. 8, shares plunged 15% after the Venice, Calif., company reported disappointing third-quarter revenue growth of 62%, far smaller than its than year-over gains of 406%, 286%, 153% and 666% in the prior four quarters.Blue Apron (APRN), a web-based meal kit delivery service that is bleeding red ink despite having $795 million in sales last year, has done even worse. The stock peaked at 11 its first day of trading and now trades around 3.""The quality of IPOs, generally, has declined since the heydays of the '80s and '90s, when small companies viewed going public as a rite of passage — giving them access to the public market and the recognition that being public brought to their company and their brand,"" Bryan Anderson, executive VP and market strategist at Austin-based Beck Capital Management, told IBD. Anderson once worked as a portfolio manager for William O'Neil + Co.""Based on how many of the highly touted IPOs have performed in recent years, it is clear to us that these companies are increasingly going public primarily to provide an exit strategy for their founders and venture-capital backers — leaving crumbs for the public investors,"" Anderson added. ""The early investors are making the bulk of the returns.""That's not to say the careful investor can't find IPO gems.The most successful new issues tend to create a new product or service or change the way people work, live or spend their time.Medical companies attract big sales with government-approved treatments that extend life or improve the quality of life. Take Moorestown, N.J.-based Tabula Rasa Healthcare (TRHC), which came public in September 2016. Its software provides a better way to prevent adverse side effects of multiple medicines taken by patients.Atlassian, the U.K.-based business collaboration software firm, is changing the way company employees communicate with each other to get tasks and projects done. The midcap stock boasts exceptional fundamentals, as seen in its IBD Stock Checkup: They include a Composite Rating of 99, an EPS Rating of 96, and an A for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return On Equity).IPO Leaders, a daily automated stock screen that also includes weekly commentary helps readers locate stocks that are trading near or at the best entry points.IBD found 21 companies that have gone public within the past 24 months, hold an Earnings Per Share Rating of 70 or higher, and trade at 25 a share or higher.

488,NOV,"A good rule of investing is to take profits when a stock climbs 20% to 25% from its buy point. But if you bought above the ideal buy price, should you cash out or wait until your shares hit that profit target?That was the question that faced many Arista Networks (ANET) investors last month.The stock's journey on IBD's Leaderboard began Aug. 4, when it broke out of a flat base. Shares gapped past the 163.07 buy point (1). This meant the normal 5% buy range had to be adjusted for the bullish gap. Subscribers to Leaderboard were advised to buy as close as possible to opening price of 167.60.After a few days, the network technology company retreated to its buy point but bounced right back from it. Shares continued advancing, all the while holding above the 10-day moving average. That kept investors in the stock.Oct. 9 was a critical day. That's when the price increase from the 163.07 buy point reached 20% (2). The goal was secured, but investors who bought on the gap had a profit of less than 20%. The fact that Arista had gapped above its buy point made it impossible to match the 20% increase from the standard buy point. Should they sell anyway?With no other sell signals and the general market in fine shape, it was reasonable to just keep holding. Still, taking profits was a sensible choice just because historical models tell you to expect a pullback or even a brand-new base after a 20% climb.Arista was sent to the Cut List that day, with a profit of about 11% on Leaderboard's books.From there, the stock made a mild pullback and rose to a new high Oct. 30. But anyone second-guessing the decision to sell had reason to feel vindicated on Nov. 2.That day, just before the company announced earnings, shares tumbled below the 50-day moving average in severe volume (3). The sell-off was alarming, yet the stock found support at the line as the company's quarterly results gave investors new optimism. It was possible to buy Arista shares at that support, but investors had to act quickly because the stock became extended the same day of the rebound.With Leaderboard, investors can get the needed guidance, as market specialists study the selected stocks and annotate charts with the latest signals.

490,NOV,"What do the CEO's of Charles Schwab (SCHW), Hyatt Hotels (H), Guidewire (GWRE) and Vail Resorts (MTN) have in common? They all addressed investors at Baron Fund's annual conference in New York recently.Getting insights from the chiefs of companies Baron has a keen interest wasn't the only treat. Of the 5,000 attendees, those who are investors in the firm's flagship Baron Partners Fund (BPTRX) are seeing a year-to-date return of 31%. Investors with $25,000 in any of the company's funds are invited to the annual conference held at one of New York's premier institutions, the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, which also features top shelf entertainment for lunch as well.XThe theme of this year's conference held Nov. 10 was ""Disruption.""""Disruption upends the status quo,"" said Ron Baron, chairman, chief executive and founder of Baron Funds, from the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House. ""The Chinese word for disruption is made up of two characters: danger and opportunity. Disruptions create opportunity. It's hard to see the opportunities when you live through disruptions, but believe me they're there.""Baron, 74, said the prosperity of the 1950s came from the disruption of the Great Depression and World War II. And that the disruption of the 1960s and '70s set the stage for the strong economic growth and strong stock market of the 1980s and 1990s.In addition to managing the Partners Fund, which has $2.06 billion in assets under management, Baron is also the portfolio manager of Baron Growth Fund (BGRFX), up 23.7% year to date, and Baron Focused Growth Fund (BFGFX), up 25.4%, compared with the S&P 500's return of 17.2%.Baron said the U.S. is currently in another period of disruption. ""Between 2000 and 2017, we've had one BAM! after another: two stock market bubbles burst, two wars and now a disruptive president.""Yet, amid this millennial disruption we are experiencing unbelievable achievements, such as SpaceX's relandable rockets, he said. Advances in technology have always been disruptive, but not at this pace. ""Amazon is disrupting a new industry every day.""""People are dismissive of disruption until BAM! Then it's too late to catch up,"" said Baron. ""But, our outlook is positive. We believe the millennial disruption has set the stage for accelerated growth.""And while it may seem like there is an app for everything, he said only people analyzing companies can identity competitive advantages that algorithms and apps cannot.""Apps can't assess character, judgment, curiosity and trustworthiness,"" Baron said. ""Apps can't imagine what a business will becomes.""But Baron fund managers can, judging by investment returns. Some of the managers were brought to the stage to talk about their views for the year.Jeffrey Kolitch, the portfolio manager of  Baron Real Estate Fund (BREFX), up 26.3% year to date, said, ""This isn't 2010 when everything was on sale, but if you look at the overall market and dig deep, there are tremendous opportunities.""""We are very excited about India,"" said Alex Umansky, the portfolio manager of Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund (BFTHX) and Baron Global Advantage (BGAIX). ""We had no investments in India a year ago, but now India makes up 9% of our portfolio.""The CEOs Baron introduced to his investors head companies he feels are taking advantage of the disruptions in their industries. Schwab president and CEO Walt Bettinger heads a company that fits the bill.Mark Hoplamazian, the president and CEO of Hyatt Hotels (H) said Airbnb was a big disruption to the hotel industry because people want to experience interpersonal human connections.""People want experiences over things and there is a huge momentum for a desire to travel,"" he said.Another interesting company was Guidewire Software (GWRE), which makes easy-to-use software for the property and casualty insurance industry. Chief executive and co-founder Marcus Ryu said the software typically improves a company's operating margin by 2.5 to 4.5 percentage points.Rob Katz, the chief executive of Vail Resorts (MTN) said the ski resort company shifted the paradigm away from waiting for the weather and disrupted how the company was positioned for its investors. It's now the best performing stock in the travel sector, jumping 422% in five years.RELATED:

491,NOV,"Graphics-chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) late Thursday received a bullish report from a Wall Street analyst who thinks the company's stock could reach 300 under a bull-case scenario.RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves reiterated his outperform rating on Nvidia and raised his base-case price target to 250 from 240.Nvidia shares slipped 0.1% to close at 211.36 on the stock market today. Nvidia hit a record high of 218.67 on Nov. 10.Steves has increased confidence in Nvidia's data center and gaming chip businesses. He noted that Facebook (FB) has been a big buyer of Nvidia's DGX-1 chip sets for deep learning and artificial intelligence applications.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia is currently ranked No. 10 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.Gaming chip sales are being driven by increased processing requirements for the latest ultrarealistic video games, he said. Nintendo (NTDOY) Switch console demand and virtual-reality headsets also are likely to drive Nvidia chip sales, Steves said.In his bull-case scenario, Steves believes Nvidia could hit 300 if it continues to see high growth in gaming and data center chip sales and gets a material boost from automotive chip sets for self-driving cars.RELATED:Nvidia Impresses Analysts At Supercomputing Conference

492,NOV,"As the old saying goes, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. That is certainly the philosophy of swing trading and flies in the face of the position trader's adage, ""let your profits run.""First, understanding the market you are in goes a long way in determining when to take your profits. Most of this year, when we hit our 5% profit goal, we take half profits. Usually we try to let the remaining shares extend gains to a 10% profit goal, but not as often lately. Since rallies and corrections in the market have tended to be short, that stretch to 10% hasn't happened quickly and we have often booked profits earlier.Take a recent trade in Atlassian (TEAM). The stock has superior fundamentals and at its last earnings report (1) saw a huge jump of 25%. An option strategy on the earnings, noted in our Earnings Preview column, provided a way to profit from the move while minimizing risk. The stock pulled back for nearly two weeks but held the bulk of the spectacular one-day gain, setting up a potential swing trade. It joined IBD's SwingTrader on Nov. 2 as it broke out above its trading range (2) on the heaviest volume since the earnings report.Three days later and we took half profits after Atlassian hit its 5% profit goal (3). At this point, we are usually looking to stretch to a 10% profit goal for the remaining shares, always mindful of market strength as a backdrop for our expectations.When the Nasdaq composite dropped 1.5% intraday on Nov. 9, it seemed prudent to take profits on the remaining shares (4). The market looked extended and, as we've seen all too frequently, quick drops can wipe out weeks of progress in a single day. Just as you wouldn't go looking for extra birds in a bush if you thought a bear was in the vicinity, neither do we push for more profits when the market is threatening to take away the gains we have.The worries seemed unfounded by the end of the day as the market closed near its peak and Atlassian closed back above its 5-day moving average after being below it intraday (4). But notice the action in the stock over the next five days. It flattened and hugged the 5-day moving average, jostling above and below it from day to day. We booked a 4.8% profit when averaging both exit prices and each close was right around the level of our exits. Even when the market shot up Thursday, Atlassian closed up, but ultimately right around the same level (5).Being out of the trade, with profit in hand, protected us from the risk of holding longer and having those profits disappear. In this case, the promise of more profits hasn't materialized yet so we didn't miss out on anything. And since the stock has been trading tightly, it could offer us another opportunity to snatch another profit with a new setup.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Don't Be Greedy!

493,NOV,"If you're looking for stocks that are setting up in a base ahead of their next quarterly report, here's one that fits the bill: IBD 50 member Veeva Systems (VEEV). It's expected to release its latest numbers around Nov. 20 and is currently about 10% shy of a 68.17 entry. The entry is based on a third-stage consolidation, which is less likely than an earlier-stage base to generate a big new run. X Understand that jumping into a stock right as it gets ready to report means you likely won't have enough time to build a profit cushion before the release. That leaves you exposed to a sudden and perhaps sharp drop if the company misses analyst estimates or provides weak guidance. You can minimize your exposure by waiting to see the actual numbers and the market's reaction. Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch? Start HereEarnings growth increased last quarter from 47% to 53%. But revenue gains fell from 32% to 27%.

The company has a 94 Composite Rating and holds the No. 2 rank among its peers in the Computer Software-Medical industry group. Tabula Rasa Healthcare (TRHC) is the No. 1-ranked stock within the group.Note: Dates for earnings reports are subject to change. Check the company's website for any updates.

Consumer discretionary represented 12%; health care and industrials made up roughly 11% apiece.

496,NOV,"Communists of the world, it is time to rejoice! Nov. 7 is the 100th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. On that day in 1917 the Lenin-led Reds staged a coup in St. Petersburg, seizing power from the first democratically elected government in 1,000 years. This was the first time in history that a communist regime had toppled a government but certainly not the last.But where are the celebrations of this magnificent moment? We have not heard a word of congratulations even from the nominally communist nations of China, Venezuela, Cuba, Sweden, Vietnam, or even the Upper West Side of Manhattan. No parties on the college campuses, nothing from Hollywood or even Bernie Sanders?What about that reliable bastion of leftism — the mainstream media? No reverential videos of Lenin and Stalin from CNN? What about glowing tributes from the New York Times? Why the silence?Before 1917, the communist utopia concocted by the twisted mind of a disgruntled rabbi's son from Germany named Karl Marx had the credibility of the unproven hypothesis. That changed abruptly on that historic November day. The Soviet insurrection that overthrew the legitimate Kerensky government ushered in a wave of terror that was unprecedented.The Red gangsters that ruled Russia made Genghis Khan and Attila the Hun look like amateurs in the art of carnage. In order to consolidate power over a majority of Russians who did not believe in socialism, the Leninist thugs had to murder tens of millions and incarcerate countless others in gulags.And how did their economic utopia fare? Not very well. For virtually the entire 20 years following the communist coup, the country was in perpetual famine. It did not help that on the way to collectivizing agriculture, the Soviets murdered millions of productive independent kulak farmers who were responsible for most of Russia's agricultural output.The massacre of their own people by the communists served as a template for future revolutions. Since 1917, communism has been tried in 37 countries worldwide and has a perfectly unblemished record of failure. By contrast, more than 2 billion people, primarily in Asia, have been lifted out of poverty by free enterprise since 1980. But will you ever see this in the Washington Post or on MSNBC? Of course not. It's far easier to whine about inequality.How have citizens been treated under communist rule? The landmark work, ""The Black Book of Communism,"" eloquently and comprehensively addresses this. According to editor Stephane Courtois, ""Communist regimes are responsible for more deaths than any other political ideal or movement."" How many? One hundred million humans massacred, starved and executed, including 65 million in China.Surely the ""leading"" Marxist murderer was Pol Pot, whose minions slaughtered the most-educated and accomplished 20% of Cambodians in 1975. The Killing Fields represented the zenith of Red genocide and should have served as an epitaph for the monstrosities of Marxism for all time.But paradoxically, leftism is stronger than ever today. Throughout Western societies the welfare state keeps expanding, socialism dominates the colleges and permeates the media, while laissez-faire capitalism is held in low repute. No matter that after 15 years of socialism once-prosperous Venezuela is a ruined economy. A century after the Bolshevik Revolution, far-leftists Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn are rock stars.So let's all salute the communists and wish them a well-deserved Happy 100th Anniversary.RELATED:What Caused Venezuela's Collapse Is No Mystery — Except To Economically Illiterate JournalistsAn Old Tweet From Michael Moore Underscores That Socialism Doesn't Work — EverSocialism Is Dying Everywhere -- Except The U.S.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

497,NOV,"Friday's session was quiet as major stock indexes ended with modest losses, but as has been the case recently there were plenty of strong movers below the surface.XThe Dow Jones industrial average lagged, falling 0.4%, weighed down by weakness in Coca-Cola (KO) and Wal-Mart (WMT).Wal-Mart lost 2%, one day after shares surged 11% on strong earnings. Coca-Cola gave back nearly 2% after its Investor Day on Thursday.Nike (NKE) was a bright spot in the Dow, helped in part by huge gains from Foot Locker (FL) and Hibbett Sporting Goods (HIBB), which reported better-than-expected earnings. Shares of Nike gapped up over a 57.35 cup-with-handle buy point, rising 3% to 59.19.The Nasdaq composite backed off nearly 0.2%, while the S&P 500 eased 0.3%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index outperformed again, rising 0.4%, after reclaiming the 50-day moving average Thursday. Preliminary data showed volumes on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in close to Thursday's levels.In the stock market today, NetEase (NTES) followed through from Thursday's breakout over a 320.77 cup-with-handle buy point. Shares rocketed nearly 13% to 367.50. It's extended past the buy point now.Elsewhere, enthusiasm was short-lived after Tesla (TSLA) last night unveiled a new semi-truck and a roadster than can go from zero to 60 mph in 1.9 seconds. Shares of Tesla rose 4.5% early but got turned away at the 200-day moving average, ending with a gain of less than 1%. Tesla remains in a downtrend after gapping below the 200-day moving average Nov. 2.Leaderboard name Splunk (SPLK) gapped up powerfully over a 69.71 buy point, soaring 18%. There was a lot to like about its latest earnings report, which also came with a bullish outlook. The enterprise software name, specializing in data analytics, announced 450 new enterprise customers as well as an expanded relationship with Dell EMC, a subsidiary of Dell Technologies (DVMT).Fellow enterprise software name Workday (WDAY) gained 2% to 111.68. It's still in buy range from a 110.69 cup-with-handle buy point.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, U.S. crude oil futures for December delivery were trading around $56.59 a barrel, up 2.6%.

499,NOV,"On Nov. 9, Rolling Stone magazine celebrated the 50th anniversary of its first issue, published in the hippie Haight-Ashbury neighborhood in San Francisco. True to form, liberal journalists — who claim to care so deeply about the menace of fake reporting — honored founder Jann Wenner and dismissed as insignificant the magazine's 2015 ""A Rape on Campus"" story scandal.On Nov. 5, CBS ""Sunday Morning"" host Jane Pauley gushed over Wenner as ""the rock star of publishing."" Minutes later, she upgraded the flattery by calling him ""perhaps the most influential rock star on the planet.""Out of nearly nine minutes, CBS correspondent Anthony Mason spent less than a minute on the fake story about gang rape at the University of Virginia. He asked, ""How much did UVA hurt the magazine?"" Wenner replied, ""a little."" Mason pushed back, and Wenner complained that it was ""one incident"" in 50 years, saying: ""I think that the people who were in charge of this at the time, you know, let certain standards slide. Were it not for this one woman who fabricated, that was golden; that was a great story."" Had both the interviewer and interviewee yawned at this point, it would have done justice to the mood.""This one woman"" was the center of the story, which became a national outrage about gang-raping fraternity boys. It turns out Rolling Stone didn't even get to square one and attempt to verify that there was a party at the Phi Kappa Psi frat house on the night in question. There wasn't. That's why it had to fork over $1.65 million in damages.Put yourself in the shoes of those innocent young men who were accused of such a heinous crime, found guilty by such a powerful magazine and soundly condemned by a nation. The $1.65 million in damages does not begin to erase the humiliation.XNBC's ""Today"" show interviewed Wenner and didn't even bring up the subject. Host Matt Lauer was more interested in asking, ""what are you most proud of in terms of a social issue that you got ahead of?"" How about rape on campus? At least Lauer asked about the Rolling Stone cover that glamorized Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and then asked: ""Was that your biggest do-over? Or are there some others?"" Wenner volunteered the UVA story, saying, ""we got, you know, really duped."" So it just wasn't the magazine's fault. How's that for taking responsibility?ABC's ""Good Morning America"" aired a story on Rolling Stone and a new Wenner biography on Oct. 20, which didn't include a word about the fake rape story as the host gushed over a 1972 nude cover photo of ""Partridge Family"" star David Cassidy.Despite being exposed as an unreliable source of lies and character assassination, almost every liberal-media notice started with comparing Rolling Stone to the Holy Bible. This suggests that they're all eager lackeys of the hippie magazine's public relations staff. CBS began, saying, ""It's been the cultural bible of baby boomers for half a century."" NBC also called it ""the cultural bible for baby boomers."" The New York Times described it as the ""shiny entertainment-industry bible."" A few weeks ago, a Times headline read, ""Rolling Stone, Once a Counterculture Bible, Will Be Put Up for Sale.""If Rolling Stone represents the ""sacred text"" of the 60s-mythologizing left, then that's a sad indictment. But it's obvious that the magazine was part of transforming the ""counterculture"" into the ""culture."" Its revered status as a cultural ""agent of change"" seems to be a major reason why the media elites grant the magazine a pass on smearing entire universities.And with that, let's return to those media lectures about the need for honest and competent journalism.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

500,NOV,"Major stock indexes were mostly unchanged with about one hour left to go in Friday's session, as eight-week win streaks for the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 were in jeopardy.XThe Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 edged lower while the Nasdaq composite gained less than 0.1%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index edged higher by 0.1%.

Investors focused instead on news of a new ""Star Wars"" trilogy, plus a streaming servicing in the works that CEO Bob Iger said would be priced lower than Netflix (NFLX).

503,NOV,"Electric car manufacturer Tesla (TSLA) apparently has more than a long way to go before it can meet its goal of making 5,000 Model 3 sedans per week by late in the first quarter.XA report from Elektrek on Thursday estimates that Tesla built just 180 Model 3 vehicles last month, and a total of 440 vehicles since the start of production in July. Tesla once had a goal to build 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by late December, before recently pushing that date back a few weeks.Production troubles aside, test drives of the Model 3 by two equity analysts elicited positive reviews, with one saying that passion for the Tesla brand is comparable to how Apple (AAPL) fans feel about the iPhone.Tesla acknowledged production woes with its Model 3 when it reported third-quarter results on Nov. 1 that missed earnings expectations by a wide margin. Production delays at Tesla are among the reasons a large amount of Tesla shares are sold short.Tesla said it delivered 26,150 vehicles in the third quarter, up 4.5% from the year-ago period, but added that ""production bottlenecks"" were crimping its ramp-up for the Model 3. The company wouldn't specify the number of Model 3s produced in October.""The initial phase of manufacturing any new vehicle is always challenging, and the Model 3 production ramp is no exception, particularly given our focus on highly automated manufacturing processes that will ultimately result in higher volumes at significantly lower costs,"" Tesla said in its quarterly report.""While we continue to make significant progress each week in fixing Model 3 bottlenecks, the nature of manufacturing challenges during a ramp such as this makes it difficult to predict exactly how long it will take for all bottlenecks to be cleared or when new ones will appear,"" the company said.Nomura analyst Romit Shah on Thursday issued a positive report on Tesla and said enthusiasm for the Model 3 is similar to how Apple fans admire the iPhone.""Apple succeeded because the world shifted from PCs to smartphones and Apple had the best product,"" Shah wrote in a research note to clients Thursday. ""Similarly, we believe there is a secular shift today from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles and we think Tesla has the best product.""IBD'S TAKE: Tesla has a weak IBD Composite Rating of 39 out of a possible 99 and is trading below its 50-day moving average. Check out IBD's Tech Leaders feature to get a broader idea on top tech stocks.If Tesla can overcome operational challenges, Shah added, ""We believe a strong affinity for the Tesla brand will translate into unprecedented revenue growth and strong cash flows.""Shah reiterated a buy rating on Tesla and price target of 500.Tesla shares lost 0.5% to close at 302.99 on the stock market today. Tesla shares are down about 23% from a record high of 389.61 set on Sept. 18.Shah's report followed his test drive of a Model 3 on Wednesday.""We aren't professional car reviewers, but we walked away believing that Tesla will be selling as many cars as it can produce for a long time,"" Shah wrote.Also test-driving the Model 3 this week was RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak.""The Model 3 exceeded our expectations, specifically on the interior and user interface,"" Spak wrote. ""Operationally, Model 3 production delay certainly proved disappointing, but company appears confident that issues are fixable.""Spak has a sector perform rating on Tesla and price target of 340.RELATED:Tesla Skids On Quarterly Earnings, Could Lose Lucrative Tax CreditTesla Stock Quotes, Company News And Chart Analysis

509,NOV,"Until a century ago, Karl Marx was an unpracticed intellectual, a prolix babbler whose thoughts remained an ideal rather than a reality. Then came the Bolshevik Revolution. On Nov. 7 (Oct. 25 in the old Russian calendar) of 1917 the Soviet Union was effectively born.This event may have been as momentous as the war that spawned the first communist state. Tens of millions of people died as communism transformed nations. We continue to live with the consequences of Marxism today.XLife was good in 1914. The industrial revolution delivered entire populations from immiserating poverty. Liberal currents affected even the great autocracies of Austria-Hungary, Germany and Russia. The future beckoned.But on June 28, Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the venerable Habsburg throne, and his wife Sophie were visiting Sarajevo in the recently annexed province of Bosnia. In a plot backed by Serbian military intelligence, the young Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip assassinated the pair, setting in motion diplomats and statesmen, generals and admirals, and armies and fleets around the globe.War came in August. Russian peasants died in a war started by aristocrats for reasons no one truly understood.This was the central tragedy of the conflict. Before troops began marching in August 1914, common people's lives were improving. Even those at bottom in the great Tsarist despotism were doing better. Then came the continental war.Nowhere was the tragedy greater than in the mysterious, mystical, antiquated Russian Empire. For a long time, St. Petersburg was a force of conservatism, even reaction, opposed to Western liberalism and especially the French Revolution.However, Imperial Russia eventually made common cause with France, the paragon of revolution. But the former was a giant with feet of clay. The regime staggered along unsteadily amid peace and prosperity.Then came June 28, 1914, when a Serbian terrorist assassinated the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. Austro-Hungary followed an ultimatum against Belgrade with a declaration of war, dragging in Russia, which defended Serbia.Russian elites had various grievances against Germany, but none could justify war. When pressed to mobilize the army, Czar Nicholas for a time temporized, at one point declaring that ""I will not become responsible for a monstrous slaughter."" But on July 30 he surrendered to St. Petersburg's clamorous war party.Alas, the losses in manpower and materiel were horrific. By the end of 1916, Russia had lost some five million men.In March 2017 (February in the old calendar) liberals and moderate socialists staged a revolution, forcing the czar to abdicate. But the provisional government's control was tenuous and it continued the war amid a series of revolts, mutinies, protests and disturbances.This opened the way for political radicals, prime among them the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, or Lenin. He began the war in exile in Zurich, Switzerland, but Germany arranged for his passage home to spread the revolutionary virus.He initially had little success, but understood that the people were desperate for peace, land and food. On Nov. 7, Lenin and his colleagues staged what amounted to a coup against the hapless provisional government.The Bolsheviks outmaneuvered more moderate forces on the left, made peace with Germany, and won a bitter, four-year civil war against the counterrevolutionary Whites. Lenin then set the repressive foundation of the brutal Soviet state.Lenin died in 1924, leading to a bitter succession battle won by manipulative Josef Stalin. Under him millions died, including many of his supporters. Although revolutionary fervor had dissipated, the USSR staggered along, murdering and impoverishing its people, until Christmas 1991. The Soviet flag finally was lowered from the Kremlin for the final time.Scholars figure that communism killed between 8 million and 61 million Soviets, but 15 million to 20 million seems most accurate. Estimates of the total number of dead due to communism— not counting from wars — run from 85 million to more than 200 million.Communist rulers both murdered promiscuously and implemented policies that resulted in mass death, through famine, for instance. The hardship — including poverty, starvation, oppression, and inhumanity — is incalculable. Equally brutal was the assault on the human spirit. Marxism as adapted by Leninism squeezed the very life out of people.History is a long series of ""what ifs?"" Communism was not destined to take over Russia, transforming the 20th century for the great ill of mankind. But today we must confront the consequences of the birth of the Soviet state a century ago.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

510,NOV,"Oil climbed more than 2% midday Friday, paring losses earlier this week, as Saudi Arabia moved to dispel doubts over Russia's readiness to extend output curbs.Futures rose as much as 2.5% in New York after Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Khalid Al-Falih, said OPEC should announce an extension of output curbs when it meets on Nov. 30. Russia is said to be hesitant to commit to a decision so soon, suggesting the group wait until closer to the deal's expiration at the end of March. U.S. crude output gained this week to the highest in more than three decades, according to government data.Oil rose to the highest in more than two years last week amid near certainty that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies would prolong the output deal and heightened geopolitical tension in the Middle East. Prices retreated in the last few days after the International Energy Agency said milder-than-normal winter weather is putting a brake on demand growth. While Russia's reluctance is causing concern, Saudi Arabia's Al-Falih is trying to reassure the market the deal will be extended.""Ahead of the OPEC meeting, we're going to see a little bit of volatility,"" Gene McGillian, a market research manager at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn., said by phone. ""Going forward, the market needs to keep seeing that the fundamental picture is continuing to tighten.""West Texas intermediate for December delivery was at $56.01 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 87 cents, at 10:11 a.m. in New York. Total volume traded was about 33% above the 100-day average. Prices lost 19 cents to $55.14 on Thursday.Brent for January settlement was 62 cents higher at $61.98 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Prices are headed for the first weekly drop since the start of October. The global benchmark was at a premium of $5.81 to January WTI.OPEC is unlikely to reduce excess oil inventories to average levels by the time the current supply deal expires, Al-Falih said Thursday.The kingdom has had extensive consultations with Russia, and the minister said he feels ""fully convinced"" the country will be ""fully on board"" when a resolution is made.

512,NOV,"Looking to avoid the competitive wrath of Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) that target its core market with various ventures, Yelp (YELP) has been busy adjusting business models and creating new ones to boost growth.XThe relatively small Yelp is in a continuous battle for digital ad dollars with those two much larger rivals. More than 85% of all new digital ad spending in the U.S. is funneled through the web behemoths, according to a recent Internet Trends report.Facebook, for one, has been steadily adding features to its social media platform to help users locate restaurants, bars and nearby attractions, for example through its Facebook Local app. Last month, Facebook launched a service for ordering food.But Alphabet represents a special challenge to Yelp. Google has started to assemble its own portfolio of local advertising products, but on top of that Yelp also relies on the search giant as a ""major source of traffic,"" wrote Baird analyst Colin Sebastian in a research note to clients after Yelp reported quarterly results.Still, Yelp Chief Executive Jeremy Stoppelman thinks he has at least some of the answers.""We see a long runway of opportunity in front of us, and we believe we have the right strategy to extend our lead in local,"" Stoppelman said during a conference call after Yelp reported third-quarter results on Nov. 1. ""Our newer growth initiatives, including Yelp Reservations, Yelp Wi-Fi marketing, and Request a Quote are just beginning to demonstrate their strategic impact on the overall business.""Yelp has taken several steps of late to meet the seemingly daunting task in front of it. First, there's Yelp Wi-Fi, a service that allows businesses to connect with customers over a freely provided Wi-Fi network.Request a Quote, launched in April 2016, can be used, for example, by college students wanting to get a quote on a mover, or by an engaged couple looking to price a photographer for their wedding. More than 973,000 local businesses are now connected to the Request a Quote service, Yelp says.Yelp also has taken steps to help companies advertise more effectively on the Yelp site. In August, Yelp partnered with LiveRamp to make the location and search activity of Yelp users available to advertisers. It allows marketers to create custom audience segments in a way similar to what Facebook (FB) does with its Facebook Audience Network.To help defend its turf against Facebook and Alphabet, Yelp has also improved the way advertisers can increase their click-through rates with the help of artificial intelligence. It also brought on board ""thousands of new advertisers"" via its self-serve ad platform with tools that allow business owners to set up and manage ad campaigns themselves.And, last month, Yelp closed the sale of Eat24, which was purchased by Grubhub (GRUB) for $287.5 million. The two plan a long-term partnership in which Yelp will integrate online ordering from all Grubhub restaurants into Yelp's platform. When fully implemented, targeted for early next year, Yelp expects the partnership to significantly upgrade the food ordering experience for Yelp users, while improving its per-order profitability.""As we look forward to 2018, we see multiple catalysts, including Request a Quote, an enhanced food ordering offering via the Grubhub partnership, continued focus on self-serve advertiser additions and direct response advertising,"" wrote Credit Suisse analyst Paul Bieber, after Yelp reported third-quarter results on Nov.1.Founded 13 years ago, Yelp has emerged as a leading online platform for user reviews and information on a range of local businesses, including restaurants, retailers and home service providers. Millions of consumers use the Yelp platform daily to find and interact with local businesses, with more than 142 million reviews on the Yelp website. The company went public in 2012.Yelp reported third-quarter revenue of $222.4 million, up 19% from the year-ago period and at the high end of its guidance, maintaining a string of double-digit growth per quarter going back more than four years. About 90% of revenue came from advertising, with 8% from transaction fees and 2% from other services.Adjusted earnings rose 32% to 29 cents a share, but that was the fourth quarter in a row of revenue deceleration from the year-ago quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Yelp has a IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of a possible 99 and a Relative Strength Rating of 89, and it currently trades above its 50-day moving average — all positive indicators. To invest in stocks, start with this simple routine.Yelp lowered revenue guidance for the full year to reflect its sale of Eat24, but adjusted pretax earnings guidance was revised upward, indicating improvement in profitability from transaction revenue.During the third quarter Yelp said it averaged 83.6 million monthly unique visitors on desktop computers. That was up 17% from the year-ago period.It also said there were 73.5 million monthly unique visitors to Yelp's mobile-optimized website, up 2%. But another 30 million accessed the site via Yelp's mobile-specific app, up 21%.There were more than 142 million reviews at the end of the third quarter, up 23% from the year-ago period.Analysts generally applauded the third-quarter results, with several upping their price target on Yelp shares. Bieber at Credit Suisse raised his price target on Yelp to 51 from 48. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill raised his price target to 52 from 49.Since hitting a six-month low of 26.93 in May, Yelp shares are up about 70% and currently trade near 46.""We continue to believe that Yelp is well-positioned to benefit from local advertising dollars moving online,"" Thill wrote in a research note to clients following the earnings report. He said about $149 billion is spent annually on local advertising in the U.S., and those dollars continue to move toward digital platforms.""We believe that as these businesses become more educated on the benefits of the Yelp platform (through the sales force and other marketing initiatives), we will see penetration increase,"" Bieber wrote.RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney met with Yelp executives on Nov. 8. ""We came away positive from Yelp's presentation, and view the opportunities the company faces in 2018 as constructive,"" Mahaney wrote in a research note to clients. ""We believe core advertising revenue and metrics growth trends appear to have regained consistency.""Mahaney has an outperform rating on Yelp and a price target of 55, up from a previous target of 36.RELATED:Facebook Unveils Marketplace For Local Buying, SellingGrubhub Shares Rise As Quarterly Results, Outlook Beat EstimatesFacebook Shares Higher As Third-Quarter Results Crush EstimatesGoogle Has Biggest Beat In 10 Years, Bulls Say Best Yet To Come

514,NOV,"Time magazine's cover story for the week of Nov. 6 is a classic. It blares: ""The Wrecking Crew: How Trump's Cabinet Is Dismantling Government As We Know It."" The New York Times ran a lead editorial complaining that team Trump is shrinking the regulatory state at an ""unprecedented"" pace.Meanwhile, last week the stock market raced to new all-time highs; we had another blockbuster jobs report with another fall in the unemployment rate; and housing sales soared to their highest level in a decade.Are the editors at Time and the Times so ideologically blinded that they are incapable of connecting the dots?The U.S. economic revival of 3% growth has already defied the predictions of almost every Donald Trump critic. I vividly remember debating Hillary Clinton's economic gurus during the campaign: They accused Trump and advisors such as myself of ""lying"" when we said that pro-growth policies would speed up economic growth to 3 to 4%.Jason Furman, who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama, told reporters earlier this year that the chances of reaching 3% growth over a decade were about 1 in 25 — which is what many political experts said was Trump's chance of winning the election. Another Obama economist, Alan Krueger, called the 3% growth forecast ""extremely rosy.""Larry Summers, a top economic advisor to Obama, questioned the ""standards of integrity"" of the Trump economic team's forecast for 3% (or more) growth. ""I do not see how any examination of U.S. history could possibly support the Trump forecast as a reasonable expectation,"" he wrote in The Washington Post.Congress weighed in, too. ""This budget relies on absurd economic projections and pretend revenues that no credible economist would validate,"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., announced at a House budget hearing.The sharp-penned Paul Krugman of The New York Times declared Trump's growth forecast an act of ""economic arrogance."" He said that the productivity improvement necessary for faster growth was as likely as ""driverless flying cars"" arriving ""en masse.""Admittedly, we shouldn't read too much into six months of very good economic data (with 3% growth) or the booming stock market. These trends can always reverse course quickly. Trump's more restrictive policies on trade and immigration could harm growth potential.But so far the Trump haters have missed the call on the economy's trajectory. Doubly ironic is that the same Obama-era economists who are trashing Trump's increasingly realistic forecast of 3% growth are the ones who predicted 4% growth from the Obama budgets. Obama never came anywhere near 4% growth, and at the end of his second term, the economy grew at a pitiful 1.6%.Under Obama, free enterprise and pro-business policies were thrown out the window. What was delivered was the weakest recovery from a recession since World War II, with a meager 2.2% average growth rate. Middle America felt it, which is why Trump won these forgotten Americans.One reason that economist Larry Kudlow and I and others assured Donald Trump that 3 to 4% growth was achievable was that Trump could capitalize on the underperformance of the Obama years. Under Obama, business investment fell almost two-thirds below the long-term trend line — thanks to higher taxes on investment. Now, partly in anticipation of the tax cut, business spending keeps climbing.Maybe the liberal economists and their shills in the media should show some humility. They should acknowledge they were dead wrong about how much Obamanomics was going to grow the economy and about how Trumponomics would crash the economy and the stock market. Or better yet, maybe the rest of us should all just stop listening to them.RELATED:Say Hello To 3% GrowthNo, We're Not At 'Full Employment' YetClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

Analysts expect the Dallas-based oil & gas exploration company to earn 10 cents a share, an increase of 67% from the year-ago quarter.Eni (E) was another oil stock breaking out. The Italy-based oil company rose past the 33.60 buy point of a cup-with-handle base in hefty volume. The government of Italy may sell part of its 4.3% stake in Eni plus its holding in air traffic controller Enav to reduce debt, Bloomberg reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.Cenovus Energy (CVE) climbed above the 10.79 entry of a flat base that developed within a larger consolidation.RELATED:AMD, Intel Team Up To Take On Nvidia In Gaming LaptopsChip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry NewsTower Firms Up, Telecoms Fall On Failed T-Mobile-Sprint Merger

518,NOV,"North Korean Nukes: Why did President Trump suddenly go wheels-up on a grueling, 12-day Asian tour? As new polling data suggests, it might be because North Korea has suddenly emerged as a major nuclear threat in the eyes of most Americans.In the November IBD/TIPP Poll, taken from Oct. 26 to Nov. 3,  73% said they were ""very concerned"" or ""somewhat concerned"" about the ""possibility of a nuclear attack by North Korea against the U.S. or its allies."" The national poll of 917 adult Americans has a margin of error of +/-3.7 percentage points.Recent news developments no doubt feed this growing fear.On Sunday, Rear Adm. Michael J. Dumont of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that it would take a ground invasion of North Korea to destroy its nuclear weapons capability. Dumont noted that Seoul, the South Korean capital that lies just 35 miles from the Demilitarized Zone, would be vulnerable to attack by artillery, rockets and ballistic missiles in the event of a war. Seoul is home to 25 million people.Meanwhile, just days ago, an unnamed U.S. official told CNN that North Korea is ""working on an advanced version of its existing KN-20 intercontinental ballistic missile that could potentially reach the United States."" The totalitarian regime of Kim Jong Un launched its first ICBM just last July, so the progress is rapid. An ICBM could potentially reach the U.S. in a little over half an hour.Based on this escalation, blunt-talking U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis last month made clear what the U.S. policy was: ""I cannot imagine a condition under which the United States would accept North Korea as a nuclear power,"" he said.So a very clear and bright line has been drawn for all to see.Americans seem to understand this. While on many issues these days there are often sharp, even divisive, splits in general opinion based on party affiliation, that's not the case with North Korea's nuclear threat, the IBD/TIPP Poll's results show.Among Democrats, for instance, 86% said they were concerned, vs. just 14% saying they weren't. But Republicans weren't too far behind, with 69% expressing concern about a North Korean nuke, compared with 31% not being concerned. For independents, it was 65% concerned vs. 35% not concerned.A surprising share of those queried also believe that a military conflict between the U.S. is ""inevitable."" Some 27% said the U.S. and North Korea will go to war — 37% of Republicans, 22% of Democrats and 25% of independents.That explains Trump's tough talk on Monday, as he began the first leg of his nearly two-week tour. Speaking with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe next to him, Trump referred to the ""North Korean menace"" and vowed that ""the era of strategic patience is over.""""The regime continues development of its unlawful weapons programs, including its illegal nuclear tests and outrageous launches of ballistic missiles directly overly Japanese territory,"" Trump said. ""We will not stand for that.""Americans have good reason to be worried about the totalitarian North Korean regime's nuclear schemes. Given the brutal nature of the murderous Kim regime and its potential instability, a nuclear North Korea is a nonstarter.President Trump is expected to meet with Chinese officials and possibly also Russian leader Vladimir Putin during his trip. No item on the agenda will be more important than North Korea's burgeoning nuclear program.American presidents of both parties have kicked this can down the road for decades, leaving it for someone else to resolve. Trump is the first to really take it seriously. As we've said before, China is North Korea's main patron. We hope, and expect, Trump will mince no words in expressing his disappointment over China failing to leash its mad dog in Pyongyang.Americans might be surprised to know that the U.S. is already technically at war with North Korea, since the hostilities of the Korean War ended with a cease-fire — not a formal end of the state of war. For one side of the conflict — North Korea — that state of war is very real. Seeing Kim's growing nuclear program, Americans are also starting to realize the threat is real.RELATED:No, North Korea's Nuclear Threat Isn't Fake News North Korea's Nuclear Threat To The U.S. Is Real — And China's Largely To Blame Trump's Trade War With China Is War On North Korea By Other Means IBD/TIPP Poll Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

519,NOV,"One year after his surprise victory in the 2016 elections, President Trump's approval rating remains mired in the mid-30s, while half the public say he has met or exceeded their expectations as president, according to the latest IBD/TIPP Poll.XThe poll also finds that the public's outlook has improved on a variety of measures in the past year.The November poll asked people whether the Trump presidency so far has met, exceeded or fallen short of expectations.Forty percent say Trump has met their expectations and 10% say he's exceeded them; 46% say Trump has fallen short of what they expected.On a partisan basis, 27% of Democrats say Trump has met their expectations, 66% say he's fallen short, and 3% say he's done better than they expected. Among Republicans, 54% say he met expectations, but the share who feel he's exceeded expectations is nearly identical to the share who say he's fallen short (22% vs. 23%). Forty one percent of independents say Trump met expectations, 47% say he's fallen short, and only 8% say he's exceeded them.Urban and suburban adults are most likely to say Trump has fallen short (50% and 51%, respectively). But 59% of those living in rural areas say he's done as well or better than they expected.The national poll was taken from Oct. 26-Nov. 3, and includes responses from 917 adults, giving it a margin of error of +/-3.4 percentage points.Trump's overall approval rating edged up this month by three points to 36%, with 58% saying they disapprove of the job he's doing.His favorability rating is -19 points, with 56% saying they have an unfavorable view compared with 37% favorable.The proprietary IBD/TIPP Presidential Leadership Index — which combines results from job approval, favorability and leadership questions — climbed 9% this month, but at 39.8 it is still below Trump's average Index reading of 41.1 since he took office.Trump's low approval numbers come despite the fact that the country is in a better mood, overall, than it was on the eve of the presidential elections one year ago Tuesday.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index has been consistently higher since Trump was elected than it was a year ago. The index has averaged 53 through October this year. It stood at 51.4 in IBD/TIPP's November 2016 poll, which was conducted just before the elections took place.A year ago, more than a third of adults surveyed (34%) thought the economy was in a recession and only 49% thought it was improving. Today, just 19% think the economy is in a recession and 53% say it's improving.The share of job seekers is down, too. The latest poll has it at 11.3%, whereas it was 13.1% just before the 2016 elections. These figures track the official unemployment rate, which was 4.8% last year and is now down to 4.1%.People are less stressed financially too, according to the poll's Financial Related Stress Index, which is 5% lower today that it was last November.The share who think the country is headed in the right direction, however, has remained unchanged at 40%.None of this has helped boost Trump's appeal to the public. At 39.8, Trump's current Presidential Leadership Index is almost 26% lower than it was for Obama in November 2016.In other findings, the poll shows that key provisions of the Republican's tax plan continue to win widespread support among the public.The poll also found that few people have been following the breaking news regarding the controversial Uranium One deal, which gave Russia control of 20% of U.S. uranium supplies. The Hill reported recently that the FBI had evidence that Russian nuclear officials had been involved in serious crimes in the U.S. at the time the deal was approved by Obama officials, raising questions about Russian influence-peddling in the administration.Just 48% say they are following that story closely; 51% say they aren't.However, far more are following the latest revelations that the Clinton campaign and the DNC had financed the controversial Trump dossier, which alleged collusion by the Trump campaign and the Russian government. That revelation has seriously undermined the credibility of that dossier, which has been the driving force behind the entire Trump/Russia investigation.Nearly two thirds (64%) say they are following this new element of the story closely.RELATED:IBD/TIPP Presidential Approval, Direction of the CountryIBD/TIPP Economic Optimism IndexAmerica's Most Accurate PollsterWant to make more money in the stock market?

520,NOV,"Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley plans to retire in the middle of next year, signaling the departure of an influential, crisis-tested policymaker that will widen the leadership overhaul at the U.S. central bank.The New York Fed said in a statement Monday that his decision will ""ensure that a successor is in place well before the end of his term.""Dudley's term ends in January 2019, when he reaches the 10-year limit in the role.President Trump announced on Nov. 2 that Fed Governor Jerome Powell will be nominated, subject to Senate confirmation, to replace Chair Janet Yellen when her term expires in February. Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer retired in mid-October. That leaves Trump with three open slots on the seven-seat Board in Washington, plus a fourth if Yellen decides to resign her seat as governor, as is widely expected.""Beyond the chair, the two most important people on the committee are the vice chair and the head of the New York Fed. Now both are unknown,'' said Mark Spindel, the author of a 2017 book about the Fed's relationship with Congress. ""The unwinding of the balance sheet makes that job hugely vital.''The New York Fed chief serves as the vice chairman of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee and has a permanent vote on its decisions. In that influential capacity, Dudley has been a fierce defender of Yellen's gradual approach to raising interest rates and allowing the central bank's $4.5 trillion balance sheet to shrink slowly.The New York Fed's board of directors selects the district bank's president, in consultation with the Fed Board in Washington.Dudley turns 65 next year and has led the New York Fed since January 2009. The bank's oversight of Wall Street gives it an outsized importance relative to the other 11 regional Fed banks. Dudley said in September that Yellen has done a ""fabulous job"" and would be a fine choice for reappointment. Trump had Yellen on his short-list right up until he opted for Powell, who's viewed as likely to keep the central bank on the gradual path of rate hikes that she's sketched out.The FOMC is next scheduled to meet Dec. 12-13, and trading in federal funds futures indicates investors expect the fifth rate increase since it began tightening policy in December 2015.A former chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Dudley was a central figure as the Fed injected unprecedented monetary stimulus in the aftermath of the 2007-2008 financial crisis and the worst recession in decades.Before becoming president, he was in charge of managing open market operations at the New York Fed, which implements FOMC rate decisions. If the bank's directors decide to make another internal appointment that could point to Simon Potter, who currently has that role.Still, the regional bank in the past has also reached beyond the central bank to bring in an outsider. Dudley replaced Timothy Geithner, who worked at the U.S. Treasury and International Monetary Fund before shifting to the Fed. Geithner went on to become President Barack Obama's first treasury secretary.

538,NOV,"Medtronic (MDT) will overcome Hurricane Maria's impact in fiscal 2018, but the maker of medical devices is expected to face growing competition from Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Boston Scientific (BSX) in heart implants, an analyst said Thursday.XIn September, Abbott caught up to Medtronic and Boston, gaining approval for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, or ICD, that allows a patient to undergo an MRI scan if needed. These devices are implanted to help control abnormal heart rhythm.Still, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro says the lower end of Medtronic's full-year forecast in August for 4%-5% sales growth on a constant basis remains realistic. He increased his view for fiscal 2018 to $29.55 billion in sales and adjusted income of $4.74 per share.""The impact of MR-compliant ICDs from Abbott and Boston is another topic of interest as it relates to the second half of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019,"" he said. For Medtronic's fiscal 2019, Novarro forecasts the firm as managing 3% constant-currency growth.Competitive concerns also extend to heart-valve replacements, Novarro said. In early 2018, he sees Boston re-entering the European market with its Lotus Edge product. Boston recalled the device, not approved in the U.S., due to problems with its locking mechanism.IBD'S TAKE: Medtronic has an IBD Composite Rating of 57, meaning it performs in the top half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still falls to No. 54 in the Medical-Products industry group in terms of rankings. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at better-rated medtech players.Despite the mounting competition for its cardiac and vascular group, Novarro sees Medtronic as capable of pulling off its full-year guidance.""We expect management to reaffirm guidance for constant-currency revenue growth and refine guidance further on the (fiscal third-quarter) call,"" he said. ""The only possible change in fiscal 2018 earnings per share guidance will be the impact from Hurricane Maria.""On Tuesday, Medtronic is slated to report its fiscal second-quarter earnings. The consensus expects Medtronic to report adjusted income of 99 cents per share on $6.93 billion in sales. The sales view is below the Medtronic pre-announcement on Nov. 8 for $7.05 billion.Hurricane Maria, which battered Puerto Rico in September, is expected to have a $55 million to $65 million impact on Medtronic's second-quarter sales and to trim adjusted profit by 3 cents. The majority of the impact was on the company's minimally-invasive and restorative-therapies groups.For that reason, Novarro shifted his segment views for Medtronic's second quarter. In the U.S., he sees the diabetes group diving 12% and minimally-invasive therapies losing 1%. He expects flat sales in restorative therapies, partly offset by 4% growth in cardiac and vascular.Internationally, Novarro expects the cardiac and vascular and diabetes groups to grow 8% apiece. He sees the minimally-invasive and restorative-therapies groups growing a respective 6% and 5%. Only the pain-therapies group is expected to decline, by 5%.Medtronic's diabetes group has been plagued recently by a shortage in glucose sensors. Growth in the latter half of fiscal 2018 will come on the backs of new products, Medtronic has said.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Medtronic gained 0.7% to close at 79.26.RELATED:How Electricity Could Replace Opioids In Treating Chronic PainEdwards Lifesciences Crashes After Heart Valve Sales Miss Lofty ViewsDow Component J&J Pops After Topping Views On Pharma Strength

544,NOV,"General Electric's (GE) new boss is shrinking the company and slashing the dividend as he wrestles with one of the biggest slumps in the industrial behemoth's 125-year history.Chief Executive Officer John Flannery is planning to focus on aviation, power, renewable-energy and health-care equipment when he unveils his plan for GE at an investor meeting Monday, said a person familiar with the matter. He's also preparing to exit some other businesses, and cutting the quarterly payout in half -- only the second reduction since the Great Depression.The extraordinary steps underscore the severity of the challenges facing Flannery, who is readying dramatic changes three months after taking the reins from Jeffrey Immelt. GE, plagued by poor cash flow amid slumping markets in power generation and oil-field equipment, is by far the biggest loser on the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year.Flannery already has made changes to top management, sought deep cost cuts and welcomed a representative of activist investor Trian Fund Management to GE's board.GE climbed 1.5% to $20.80 ahead of regular trading New York. The shares fell 35% this year through Nov. 10.The quarterly payout will drop 50% to 12 cents a share, the Boston-based company said in a statement Monday, in a move that will save about $4 billion a year. GE last reduced the dividend in 2009 as it struggled with fallout from the financial crisis.""We understand the importance of this decision to our shareowners and we have not made it lightly,"" Flannery said in the statement. ""We are focused on driving total shareholder return and believe this is the right decision to align our dividend payout to cash flow generation.""GE in October slashed its expectations for 2017 profit and cash flow as Flannery called the company's performance ""completely unacceptable.""Investors have been bracing for a dividend cut as GE's slide deepened in recent weeks. The stock has lost about $100 billion in market value this year even as broader indexes have advanced.The dividend had been recovering from a dramatic 68% cut in 2009, after Immelt for weeks had said the payout was safe. Immelt has called slashing the dividend ""the worst day of my tenure as CEO.""Flannery's plan to refocus the company was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal, which said he plans to sell the company's stake in Baker Hughes (BHGE), a provider of oilfield equipment and services.
"
545,NOV,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) launched to a nearly 17-year high Monday on strong combination data for its immuno-oncology drug combined with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo in skin, kidney and lung cancers.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Nektar soared by more than 14% to close at 37.10, after earlier rising as much as 27.2% to touch a high last seen in January 2001. Meanwhile, Bristol ticked up 0.2% to close at 60.99.The data were presented at the 2017 Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer annual meeting. Nektar's drug, NKTR-214, is designed to grow specific cancer-killing immune system cells and natural killer cell populations in the body to fight cancer.Opdivo is what's known as a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, which works to block specific interactions in the immune system that would prevent an immune response. It competes closely against Dow's Merck (MRK), which makes a rival drug called Keytruda.A total of 38 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase of the trial, dubbed Pivot.IBD'S TAKE: Keep tabs on the earnings season by bookmarking IBD's Investing Action Plan.As of Nov. 2, 63% of never-before-treated patients with advanced melanoma responded to the treatment. Of those, all signs of cancer disappeared in two patients and five had partial responses to the treatment.In never-before-treated kidney cancer patients with at least one baseline scan, responses were seen in 46%, including one complete response and five partial responses. For patients with two or more prior scans, 60% responded to the combination.Among advanced kidney cancer patients who'd already received at least two rounds of prior therapy, a partial response was observed in one of seven.Three of four advanced lung cancer patients responded to the regimen. All signs of cancer disappeared in one patient. The other two patients had partial responses.The most common side effects were low grade — including fatigue, flulike symptoms, rash and itching. There were no grade three or worse side effects at the dose recommended for testing in the continuing Phase 2 trial, Nektar said in a news release.""In the dose-escalation stage of the Pivot trial, we've observed important response rates across all three tumor types,"" said Mary Tagliaferri, senior vice president of clinical development at Nektar. ""All patients with responses in the trial continue on treatment.""Canaccord analyst Arlinda Lee boosted her price target on Nektar to 50 from 35 and kept her buy rating. She expects Nektar to target additional types of cancer using NKTR-214.""In 2018, we expect clinical data for NKTR-214 plus Opdivo in renal cell carcinoma and sarcoma and other solid tumors, as well as potentially NKTR-214 in combination with (Roche's (RHHBY)) Tecentriq and/or Keytruda,"" she said in a note to clients.RELATED:Nektar, Acadia Pop On Street-Crushing Quarters, But Tesaro DipsNektar Rockets To 16-Year High As Analyst Pegs It For SuccessNektar Therapeutics Earns Relative Strength Rating Update; Hits Key Benchmark

546,NOV,"Five Prime Therapeutics (FPRX) continued taking hits Monday after presenting data from a Phase 1 trial of its drug combined with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo in pancreatic cancer patients.XBut at least one analyst says the data have been taken out of context. The combination of Five Prime's cabiralizumab with Bristol's Opdivo resulted in a 13% overall response rate and led to durable responses in patients out to one year.Pancreatic cancer is particularly hard to treat using a drug like Opdivo, which belongs to a class of checkpoint inhibitors that target an interaction involving the PD-1 protein in the immune system to treat cancer, Instinet analyst Christopher Marai said in a note to clients.Marai classified the combination as ""compelling and could become more so on top of chemo."" The presenter ""highlighted the rarity of seeing an (immuno-oncology) combo work in pancreatic cancer, noting thousands of patients have received treatment inside and outside trials with checkpoint inhibitors and have not seen benefit,"" he said.The data were presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer annual meeting. Five Prime first released the abstracts on Nov. 7.Five Prime has taken a beating since releasing the abstracts. By the closing bell on the stock market today, Five Prime sank 10% to close at 25.96. The stock has lost more than a third of its value since releasing the data.Investors are keying in on adverse event data, analysts say. Five Prime and Bristol tested the regimen across multiple tumor types. Across all patients, grade 3-5 adverse events attributed to cabiralizumab occurred in 43%, leading 13% to discontinue treatment.IBD'S TAKE: Could this top-ranking medical stock pop higher on earnings in early December as its shares near a buy point? Head to IBD Stock Analysis for more.But in pancreatic cancer patients, 7% and 13% on the combination and on cabiralizumab alone, respectively, discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Broad safety data were in line with what one would expect from treatment with Opdivo, Marai said.Cabiralizumab has been previously tested in rheumatoid arthritis and a joint disease. The drug proved safe and well-tolerated in those trials, he wrote.Some investors have expressed concern that Five Prime and Bristol only released efficiency data from the regimen in pancreatic cancer, Marai said. But he noted the first segment of the trial to complete enrollment and have mature data was pancreatic cancer.This is ""logical given the high unmet need and poor response to general therapies,"" he said. ""We believe limited disclosure is more a result of the highly competitive nature of the (immuno-oncology) space and Bristol's strategic position, than a lack of positive data.""RELATED:Why This Biotech Crashed Despite Topping Breast Cancer Drug SalesThis Biotech Just Rose By A Third On Its Earnings — But Is It In Trouble?Why Tesaro's $2 Million Cancer-Drug Miss Prompted Its Rivals To Topple

554,NOV,"Wireless-chip maker Qualcomm (QCOM) on Monday rejected an unsolicited acquisition offer by Broadcom (AVGO), saying the proposed $130 billion deal undervalues the company, but Broadcom insists it plans to continue pursuing the merger.XIn a news release, Qualcomm said its board of directors unanimously rejected the Nov. 6 proposal and said it was not in the best interests of shareholders.""It is the board's unanimous belief that Broadcom's proposal significantly undervalues Qualcomm relative to the company's leadership position in mobile technology and our future growth prospects,"" Qualcomm Chairman Paul Jacobs said in the release.The board also believes Broadcom's proposal comes with ""significant regulatory uncertainty,"" meaning it might not pass muster with antitrust authorities.Broadcom responded with its own statement on Monday, saying it remains fully committed to the deal.""We continue to believe our proposal represents the most attractive, value-enhancing alternative available to Qualcomm stockholders and we are encouraged by their reaction,"" Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan said in the statement. ""Many have expressed to us their desire that Qualcomm meet with us to discuss our proposal. It remains our strong preference to engage cooperatively with Qualcomm's board of directors and management team.""Qualcomm shares were up 3% to close at 66.49 on the stock market today. Broadcom ticked up 5 cents to 265.01, still in buy range.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom stock has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. For more analysis on Broadcom and its peers, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf said the company's prospects remain bright.""No company is better positioned in mobile, IoT (internet of things), automotive, edge computing and networking within the semiconductor industry,"" Mollenkopf said in the release. ""We are confident in our ability to create significant additional value for our stockholders as we continue our growth in these attractive segments and lead the transition to 5G (wireless technology).""Broadcom offered to pay $70 in cash and stock for each share of Qualcomm. The deal would consist of $60 in cash and $10 per share in Broadcom shares. The proposed transaction value of $130 billion includes $25 billion of net debt.Broadcom might have to raise the acquisition offer to make it more palatable to Qualcomm shareholders, analysts say.If Broadcom can pull off the acquisition, it would be the largest ever tech deal, dwarfing Dell's $67 billion acquisition of EMC in 2015.The combination of Broadcom and Qualcomm would create the world's third-largest semiconductor maker, behind Intel (INTC) and Samsung.William Blair analyst Anil Doradla said he expects the back-and-forth between Qualcomm and Broadcom to last for a number of months.""We are still in the very early stages of a potential deal, and even if the companies are able to agree on terms, it could be well over a year before the deal receives regulatory approval,"" Doradla said in a note to clients Monday.Regulatory issues are the main sticking point in the deal moving forward, Doradla said.""Qualcomm is clearly using the prospect of regulatory uncertainty to drive a higher offer price,"" he said.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated his ""top pick"" buy rating on Broadcom with a price target of 300. He said Broadcom is committed to its dividend strategy even with its bid to acquire Qualcomm.Qualcomm's rejection of Broadcom's offer sets the stage for a proxy battle that will be decided by shareholders, Daryanani said in a report Monday.""In a proxy fight we believe the debate would be: Can Qualcomm management that has overseen severe underperformance and been unable to resolve key disputes turn the ship or do shareholders put faith in Hock and take the exit? At the right price ($80?) we think investors would choose the Broadcom option,"" Daryanani said. He maintained his outperform rating on Qualcomm with a price target of 70.Qualcomm's recent performance has been hindered by a legal dispute with major customer Apple (AAPL) over patent royalty terms.Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley reiterated his buy rating on Qualcomm and raised his price target to 83 from 76, based on the expectation for a higher buyout price.RELATED:Broadcom Offers To Buy Qualcomm For $130 Billion In Largest Tech Deal Ever

556,NOV,"For years, the talk around China is how the world's most populous country is moving from a manufacturing-heavy base to a consumer-focused economy. The Global X China Consumer ETF (CHIQ) is betting on that long-term trend, having among its top holdings such stock market leaders as Alibaba Group (BABA) and Melco Resorts (MLCO).XThe exchange traded fund owns some of the largest and most recognized consumer brands in China. Many of the 40 stocks in the ETF are traded in Hong Kong or mainland China, but some are well-known names to U.S. investors.Alibaba Group, the giant online retailer and digital media company, is the largest holding, with more than 5% of the fund's weighting. The stock has been a winner, up more than 75% from a 104.67 buy point in February.Casino operator Melco Resorts, online retailer JD.com (JD) and tutoring schools New Oriental Education (EDU) and TAL Education (TAL) also are among the major holdings. Most have performed well in 2017, but some such as TAL are cooling off after huge runs.IBD'S TAKE: Looking for actionable stocks? Check out our Stock Lists page, where you can find stocks near buy zones, stocks hitting new highs, sector leaders, tech leaders, IPO leaders and more.The portfolio is primarily invested in consumer discretionary and staples companies. It's primarily a large-cap fund, with an average capitalization of $23.5 billion.Looking at the most recent economic reports, you might think it's time to tap the brakes on China. GDP growth slowed to 6.8% in Q3 from 7.5% a year earlier, and is well off the peak 15% growth under previous President Hu Jintau.Economic policies introduced in 2015 ""called for a slower pace of growth as the country's economy matures and transitions from a production-oriented focus to a services-based and consumption-oriented economy,"" analysts at Wells Fargo Investment Institute wrote in a report. ""While we expect Chinese economic growth to slow in the coming years, we also anticipate that policymakers will actively utilize credit levers to help cushion the slowdown.""The slowdown has not kept China equities from rallying. The MSCI China index surged nearly 50% from Jan. 1 to the end of October, according to Bloomberg data cited by Global X.Global X's own take on China is that the strongest economic theme is the rising spending power of China's middle class. Jay Jacobs, a Global X analyst, wrote in a Nov. 8 report that holiday and travel sales reflect that growth.China's Singles Day saw $17.8 billion in total sales on Nov. 11 last year, 32% above 2015's figures and six times more than Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined in the U.S.The ETF also appears to be forming a flat base, but still has a way to go before it climbs back to the all-time high of 21.23 seven years ago. The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

OLED displays are seen as superior to LCD screens in color reproduction, refresh rate and power consumption.

He cited multiple catalysts for the stock, including a new multiyear deal with major customer Samsung and the continued ramp up of Apple's iPhone X, and perhaps new OLED iPhones.Plus, Universal Display could get a boost from sampling new blue phosphorescent OLED emitter materials and a partnership to make Organic Vapor Jet Printing equipment, Stone said.RELATED:Universal Display Hits Record High After Analyst DayUniversal Display Surges After Obliterating Third-Quarter Targets

Saudi Arabia's elite were said to be scrambling to shift assets out of the region amid an expanding anti-corruption crackdown that has ensnared dozens of royals and investors. Separately, the kingdom advised its nationals to leave Lebanon, which is in the cross hairs of intensifying tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran.At the same time, stored crude supplies at a key U.S. pipeline hub dropped by more than 1 million barrels, giving further impetus to rising prices.""The news out of Saudi Arabia has really added to that bullish bias to prices,"" Rob Haworth, who helps oversee $150 billion in assets at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle, said by phone.

564,NOV,"Daily or weekly stock chart? That sounds like asking for window or aisle seat, smoking or nonsmoking, fries or no fries with that.XInvestors naturally gravitate to either the weekly or the daily chart in their stock routine. The risk in using only one is that an investor could miss something important. What are some advantages of each chart?Among the weekly chart's strengths:** It covers a longer period than the daily chart, giving a broader perspective. One big psychological benefit: It's easier for shareholders to stay calm when looking at the weekly chart.** Weekly action can smooth out minor noise. If an investor is looking only at daily charts, it's easy to get too focused on moves in the latest 6-1/2-hour session. Worse yet, if an investor gets too focused on daily charts, many are tempted to ""graduate"" to intraday charts.If an investor is looking for a way to mess with his or her own mind, intraday charts are it. Short of electric-shock treatments, few things jar the psyche more intensely than intraday charts.But weekly charts don't carry every advantage. Among the daily chart's strengths:In late October to early November of 2014, Starbucks (SBUX) sketched a handle that was visible only on the daily chart (1).At first glance, the handle might've looked too low for the base, which rested within a larger consolidation. But the math checked out; it passed the midpoint test. The buy point was 77.77, 10 cents above the handle's highest intraday price of 77.67.When the stock cleared the buy point, volume was missing. Disciplined investors would not have bought because of the low volume. But big volume kicked in on Nov. 21 (2), giving investors a chance to buy from 1% to just under 3% above the ideal entry.From the highest price on Nov. 21 to an intraday high of 99.20 on March 19, the stock gained nearly 28% in four months.(A version of this article first appeared in the April 9, 2015, edition of IBD.)IBD's TAKE: Scroll through Investor's Corner archives to beef up your knowledge of the most important sell rules.

575,NOV,"The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose 3.3 points to an eight-month high of 53.6 in November, remaining in optimistic territory for a 14th straight month, but high-earning households stood out as the only group feeling particularly bullish.XAmong households earning more than $75,000, IBD/TIPP's optimism gauge jumped 4.6 points in November to 56.6, firmly above the neutral level of 50. By contrast, households earning less than $30,000 and those with earnings from $50,000 to $75,000 both reflected slight pessimism at 49.5. Modest optimism prevailed among those earning between $30,000 and $50,000, with a 51.3 reading.A surging stock market, a strong job market that has seen unemployment sink to a 17-year low of 4.1%, and Washington's shift to tax cuts from ObamaCare subsidy cuts have all buoyed optimism, but especially among higher earners.The lack of more widespread optimism probably reflects a combination of political division and a prolonged period of tepid wage growth. Still, there's some evidence that wages are perking up, especially among modest-wage earners.Target (TGT) just hiked its minimum wage to $11 from $10 an hour, with a commitment to hit $15 in 2020. Amazon.com (AMZN) has put pressure on other employer to raise wages with its hiring binge, including a one-day spree in August in which it aimed to hire 50,000 people at $12 an hour or more.IBD'S TAKE: The Dow Jones industrial average closed near 23,550 on Monday, up 1,650 points since IBD changed its market trend indicator on Aug. 22 to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a yellow light turning green. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. The Economic Optimism Index is a composite of three major subindexes that track views of near-term economic prospects, the outlook for personal finances over the coming six months, and views of how well government economic policies are working.The gauge of the six-month economic outlook rose 3.1 points to 51.8, bouncing back after weakness in the South after it was battered by hurricanes.The six-month personal financial outlook index climbed 2.1 points to 61.6.The measure of confidence in federal economic policies rebounded 4.5 points to 47.3.

578,NOV,"XPioneer earned 48 cents a share, excluding noncash mark-to-market derivative losses, easily topping Zacks Investment Research views for 30 cents, as revenue climbed 23% to $1.46 billion, better than estimates for $1.14 billion. Production rose 6% to 276,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which includes a 10% increase in oil production to 162,000 barrels a day.The company sees Q4 production of 292,000-302,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and boosted its 2017 capital budget forecast to $2.75 billion from a prior view of $2.7 billion.Over the summer, Pioneer lowed its outlook of how many higher-value oil barrels it would produce in 2017. But at the Oil & Money conference last month, Pioneer said it plans to quadruple production over the next decade thanks to increasing output from Texas.On Wednesday, Pioneer said this 10-year production plan would help keep its spending within cash flow by 2020 at an oil price of $50 per barrel.Laredo Petroleum (LPI) earned 13 cents a share, missing Zacks views by a penny, as revenue jumped 29% to $205.8 million, easily beating views for $183 million. Production increased 17% to 60,011 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and management sees Q4 production ramping up to 61,000-64,000.Laredo increased its 2017 capital budget to $630 million from the previously anticipated $530 million, due to service cost inflation, additional completion optimization testing and data collection.""The efficiencies driven by these investments, coupled with a disciplined capital program, are expected to result in a double-digit oil production growth rate over the next two years, while operating within cash flow by the end of 2019 and enhancing the Company's return on average capital employed,"" said Chairman and CEO Randy Foutch in a statement.Earlier Wednesday, oil prices reversed lower after government data showed U.S. production surged to near-record highs.The Energy Information Administration said domestic production rose to 9.55 million barrels per day (bpd) last week from 9.5 million in the previous week, closing in on the record high of 9.61 million bpd reached in June 2015. Crude stockpiles fell by 2.4 million barrels from the prior week. Gasoline inventories decreased by 4 million barrels. Analysts were expecting a 1.8 million-barrel decline in crude and 1.5 million-barrel drop in gasoline.Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said stockpiles fell by 5.1 million barrels for the week ended Oct. 27, with gasoline stockpiles down by 7.7 million barrels.U.S. crude settled down 0.2% at $54.30 a barrel, and Brent dropped 0.7% to $60.49, after both rose more than 1% earlier.Shares of Pioneer dipped 0.6% in late trading, after closing 2.9% higher at 153.97 on the stock market today. Laredo finished up 2.2% at 12.18.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.Prices had some upward momentum earlier in the day on a Reuters survey that showed OPEC production fell by 80,000 barrels per day to 32.78 million, led by a drop in output from the Kurdish region of northern Iraq.The oil group's compliance with a deal to remove 1.8 million barrels of production from global markets was at 92%, up from 86% in September. The rising compliance seems to indicate that OPEC and Russia will support extending the output deal when they meet on Nov. 30.Nigerian output fell by 70,000 bpd last month, according to the survey, while Libya increased production by 70,000 bpd. Both are exempt from the current output deal.RELATED: Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalExxon To Boost Spending, Add Rigs To Permian; Chevron Cuts Capex ViewShale Earnings: Concho Resources, Devon Energy Beat, Anadarko Misses

580,NOV,"General Electric's (GE) current dividend is a math problem with numbers that are getting harder to add up.XOn Tuesday, Morgan Stanley said the case for a GE dividend cut was bolstered by key insights gleaned from a review of the latest 10-Q regulatory disclosure filed by the company.Analysts found GE had a ""lower than expected unrestricted cash balance"" of $4.7 billion, which excludes money held in countries with tight currency controls, at the end of the third quarter.""This is not a major liquidity concern in itself, since GE has ample lines and avenues of credit. But this amplifies the desirability of a dividend cut, in our view,"" Morgan Stanley equity analyst Nigel Coe and his team wrote in a note to clients.GE stock has an annualized dividend of 96 cents, and the company spends about $8 billion a year to maintain it.On Monday, Fitch Ratings cut its outlook on GE's debt to negative from stable — a warning that a downgrade from a current AA- rating is possible in the next one to two years — and cited the ""high dividend payout"" as a major drag on free cash flow, hinting that a change in the dividend may be coming.""The ratings incorporate expectations for potentially substantial capital deployment for acquisitions over several years, as well as continued high-dividend payouts,"" the ratings agency said. ""These expectations could change depending on the outcome of GE's business review, which could also affect prospects for future debt and leverage.""And last week, after GE cut its cash flow outlook in a dismal quarterly report, Morningstar senior equity analyst Barbara Noverini acknowledged that her previous thesis that GE could maintain its dividend had broken down, citing two key factors:In other words, it became clear as day that new CEO John Flannery's revised cash flow target of $7 billion would fall far short of the $8 billion that GE pays out in dividends, after accounting for capital expenditures and pending pension payments.""While it is possible he can still use asset sales and debt to bridge the near-term shortfall, we've modeled a dividend cut to 65 cents in 2018,"" Noverini added.GE shares fell 0.7% to 20.02 on the stock market today, extending their losing streak to eight straight trading days.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.In the past, GE consistently maintained that its dividend was a top priority. But Flannery has warned there are ""no sacred cows"" as he puts every aspect of the conglomerate's operations under scrutiny.Flannery is set to share his longer-term vision for GE, as well as announce the fate of its prized dividend, at an investor conference on Nov. 13.Fitch cautioned Monday that ""there are execution risks associated with implementing any changes to the company's strategy and organization that may come out of its comprehensive business review.""And despite the actions that GE has already undertaken to streamline its vast portfolio of businesses, and cut costs, Fitch sees the timeline to better financial results as uncertain.RELATED:GE CEO Looks To Microsoft To Boost Digital Industrial EffortsGE Under Pressure To Cut Dividend After Slashing Cash Flow OutlookDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And Analysis

Analysts predict an 8% per-share profit gain to 53 cents, with sales dipping 1% to $255 million. But Lumentum's outlook and commentary about 3D sensor demand may be more important.Shares reversed lower to close down 2.5% to 63.17 on Tuesday, but that's after running up nearly 16% from Oct. 20 to Oct. 30. Lumentum has a potential cup-base buy point of 68.73.The chipmaker reports after the market close Wednesday. Analysts expect a 12% EPS gain to $1.44, with revenue declining for a second straight quarter, off 6% to $811 million. Qorvo has a cup-with-handle buy point of 76.57. For a second straight session, Qorvo crossed that entry intraday, but closed below it, falling 0.6% to 75.81 on Tuesday.Even if Lumentum and Qorvo have good results and guidance and stocks acted well, there's still the little issue of Apple's earnings out late Thursday. The iPhone X officially goes on sale Friday, which means there will be teardowns that reveal which Apple suppliers are winners and losers.Meanwhile, Broadcom and Skyworks extended Monday's breakouts, but are still in buy range.Universal Display, which makes key technology for OLED screens, rose 5.7% on Tuesday to 146.50, clearing a 145.40 entry. Universal Display is not a direct Apple supplier, but the iPhone X does use an OLED screen. Samsung Electronics said Tuesday that OLED demand is strong, while initial iPhone X reviews were positive.Universal Display reports earnings on Thursday, Skyworks is out Nov. 6, while Broadcom is several weeks away.Apple rose 1.4% to 169.04 on Tuesday, just beyond the 5% chase zone from a 160.97 entry cleared Friday.RELATED:The Big Picture: Indexes Cap October With Halloween TreatUniversal Display Breaks Out After Samsung Earnings ReportApple Gets Price-Target Hike After Notching Record HighElectronic Arts Guides To Holiday Sales Below Views

612,NOV,"Riskier credit sectors once again outpaced government bonds in October as interest rates rose on the back of a strong economy and despite mild inflation readings.XRates across the board ticked up, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury note finishing the month at 2.38%, up five basis points. The economy continued its expansionary path as several readings came in strong, such as consumer spending, consumer confidence and construction spending. However, core inflation at 1.3% remained well below the Fed's target of 2%.Taxable general domestic bond funds rose an average of 0.29% in October, while U.S. diversified equity funds advanced 1.7%, according to preliminary Lipper Inc. data.Income-generating funds showed the best performance, with loan participation, multisector income and flexible income funds gaining 0.56%, 0.27% and 0.42%, respectively, during the month. They're up 3.08%, 5.6% and 8.4% year to date.Government-debt-related funds all declined in October. General U.S. Treasury funds shed 0.15%, GNMA funds 0.08% and U.S. mortgage funds 0.03%. Spreads tightened during the month, resulting in a positive return of 0.35% for high-yield funds, and 0.23% and 0.3% for A and BBB rated corporate debt funds.""The major theme has been the potential for tax cuts and with that, the potential for better growth in the economy, which has led to slightly higher rates, tighter credit spreads and equities at record highs,"" said John Bredemus, head of capital markets at Allianz Investment Management. ""On the other side of that is this continued low-inflation environment.""Non-U.S. bond mutual funds also posted losses in October. Emerging-market local-currency ones dropped 2.22%, trimming their yearly gain to 10.49%. Hard-currency ones only ticked down 0.1% as the dollar strengthened a bit, topping off their year-to-date return at 9.7%. International income funds fell 0.42% for a yearly gain of 6.62%.""There is something we haven't seen since 2010, when the world was coming back from that bad recession of 2008-2009, and that is synchronized growth,"" said James Swanson, chief investment strategist at MFS Investment Management and lead portfolio manager of MFS Diversified Income fund (DIFAX). ""We really haven't seen the eurozone, Japan, the emerging-market countries and the U.S. doing this well all at the same time. And growth is associated with higher interest rates.""The Bank of England raised its benchmark interest rate to 0.5% from 0.25% on Nov. 2, the first increase in over a decade, but signaled that further rate increases will be very gradual. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank has agreed to further slow its bond buying from 60 billion to 30 billion euros per month starting in January as the eurozone is experiencing its fastest growth since the debt crisis 10 years ago.So, with global economic growth firing on all cylinders, what could derail the current state of capital markets?""Central bank policy is the most often cited reason that the market would turn down,"" said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide. ""Currently, the Fed and ECB are patient, but a significant upturn in inflation could change things. Inflation across the globe has picked up, but is not yet cause for caution. It needs to be closely watched, though.""MFS' Swanson expects the yield curve to further flatten and growth to slow down somewhat in 2018. But the baby boomer demographics call for higher demand for fixed-income assets, which should be supportive of bonds globally. ""So I'm not worried about a bond blowout, but in the near term, short-term rates have further to go up,"" noted Swanson.He favors the seven-to-10-year part of the yield curve for government bonds, which he recommends owning for safety. ""I don't think you make money; I think you just collect your coupon on that,"" he said.Within fixed income, he likes high-grade investment-grade corporate bonds, mostly in the U.S. He believes they are a nice alternative to equities, which are very expensive now. He's not in favor of high yield, primarily due to the lower quality and low compensation for the extra risk.""It can be a volatile market,"" he said of high yield. ""If we go into a recession, that market on average goes down 26%, and that's a bond market. So, I don't think that's a safe place to be right now.""Within investment grade, he likes energy and health care. He's also constructive on select structured products such as collateralized mortgage obligations, asset-backed bonds and collateralized loan obligations, where he says one can find pockets of opportunity. Due to the long duration of Treasury inflation-protected securities, Swanson is slightly underweight TIPS as those securities will be hurt as rates rise.Municipal bond funds ended October with flat to slightly negative returns. Swanson believes munis are still a good alternative to taxable bonds for people in high tax brackets as they provide similar yields. ""The key to the muni market is being selective, because there are some very bad credits when you look at state GO's within the U.S. or individual project-type deals — some of them are very risky.""RELATED:Read The Bond Mutual Fund Roundup For September And The Third QuarterYou Need This Much Retirement Income At Your Age And Income

619,NOV,"While Apple (AAPL) publicly dismisses the notion of coming out with augmented-reality glasses anytime soon, the company is working feverishly to have an AR headset ready in 2019 and for sale the following year, Bloomberg reported Wednesday.Apple sees the AR headset as a successor to the iPhone, the report said.""The development timeline is very aggressive and could still change,"" Bloomberg writer Mark Gurman noted, citing anonymous sources familiar with the project.Apple's AR headset faces a host of challenges, including the development of a custom chip, operating system and display, and dealing with limited battery life.Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook recently told British Vogue that the technology for augmented-reality glasses isn't ready yet.""There are rumors and gossip about companies working on that, and we obviously don't talk about what we work on. But today I can tell you that the technology itself doesn't exist to do that in a quality way,"" Cook told Vogue. ""We don't (care) about being first; we want to be best in creating people's experiences. Something that you would see out in the market anytime soon would not be something that any of us would be satisfied with.""Cook has repeatedly said that he thinks augmented reality will be a revolutionary technology. Apple has infused its latest smartphones with augmented-reality capabilities and released software development tools called the AR Kit to spur development of apps.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base at a buy point of 160.97 on Oct. 27. For more analysis on Apple stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Augmented reality overlays images and other data in a person's field of vision. AR on smartphones is seen as a first step toward consumer adoption of the technology. AR apps on the iPhone overlay information on what the camera sees and presents it on the handset's display.Other companies working on augmented-reality glasses include Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google, Microsoft (MSFT), Vuzix (VUZI), Osterhout Design Group, Meta and Magic Leap.Since the release of Apple's iOS 11 mobile operating system on Sept. 19, over 1,000 AR apps have been approved for the iPhone and iPad.""We're already seeing things that will transform the way you work, play, connect and learn,"" Cook said on a Nov. 3 conference call with analysts. ""For example, there are AR apps that let you interact with virtual models of everything you can imagine, from the human body to the solar system.""""And of course you experience them like they're really there,"" Cook went on to say. ""Instantly, education becomes much more powerful when every subject comes to life in 3D. And imagine shopping when you can place an object in your living room before you make a purchase, or attending live sporting events when you can see the stats on the field.

628,NOV,"Before you travel a long way, you make a checklist of what to do. You pack clothes. Ask your neighbor to collect your mail. Lock all the doors. Then finally you go. By checking everything off your ""to do"" list, you eliminate many unnecessary bumps along the way.XAdopt a similar mindset when you prepare an ""investing trip"" with a growth stock.With IBD's research tools, you can quickly build a watch list of potential market stars. But your work doesn't end there. To raise the probability of notching a 20% winner here and a 200% screamer there, you need to devote time to identifying those stocks that already show signs of strength.A price base serves at least two vital functions. One, it marks the beginning of a resting phase for a stock that has already moved sharply higher. This rest period can last as little as four weeks or as long as 65 weeks or even longer. The base gives big investors a chance to pick up shares as others unload their shares to cash in gains.Once the herd of desperate sellers has dispersed, a new crowd of hungry buyers sends the stock catapulting to a new advance.Whether you're a brand-new IBD reader or a veteran CAN SLIM stock hunter, you can always benefit from this checklist to help you sort among your stock candidates and increase your profit potential.Look for weeks in which shares rose in heavy volume. On a daily chart, gap-ups in strong volume are a plus. A cup should in most cases show a decline of no more than 33% to 35%. Flat bases and square boxes have a dip of less than 15%.Amgen (AMGN) passed this checklist in the early 1990s. From March 1987 through part of 1989, the young biotech's stock moved like a sitting duck. But from August 1989, the stock ramped up 61% from 37.50 to 60.25 (before a 2-for-1 split in August 1990).It faded in November, starting a 16-week double-bottom base. It fell 29% from the base's high to low. So far, so good.Amgen rallied past its 55.60 buy point (pre-split) in February (1), then formed a handle. The handle wasn't perfect, but volume was dry as sand. The stock also held up near its high. The time to buy: when Amgen eclipsed the handle's high of 59.50 the week ended March 16, 1990 (2). It boasted a 94 EPS Rating and an 89 RS.The stock gained 113% by year's end.(A version of this column originally ran in the Nov. 16, 2010, edition of IBD.)RELATED:Can You Spot Major Market Peaks?

The Redwood City, Calif.-based company earned an adjusted 62 cents a share, up 17% year over year, on adjusted sales of $1.18 billion, up 7%. Analysts expected 54 cents and $1.18 billion.""We believe management is trying to keep estimates conservative ahead of the launch of 'Star Wars Battlefront 2' on Nov. 17,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said in a note to clients. ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" is EA's big holiday game release, but scuttlebutt on the title has been mixed.IBD'S TAKE: Electronic Arts has an IBD Composite Rating of 98, meaning it has outperformed 98% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more analysis of EA stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Olson reiterated his overweight rating on EA stock and raised his price target to 130 from 128.Jefferies analyst Timothy O'Shea raised his price target on EA to 138 from 135 and kept his buy rating.""Key holiday launch 'Star Wars Battlefront 2' is the biggest swing factor for fiscal 2018,"" O'Shea said in a report. ""If Star Wars can encourage users to spend real money on virtual goods (like FIFA) the game could drive meaningful upside to fiscal 2018 and 2019 EPS, but this is not a certainty. Looking past the holidays we remain bullish as EA is benefiting from a multitude of powerful tailwinds including more in-game spending, more downloads, and more mobile.""Stifel analyst Drew Crum was satisfied with EA's earnings report. He maintained his buy rating and price target of 127.""Overall we thought this was another solid update for EA, reaffirming our positive stance on the shares,"" he said in a report.Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz also liked what he saw and kept his outperform rating and price target of 130 on the stock.""Management took a positive tone and highlighted strength from its sports titles (FIFA and Madden) and encouraging user engagement trends,"" Uerkwitz said in a report.Other analysts were unconvinced.CFRA analyst Scott Kessler reiterated his sell rating on EA, but upped his price target to 108 from 106.""We see considerable competition and an excessive valuation,"" he said in a note.Elsewhere in the video game sector, Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) received a price-target hike. Brokerage Stifel upped its target on Take-Two to 122 from 105 and kept its buy rating.Take-Two is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter results after the market close Nov. 7. The game publisher is likely to get a boost from sales of ""NBA 2K18"" and ""Grand Theft Auto,"" he said.Take-Two shares slipped by 9 cents to finish at 110.56.RELATED:Electronic Arts Guides To Holiday Sales Below ViewsTake-Two Scores New High On Price-Target Hike; NetEase Downgraded

634,NOV,"Analysts tore into Snapchat-owner Snap (SNAP) Wednesday after a third-quarter earnings report that missed estimates on many metrics, cutting their price targets on shares but holding mixed views on Tencent Holdings' (TCEHY) move to get a 12% stake in the social media firm.XSnap shares plummeted 14.6% to close at 12.91 on the stock market today. After the market close Tuesday, Snap reported third-quarter results that missed revenue estimates by a wide margin, while its chief executive acknowledged complaints that Snapchat is ""hard to use."" The amount of daily active users Snap reported also fell short of views.""Snap, Crackle, Flop"" was the title UBS analyst Eric Sheridan gave his research note to clients Wednesday, as he was among those who gave the harshest reviews. Sheridan lowered his rating on Snap to sell from neutral and dropped his price target to 7 from 12.With the first two quarters as a public company, Sheridan framed Snap's disappointing results as ""growing pains,"" with debates around growth in users and its ad business left unsolved.""While many of those questions remain unanswered after a third earnings report, it is now very likely that Snap will continue to struggle on multiple fronts in the coming 12 months,"" Sheridan wrote.Others cutting their price targets included RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney, who went to 15 from 20 and lowered his rating to sector perform from outperform. Cowen analyst John Blackledge cut his target to 12 from 14, with a market perform rating. And Credit Suisse analyst Steven Ju cut his target to 17 from 20, saying Snap turned in ""another messy quarter.""With its quarterly results, though, Snap announced that Tencent and its affiliates had acquired about 146 million shares of nonvoting Class A common stock via open market purchases. Tencent is one of China's largest internet companies and is the leading provider of messaging services with its WeChat app.Piper Jaffray analyst Sam Kemp in a note to clients said Tencent's purchase was not a ""thesis changer"" for several reasons.""We do not believe that Tencent would be able to acquire Snapchat as the result of Snap's capital structure (95% of voting rights being owned by the co-founders),"" Kemp wrote. He maintained a neutral rating on Snap and price target of 12.50.FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi held a different view on the Tencent deal.""Although this is understood to be a passive stake, Tencent could increase its stake materially in the future,"" such as what Tencent did with the gradual acquisition of Riot Games, he wrote in his morning note.Seyrafi added that Facebook (FB) might also now be interested in taking a closer look at Snap. Prior to Snap coming public, Facebook twice made an acquisition offer, according to reports.IBD'S TAKE: After going public in March, Snap shares have declined generally, struggling in the face of competition from Facebook. Shares reached a peak of 29.44 on Snap's second day of trading and have dropped ever since. Snap is ranked 30th in IBD's Internet-Content Group. Seyrafi thinks Facebook could become interested in acquiring Snap now that shares have fallen below $14. Seyrafi previously said that's the threshold by which Facebook could be interested in a deal.""Now that Facebook has, in effect, made Snap 'cry uncle' by acquiring many of the latter's innovative features, Snap could be more amenable to a deal with Facebook, Tencent, or another company that wants to increase its social media presence,"" Seyrafi wrote. He reiterated a sector perform on Snap and price target of 15.Facebook reported third-quarter results on Nov. 1 that topped earnings and revenue estimates by a wide margin.GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives maintained a rating of attractive on Snap but lowered his price target to 18 from 17. Tencent's investment shows ""there is clear, inherent value in the company's 180 million daily active users, strong engagement numbers, and growing international social media platform,"" Ives wrote in a research note to clients.""While it would have been easy to throw in the white towel this morning after a disastrous third-quarter earnings report, we believe Snap will be able to ultimately get through this painful transition phase and exit a healthier platform,"" Ives wrote.RELATED:Tencent Buys 12% Of Snap, But It Doesn't Help Snapchat ParentFacebook, Snap Get Positive Reviews As Price Targets RaisedSnap Downgraded, Price Target Cut As Growth Concerns Continue

641,NOV,"Large and megacap stocks mostly continued to hold firm amid another whirlwind day of quarterly results. Tesla (TSLA) led the downside among companies reporting as the innovative electric vehicle maker likely posted its biggest quarterly net loss on a per-share basis since it came public in June 2010.XTesla gapped down at the open and slid more than 7% to 297.85. Volume is running nearly four times the usual pace; the big cap trades on average 5.42 million shares each day.Meanwhile, all eyes are on Apple (AAPL) as it reports fiscal fourth-quarter results after the close.The stock is behaving well since clearing a new buy point in a decent cup with handle. The classic chart pattern shows a 160.87 buy point. Apple's cup with handle formed next to a flat base created from May to July. The buy point from that base was 156.75, and Apple, currently at 168.43, has lifted 7% above that correct entry. It is less than 5% from the 160.87 entry.The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 0.4%, despite a nearly 2% sell-off in Home Depot (HD). The stock is getting buying support, however, at the 50-day moving average. Home improvement chains fell on reports that President Trump and the GOP are mulling the idea of reducing the mortgage interest deduction from taxes.Eight of the 30 Dow Jones industrial average components rose 1 point or more, including industrial plays 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX) as well as consumer spending bellwethers such as McDonald's (MCD).At 3:45pm ET, the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 edged slightly up. The Russell 2000 rose nearly 0.3%.Going back to Tesla, the stock posted a critical sell signal when it fell 7% below a recent breakout past a 370.10 entry in a cup with handle of its own. That base began forming when Tesla peaked at 386.99 on June 23.While that base had a normal-sized decline of 22% from head to toe, one problem with the base was that it revealed numerous sharp declines, including gap downs, in heavy or increasing volume. That's a no-no; you'd prefer a stock to show quiet, smooth price action on a day to day and week to week basis.Those who bought at Tesla's breakout in the spring of 2013 near 50 still hold a very large profit cushion and can afford to hold patiently. The stock is 23% off its 52-week peak of 389.61, and that is not severe.However, two more reasons for newer shareholders to sell include the following:One, the stock is now on the verge of forming a deeper, longer base. It's going to take a while before Tesla will set up again. Keeping shares means that you lose the opportunity to invest in a stock that currently shows more horsepower.Two, Tesla failed to deliver on its promise to rapidly ramp up production and deliveries of its Model 3, its most affordable e-vehicle yet. Now, the company must deliberately slow down production in its highly successful Model S to meet already huge demand for the Model 3. Continued failure to manage institutional investors' expectations and beat them may result in heavier selling among fund managers.Tesla's third-quarter revenue rose 30% to $2.98 billion, which is a quarterly record. However, that gain also represents a deceleration in the top-line growth rate. Sales grew 27%, 22%, 33%, 145%, 88%, 135% and 120% vs. year-ago levels in the prior seven quarters.Elsewhere, Sony (SNE) jacked up more than 3% to 44.91 in heavy turnover, extending its breakout out of a three-month flat base with a 41.75 entry. The base also has elements of a double bottom. From that perspective, the buy point was 40.59, 10 cents above the middle peak within the shallow base.Despite the breakaway gap on Tuesday, one could try to buy as close as possible to that session's opening price of 43.21 because that price was within the proper buy range, up to 5% past the 41.75 flat-base entry.Sony, one of Japan's most famous manufacturers and innovator in the video game space, reported a huge increase in adjusted Q3 profit (90 cents a share vs. 4 cents a year ago) as revenue climbed 10% to $18.3 billion, the biggest year-over-year increase in at least four years.Sony has helped Japan's Nikkei 225 enjoy strong gains in 2017. The Japanese equities benchmark finished 0.5% to 22,539 overnight, extending its year-to-date gain to 17.9%.At 2579, the S&P 500 is up 15.2% since Jan. 1.Returning to Apple, watch to see if the company can not only post another quarter of respectable double-digit earnings growth but also give hints as to whether business can accelerate during the holiday quarter and beyond.Earnings had dropped 10% in the fiscal year ended in September 2016, on an 8% slump in revenue. However, Apple has been staging a classic turnaround in fundamentals lately.In the past three quarters, the iMac maker's earnings rose 2%, 11% and 18% vs. year-ago levels, following a three-quarter slump. And in Q4 (ended in September), earnings are seen increasing 12% to $1.87 a share, which would mark a third quarter in a row of mild double-digit gains. It's slated to report Q4 results on Nov. 2 after the market close.For fiscal year 2019, the Street sees earnings accelerating 24% to $11.16 a share.Another positive for Apple shareholders: a respectable annualized dividend yield of 1.5%, with plenty of potential for  further increases in that cash payout. Apple tends to raise its dividend in the spring. But William O'Neil + Co. calculates that the company has a long-term annual dividend growth rate of 24% in recent years.Apple, featured in Stock Market Today columns frequently as it formed a bottoming base in the last quarter of 2016, has risen more than 43% since breaking out of a first-stage cup with handle on Jan. 6-9 at 118.12.In other financial markets, traders bought U.S. government bonds, pushing yields a touch lower following news that the Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in a decade. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond is at 2.35%. President Trump, meanwhile, formally announced he's picked Jerome Powell to replace Janet Yellen as the head of the Federal Reserve.RELATED:Finding Superb Market Outperformers: Inside IBD 50Still The Golden Rule Of SellingWhat Does A Great Cup With Handle Look Like, And Why Does It Make Money For Traders?How To Invest: Use A Stock Checklist, Boost Your Portfolio ReturnHow To Find Excellent Stocks With Investors.com: Start Here

681,NOV,"A respected Apple (AAPL) analyst thinks the company will have shipped only 2 million to 3 million units of its highly anticipated iPhone X smartphone for its global launch on Nov. 3.KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo made the estimate in a report Friday, according to Apple news website 9to5Mac.""Given that Apple usually sells more than 10 million phones in opening weekend sales alone, availability of just 2-3 million units for the launch is unlikely to satisfy customer demand for iPhone X,"" 9to5Mac writer Benjamin Mayo wrote. ""As such, be prepared for the Apple Store to quickly go out of stock when the devices go up for sale.""Apple's contract manufacturers have dealt with several problems while trying to build the premium handset, Kuo said. First, production was postponed when Apple tried unsuccessfully to integrate a fingerprint reader into the device's screen.Then it dealt with a shortage of 3D scanners used for the facial-recognition security feature, because of low production yields. Those issues have been previously reported, but Kuo revealed two other component-related production snags on Friday.Apple also is dealing with supply shortages of circuit boards for the iPhone X antenna and wide-angle camera, he said.The ""biggest hurdle"" is the flexible printed circuit board for the phone's antenna, Kuo said. An initial suppler failed to pass Apple's tests and a second supplier has had to ramp up production, he said. The wide-angle camera circuit board is considered the next biggest bottleneck, Kuo said.Kuo cut his fourth-quarter shipment estimates to a range of 25 million to 30 million iPhone X units, down from 30 million to 35 million. But he believes that iPhone X production will quickly rise in the first quarter of 2018.Apple stock ticked up 0.2% to close at 156.25 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has been forming a flat base with a buy point of 165.04 for the past seven weeks.

The device's price starts at $999.The iPhone X, pronounced ""ten"" as in the Roman numeral, is Apple's 10th-anniversary smartphone. It features a 5.8-inch OLED display, facial-recognition technology, wireless charging, improved cameras, faster processors and a new handset design with no physical home button to interrupt the screen.Nomura Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal on Friday lowered his iPhone X estimates for the December quarter because of production bottlenecks.""We believe iPhone X production is 5 million to 10 million units below plan"" for the December quarter, which is Apple's fiscal first quarter, Kvaal said.He cut his iPhone sales estimates for the December quarter by 5 million units and raised his March quarter estimates by the same number. Kvaal believes Apple customers will wait for the new phone and won't defect to makers of Android phones such as Samsung.""We believe bottlenecks in 3D-sensing modules are improving, if not fast enough to meet Apple's production plans for the iPhone X,"" Kvaal said. ""We shift 5 million units from fiscal Q1 into fiscal Q2.""He now thinks Apple will sell 20 million units of the iPhone X in its fiscal first quarter, accounting for 24% of total iPhone sales in the period.RELATED:Apple Stock Falls On 'Anemic' iPhone 8 Demand, Production CutsApple iPhone X Production Finally Ramping Up, Easing Concerns

688,NOV,"Futures for the S&P 500 index fell modestly Monday morning, pulling back modestly after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite jumped to record highs on Friday.XApple (AAPL) on Friday powered above a buy point, along with several other big-cap techs. Meanwhile, Broadcom (AVGO), Lumentum (LITE), Universal Display (OLED), Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) — all Apple iPhone suppliers or iPhone-related plays — are closing on their own buy points.Apple reports earnings on Nov. 2. Lumentum, Universal Display and Qorvo also have earnings this week. In many of these cases, the Relative Strength lines have lagged somewhat over the last several weeks, reflecting their sideways action while the S&P 500 index advances to new record highs.S&P 500 and Dow futures fell more than 0.2% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were flat vs. fair value.Apple shot up 3.6% to 163.05 on Friday, breaking out of shallow cup-with-handle base with a 160.97 entry. Along with a generally surging tech sector, Apple also kicked off preorders for the iPhoneX, which quickly sold out due to high demand and thin supplies.Apple is expected to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.86, up 11%, with revenue rising 9% to $51.17 billion.Wall Street sees EPS rising 11% to $1.86 on sales of $51.17 billion in the September quarter, up 9%. But analysts and investors may be more interested in iPhone 8 demand and iPhone X supplies heading into the holiday season.The iPhone X officially goes on sale on Nov. 3, with prices ranging from $999 to $1,149. Within hours, there will be iPhone X teardowns that reveal which companies have chips and other components in the handset, and whether or not they have a larger or smaller share than in prior iPhone models.When Apple broke out in early August, the lack of iPhone suppliers successfully following suit was notable. Ultimately, Apple retreated below its old 156.75 buy point. While that breakout didn't officially fail, Apple did form a new base next to the old one. So will Apple suppliers follow the iPhone maker this time?IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. IBD discussed how to use call options for Apple in the latest Earnings Preview column.Broadcom is in a flat base with a buy point of 259.46. The chipmaker tried to break out in late July and late August, but those quickly faltered. On Friday, the stock rose 3.7% to 252.87, rebounding above its 50-day moving average in strong volume.Broadcom won't report its latest earnings for several weeks.Lumentum is a fiber-optic components maker. But it's also a presumed supplier of 3D sensors for the Apple iPhone X. The iPhone X uses 3D sensors for a facial recognition app that unlocks screens.The company reports fiscal first-quarter earnings before the market open on Wednesday, Nov. 1. Analysts predict an 8% per-share profit gain to 53 cents, with sales dipping 1% to $255 million. But investors may be more interested in Lumentum's outlook and the prospects for a big rise in demand related to the Apple iPhone X, even if that's not specifically cited.Lumentum shares are in a cup base with a current potential buy point of 68.73. The stock spiked nearly 12% to 62.60, rebounding from its 50-day line, amid signs that Lumentum may get a big benefit from Apple.Universal Display supplies OLED technology and materials. OLED screens are in the iPhone X and some other high-end smartphones from Samsung and others.Universal Display reports after the market close on Thursday, Nov. 2. Wall Street expects EPS of 12 cents, reversing a year-earlier loss of 3 cents a share. Sales are seen rising 56% to $47.1 million in the September quarter.Universal Display, a member of the IBD 50 index, is in a flat base-on-base with a 145.40 buy point.The current consolidation is just above a double-bottom pattern. Universal Display cleared that 127.88 buy point in early September, moving to 145.30 in a couple of weeks. But then the stock reversed, erasing a near-14% gain and then some.

691,NOV,"GE Digital, General Electric's (GE) young and fast-growing industrial software unit, has made several key purchases recently to bulk up on artificial intelligence, the cloud and other areas, but investments look to max out this year.XSome of the acquisitions include two machine-learning and AI specialists, Bit Stew Systems and Wise.io; a provider of cloud-based field service management software, ServiceMax; and a provider of asset performance management software, Meridium.The deals come as GE overall now looks to slash $2 billion in costs and shed $20 billion in assets in the next couple of years. But even before the shake-up was announced earlier this month, GE Digital was planning to slow investments in the industrial Internet of Things.""We had been advertising for some time, well before any management changes, that this will be a peak investment year. And it's turning out to be a peak investment year,"" Khozema Shipchandler, VP and CFO of GE Digital, told Investor's Business Daily on the sidelines of last week's Minds + Machines event in San Francisco.This year GE expects to invest roughly $1.3 billion in Predix — its software platform for connecting industrial equipment to cloud-based technologies — and related applications.While GE is seeing ""hypergrowth"" in many industries it serves and is scaling up rapidly, the company no longer has to develop applications from scratch, Shipchandler said.""It's less about developing brand-new software,"" he said. ""It's now about taking what we have got and adding features and functionalities to it year-on-year. So that's the principal reason our investment trajectory will come down a little bit.""Shares of the Dow component was down 1.2% at 20.16 on the stock market today, their seventh consecutive drop. The stock is down 36% year-to-date vs. an 18% gain for the Dow Jones industrial average as a whole.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Yet investors seem largely skeptical that GE's emerging digital strategy can profoundly change the outlook for the company, which recently slashed its overall cash flow and profit outlook for 2017.And in August, GE trimmed its 2020 revenue target for GE Digital to $12 billion from an earlier target of $15 billion, though Shipchandler said GE Digital has piled up $1.1 billion in Predix purchase orders so far this year, double the volume seen for all of 2016 and hitting its end-of-2017 target ahead of schedule.While the future structure of GE remains to be seen, CEO John Flannery affirmed at the Minds + Machines event last week that digital growth is critical to the survival of both GE and the industrial companies it calls its customers.""It's fundamentally an existential issue for the industrial world,"" Flannery said at the Oct. 25 event, ahead of his highly awaited Nov. 13 strategic update to investors. ""It's no longer enough to build incredible machines. The company that just builds machines will not survive.""RELATED:GE Must Walk This Fine Line With Amazon, Microsoft, Tech GiantsGE CEO Looks To Microsoft To Boost Digital Industrial EffortsGE Under Pressure To Cut Dividend After Slashing Cash Flow Outlook

The iPhone X uses 3D sensors for a facial recognition app that unlocks screens. Germany's AMS on Monday reported September quarter revenue that missed expectations but its current quarter outlook was above views.Lumentum is expected to report fiscal first-quarter 2018 earnings on Nov. 1. On its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call, Lumentum said it has received $200 million in orders for 3D sensors for calendar year 2017, primarily from one customer that is presumed to be Apple.""With AMS' Q4 revenue strength being attributed to its 3D sensing business and its ramp with a major OEM (we believe Apple), and with the Q4 guidance beat overshadowing the Q3 revenue miss, we see AMS' results as a positive read-through for vendors supplying into 3D sensing,"" said Patrick Newton, a Stifel analyst in a report.

700,NOV,"SAN FRANCISCO — General Electric (GE) Chairman and CEO John Flannery promised Wednesday to boost partnerships for the company's ""digital industrial"" efforts, even as he prioritizes resources on its established segments such as energy, aviation and health care.XAt the Minds + Machines conference, he introduced some of the companies that GE is partnering with to speed the adoption of its Predix industrial Internet of Things platform, including Microsoft (MSFT).""Digital technology is not new in these industries but the thing that is different this time is it's not just a system of record, or tracking something,"" said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.Instead, he added, platforms like Predix are transforming industry because digitization ""doesn't stop at the (physical) asset. Even field operations are digitized.""Predix installs sensors and software solutions on industrial assets, and then connects them to the internet through the cloud, to extract insights from the vast quantities of data coming out of those machines and equipment.GE and Microsoft formed a partnership last year to bring Predix to the Microsoft Azure cloud, allowing GE's industrial customers to access additional capabilities such as natural language technology, artificial intelligence and advanced data visualization.The two companies announced Wednesday that starting Nov. 30, Predix customers and developers will be able to build powerful industrial apps on Azure. The Predix-Azure combination will kick off in North America and expand to additional markets next year.Wednesday's remarks come amid deep bearishness over GE's stock, which has plunged more than 30% this year as investors question the company's ability to turnaround cash flows and maintain its dividend. Shares lost another 1.8% on the stock market today, closing at 4-1/2-year low of 21.50. Microsoft dipped 0.3%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Next month, Flannery is expected to lay out a new strategy that includes thousands of layoffs. He has already signaled more than $2 billion in cost cuts next year, double a prior target, as well as some $20 billion in asset sales in the next few years.Digital initiatives could be a necessary growth driver for a struggling industrial sector. Industrial productivity has been flat for the past five years.On Wednesday, Flannery described the company's Predix platform as a game changer for the industrial sector and warned that a company that just builds machines will not survive.""We are all in, in terms of digital,"" Flannery, who took over as chief in August, said. ""Predix allows us to go from data to analysis to action to outcome.""Flannery said GE is seeing 100% growth in Predix orders year over year, with more than 1,000 customers in over 85 countries and 10% of the world's power generation running through Predix applications.Qantas airlines, a GE customer, used Predix-powered apps to save 30 million kilograms of fuels, Flannery said.RELATED:GE Under Pressure To Cut Dividend After Slashing Cash Flow OutlookGeneral Electric Trims 'Digital Revenue' Targets, May Sell Predix StakeLike GE, This Industrial Rival Is Also Planning Thousands Of Layoffs

723,NOV,"LAS VEGAS — Uber is getting into the credit card business, and while the card-perk space is crowded, the tech unicorn isn't messing around with this new financial product.XThe Uber Visa (V) Card, launching with partner Barclays (BCS) on Nov. 2, has no annual fee, integrates directly with the Uber app and boasts tons of perks — all with the on-the-go customer in mind.""The rewards are great, but the experience is just a seamless extension of how (cardholders) already use Uber,"" Denny Nealon, head of U.S. partnerships at Barclays, told Investor's Business Daily at Money20/20 this week. ""It's probably one of the most modern payment functionalities that's going to be out in the market.""Here's some of what a customer can receive:But wait, there's more: Mobile phone insurance of up to $600 (when the card is used to pay the monthly phone bill) plus up to a $50 credit for online subscription services — think Amazon (AMZN) Prime, Netflix (NFLX), Spotify and more — after spending $5,000 on the card per year.""We want to connect more to the online and offline worlds and what people do outside of Uber, when they actually get out of the car,"" Drew Quinn, financial products manager at Uber, told IBD. ""This is the first step in that direction.""Getting approved is easy too. Customers can fill out a quick form within the Uber app, and find out almost instantly if they've been given the thumbs up. And you can start using the card right away for select purchases, without having to wait for the physical version to come in the mail first.And no need to hoard points for that pricey vacation one day. You can easily redeem your points for practical, everyday things like Uber credits, cash-back and gift cards.Here's the question, though: Can the Uber Visa Card stand out in the card-perk wars? JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), American Express (AXP) and Bank of America (BAC) all have premium credit cards with benefits. And like some of the other rewards cards, Uber Visa cardholders will get invites to exclusive events as one of the perks.""A lot of these rewards are something that you would traditionally see in a premium card with a big annual fee, and this one just doesn't have that fee,"" Quinn said.Nealon added that while it may look like a lot of other cards, the cash-back structure makes it ""probably the richest, no-annual-fee card out there. The richness of the value is there.""Uber and Barclays wouldn't say how many cardholders they're expecting to sign up. But with Uber available in 500 cities worldwide and the app's massive user base, the potential customer pool is large.RELATED:Shopping Around For A Luxury Credit Card?

724,NOV,"The breakfasters at Bob and Edith's Diner are too preoccupied with their tasty bacon and eggs to notice the Democratic gubernatorial candidate. Or perhaps, like all Americans who are more sensitive than oysters, they are in the throes of political exhaustion and are trying to ignore this year's only competitive gubernatorial race.In any case, they seem unaware that the mild-mannered pediatric neurologist in one of the booths — he is wearing a bourgeois disguise: gray suit, maroon tie — supposedly is ""fighting for the violent MS-13 killer gangs"" involving many Central American immigrants. The U.S. president says so, as does the gubernatorial candidate of his party.In two weeks, Virginia will have America's most consequential election since 50 weeks ago. Then, this became the only Southern state Hillary Clinton carried (by 5 points). Today's campaign dramatizes the difficult calculation confronting people who want the Republican Party restored as a vehicle for conservatism but who know that this requires expunging the political style — exuberantly fact-free accusations and screeds — exemplified by the ""MS-13"" tweet.Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam won the Democratic nomination by handily defeating (by 10 points) a darling of the Bernie Sanders/Elizabeth Warren (both endorsed the darling) tendency in the Democratic primary, which attracted 177,000 more voters than the Republican primary did. Now, however, Northam is benefiting from his opponent's intractable dilemma, that of all Republicans who remember life before 2016 and want to do what they are told cannot be done: Turn the clock back. Virginia's incumbent Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, is popular. Virginia is purple trending blue: Democrats have carried it in three consecutive presidential races, they have won three of the last four gubernatorial contests and both U.S. senators are Democrats. Barack Obama has campaigned to energize African-American voters. And the Republican candidate, Ed Gillespie, has a problem residing across the Potomac.In 2014, Gillespie — former counselor to President George W. Bush, former Republican National Committee chair, advisor to Mitt Romney's campaign, lobbyist extraordinaire — came within a whisker (under 18,000 votes) of defeating an incumbent U.S. senator, Mark Warner. This year, however, Gillespie barely defeated a full-throated Trumpian in the Republican primary. Gillespie is intelligent, temperate, experienced and happiest when talking about government policies. These attributes are, in the incandescent eyes of his party's now-Trumpian base, defects of swamp creatures. So, he is gingerly tiptoeing across the treacherous terrain of Trumpian Republican politics. This involves stoking the anger of those people who seem happiest when furious, but without infuriating everyone else.He did the former with dishonest MS-13 ads featuring tattooed dark-skinned men (""Kill, rape, control."") and accusing Northam of refusing to crack down on ""sanctuary cities,"" of which Virginia has none. Gillespie's admirers say he is better than he sounds. Others, remembering Mark Twain (who popularized the quip ""Wagner's music is better than it sounds""), say that in democratic politics — the politics of persuasive rhetoric — a candidate is the way he chooses to sound.Recently, however, Gillespie has been stressing economic issues while Northam has been saturating liberal Northern Virginia with ads featuring women who are cross because Gillespie is pro-life. Never mind that governors have been almost irrelevant to abortion policy since courts took control of it two generations ago. Perhaps Northam's ads are intended to enkindle progressives, but that should be done by the president's daily reminders of his existence. If Gillespie enlists Trump to campaign for him, he will thereby embrace a political style that entails a political substance (e.g., harping on MS-13) suited to it. If he does not, Trump's supporters will notice and accuse him of having standards, yet another swampish vice — the stigmata of elitism.A Gillespie win on Nov. 7 would be a double victory for Republicans. They would control another swing-state's governor's mansion in 2020. And it might send the Sanders/Warren true believers careening off on a ""We told you so!"" rampage, arguing — convincingly only to other believers — that Virginians chose a conservative Republican because Northam, although progressive, was insufficiently so. Then they could continue making ""single-payer"" (government-dispensed) health care progressivism's central promise to a nation in which 157 million people happily get their health care plans from their employers.So, if Gillespie wins, Republicans elsewhere will conclude that the derangement of their party does not hinder its prospering. If the Democrat wins, many progressives will be secretly as unhappy as the Trumpians who, like those progressives, will argue that their man lost because he was inconsistently and insincerely enthusiastic about his party's most off-putting faction.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

The company's ""Grand Theft Auto Online"" game continues to perform well and its recently launched ""NBA 2K18"" basketball game looks strong. He anticipates better-than-consensus results from Take-Two when it reports fiscal second-quarter earnings after the market close Nov. 7.""The ongoing strength of the GTA franchise and 'NBA 2K' are likely the key drivers for outperformance,"" Handler said in a report.

731,NOV,"The major indexes looked poised to end October on a frighteningly good note, led once again by the tech-dominated Nasdaq composite.XAt 3:15 p.m., the Nasdaq composite held on to decent gains Tuesday, up 0.5% in late afternoon trading; it  traded as high as 6,729 intraday, good for a 3.6% lift for the month.Alphabet (GOOGL) certainly helped the cause, rising as much as 9.2% in October with the help of a post-earnings blast higher on Friday. On Tuesday, shares wiped away a small intraday loss and are up fractionally to 1,034.42 in thin volume. The Google search engine operator, which makes up nearly 6% of the total market value of the Nasdaq, is now up 2.5% from a new 1,006.29 buy point in a well-formed flat base and thus still in buy range.The proper buy zone, based on IBD's time-tested buy rules, goes up to 1,056.60.IBD's proprietary ratings in Alphabet have improved markedly since Jan. 1. At that time, IBD Stock Checkup showed Alphabet sporting a mediocre 76 Composite Rating, a 93 EPS, and a lowly 45 for Relative Price Strength. Today, those rankings are now at 97, 94 and 77.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average continued lagging the Nasdaq, up between 0.1% and 0.2%. At 2577, the S&P 500 is up 2.2% for the month.At 23,400, the Dow shows a 4.4% month-to-date gain, but still lags the Nasdaq since a rare Day 3 follow-through that was noted in the June 30, 2016, edition of IBD's The Big Picture. That follow-through noted a possible tradeable market rally getting underway.The Nasdaq has risen 39% since the close of the June 30 session, vs. a 30.5% advance by the Dow industrials over the same time frame.Small caps outperformed after selling off hard on Monday; the S&P SmallCap 600 rallied more than 1%.Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was running mildly lower vs. the same time Monday. Winners are beating losers on the NYSE by a nearly 2-1 ratio.Apple (AAPL) helped the cause, rising another 1.2% to 168.69 and getting further past a new cup-with-handle buy point of 160.97. The 5% chase zone goes up to 169.02.The consumer electronics and digital services giant, which is seeing strong orders and good media reviews for the iPhone X, is now also up nearly 43% since surpassing the first base that it completed in early January 2017, a 13-week cup with handle that sported a 118.12 buy point.Apple had been featured numerous times in Stock Market Today reports from October through that Jan. 6-9 breakout.As noted in Stock Market Today on Monday, Apple stands to gain from an ongoing turnaround in both the top and bottom lines.Back to Apple, earnings had dropped 10% in the fiscal year ended in September 2016, on an 8% slump in revenue. However, Apple has been staging a classic turnaround in fundamentals lately.In the past three quarters, the iMac maker's earnings rose 2%, 11% and 18% vs. year-ago levels, following a three-quarter slump. And in Q4 (ended in September), earnings are seen increasing 12% to $1.87 a share, which would mark a third quarter in a row of mild double-digit gains. It's slated to report Q4 results on Nov. 2 after the market close.For fiscal year 2019, the Street sees earnings accelerating 24% to $11.16 a share.Another positive for Apple shareholders: a respectable annualized dividend yield of 1.5%, with plenty of potential for  further increases in that cash payout. Apple tends to raise its dividend in the spring. But William O'Neil + Co. calculates that the company has a long-term annual dividend growth rate of 24% in recent years.Going back to Alphabet, institutions are clearly deploying more capital into the megacap internet-based entertainment and advertising play. Among three fundamental reasons, one is the fact that EPS growth is back on an accelerating path.Earnings per share jumped 32% to $9.57 a share, pounding the Wall Street consensus view by nearly 15%. It was the biggest year-over-year increase in five quarters and marked a faster rate of increase vs. gains of 7%, 28% and 27% in the prior three quarters.Two, Alphabet is showing stronger profit margins, which may indicate that the company's tighter control on expenses over the past few years may be paying off. Net margin in Q3 hit 24.2%, up 170 basis points vs. a year ago and the highest since a 25.3% level seen in the first quarter of 2013.Three, revenue growth has seen a mildly faster pace.From the fourth quarter of 2014 to the first quarter of 2016, the top line saw increases of 11% to 18%. But since Q2 of 2016, the top line has grown 21%, 20%, 22%, 22%, 21% and 24% vs. year-previous levels.Two more reasons why Alphabet could rally another 20% to 25%:One, fund sponsorship may be stabilizing. Mutual and hedge funds owning Alphabet fell to 4,350 funds in Q3 vs. 4,408 in Q2, but the total shares owned was unchanged at 131.6 million. That total represents less than 19% of 694 million total shares outstanding.Two, some top-rated funds have increased their stake, including Fidelity OTC Portfolio (FOCPX) and Fidelity Magellan (FMAGX) in the second quarter, according to data from William O'Neil + Co.IBD research has found that many top-rated companies have the potential to rally 20% to 25% past a proper buy point before undergoing a new pullback or significant correction in price. On Jan. 6 this year, Alphabet propelled out of a shallow cup-with-handle base at 824.40 and rose 22% before peaking near 1,008 on June 6.While sports-apparel firm Under Armour (UAA) dropped more than 18% in massive volume and commanded the negative headlines after posting disappointing Q3 results (EPS down 24%, sales off 4% to $1.41 billion), not all apparel firms are wilting.Despite a negative reversal on Tuesday, Canada Goose (GOOS) has been building the right side of a new cup-type base. For now, watch to see how the small-cap stock handles upside resistance near 22. At 21.43, Canada Goose is still trading nearly 12% off its all-time peak of 24.32.The ultrapremium outerwear and cold-weather knitwear marketer went public at 12.75 a share on March 16. The stock quickly goosed up a 31% gain after a late-May breakout past an 18.50 IPO base, then peaked at 24.32.The current base shows a normal decline of 30%, within the normal range for a solid cup with handle.Keep in mind that Canada Goose's business is highly cyclical, with the bulk of its sales and profits coming during the holiday quarter. That said, the luxury-brand play looks set to go well into the black in fiscal year 2018 (ending in March next year) as analysts on consensus see profit of 43 cents, then 54 cents in FY 2019, up 26%.Sales grew 39% to $404 million in FY 2017 (ended in March), notching a third year in a row of 30%-plus gains.On Canada Goose's e-commerce site, a women's red Canada Coat full-length parka currently sells at $1,695.00. Many other women's parkas range from $795.00 to $1,295.00 each.Under Armour, meanwhile, had posted a shocking first year-over-year top-line decline in at least four years. The closing of numerous brick and mortar chain stores and stiff competition from the likes of Nike, Adidas and other athletic brands has dented its business model of being virtually ubiquitous in the retail landscape.The right time to have sold the stock was when it failed to complete a new base in the summer of 2016. That base featured a left-side high of 47.94. On the right side, Under Armour got as high as 44.68 before reversing sharply lower.The stock then cracked on Aug. 31, falling nearly 5% to 39.63 and taking out both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages in heavy turnover.Elsewhere in the market today, building and construction stocks rallied sharply.Decking products expert Trex (TREX) gapped up more than 24% to 108.79 and reached as high as 112.39, stretching its gain from an August breakout past 76.59 in an elongated double-bottom base to more than 46%. The stock headed the upside of IBD's ""Stocks On The Move"" table, which is a great hunting ground for snagging breakouts and building a good watch list.Trex reported robust Q3 results (EPS up 42% to 68 cents a share, revenue up 32% to $140.2 million, the strongest increase since Q3 2014).  Analysts are forecasting mild double-digit profit growth for full-year 2017 (up 17% to $2.99 a share) and 2018 (up 14% to $3.41).Thinly traded William Lyon Homes (WLH) cleared resistance near 25 and rolled past a 25.28 flat-base buy point, rising nearly 9% to 27.18. Volume is running nearly triple its average pace. The buy zone goes up to 26.54. The Newport Beach, Calif., single-family homebuilder posted a 109% leap in Q3 earnings to 71 cents a share on a 43% jump in revenue to $490.3 million.William Lyon trades on average 394,000 shares a day, roughly equivalent to $11 million in trading volume. That's thin, but Lyon also gets a respectable 91 Composite Rating from Stock Checkup, and that rating is likely to climb.IBD's TAKE: Using stock charts correctly can help you time your purchases in leading stocks so that you can maximize your gains and minimize losses within a relatively short period of time. Watching for breakouts from key chart patterns during earnings season is especially helpful. In addition to the flat base and the saucer base, the cup with handle stands out as one of the most critical patterns of human psychology; it visualizes investor fear and greed, hope and denial.

736,NOV,"Stocks slumped in late-afternoon trading Monday, but the declines among the major indexes remain mild. Apple (AAPL) bucked the drop with a 2.2% lift to 166.72 and new all-time highs.XApple has now gained 41% after a Jan. 6-9 breakout from a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12.The iPhone giant, which reportedly is seeing brisk orders for its most expensive iPhone ever (the X), is also following through on Friday's breakout from a brand-new cup with handle that shows a 160.97 proper entry.General Electric (GE), meanwhile, led the Dow Jones industrial average to a 0.3% decline as the firm that goes back to the days of Thomas Edison lopped off another 38 cents, or 1.8%, to 20.41. That marked GE's sixth straight loss.The S&P 500 also slipped 0.3% despite strength across the oil patch. WTI near-term futures edged 0.4% higher to $54.13 a barrel on the Nymex. The Nasdaq composite was down slightly.Institutions were selling GE shares hard. The stock's volume finished at 95.8 million shares, 64% heavier than usual. The megacap firm's average daily turnover over the past 50 sessions is 58.2 million shares.GE slid nearly 13% in monster weekly volume last week.The Dow Jones industrial average is a price-weighted index of 30 names, and the keepers of the average replace lagging companies with higher-priced better performers. Recent new entrants include not just Apple but also Goldman Sachs (GS) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH). All three trade at more than 100 a share.Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Pfizer (PFE) have the next-lowest share prices within the Dow 30, trading near 34 and 35.08, respectively.Cisco, a giant in computer networking and internet-based telecom gear, is challenging institutional buying support near a 34.20 buy point in a new cup with handle. The stock fell more than 1% to 34 in dull turnover.Apple replaced dividend-rich AT&T (T) in March 2015, when the latter traded near 33 a share. AT&T, which has been featured in IBD's Dividend Leaders screen, has made virtually no progress since then.GE had recently peaked at 33 in the summer of 2016 and now stands nearly 39% below that high. The stock's all-time peak is 60.50 back in August 2000.GE's Relative Price Strength Rating is a horrifying 7 on a scale of 1 to 99, as noted in IBD Stock Checkup. Certainly, pressure is mounting on GE's new management team, led by John Flannery, to reinvigorate growth. Flannery has served in many top posts at GE, including head of GE Capital and the India operations.The company's adjusted third-quarter earnings fell 4% to 26 cents a share, sharply missing Wall Street's view, according to data from William O'Neil + Co.Q3 revenue increased 14% to $33.47 billion, snapping a three-quarter slump. But GE has not seen a double-digit annual gain on the top line for more than nine years. The best result was a 6% rise in revenue to $182.5 billion back in 2008.Helping the Nasdaq's cause was Broadcom (AVGO), rising 8.33, or more than 3% to 261.23 in strong turnover. The chip designer for auto, telecom, data center and other markets has cleared a 259.46 buy point in a new nine-week flat base.The proper buy zone goes up 5% past that 259.46 buy point, or 272.43.Broadcom appears in IBD's real-time Stocks On The Move table, a great source for watchlist ideas and potential new breakouts. The table shows stocks moving sharply up or down in heavy volume, based on a real-time analysis of price-and-volume data, and can be seen on the home page.Back to Apple, earnings had dropped 10% in the fiscal year ended in September 2016, on an 8% slump in revenue. However, Apple has been staging a classic turnaround in fundamentals lately.In the past three quarters, the iMac maker's earnings rose 2%, 11% and 18% vs. year-ago levels, following a three-quarter slump. And in Q4 (ended in September), earnings are seen increasing 12% to $1.87 a share, which would mark a third quarter in a row of mild double-digit gains. It's slated to report Q4 results on Nov. 2 after the market close.For fiscal year 2019, the Street sees earnings accelerating 24% to $11.16 a share.Another positive for Apple shareholders: a respectable annualized dividend yield of 1.5%, with plenty of potential for  further increases in that cash payout. Apple tends to raise its dividend in the spring. But William O'Neil + Co. calculates that the company has a long-term annual dividend growth rate of 24% in recent years.IBD'S TAKE: The current yield of the S&P 500 is 1.87%. Track the yield and other vital market indicators by going to the special General Market Indicators page, available as a PDF link at Market Trend on Investors.com. The yield is posted on the top bar of the large daily chart of the S&P 500.Apple's SmartSelect Ratings have improved steadily throughout the year.On Jan. 1, the Composite Rating was dismal at 51 on a scale of 1 to 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The RS Rating, which compares a stock's 12-month price performance with all other companies in IBD's database, was equally dim at 59.But today, those two scores are now at 74 and 83, respectively. Expect the Composite Rating to be somewhat weaker when a stock such as Apple is undergoing a major turnaround in both fundamentals and in stock-price action.Elsewhere among the Dow Jones 30 components, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is making what appears to be a normal-looking pullback after breaking out of a flat base at 137.18 on Oct. 17. The diversified medical and personal-care products titan has so far rallied as much as 5.2% from that proper entry, getting briefly extended from the correct buy point.J&J has posted single- to mild double-digit EPS gains for eight quarters in a row. The Street sees Q4 earnings rising 9% to $1.72 a share.The market reacted a tad negatively on reports that Congress is considering a phase-in pace toward lower corporate taxes. It's not the first time such a plan has been reported in the media. In any case, the market appears to be unwilling so far to give up much of its strong gains over the past five weeks.One big reason: U.S. GDP rose 3% in Q3 on an annualized basis, despite the enormous damage caused by hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. That follows a 3.1% gain in Q2.While the Q3 GDP figure is bound to change in future data revisions, Eric Winograd, senior U.S. economist at AllianceBernstein, notes that investors should focus on the recent monthly data that point to an ""economy balanced among sectors.""""Each of personal consumption, private investment and net exports made a positive contribution to the headline rise, with the increase in private investment particularly noteworthy; it rose 4.2% year over year, the highest in two years,"" Winograd told IBD. ""We may not yet be back to pre-crisis levels of investment, but the news on that front is good.""Winograd also says consumption data point to an accelerating expansion in the U.S. economy.""I think of final sales to domestic purchasers, one of the subcategories of GDP, as essentially a 'core' measure — the single figure that best captures the underlying dynamics of the economy. With the (household) paycheck growing at about 4% YOY, the 4.1% YOY gain in final sales makes perfect sense,"" he added.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Apple In Buy Range; 2 New IPOs To WatchHow To Find Top Growth Stocks: Why The Cup With Handle Is A Money MakerWhen To Buy A Stock: Master This Key Growth Stock Chart PatternHow To Invest: Finding Great Stocks Inside IBD 50Top Stocks Today: Can This Chipmaker Rise Sharply Again On A New Breakout?Technology News: Nvidia Gets Another Price Target Hike

The gains more than made up for higher costs, weak agricultural conditions in Brazil and the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Hurricanes reduced earnings in the quarter by about $250 million, the company said last month.""Given that DowDuPont already recalibrated expectations for the hurricane impacts and headwinds in Brazil, the upside surprise is, in our view, more positive than it looks, and bodes well for Q4,"" Laurence Alexander, an analyst at Jefferies & Co. who recommends buying the shares, said in a note to investors.Shares of the Dow industrials component rose 2.8% to 73.05 on the stock market today, hitting a new record high.The company last month announced changes to its split-up plan that will increase the material science unit's focus on commodity products such as polyethylene plastic.

Instead, its core product is its strata of algorithms and artificial intelligence, they say.They add that Facebook doesn't need to crank out the original TV shows or other features on which fellow FANG stocks Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN) have banked.""I'm not sure that's why I want to go to Facebook,"" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said. ""I do want to go to Facebook to have my friends tell me 'Blade Runner 2049' is good.""Those in the Facebook-is-a-media-company camp, however, might point to its financials. Digital ad sales are expected to drive a 41% surge in revenue in the third quarter. Any financial outlook that the company offers for next year could be tempered by its decision to hire 1,000 people to vet those ads, after Kremlin-linked accounts allegedly planted thousands of them in an attempt to inflame tensions in the U.S. around wedge issues.In addition, they might argue, the company offers video content from Major League Baseball, the National Football League and National Public Radio. It recently put up an unsuccessful $610 million bid for the rights to broadcast Indian Premier League cricket games. And lots of people get their news, real or fake, from the site.Many observers say a company that does all that should own up to the responsibilities and regulations that cover the rest of the media business.But would a play for more media be good for Wall Street? Analysts say that creating or buying media content itself could gut Facebook's margins and the investor excitement that has helped its stock more than quadruple since its splashy initial public offering in 2012.""There are so many other growth opportunities ahead of the company, we doubt it would have to have media become a major piece of the story,"" SunTrust analyst Youssef Squali said.The company's longer-term opportunities include augmented reality, in video games or even distance learning. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg wants to develop glasses that digitally impose objects over the user's actual surroundings and, in effect, declutter the world of physical objects.""You want to play a board game? You snap your fingers, and here's the board game,"" he said, according to a Recode story this year. ""You don't need a physical hardware TV, you buy a one-dollar app 'TV' and put it on the wall.""There's also a lot more room for Facebook's Messenger and Whatsapp messaging platforms to tack moneymaking widgets onto the messages that users already send to one another. Mention a location and that could trigger a bot from Uber that would allow you to arrange a ride through Messenger.Others say there's a chance for those services to be more like WeChat, the multifaceted messaging service based in China.""That's not just a text messaging app, it's a payment app, it's a commerce app. You can do a lot of different things,"" Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson said. ""It's really a platform in and of itself.""IBD'S TAKE: Facebook touched a buy zone out of a flat base in the middle of October but has since retreated and is near its 50-day moving average. Still, it remains second in IBD's Internet-Content Group, right behind No. 1-ranked YY.He adds that Facebook has a long way to go before it fully mines its own assets — Whatsapp, Messenger and the photo-sharing site Instagram — for sales and profit.How about what's already making money for Facebook? Start with site's roughly 2 billion monthly users, or somewhere around half the people on the internet. People spend close to an hour, and counting, each day within the Facebook infrastructure. That's thanks in part to the slow drip of birthday and event reminders — and the bump that comes from being notified of an abrasive comment or a 'Like' — that keep people on the site.The more people use the site, the better Facebook can serve up precise consumer analytics for advertisers across its core site and its other platforms.""They've got close to half of the users of the internet on their platform, and they can target them with scary accuracy,"" Olson said.With size, accuracy and familiarity come trust. Sixty-six percent of respondents to an RBC/Ad Age marketer survey in September said they planned to increase their ad budget with Facebook. The percentage was 63% for Instagram.That beats Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, Google's YouTube, Amazon, Snap's (SNAP) Snapchat or Twitter (TWTR).With the exception of tweeting, Facebook also has adopted features similar to those on other social media sites. You can send money and order food.Instagram's Stories feature, in which users stitch together photographed and recorded things that happen to them during the day, largely does what Snapchat does. Pachter called Instagram Stories a good ""defense"" against Snapchat.""That keeps 40-year-old women from befriending their kids on Snapchat,"" he said.But as more moms storm Facebook's news feeds, a recent survey from Piper Jaffray found that ""the youngest of teens are simply not adopting"" the platform, favoring the more photo-and-video-centric Instagram and Snapchat.The company this year continues to invest, hiring engineers and building out data centers, which is keeping operating expenses elevated. And its advertising technology has been porous enough for some major errors.By midday Friday, shares of Facebook were up 3.4% to near 176.40 on the stock market today.Since last year, reports have also surfaced that Facebook overestimated how long people watched its videos or it otherwise miscalculated user engagement with marketers and publishers.Then there's the matter of Russia, which has compromised the trust of the public and, to an extent, investors. But analysts say any regulatory consequences — Facebook might have to provide more information about who's behind a political ad — would be minimal on a financial level.More significant financially, they say, is the possibility of antitrust action and scrutiny in Europe over privacy protections. Facebook and Google dominate the digital ad landscape; how the companies use consumers' data has been a concern in Europe for years.Facebook's ability to expand globally remains one of its biggest advantages. Most of its daily active users access the site through a mobile device and, outside of first-world nations, the phone is ""often the first (or only) connected screen,"" Needham analysts said a research note in October.But analysts' views are mixed over whether Facebook can tap the largest economy outside the U.S.: China. And any move into China would follow Russia's own infiltration of the social network.""I think the last thing the Chinese government wants is to have some kind of rogue platform that they can't control,"" Squali said.RELATED:How Does Facebook Compare To Amazon, Netflix And Google?Here's What Facebook Messenger Can Do For Your Stock PortfolioCould Facebook Virtual Reality Spending Hit $5 Billion A Year?FANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google

772,NOV,"Major indexes recouped some of Wednesday's moderate losses while investors awaited a deluge of quarterly results from big-cap tech firms. Biotechs slid on Celgene's (CELG) 18% plunge following disappointing Q3 results.XIBD's biotech-biomedical industry subgroup fell more than 1%, joining military defense, ethical drug, hospital and medical software firms on the downside.At 2 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite was up around 0.1%, lagging a 0.4% lift for the Dow Jones industrial average and a nearly 0.3% rise for the S&P 500. The S&P SmallCap 600 padded its early gains, rallying nearly 0.6%. Volume decreased vs. the same time on both main exchanges.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, quietly positioned itself for a potential rebound back above the critical 50-day moving average. Shares rose nearly 0.7% to 157.42, edging back above a prior flat-base buy point at 156.75.The megacap tech leader, which reports fiscal Q4 results late Monday, still holds a solid gain since it initially broke out of a first-stage bottoming base on Jan. 6-9, a cup-with-handle showing a 118.12 entry. Shares have rallied as much as 39% since then.The Street expects Q4 earnings to rise 12% to $1.87 a share, extending a streak of low double-digit EPS growth to a third quarter. After that, growth is expected to accelerate; fiscal year 2018 profit is expected to rise 24% to $11.15 a share.Apple's IBD ratings have improved since the start of the year.On Jan. 1, the iPhone and iPad giant showed a lousy Earnings Per Share Rating of 45 and a Relative Price Strength Rating of 59. Today, they've risen to 85 and 77, respectively, on a scale of 1 to 99.Apple's example in 2017 is a good lesson in how a stock chart can help an investor spot an excellent turnaround situation. Four quarters ago, the company posted a 15% drop in Q4 earnings per share and a 9% slump in revenue (its third straight year-over-year drop). With such results, and a lagging stock price, no wonder Apple's IBD ratings plunged into mediocrity.However, under the leadership of CEO Tim Cook, the company continues to create innovative and popular new products. The company also has set a goal of doubling its services-related revenue by decade's end.Sales have risen 3%, 5% and 7% in the past three quarters. The Street sees Q4 sales rising 8%, to $50.79 billion, continuing a slow-yet-steady acceleration in top-line growth.Fiscal year 2018, which ends in September next year, could be even better. Apple's revenue is seen increasing 17% to $266.6 billion, up from an expected 5% gain in the just-ended fiscal year 2017.Celgene reported a respectable 21% jump in Q3 profit to $1.91 a share, and that beat the consensus estimate by 2%. But perhaps Wall Street had been hoping for a bigger beat. Meanwhile, a 10% gain on the top line to $3.29 billion marked the weakest year-over-year increase in more than four years.Did Celgene give investors any sell signals before Thursday's tumble? In fact, yes.Back in June, the cancer treatment specialist bolted out of a somewhat lopsided cup base at 127.74, then rallied 15% to as high as 147.17. But a sharp gap down in heavy trading on Oct. 5 gave a strong hint at a change in the character of the action.Just days later on Oct. 13, Celgene then tripped below its 50-day moving average. Volume ballooned 40% above the 50-day average, a sign that institutions were locking in gains.IBD'S TAKE: In some cases, a great stock will punctuate the end of a rally with multiple sell signals, covered frequently in IBD's Investor's Corner and daily market columns. Check out this article on how to spot multiple sell signals to lock in profits and raise cash to maximize your portfolio return.Fortinet (FTNT) may be working on a  new handle on a double-bottom base. The security software firm is an industry peer of Palo Alto Networks (PANW), currently a member of Leaderboard, IBD's premium stockpicking and chart annotating service.Fortinet, slated to report Q3 results after the close today, has moved past a 39.61 buy point within a 13-week double-bottom base. In this base, the second low of 35.44 undercut the first low of 35.87. Fortinet broke out on Oct. 18 in heavy volume and remains in buy range.The buy zone goes up to 41.59.Meanwhile, since Fortinet has not yet climbed to new highs, the possibility of an alternate buy point exists.Notice on the daily chart how the stock has pulled back mildly over the past several sessions. A good handle features such action, running lower along the lows as the stock trades lightly. In a proper handle, the decline usually never exceeds more than 12%. However, a handle must also be a minimum five trading days long; Fortinet has pulled back just four sessions.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, the midcap stock sports a good Composite Rating of 94 on a scale of 1 to 99. Despite a mediocre RS Rating, the up/down volume ratio of 1.4 points to heavy-volume buying by institutions over the past 50 sessions.Other top-rated stocks in IBD's Computer Software-Security industry group include Nice (NICE) (96 Composite, but thinly trade), Symantec (SYMC) (79 Composite, but also posting a big turnaround in 2017), and Qualys (QLYS) (94 Composite, testing support near the 50-day moving average following an Aug. 3 breakout past a flat base at 44.45).Elsewhere in the stock market, certain consumer-spending plays thrived.Group 1 Automotive (GPI) broke out past a 75.52 buy point in a long cup with handle as shares rose 10% to 77.82. Volume is running more than four times its 50-day average. The buy zone goes up to 79.30.Earnings rose 14% to $2.23 a share, snapping a two-quarter streak of falling profits. Revenue rose 7% to $3.01 billion, matching the biggest increase in seven quarters.On the downside, Raytheon (RTN) undercut its 50-day moving average in heavy volume since late June as shares in the missile maker dropped more than 4% to 180.59. The stock has rallied as much as 32% since clearing a flat-base pattern at 143.49 on Nov. 9 last year.Raytheon reported a 7% increase in Q3 earnings to $1.97 a share, beating views. But it's also the third quarter of single-digit EPS growth in the past four quarters. Revenue rose 4% to $6.28 billion.A continued dive beneath the 50-day line would trigger a key IBD sell signal.Raytheon faced such a challenge soon after the Nov. 9 breakout last year. The stock spiked through its 50-day moving average on both Dec. 12 and on Jan. 26 this year, but immediately rebounded.RELATED:Know The Cup With Handle; What Makes This Chart Pattern Special?This Psychological Market Indicator Just Made A Mini-SpikeWhat Is The I In CAN SLIM?How To Find Excellent Stocks Like Nvidia: Begin Your Search Here

774,NOV,"A month after Wal-Mart (WMT) debuted ""in-fridge"" delivery, Amazon.com (AMZN) is unveiling its own in-home delivery system, Amazon Key, which allows delivery people to let themselves into your home to drop off packages.XThe system, available only to Prime members, works like this: Customers buy and install a $249.99 kit that includes a cloud-based camera and Key-compatible smart lock, then download the Amazon Key app. When a delivery arrives, they're notified via the app, and Amazon authorizes the delivery and unlocks the door. Users can watch the delivery take place live or view the video at another time.While Wal-Mart sees its system being employed for fresh grocery deliveries, Amazon also envisions Key being used to let in houseguests, dog walkers and other professional service providers while the resident is away.Beginning Nov. 8, about three dozen cities and areas will be eligible to receive Amazon Key service, including Atlanta, Austin, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, Miami, Phoenix, Seattle and Washington, D.C.Amazon shares slipped 0.3% to close at 972.91 on the stock market today. Wal-Mart ticked down 0.6% to finish at 88.48.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.While services like Amazon's and Wal-Mart's could appeal to busy professionals and those with mail-theft issues, they may not be welcome by those uncomfortable with the idea of letting strangers into their homes while they're not there. And Amazon advises pet owners to refrain from the using the service if their pets could scamper out the front door on delivery day.RELATED:Wal-Mart Tests 'In-Fridge Delivery' With Smart Lock Maker AugustRetail and E-Commerce Stocks and Industry News Wal-Mart Expands Online Grocery Pickup To Include Food Stamp BenefitsTarget's New Exclusive Brand?

Apple shares fell 0.4% to close at 156.41 on the stock market today.""We believe a very large installed base of loyal, yet patient users can't wait to get their hands on iPhone X,"" Pelayo said in a note to clients. ""Unit growth will be driven by the large and loyal installed base of users (approximately 600-700 million) that have patiently been waiting for more differentiated products such as the iPhone 8 series, and in particular the iPhone X (and follow-up models).""Apple should be able to work out supply constraints for the iPhone X by the end of the first quarter, he said.

785,NOV,"Delphi Automotive (DLPH) announced Tuesday it plans to buy the self-driving-car startup Nutonomy for $450 million, strengthening its autonomy strategy as Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) continue to rev up their efforts.XThe automotive supplier said acquiring Boston-based Nutonomy would speed up its efforts on self-driving solutions that can be deployed on a commercial scale. Upon completion of the Nutonomy deal by the end of the year, Delphi will have self-driving operations in Boston, Pittsburgh, Singapore and California. It aims to have 60 self-driving cars on the road by year-end.Delphi told the media Tuesday it wants to be a leader in autonomous vehicles and sees the greatest opportunity in commercial vehicles, such as on-demand rides, transportation services and logistics companies. Notably, Nutonomy was one of the first companies to test self-driving taxis, in Singapore last year, and has partnered with ride-sharing company Lyft in Boston.Unlike some players, Delphi plans to make its turnkey self-driving system available to any automaker or mobility provider to purchase, especially benefiting smaller players with limited resources to build their own systems.Shares of Delphi closed up 0.5% at 98.27 on the stock market today. Shares are testing the 50-day moving average after a 9% advance from their July breakout past 90.15. The company will hold an investor update on Friday, with earnings to follow on Nov. 2. Tesla edged up 0.1%, and Nvidia added 1%.IBD'S TAKE: As Delphi ramps up its self-driving ambitions, see how it compares with this top growth stock in its industry group.Earlier this year, Delphi said it would spin off its powertrain assets to focus on autonomous driving. It added in Tuesday's statement that it will become two new, publicly traded companies by March — Aptiv, focused on new mobility solutions, which will trade under the ticker APTV, and Delphi Technologies, the powertrain unit, which will retain the DLPH ticker.Nutonomy adds to several initiatives that Delphi has made this year to develop emerging mobility solutions. These include a pact with BlackBerry (BB) to secure its turnkey self-driving system, being co-developed with Intel (INTC), as well as a partnership with Transdev Group on robo-taxis. Delphi also bought self-driving software maker Ottomatika in 2015.RELATED:GM's Q3 Earnings Were Great — But This Risk Hangs Over Surging StockAutomotive Industry News, Self-Driving Cars And Stocks To WatchDelphi, BlackBerry Team Up On Self-Driving Technology

786,NOV,"Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials were little changed early Wednesday morning. Apple (AAPL) now has a new, lower buy point. Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a rival to Nvidia (NVDA) and Intel (INTC), tumbled late Tuesday despite beating Q3 estimates after closing just shy of a buy point.XAMD's tumble underscores two important lessons. First, always wait for a stock to clear a proper buy point. Second, you generally should look to buy the leaders in a particular field, such as Nvidia, rather than an also-ran.S&P 500 index fell slightly vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures lost 0.1%. Dow futures rose 0.1%.On Tuesday, the Dow industrials powered ahead on strong earnings from 3M (MMM) and Caterpillar (CAT). The S&P 500 and Nasdaq advanced 0.2%.Apple, another Dow component, rose 0.6% to 157.10 in Tuesday's stock market trading. But the iPhone giant's stock now has etched a proper handle in its shallow cup base, reaching the minimum five days. That gives Apple a new buy point of 160.97 vs. its prior potential entry of 165.04.A few caveats. Apple gapped down in volume in its handle, which is not ideal, undercutting its 50-day moving average. Apple has a lowest-possible E Accumulation/Distribution Rating: The stock sold off in volume in the left side of its base, which is not that surprising, but volume on the upside has been weak.Also, while the market is in a confirmed uptrend, there has been a recent spate of distribution days, so investors should keep that in mind.IBD'S TAKE: Apple reports earnings on Nov. 2. Buying or holding a stock heading into earnings can be risky. Investors doing so may want to consider an earnings options strategy that offers a chance to cash in on the upside while minimizing potential losses.AMD earned 10 cents a share excluding various items, up 133% vs. a year earlier. Revenue climbed 25% to $1.64 billion, its third straight quarter of accelerating growth. Analysts had expected EPS of 8 cents on sales of $1.51 billion. AMD sees Q4 revenue of $1.34 billion to $1.44 billion vs. views for $1.322 billion. But that's also a 15% sequential decline. AMD also said it sees a ""leveling off"" in cryptocurrency demand for its chips.AMD shares, which briefly rose to around 13.70 in late trading, soon crashed. The stock is down about 10% to 12.84 in premarket trading, suggesting moves below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. AMD had closed up 1.1% to 14.25 in Tuesday's stock market trading, ending just below a 14.51 cup-with-handle entry.An overeager investor might have been tempted to cheat, heading into earnings. The justification is that you get a lower price and stroke your ego about how you were smarter or braver than other investors. But saving a few cents, or even a few percentage points, isn't worth the risk.The buy point is a key technical level, maximizing your odds of significant near-term gains while limiting the risk of losses and offering signals for cutting losses short. When a stock clears a bullish entry point in heavy volume, almost every current shareholder should be happy. Mutual funds and other institutional buys must bid up the price to acquire shares. If a breakout falters, and drops below the buy point, that's a clear sign that something is wrong.Barring a big turnaround in Wednesday's session, AMD is not going to trigger that 14.51 buy point. Patient investors avoid a big loss by never taking a position.For investors who felt compelled to buy a stock early, they may want to try options to hedge their risks. IBD's Earnings Preview column covers this options strategy with specific examples.AMD actually made a similar point after its Q2 report on July 25. The next day, shares popped as high as 15.65, exactly hitting a buy point. But AMD closed in the bottom half of its range and then sold off over the next several weeks. Except for that momentary trade at 15.65, AMD didn't offer a buying opportunity.You get what you pay for.AMD has long been a distant No. 2 to Intel in PC chips, and competes against the larger rival in server chips as well. AMD also takes on Nvidia in graphics chips, with both taking advantage of such chips being used for artificial intelligence and Bitcoin mining.But while AMD has had some recent success in terms of financials and stock performance, it's still a big laggard next to Nvidia, which delivered 56% sales growth in its latest quarter, on top of tough comparisons.AMD historically has struggled to maintain profitability, even on an adjusted basis, with sales often slumping as well.Nvidia shares fell 0.4% early Wednesday after closing about 1% higher Tuesday to 198.68. Nvidia is extended from a 174.66 buy point cleared last month.Intel dipped 0.3% in the premarket. Shares climbed 0.3% Tuesday to 40.95, hitting their highest level in nearly 17 years. Intel, which reports Q3 results on Thursday, is extended from a 38.55 buy point.RELATED:The Big Picture: Meet The Stock Market's Surprising New LeaderWhen Analyzing Stocks In An Industry Group, Focus On The RS Rating LeaderBullish Chart Patterns: Do You Know The Basics Of A Cup With Handle?Bullish Chart Patterns II: How To Find The Exact Buy PointChip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News

787,NOV,"Triton International (TRTN) is showing positive action since clearing a 38.29 buy point in a six-week cup base on Friday. Is now a good time to buy?In terms of buy rules and the criteria that make up IBD's CAN SLIM investment system, yes. The stock hasn't yet exited the 5% range past the proper entry. That buy zone runs up to 40.20. Friday's breakout came in strong turnover; 1.09 million shares exchanged hands that day, 83% above usual levels.Let's dive into the other factors that may lead to a successful run by the specialist in various types of containers for the shipping industry.Technically, the most recent base is at least middle to late stage. That's a negative factor. But it also speaks to the power of the stock.Triton debuted on the NYSE on July 13, 2016, ending that session at 15.80. After a brief move up, Triton corrected sharply, forming a four-month base in the process. When stocks heated up after Donald Trump's presidential win on Nov. 8 last year, so did Triton. The stock vaulted past a 17.60 buy point, rose 20%, then settled into a second-stage base that formed from late November to late January of this year.On Jan. 24, shares surpassed a 21.44 buy point in a base that has shades of a double-bottom base as well. The 26% decline from the base's head to toe was normal in size. From that point, Triton has sketched a long series of higher highs and higher lows, forming consolidations that could qualify as new bases. In the meantime, the 50-day moving average served as a test of support for the stock.Finally in September, Triton made its biggest dive beneath the 50-day moving average in the stock's history. Yet the total correction never became more than 19%.This relatively mild decline hints that shareholders are not so eager to dump their shares.The most recent base is arguably fourth or even fifth stage. Later-stage bases tend to have more difficulty in producing sound breakouts to new highs. Only those companies with excellent or sharply improving fundamentals will get the sort of institutional demand that fuels long-term rallies.In the case of Bermuda-based Triton, the company may be poised for record earnings the next couple years.Earnings dived 66% to 63 cents a share last year. But Wall Street expects earnings to rebound 308% in 2017 to $2.57 a share, then lift an additional 34% to $3.45 in 2018.The company, which provides chassis, dry freight, refrigerated and other specialty containers for worldwide transport, also is seeing some serious revenue growth acceleration.Revenue dropped 12% to $158.3 million in the second quarter of 2016, but then rose 41% the next quarter. Nice turnaround. That's not all. Revenue picked up 50%, 63% and 78% in the three most recent quarters.The Street sees revenue rising 22% to $301.7 million in Q3 and up 19% to $309.7 million in Q4. Those increases come on top of big gains in the year-ago quarter, making it very tough to repeat growth of 25% or higher — the C requirement in IBD's CAN SLIM stock-picking methodology.Some IBD readers may be put off by how Triton formed the left side of its cup in a hurry. It's indeed unusual. You'd prefer to see some symmetry within a cup pattern. However, the left side of the base was influenced by selling spurred by Triton's Sept. 8 pricing of an offering of 5.35 million shares at 32.75 a piece.Notice how, on the weekly chart, Triton had marked five up weeks in a row before the breakout week. That's a good sign, says IBD chairman and founder William J. O'Neil. Such action means that institutional demand is irrepressible.Institutional sponsorship has grown rapidly; 266 mutual funds and hedge funds collectively owned 17 million shares as of the end of September, up from 217 funds and 14.2 million shares in December 2016.Triton has a float of 78 million shares. Average volume is decent at 599,000 shares a day.Group relative strength is good. It's part of IBD's Commercial Services-Leasing group that has surged from 84th to 29th among 197 industry groups over the past seven weeks.Prefer those stocks in industry groups and subgroups that rank within the top 20 or 40 in terms of six-month relative price performance.If Triton's breakout does not bear fruit, defensive action is paramount. As with any stock, be ready to employ the golden rule of selling.IBD's TAKE: Cup-without-handle breakouts can be just as good as those stocks clearing a cup with a handle.

797,NOV,"Wall Street analysts continue to trim their iPhone X build forecasts for this year as Apple's (AAPL) contract manufacturers struggle with production issues.XOn Tuesday, Credit Suisse cut its iPhone shipment targets through next year with unit estimates for 2017 and 2018 to 217 million and 233 million, respectively. That's down from the brokerage's May estimate of 223 million and 248 million units. It implies no growth in 2017 and 7% growth in 2018.Credit Suisse attributed the cuts in 2017 to the ""lower-than-estimated ramp of iPhone X build."" Its 2018 iPhone shipment cut reflects the impact of higher-than-expected average selling prices for the new iPhone models, including the iPhone 8 series and iPhone X, which could dampen demand.Credit Suisse analysts Manish Nigam and Camille Xu cut their price targets on Apple contract manufacturers Hon Hai, Pegatron and Wistron, which are traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange.Apple stock was up a fraction to close at 160.47 on the stock market today.On Monday, Susquehanna Financial Group lowered its iPhone build forecasts for the September and December quarters by several million units because of iPhone X assembly snags.""Our recent checks suggest the main issue with iPhone X assembly is poor manufacturing yields associated with the transmitter and receiver used in 3D sensors,"" Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini said in a report. ""This has led to a total iPhone X unit shipment forecast of 37 million in second-half 2017 vs. prior expectation of 47 million.""IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has been forming a cup base with a buy point of 165.04 for the past seven weeks.

It is the first iPhone to use an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display instead of a liquid crystal display (LCD). OLED screens boast richer colors, truer blacks, a faster refresh rate and lower power usage.The push-out in iPhone X shipments could limit or remove the upside to OLED emitter sales for supplier Universal Display (OLED) in the second half of 2017, Hosseini said.However, 2018 looks good for Universal Display as more smartphones adopt OLED displays and production ramps up, Hosseini said. Samsung is rumored to be releasing its OLED-screen Galaxy S9 smartphone early in 2018, while Chinese smartphone vendors also are shifting to OLED screens, he said.Universal Display added 1.1% to close at 136.95.On Monday, KeyBanc Capital Markets said shares of iPhone chip suppliers are likely to be ""range-bound"" until the production issues are worked out.""Until supply constraints ease on the iPhone X, we see limited catalysts for the Apple supply chain,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh said in a report.Stocks impacted by the iPhone X include Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), he said.Broadcom gets about 15% to 20% of its sales from Apple.

While the move back above the 50-day line is bullish, the stock also is working on a flat base with a 165.04 buy point.At 12:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite edged 0.1% higher; at one point, the tech-rich market-cap-weighted index was up 0.4%.The Dow Jones industrial average, getting a boost by not only Apple its financial-sector components Goldman Sachs (GS), Travelers (TRV) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), was also up close to 0.2%. The S&P 500 rose just 0.1% as selling in the retail sector weighed.The S&P SmallCap 600 slipped 0.2%. Transport shares cooled off; the Dow Jones transportation average dropped nearly 0.9%, partly due to a jump in energy prices.Crude oil continued to rally, boosted in part by military conflict between Iraq and its Kurdish-occupied northern region, helped commodity stocks lead the upside. WTI near-term oil futures rallied 0.8% to $51.87 a barrel.Biotech, heavy construction, coal, oil drilling, gaming and Southeast banking shares also paced the upside. KBR (KBR), a member of IBD's Building-Heavy Construction industry group, rallied more than 4% to 18.47 in volume jumping more than 80% above average.The stock had trouble making further upside progress since clearing a first-stage bottoming base pattern at 18.05 in early September. However, the stock did not trigger any sell signals and now appears to be finding support at the 18 level.The Houston-based expert in engineering and construction services to government and civil infrastructure, energy and petrochemical clients has strung three quarters in a row of top-line growth (revenue up 10%, 11% and 8% since Q4 of 2016 to Q2 2017) and is slated to post a solid quarter of profit, 30 cents a share, in the just-ended third quarter, vs. an adjusted net loss of 44 cents in the year-ago quarter.For the year, KBR is seen earnings $1.43 a share. It lost 34 cents a share in 2016.Returning to Apple, the reclaiming the 50-day moving average offers long-term holders a chance to consider adding a small portion of shares to a winning position. Those who bought at 156.75 are now back in the black, and the stock had not triggered any defensive sell rule, including the golden rule of selling.Four additional reasons to keep holding Apple include the following:One, fundamentals are set to continue accelerate. As noted in multiple Stock Market Today columns earlier this year, Apple is set to post another quarter of double-digit EPS growth.And in the fiscal year 2018, ending in September that year, earnings are seen rising 22% to $11.03 a share, up from an 8% jump in fiscal 2017. Apple reports fiscal Q4 results on Nov. 2.According to IBD Stock Checkup, Apple's Earnings Per Share Rating is an 85, up from a lowly 45 at the start of the year.Two, the company boasts excellent cash flow. In fiscal 2016, operating cash flow was $10.53 a share, much more than the $8.31 it earned per share in profits. That could help prevent the stock from having to take on more debt to finance future growth. At the end of the latest fiscal year in September 2016, Apple showed a long-term debt to shareholders equity ratio of 59%, up from 26% and 45% in the prior two years.Three, while the total number of mutual funds and hedge funds owning Apple shares dropped on a year over year basis, the decline is minimal: 5,244 funds owned shares as of the September quarter, vs. 5,264 a year earlier.Among highly regarded funds, Oppenheimer Value (CGRWX) increased its stake as a proportion of its fund in the third quarter and has held shares since Q3 of 2012. Fidelity OTC Portfolio (FOCPX), Fidelity Magellan (FMAGX), Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) and Columbia Large Cap Growth (LEGAX) also continue to be big holders of Apple shares.Four, technicals remain sound as the stock continues to wage a long-term trend of higher highs and higher lows. The up/down volume ratio of 0.9 is not terrible, given that the stock made a sharp pullback in September. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating of E is poor, though.Elsewhere in the market, coal play Warrior Met Coal (HCC) gained more than 1.5% to 23.97 in volume running more than triple usual levels. The stock undercut its 50-day moving average on Sept. 21 but immediately began a slow rebound. Watch to see if the small-cap energy play can retake its 50-day line.The stock is up 26% since its April debut at 19 a share. Now, the Brookwood, Ala., firm is in Week 6 of a potential new base.Warrior Met, an expert in hard coking coal, has a float of 49 million shares, satisfying the S (supply vs. demand) in IBD's CAN SLIM investment paradigm, and 53 million shares outstanding. The new company lost money in both 2015 and 2016, but is expected by Wall Street to earn $6.66 a share this year.IBD'S TAKE: Did you know that the flat base, which reflects an unwillingness among large fund managers to dump their shares, often serves as a launchpad for big breakouts and tremendous price gains for many growth stocks?

815,NOV,"Kite Pharma is edging closer to approval for a cutting-edge cancer treatment that fights the disease by rebuilding a patient's own cells — a technology that could benefit thousands of people and pave the way for blockbuster drugs.XKite's ultracustomized treatment is a key entry in an area of great promise in cancer research and has attracted about a dozen drugmakers, including Bluebird Bio (BLUE), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), Celgene (CELG) and Novartis (NVS). The latter got a major FDA approval in August, giving Novartis the lead in this emerging field.Those firms and others are developing their own cancer-fighting systems that harness the same underlying process used by Kite, which is now a unit of Gilead Sciences (GILD). The approach, called CAR-T therapy, uses bioengineering to retrain a patient's infection-fighting white blood cells to seek out and destroy cancer cells.Analysts say Kite's manufacturing process stands out in the CAR-T field for its shorter turnaround time to treatment and success rate.For Kite's groundbreaking work, Investor's Business Daily named the company an IBD Biotech Innovator in the inaugural edition of the awards.How IBD Chose The Biotech Innovator Award Winners: IBD asked equity analysts, ETF and mutual fund managers and university professors to identify the top biotech companies based on their innovative research. We asked them to focus on companies with pioneering drugs likely to launch in the next several years and reach blockbuster, or near-blockbuster, sales of $1 billion or more a year. The award winners selected by IBD editors are the six most-cited companies. To find profiles of all the award winners and details of their work, go to our full Biotech Innovators special report.)David Chang, Kite's chief medical officer, told IBD that current cell therapies are ""just the beginning … . This is an area that's really set up to undergo big changes over the next few years.And Kite has recently enlisted a powerful ally.In late August, Gilead of Foster City, Calif., agreed to acquire Santa Monica, Calif.-based Kite for $180 a share in an all-cash deal valued at $11.9 billion. The deal closed Oct. 3. Kite already was trading at all-time highs, near 140, since the start of summer, after going public at $17 a share in mid-2014. Gilead stock rose above 86 from about 75 after the companies announced their merger, but closed Friday at 81.17.The alliance brings Kite an established partner with financial heft and industry breadth just as the biotech ingenue prepares to beef up production and distribution of its flagship drug.That treatment — axi-cel, short for axicabtagene ciloleucel — is designed to fight an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of blood cancer affecting the immune system that is the sixth most common cancer in the U.S. Kite is expected to get drug approval this year.Gilead is hitching its star to Kite with expectations of gaining a string of successful cancer-fighting products at a time when Gilead's strongest portfolio of medications, for treating hepatitis C, is losing steam.Kite expects the manufacturing process it honed to develop axi-cel will serve as the foundation for future treatments, including those to destroy solid cancer tumors and cancers of the cervix, head and neck.Pharmaceutical companies typically look to fill out their product pipelines by acquiring companies with a technology they don't have. That's where Gilead's purchase of Kite comes in.""It wasn't just a 'one and done' kind of an acquisition. … It was more of a long-term play with multiple product opportunities, and we could see this playing out for decades to come,"" Gilead CEO John Milligan said on a conference call with analysts following the purchase announcement.Even with sales of its hepatitis C products crimped, revenue is growing from Gilead's HIV/AIDS drugs. The company is expected to end the year with revenue of $24 billion to $25.5 billion, down from $30.4 billion last year.Gilead is the No. 3 company by market cap among the 453 companies in IBD's biotechnology industry group, trailing leader Amgen (AMGN) and just behind Celgene.Gilead has ""a substantial balance sheet where they could help fund the launch (of Kite products) in Europe, help expand Kite's manufacturing capacity beyond its facility in El Segundo (Calif.) and help propel other early-stage projects forward,"" Jefferies analyst Biren Amin told IBD.In return, Amin said, Gilead gets ""an early- to midstage oncology pipeline, which they didn't have. Kite allows them to diversify away from hepatitis C longer term.""Kite isn't saying how much it will charge for its treatment until the product is approved, but Amin said analysts estimate costs will range from $250,000 to $300,000 for one person's full course of the therapy. The company has built the capacity to produce between 4,000 and 5,000 patient therapies a year, Kite spokeswoman Christine Cassiano said.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to make a decision on Kite's axi-cel drug by Nov. 29. Kite hasn't disclosed a brand name for the drug.If that timeline holds, Kite's drug could reach blockbuster status — annual sales of $1 billion or more — in 2020, according to Amin.Kite won't be the first biotech company to receive FDA approval for a CAR-T drug. Novartis got the green light from the FDA on Aug. 30 for its therapy for certain types of leukemia in children and young adults.If Kite's axi-cel drug is approved by the FDA, it will become the first therapy of its kind to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients with advanced cases of the disease. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of blood cancer that originates in the immune system.The therapy involves extracting and filtering a patient's blood to remove key components of the immune system called T cells, and engineering those cells in the lab so they express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that is programmed to escort intruder-destroying T cells directly to proteins found on the surface of cancer cells. These modified T cells are infused back into the patient, where they multiply and become the body's cancer fighters.Researchers affiliated with the National Institutes of Health developed the early science that underpins the process and, in 2012, licensed it to Kite. Kite is one of about a dozen biotech firms that have received permission to use the agency's version of the technology, according to Amin.Kite's study found that about eight months after a single infusion of their treatment was administered, 39% of patients with advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma for whom chemotherapy no longer worked were in complete remission, with no sign of malignancy.""There's no rocket science there,"" said Kite's Chang about the company's multistep manufacturing process, which he said takes 17 days ""vein to vein."" That, he says, is the shortest turnaround time among companies trying to develop their own versions of a CAR-T drug.There is an art to the manufacturing process, and observers say Kite's deft approach and high success rate in its clinical trials has set the company apart.""One thing we paid a lot of attention to was making sure that every manufacturing was as successful so that there is a cell product to be given back to the patient,"" Chang said. ""We were able to treat everybody who enrolled in our clinical study, with the exception of a single patient. That's one out of 111 patients — or less than 1% — who was not able to be treated.""Kite aims to automate more of the drug development process as part of a collaboration with General Electric (GE) offshoot GE Global Research. The initiative could help Kite reduce manufacturing costs, speed up processing time and minimize variability in the results. Kite also is researching ways to change how the cells are manipulated with growth factors to make the supercharged cells more effective once they are returned to the patient, Chang said.The company is investigating how to equip a person's cells so they are able to ""go after"" more than just one type of cancer, he said. Kite is even looking to develop an ""off the shelf"" CAR-T product that could be used by any patient, he says.""When we talk about innovation, it's about execution as well as making the right choices, hopefully, to guide on your programs,"" said analyst Amin. ""They're doing that.""RELATED:Besides Kite Pharma, Which Companies Rose To IBD Biotech Innovators Status?Get The Details On All 6 Biotech Innovator Award-Winning Companies And Their WorkBluebird Is Among The Biotech Stocks Near New HighsWhy Biotech Stocks Had A Catch-Up RallyWill Novartis Acquire This Company?

816,NOV,"People who preorder the iPhone X starting Oct. 27 might have to wait as long as two months before they get their new Apple (AAPL) handset, an analyst said Friday.Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz echoed the concerns of others on Wall Street who believe the iPhone X will be in very short supply when it goes on sale Nov. 3, a week after preorders begin.Supply challenges could increase iPhone X delivery times on preorders to six to eight weeks, Moskowitz said in a report. Apple bulls will cheer that news as a sign of high demand, but that will be difficult to verify until the supply improves, he said.""We expect industry and media noise over supply chain constraints impacting iPhone X volumes to persist into the first half of calendar 2018,"" Moskowitz said. ""Our research indicates near-term headwinds due to some components. The forces, however, stand to ease by June-quarter 2018, setting the stage for bigger year-over-year unit growth as well as richer ASP (average selling price) and gross margin trends.""Moskowitz reiterated his equal weight, or neutral, rating on Apple stock, but raised his price target to 161 from 146.Apple shares rose 0.6% to 156.99 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has been forming a flat base with a buy point of 165.04 for the past six weeks.

820,NOV,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 8 series handsets are significantly underperforming prior new iPhone launches, a new survey reveals.Consumer Intelligence Research Partners on Monday said the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus accounted for 16% of total U.S. iPhone sales in the September quarter.During the same time frame last year, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus together accounted for 43% of sales. Two years ago, the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus represented 24% of sales. And, three years ago, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were 46% of sales in their launch quarter, CIRP said.""In terms of consumer demand and reception, the 8 and 8 Plus have a share of total sales that makes them look much more like an 'S' model,"" CIRP partner Josh Lowitz said in a news release. ""This is not surprising, as the form factor remained the same, and the improvements in features were incremental and internal.""Apple skipped its usual S model release this year. Traditionally Apple has released an S model, which features incremental improvements over the prior generation, every other year.This year, instead of an iPhone 7S series, Apple jumped right to the iPhone 8. Further complicating matters, Apple decided to release a second new model, the iPhone X, which is due out on Nov. 3.""It seems when Apple announced the forthcoming iPhone X, it changed the market dynamic, and probably depressed demand for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus,"" CIRP partner Mike Levin said in a prepared statement.

821,NOV,"With a year-to-date return of over 29.34%, Columbia Select Large Cap Growth Fund (UMLGX) is poised to end the year on a high note — doubling the performance of its Russell 1000 Growth benchmark and nearly doubling the S&P 500's 16.07% as of Oct. 16.This year's solid performance comes after a volatile 2016 full of macroeconomic events — like Brexit and the U.S. presidential election. Fund manager Thomas Galvin said the market has finally recalibrated its valuations for the type of quality growth stocks that the fund seeks, particularly in the technology and health care sectors. This has helped drive the fund's stellar performance.XQuality growth stocks are financially strong companies with compelling fundamental stories.The fund, comanaged by Richard Carter and Todd Herget, weights positions in its holdings based on the fund managers' level of conviction in the company. The conviction-weighted portfolio represents the management team's best ideas that could lead to significant price appreciation.The fund has seen significant success this year with high sector weightings in health care, technology and consumer cyclical. But in the latest reported quarter — as of Aug. 31 — the fund is reducing some of its exposure to the tech and health care sectors.As of Aug. 31, the fund had positions in 33 names. Of those 33 stocks, the IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner has made strong bets on two FANG stocks — Facebook (FB) and Amazon.com (AMZN) — and China-based Alibaba (BABA), amounting to almost 13% of the overall portfolio. These three firms are representative of the fund's search for high-quality secular growth stories.Facebook exemplifies what Galvin is looking for in companies, touting 17 consecutive better-than-expected quarterly earnings results and global brand awareness. Facebook's main site, Instagram and WhatsApp have unmatched global scale and allow precise targeting for advertisers.In the latest quarter, year-over-year earnings increased 69%, while revenue bumped up 45%. Looking forward to the current quarter — to be reported on Nov. 1 after the market close — analysts expect the firm's earnings to rise 42% on a 40% increase in sales.The social media giant moved past its 129.37 cup-with-handle buy point on Jan. 24 and never looked back. At its July 27 peak, the stock had advanced over 52% year to date. Now, the IBD 50 stock has formed a flat base with a 175.59 buy point. Shares are less than 3% away from the entry in the stock market today.The ""Amazon Effect"" has seen Amazon expand into a multitude of industries, including grocery stores with the late-summer acquisition of Whole Foods Market. Amazon is in the process of radically disrupting and transforming the e-commerce industry, to the benefit of its shareholders.Up until late July, Amazon was a top performing large-cap growth stock in 2017. On Feb. 16, the stock broke out above an 843.94 cup-with-handle entry. From there, the stock advanced as much as 28% to its record high on July 27.After suffering an earnings setback on that day — quarterly earnings declined 78% year over year — the stock would go on to fall 14% from its record high on Sept. 26 before rebounding. Now, the stock has gotten back above the 1,000 price level, and is forming a potential flat base with a 1083.41 buy point.Meanwhile, the fund also has an over-4% position in China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA). Alibaba has been one of the top leading growth stocks of 2017, rising more than 75% from a 104.67 classic cup-with-handle buy point. The stock pulled back to is 50-day moving average Monday, where it's testing support. It's 2.3% below a 177.10 ascending-base entry.Into the end of the year, the fund managers remain optimistic about chances that the fund will close out the year strongly. Galvin believes that unless there is an economic recession lurking around the corner, the market will continue to drift higher. Global economic growth and strong U.S. employment — the jobless rate is at a 16 year low — should create more upside potential for profit growth, leading to higher equity prices. However, the Nasdaq has already risen almost 23% this year, so potential upside may be more limited.The technology sector should remain strong through Q3 earnings season. Despite the expectation of continued strength, the fund has been reducing positions in that sector due to natural profit-taking.The fund is overweight in the consumer cyclical sector with Tractor Supply (TSCO) one of its newly added positions.Tractor Supply has rebounded in recent months after hitting multiyear lows in July 2017, but no proper buy point has emerged.RELATED:Looking For Top-Performing Mutual Funds?

822,NOV,"The stock market kept going down in afternoon dealings as indexes traded at session lows and small-caps lagged noticeably.XThe Dow Jones industrial average was down a fraction, buoyed in part by several Dow components that made new highs, such as Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Wal-Mart (WMT) and Intel (INTC). J&J has been rallying since it reported earnings last week. Wal-Mart is extended from an 82.09 buy point cleared in an Oct. 10 breakout.Cisco Systems (CSCO) followed through on Friday's breakout, adding nearly 1%. Trading was slower than usual for Cisco, despite it confirming reports that it will acquire BroadSoft (BSFT). The value of the deal was put at $1.9 billion. Shares of BroadSoft, a telecom software company, climbed less than 2% in huge volume.The Nasdaq was down 0.3% and the S&P 500 fell 0.2%. But the Russell 2000 was off 0.5%. After leading the market from mid-August to early October, the small-cap index has been stalled sideways. Regional banks were broadly weaker in today's trading, which contributed to the Russell's woes.Airline, internet content, media and some consumer industry groups were at the bottom of the day's performance table. The energy sector also was weak although the price of crude oil was little changed at just under $52 a barrel.LogMeIn (LOGM) broke out of a cup-with-handle base, topping the 121.35 buy point in heavy trading. The teleconferencing and remote-access software company will announce earnings Thursday after the close. Analysts expect a profit of $1.11 a share.That's about double its year-ago profit, but it includes the merger, completed in January, with Citrix Systems' (CTXS) GetGo subsidiary.Ball (BLL) rose past the 42.73 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. Volume was about one-third more than usual. Ball will announce Q3 results before the market's open on Nov. 3. Ball is an odd combination of low-tech products, such as beverage cans and aerosol dispensers, and high-tech defense systems.YPF (YPF) made a breakout from another cup with handle, this one with a 23.32 buy point. Volume was more than triple the average. YPF was part of a rally in Argentine stocks after President Mauricio Macri saw his ruling coalition make important strides in elections over the weekend, which could pave the way for economic reforms.The Global X MSCI Argentina (ARGT) ETF was up more than 2%, near an all-time high.RELATED:Cisco Will Buy BroadSoft For $1.9 Billion; Tesla Nearing China Deal?

Volume is running mildly above average. The solar power systems supplier to utilities broke out of a deep bottoming base last summer and tried to break out past a 50.31 buy point in September. Since then, the Tempe, Ariz., midcap stock has encountered stiff resistance near 50 for weeks.Earnings are expected to plunge 56% to $2.21 a share this year, then fall an additional 42% to $1.28 in 2018.

837,NOV,"As shares of Thor Industries (THO) surged the morning of Aug. 28, the stock was added to IBD's Leaderboard. Moments later, that decision was already being second-guessed.X In the first hour of trading that day, the maker of RVs topped the 110.01 buy point of a cup-with-handle base and volume swelled. Institutional investors were rushing to buy shares as they watched the devastation of Hurricane Harvey in the Houston region, and figured that demand would surge for travel trailers and other temporary housing.IBD market writers saw the same scenario and, more important, recognized a buy signal as Thor broke out (1). The stock, which had been on the Leaderboard watch list, was rapidly moved to the Leaders List.But just as Leaderboard subscribers were getting their email alerts, the stock was backsliding. It soon dipped below the buy point, and the Leaderboard staff started wondering if it had been suckered into a head fake. The next several days would make for a nervous period as Thor foundered below the buy point.Yet, there was never a sell signal, such as a drop of 7% to 8% from the buy point, or a break of the 50-day moving average. The lack of those signals kept the stock on Leaderboard, and served as guardrails against reacting emotionally.The day after the breakout offered some hope: Shares held above the previous day's low, and the price drop was minor (2). Thor also was holding above its 50-day moving average.After frustratingly small gains the following three days, there was a chance to exhale Sept. 5 (3). Shares climbed back above the 110.01 buy point. Volume was 76% more than average. That gave Leaderboard editors some confidence.Several more days passed, and Thor still was not gaining altitude. Two weeks after the breakout, Thor had gone nowhere. There was more hand-wringing at Leaderboard, but again no sell signals, so we held firm.By this time, the stock was testing the 10-day moving average, a level where leading stocks normally find support after their breakouts. On Nov. 13, Thor jumped 1.7% in active trading, giving itself a bit of breathing room above the entry (4). That day was pivotal because from then on, the stock stayed above the entry for good.Then, just as Thor gathered momentum, a big test loomed with the company's earnings report Sept. 27. A bad report, and all that work could come undone. But because there was a cushion, the stock stayed on Leaderboard. It turned out to be the right call, as Thor beat expectations and shares rallied.Today, the stock is approaching a 20% profit target, invoking a rule that controls the greed that may cause investors to hold a stock too long. Because the base count reset itself this year, Thor may stay on Leaderboard even after it reaches that goal.Buying stocks often presents difficult situations. Careful thought and rules are needed to make the right decisions. With Leaderboard, investors can get the necessary guidance, as market specialists study the selected stocks and annotate charts with the latest signals.

838,NOV,"Biogen (BIIB), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) will build on momentum in the biotech sphere to beat Wall Street expectations for the third quarter, an analyst predicted Friday.X""Large-cap biotech stocks have been strong as we head into the third-quarter reporting period,"" Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young wrote in a note to clients. She is focused on Biogen's Spinraza, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (REGN) Dupixent and Gilead's hepatitis C drugs.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Investor's Business Daily's 453-company Biotech industry group dipped a collective 0.8%. But the group is ranked first out of 197 groups tracked by IBD and hit a 22-month high earlier in the week.That momentum will likely continue into the third quarter for most large-caps, Young said. She calls for Biogen, Gilead, Sarepta and possibly United Therapeutics (UTHR) to beat on the top line.Biogen is set to report its quarterly results early on Oct. 24. Young calls for Spinraza, a spinal muscular atrophy drug developed with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), to beat the consensus view for $250 million. She forecasts $356 million in sales.The Cure SMA website reports that an estimated 2,000 U.S. patients have been dosed with Spinraza as of the third quarter, 450 of whom were in trials or expanded-access programs, Young wrote. That suggests that there were about 1,550 commercial U.S. patients as of the period. She sees 1,400 U.S. patients on Spinraza in the third quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks have trended north over the past several weeks amid a healthy dose of good news for several key players. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at which stocks helped send the group to a 22-month high.""We do think at some point Spinraza could surprise to the downside as patients switch to the much less expensive maintenance dose vs. the loading dose,"" she said. ""However, we think this quarter Spinraza will very much still be in its launch phase.""On the top line, Young models Biogen reporting $3.11 billion in sales and adjusted income of $6.08 per share. Both metrics top the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $3.03 billion and $5.68, respectively.The multiple sclerosis franchise is likely to face more headwinds, though. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. Tecfidera's total prescriptions fell 4% in the third quarter with no price increases. As a result, Young's model for Tecfidera is $35 million below the consensus view.Young forecasts Gilead beating third-quarter expectations on strong sales of drugs to treat hepatitis C and HIV — helping the biotech shuck off quarters of hepatitis C malaise. Still, AbbVie's (ABBV) new hepatitis C regimen could have an impact. Gilead is set to report late on Oct. 26.AbbVie's Mavyret gained approved in August to treat all genotypes of hepatitis C patients. It's typically dosed over eight weeks — a shorter duration than rival drugs — and is priced at roughly half the price of its competitors, on a wholesale basis.For that reason, Young dropped her 2018 forecast for Gilead's hepatitis C drug sales to $6.4 billion from $7.8 billion to factor in risk from AbbVie. But she remains bullish on the third quarter, where she models $6.57 billion in total sales, above consensus views for $6.37 billion.Her forecast is driven by consensus-topping views for $1.18 billion in sales of Harvoni and $1.12 billion in sales of Epclusa. But HIV estimates are largely in line with consensus views. She models a miss on HIV drug Truvada, with an estimate that's $125 million below the consensus due to the entry of generics outside the U.S.On the bottom line, Young calls for adjusted profit of $2.26 per share vs. the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks for $2.07.Young calls for Regeneron and Sarepta to narrowly beat Wall Street forecasts, benefiting from eczema drug Dupixent and Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug Exondys 51, respectively.Regeneron, which is set to report its earnings early on Nov. 8, could deliver a slight beat vs. the consensus for its Sanofi (SNY)-partnered eczema drug. Young models $86 million in sales of Dupixent, down from her earlier view for $111 million, but above the Street's $73 million.Dupixent's weekly total prescriptions are up an average 153% in the third quarter vs. the prior period. Dupixent ended the third quarter with 2,398 outstanding total prescriptions, Young wrote. She forecasts 155% quarter-over-quarter growth for the drug.But her third-quarter model for Eylea, approved to treat a number of eye conditions, is $920 million, which trails the consensus for $936 million.Sarepta could, again, surprise to the upside with Exondys 51. In the second quarter, Sarepta crushed expectations by $13 million. For the third quarter, Young calls for $43 million in Exondys 51 sales, above the consensus for $40 million.Further full-year guidance for $125 million to $130 million in sales is likely conservative, Young said, noting that ""management sounds upbeat about launch trends.""RELATED:AbbVie's New Hepatitis C Drug Chipping Away At Gilead's ShareThis Biotech Broke Out To An 11-Month High — Can It Keep Going?Why Regeneron's Patent Win Is Worse For Amgen Than You Think

855,NOV,"Apple (AAPL) on Tuesday rolled out its 11th-generation iPhones, including its first with an OLED screen and wireless charging, in what company officials claimed was their greatest technological advance in smartphones since Apple's first was introduced a decade ago.X""This is a huge step forward,"" Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said at the company's fall product launch event. He called the company's new flagship handset, iPhone X, ""the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone.""The iPhone X will set the standard for smartphone technology for the next decade, Cook said. The premium-model smartphone has a 5.8-inch OLED display, and is called the iPhone X to commemorate the 10th anniversary of its first iPhone. The X in the iPhone X is pronounced ""ten"" to denote the Roman numeral, not ""ex.""Apple also showed off its new LCD-screen smartphones with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays, called the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, respectively. The iPhone 8 handsets have faster chips and better cameras than last year's iPhone 7 series.The iPhone X and iPhone 8 series phones feature wireless charging and augmented reality, or AR, capabilities. Apple demonstrated a couple of AR games that will be playable on the phones. It also showed an AR app from messaging service Snap (SNAP).The iPhone X will start at $999 and will be available for pre-order on Oct. 27, with availability starting on Nov. 3. Apple shares dropped on the news that the phone will ship several weeks later than expected.Pricing on the iPhone 8 will start at $699 and the Plus model will start at $799. Both will be available on Sept. 22.The iPhone X has no physical home button on the front of the device. Most home-button functions were incorporated into the display. However, Apple left off the fingerprint sensor because it had difficulty integrating it into the screen.Further, the iPhone X uses facial recognition technology called Face ID to unlock the device. The facial recognition technology also powers animated 3D emojis called ""Animojis."" Animojis are custom animated messages that match the facial expressions of users and can include their voice. The Animojis include various animal faces, such as cat, dog and monkey, plus robot and alien emojis.""The iPhone X. This really is the future,"" Cook said.Earlier at the event, Apple rolled out its next-generation smartwatch, the Apple Watch Series 3, and a new TV set-top box capable of streaming ultra-high-definition video, called the Apple TV 4K.The Apple Watch Series 3 has built-in LTE cellular connectivity, so it doesn't need to be near an iPhone for full functionality.With the Apple Watch Series 3, people can make and receive calls on their wrist device. It also can access the internet for data applications. The watch will have the same number as your iPhone so you don't need to manage a separate phone number.Apple Watch Series 3 will be available Sept. 22 starting at $399. Apple also is offering a version without cellular for $329.The third-generation smartwatch has more health and fitness features than its predecessor. The wrist device includes activity coaching, an enhanced heart-rate app, and smart notifications about abnormal heart rates and rhythms.The Apple Watch Series 3 has a faster processor and spoken Siri responses instead of just text responses. It also has an altimeter sensor for tracking heights climbed. The device is roughly the same size as the Series 2 watches.With Apple Music on the watch, users can stream 40 million songs from their wrist to their Bluetooth wireless headphones.The consumer electronics giant also trotted out its next-generation TV set-top box. The Apple TV 4K is designed to have a faster processor for better graphics performance. It also streams video in high dynamic range, or HDR, quality.Apple kicked off its fall product launch event with Chief Executive Tim Cook welcoming media and analysts to the company's splashy new $5 billion headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.The event was held in the circular Steve Jobs Theater located just outside the giant ring-shaped main building, which some have likened to a futuristic spaceship. The design of the new headquarters was one of the last projects overseen by Apple's iconic co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs, who died in October 2011.The event opened with audio of Jobs talking about Apple's vision, followed by sentimental comments from Cook reflecting on his friend and mentor. Jobs envisioned the new Apple Park campus as ""an incredible workplace of the future,"" Cook said.Angela Ahrendts, Apple senior vice president of retail, discussed big new stores coming from Apple and the company's goal to make its stores into community centers.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 92, meaning it has outperformed 92% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more analysis of Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Recent Apple product launches have been light on surprises because the tech media and Apple enthusiasts have become expert at sussing out hardware specifications and software features from the company's supply chain partners and software developer network.As a result, Apple stock dipped 0.4% to 160.82 on the stock market today after rising as high as 163.96 and falling as low as 158.77. Apple shares have declined on seven of the last nine days that the company has held major iPhone launch events.Questions about pricing and availability hang over the iPhone X. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Monday that Apple's OLED iPhone model will be severely supply constrained for some time because of production issues.The iPhone X starts at $999, vs. $769 for the iPhone 7 Plus today. Higher pricing would create near-term downside risk for Apple stock, UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said in a note to clients Tuesday.""We expect OLED (iPhone X) entry pricing may be lower at $900 than some think or at most $1,000,"" Milunovich said. ""It is easier to argue for higher earnings with a higher (average selling price) though we think this overlooks the potential negative demand effect of a high price.""He maintained his buy rating on Apple stock with a 12-month price target of 180.Macquarie Research analyst Benjamin Schachter thinks augmented reality will be a key selling point of the new iPhone.""AR will be key feature for marketing,"" he said in a note to clients Monday. ""Unlike VR (virtual reality), AR's 'wow factor' can be communicated easily via video advertising.""Augmented reality also could give Apple's services revenue a lift as software developers start writing AR apps for the device. Schachter rates Apple stock as outperform with a price target of 180.RELATED:How A Cellular Apple Watch Could Boost AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, SprintWireless Operators Could Be Stingy On iPhone 8 Deals: Analyst

That's up from 75% in Piper Jaffray's spring teen survey.""The rising level of interest and ownership in consoles is a clear positive for the game publishers (Activision, EA, Take-Two) as it speaks to the console cycle's potential to drive (software) growth in the remainder of 2017 and 2018,"" Olson said.The fourth most anticipated game is ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" from Electronic Arts (EA) at 7% of votes, followed by ""Super Mario Odyssey"" from Nintendo (NTDOY) with 6%.""Destiny 2"" was released on Sept. 6.

And 25% said they watch esports, professional video game matches.""This bodes well for esports, as more organized and widely broadcast events are scheduled to launch over the next year,"" Olson said.RELATED:Video Game Stocks 'Heading Into Choppy Waters,' Analyst SaysCan Esports' Armchair Gladiators Vanquish Hulking NFL Players?

872,NOV,"One Wall Street investment bank says its surveys of consumers in the U.S. and China show a strong pent-up demand for Apple's (AAPL) 11th-generation iPhones.XBased on the results of the surveys, conducted after Apple introduced its new handsets on Sept. 12, Morgan Stanley on Wednesday raised its price target on Apple stock to 199 from 194 and reiterated its overweight rating. Apple shares ended the day up 0.4% to close at 156.55 on the stock market today.The pent-up demand for new iPhones is being driven by the aging installed base of handsets, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said in a note to clients.The percentage of iPhones in use that are two or more generations old is at a peak level, she said. Some 63% of iPhones are two or more years old, Huberty said.Replacement cycles have extended in recent years as consumers have gotten more value out of their current phones and waited for a good reason to upgrade, she said.Morgan Stanley's October U.S. survey found that the percentages of customers loyal to iPhone and switching to iPhone have increased since its April survey. The percentage of iPhone users planning to stick with the brand increased to 94% from 92%, while the percentage of non-iPhone users planning to buy an iPhone rose to 14% from 12%.Among those planning to buy a new iPhone, 20% expect to get the premium iPhone X, while 23% plan to get the iPhone 8 and 16% plan to get the iPhone 8 Plus. The rest expect to buy lower-priced, prior-generation models.The LCD-screen iPhone 8 series phones, which have display sizes of 4.7 and 5.5 inches, went on sale Sept. 22. The 5.8-inch OLED-screen iPhone X goes on sale Nov. 3.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 69, meaning it has outperformed 69% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more analysis of Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Morgan Stanley's latest U.S. consumer survey also showed surprisingly strong demand for the Apple Watch smartwatch.""While iPhone contributes the majority of revenue and profits, Apple Watch is growing in importance, potentially doubling revenue contribution to Apple top line in the next two years,"" Huberty said.The U.S. survey found that 21% of total respondents and 29% of iPhone owners plan to buy an Apple Watch in the next year. About two-thirds expect to purchase the Apple Watch Series 3 with built-in cellular connectivity, she said.Meanwhile, brokerage firm Piper Jaffray on Wednesday released the results of its latest survey of U.S. teenagers. It found record high levels of iPhone ownership among America's teens.Out of more than 6,000 respondents, 78% have an iPhone, up from 76% in Piper Jaffray's spring survey of teens. Apple's share of teen smartphone ownership has increased for five consecutive surveys, Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said in a report.""The iPhone may have room to move higher with 82% of teens anticipating their next phone to be an iPhone, also the highest ever recorded in our survey (up from 81% in spring 2017),"" Olson said.Olson reiterated his overweight rating on Apple stock with a price target of 196.RELATED:Apple iPhone X Supercycle Might Not Materialize: AnalystThis Could Push Apple To $1 Trillion Market Cap, Analyst SaysApple Seen Benefiting From Trump Tax Plan, Boosting SharesApple Grapples With iPhone X Delay Rumors, iPhone 8 Flaw Reports

873,NOV,"While many Wall Street analysts predict Apple's (AAPL) upcoming iPhone X will kick off a ""supercycle"" of upgrade activity, others aren't convinced.Richard Windsor, an analyst with Edison Investment Research, is among the skeptics. In a report Tuesday, he said the iPhone X is unlikely to produce the supercycle needed to support Apple's current stock price.Apple stock inched up 6 cents to close at 155.90 on the stock market today.""Expectations for the iPhone X are at fever pitch and a supercycle is now required to prevent a sell-off in the shares,"" Windsor said. He doesn't see that happening because the iPhone X just isn't that dramatically different from its predecessors.The iPhone X, pronounced 10 as in the Roman numeral, features a 5.8-inch OLED display and a facial-recognition security feature. It is scheduled to go on sale starting Nov. 3.""We do not think the iPhone X will stimulate a big enough uptick in replacement rates to meet the expectation that Apple will ship more than 255 million units in its next fiscal year,"" Windsor said. He predicts that Apple will ship, at most, 245 million units in the next fiscal year.The utility of the iPhone X is similar to last year's iPhone 7 handsets, but with a starting price of $999 it is much more expensive, he said.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has been forming a new base over the past six weeks with a buy point of 165.04.""We think expectations for fiscal 2018 need to come back somewhat, which is likely to trigger a sell-off in the shares, bringing the valuation down somewhat,"" Windsor said. ""Hence, the time is right to take some money off the table and put it somewhere else.""Among big techs, Windsor prefers Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), Baidu (BIDU) and Microsoft (MSFT), which have less immediate downside than Apple, he said.RELATED:This Could Push Apple To $1 Trillion Market Cap, Analyst Says

874,NOV,"Federal Reserve officials held a detailed debate last month over whether forces holding inflation down were persistent or temporary, with several policy makers looking for stronger evidence of price gains before supporting a third interest-rate hike this year.""Many participants expressed concern that the low inflation readings this year might reflect not only transitory factors, but also the influence of developments that could prove more persistent,"" according to minutes of the Sept. 19-20 meeting, released Wednesday in Washington.Several policy makers said their decision on whether to raise rates this year ""would depend importantly on whether the economic data in coming months increased their confidence"" on inflation rising toward their 2% target.At the meeting, the U.S. central bank left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged while projecting another increase before the end of the year and announcing an October start for a gradual unwind of its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. The minutes suggest that the forecast for another rate increase in 2017 is conditioned on economic data showing that the inflation target is within reach over the next couple of years.""It was noted that some patience in removing policy accommodation while assessing trends in inflation was warranted,"" the minutes said.Before the release of the minutes, investors saw about a 78% probability of one more rate increase by the end of the year, according to pricing in fed funds futures markets. Fed officials have meetings scheduled on Oct. 31-Nov. 1 and Dec. 12- 13.Getting a clear read on economic data may be difficult as some prices, such as gasoline, are affected by recent natural disasters in the U.S. The Fed's post-meeting statement on Sept. 20 said the hurricanes would affect the economy in the near term but were ""unlikely to materially alter"" its course over the medium term.The minutes said Fed policy makers expected third-quarter growth ""to be held down by the severe disruptions caused by the storms but to rebound beginning in the fourth quarter as rebuilding got under way and economic activity in the affected areas resumed.""Even though the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have deemed tax reform a top priority, most Fed participants had either not assumed any fiscal stimulus in their projections made in September, the minutes said, ""or had marked down the expected magnitude of any stimulus.""When officials met last month, they were grappling with low unemployment that hadn't translated into consistently higher wages or inflation, while buoyant asset markets have kept financial conditions easy.Many officials said U.S. financial conditions would support the economic expansion, while a couple of participants ""expressed concern that the persistence of highly accommodative financial conditions could, over time, pose risks to financial stability,"" the minutes said.U.S. unemployment dipped to 4.2% in September, the lowest since 2001, while average hourly earnings rose 2.9% on a year-over-year basis, a pickup that may be partly related to effects from two major hurricanes. Fed officials expected employment to be ""temporarily depressed"" by the storms; data last week showed payrolls fell in September for the first time since 2010.The Fed's preferred gauge of prices rose by 1.4% in the 12 months through August and has been below policy makers' 2% target for most of the last five years.In quarterly projections prepared for the meeting, policy makers forecast a labor market running hot, with the jobless rate at 4.1% in the final three months of 2018 and 2019. That's below the 4.6% rate they estimate as the longer-run sustainable rate of unemployment that keeps supply and demand in balance. The minutes said ""many"" participants ""continued to believe"" that labor-market pressures would show through to higher inflation eventually.The committee also discussed trends that could be holding inflation lower such as technological innovations and their impact on business pricing.""Several expressed concern that the persistence of low rates of inflation might imply that the underlying trend was running below 2% , risking a decline in inflation expectations,"" the minutes said. ""If so, the appropriate policy path should take into account the need to bolster inflation expectations in order to ensure that inflation returned to 2%.""

875,NOV,"Apple (AAPL) gained ground and was on the verge of climbing back above a 156.75 buy point as the iPhone giant helped bump the major indexes higher in afternoon trading Wednesday.XApple had broken out of an 11-week flat base at 156.75 on Aug. 2 following a solid fiscal third quarter. (EPS rose 18% and revenue 7%, the biggest top-line increase in seven quarters.) The stock is now forming a new flat base with a 165.04 buy point.At 2:30 p.m. EDT, the Nasdaq composite edged less than 0.1% higher but still held on to last week's gain of more than 1.4%. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average were both up less than 0.1%.Breadth remains positive in the equities market, with winners topping losers by a roughly 4-3 margin in the NYSE and by approximately 100 issues on the Nasdaq.The Nasdaq 100 also rose 0.1%. The Russell 2000 was virtually flat, but the S&P SmallCap 600 was off nearly 0.3%. Volume is running mildly lower vs. the same time Tuesday on both main exchanges.Apple had not gained a lot of ground, rising 5.2% after its Aug. 2 breakout at 156.75, before falling back to the proper entry and sinking below the 50-day moving average. While the rise back above the 156.75 is not an ideal entry right now, an investor with a big cushion in the iPhone maker could decide to add a small amount of shares to the existing position if the stock retakes the 50-day line in robust or increasing turnover.Apple's earnings had dropped 10% in the fiscal year ended in September 2016 on an 8% slump in revenue. However, Apple has been staging a classic turnaround in fundamentals lately. In the past three quarters, the iMac maker's earnings rose 2%, 11% and 18% vs. year-ago levels, following a three-quarter slump. And in Q4 (ended in September), earnings are seen increasing 12% to $1.87 a share, which would mark a third quarter in a row of mild double-digit gains. It's slated to report Q4 results on Nov. 2 after the market close.For fiscal year 2019, the Street sees earnings accelerating 23% to $11.04 a share.When Apple reports earnings this month, keep an eye out for a potential increase in either its dividend or stock-buyback plans. The current annualized yield is 1.6%, still trailing the S&P 500 (currently near 1.9%), but Apple's payout growth rate is estimated at 24% annually.On IBD Stock Checkup, Apple has seen its Composite Rating rise from 51 at the start of 2017 to 69. By itself, that's not a great number, and growth investors will want to seek those companies with a minimum Composite grade of 95 or higher (on a scale of 1 to 99) in order to find the fastest movers among the market's leadership. However, Apple's Relative Price Strength Rating has improved to a decent 78, up from 59 on Jan. 1.Apple has risen as much as 39% after breaking out of a first-stage cup with handle on Jan. 6-9 at 118.12. That cup with handle, which formed from October to early January, was part of a long bottoming-base pattern that typically forms among stocks that suffer a deep decline as fundamentals soften; then it bottoms out and gets prepared for a potential new stock run to 52-week highs.Fellow Nasdaq component Alphabet (GOOGL), which has launched a major advertising campaign for its new smart speaker called Google Home Mini, rose more than 1% and breached the 1,000 level for the first time since July 24. That gain places the megacap internet search giant in a good position to potentially break out from a new flat base with a 1,006.29 buy point.Alphabet's earnings have risen 27%, 7%, 28%, and 27% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. The Street expects Q3 profit to rise 15% to $8.32 a share.Alphabet, whose market value of $694 billion trails only Apple ($808 billion) within the Nasdaq, is also seen growing the top line at an impressive clip: up 21% to $27.16 billion in the just-ended third quarter and up 20% in Q4 to $31.22 billion.Elsewhere, Delta Air Lines (DAL) ramped up 1% to 53.26 in fast turnover and added more work to the right side of a new base. The Atlanta-based air transport giant reported a 6% rise in third-quarter revenue to $11.06 billion, matching the biggest increase in 12 quarters. Earnings slipped 8% to $1.57 a share but were still mildly above the consensus forecast.Airlines were among the day's best industry groups, joining steel, steel alloys, metal distributors, diversified medical and internet content firms.In the IBD 50, Nvidia (NVDA) gained 1% to 190.84 and has now stretched its gain from a 174.66 buy point in a flat base to more than 9%.The fast-growing maker of GPUs (graphics processing units) and chip sets for new industries, including deep learning and self-driving cars, is No. 9 in the IBD 50. Earnings in the October-ending fiscal third quarter are seen growing 13% to 94 cents a share, on top of an 89% leap in the year-ago quarter.Nvidia is also making gains since its addition to IBD's Swing Trader service.In other financial markets, oil continued to rally. WTI near-term futures gained nearly 0.7% to $51.26 a barrel. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond eased a bit to 2.34%, but is still up sharply from its Sept. 7 near-term low of 2.05%. Fed funds futures currently see a 90% chance that the Federal Reserve will boost short-term interest rates by a quarter point at its Dec. 12-13 meeting.The Fed is slated to release minutes from its October meeting on interest rates at 2 p.m. EDT.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 has showcased companies that are the new powerhouses of the U.S. and global economy. Institutional investors seek to find firms with exceptional earnings and sales growth, an outstanding product or service, and the highest pretax margins and return on equity in their industries. As seen in a graph on Page B4 of the IBD Weekly, the price-weighted IBD 50 shows a total return of 750% from April 11, 2003 to Dec. 31, 2016 — equal to an average annual gain of 16.9%. The S&P 500 has risen 242% over the same period.RELATED:Is The Market Toppy? When Will The Major Peak Arrive?

878,NOV,"Recent analyst reports indicate that many Apple (AAPL) customers are opting to buy lower-priced iPhone 7 series phones over the company's new iPhone 8 series and iPhone X handsets.X""Early indications are that demand is shifting from the flagship models (iPhone 8/8 Plus) towards the older models (iPhone 7/7 Plus) relative to 2016,"" Nomura Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal said in a report Tuesday.Apple's 11th-generation handsets are more expensive than their predecessors and sport incremental upgrades such as improved processors, displays and cameras.The iPhone 8 is priced starting at $699, while the larger-screen iPhone 8 Plus starts at $799. Those starting prices are $50 and $30 higher, respectively, than the launch prices of last year's iPhone 7 series phones.Plus, to take advantage of key features of the iPhone 8 series handsets — wireless charging and fast-wired charging — customers will need to buy new peripherals.Apple's fast-wired charging adapter and cable together cost $75, while third-party products cost about $50.

880,NOV,"Bases and breakouts. Stock market follow-throughs. Support at a key moving average. Price resistance and overcoming it.XA trader who wants to win consistently in exchange traded funds can gain a lot in the long run by employing even some basic chart-reading techniques employed by savvy investors in growth stocks. Learning the IBD method for uncovering major market bottoms and peaks will help as well.If you like to trade the broad-based equity indexes, then you can sharpen your buying and selling of the Nasdaq 100-tracking Nasdaq QQQ Trust (QQQ), SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), and SPDR Dow Jones industrial (DIA) ETFs by using the IBD ETF Market Strategy tool.Other Stories In Special ReportMaximize Your Investment Returns With These ETF StrategiesState Street Looks At Future Of ETFs As Industry Milestone NearsLong-Term Retirement Investing StrategiesHow To Invest In A Rising Rate EnvironmentMillennials Buy Low-Cost ETFs To Achieve Investment ObjectivesBuy signals get triggered when, after a significant correction in the market, at least one major market benchmark rises 1.2% or more in higher volume vs. the prior trading session on Day 4 of a new rally attempt or later. IBD calls this kind of significant gain in higher turnover a follow-through. Every major market bottom going back to 1900 started this way.In some cases, IBD will note a follow-through when the gain by either the Nasdaq composite or the S&P 500 is less than 1.2%.The follow-through does not guarantee a big rally is in store, but it's the earliest signal that an investor can get that large investment funds are seriously beginning to accumulate new positions in stocks. And tracking when large investors change behavior is important. Why? They tend to continue buying for months or years, thereby fueling the gains in your investments in stocks and ETFs.The June 30, 2016, follow-through was unique in that it occurred on Day 3 of a new rally attempt. On that session, the S&P 500 rallied 1.4%, the Nasdaq composite gained 1.3%. Volume gushed higher that day on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE (the turnover statistic used for analyzing the health of the S&P 500). On that day, SPY finished the bullish session at 209.48; QQQ closed at 107.54.Both ETFs have since rallied more than 30%. Use the ETF Market Strategy to determine when to sell half your position and when to go 100% cash. IBD Leaderboard features a daily summary of the market's action and uses the Nasdaq composite's chart to annotate the precise time to build or reduce a position in your favorite broad index ETF.What are some excellent tools you may employ to profit from timely moves in sector ETFs — be it an industry sector or a geographical one? Charts, both daily and weekly ones, help you pinpoint the moment in which you have a high chance of making an investment with maximum return and minimum risk.One of the keys to minimizing risk? Cut losses in both stocks and ETFs. Don't let any investment sour to a loss of greater than 7% or 8%. This is the golden rule. Do this every time, and you not only prevent yourself from becoming emotionally invested in a security but also preserve your capital to trade or invest again.IBD's TAKE: Mastering the art and science of growth stock investing may help enhance your returns in exchange traded funds as well. To quickly learn IBD's rules and concepts on how to select, buy and sell growth stocks, please go through the archives of Investor's Corner.That, in essence, is what defines a breakout. A stock, after a nice run, takes a break. But instead of falling sharply, it gives back part of its prior advance. A base forms. The market is steady. And then at some point, the stock breaks out and rapidly runs into new high ground.A leading ETF is capable of rewarding investors in similar fashion. Consider the Global X Lithium ETF (LIT): It gives investors a convenient vehicle to invest in companies that benefit from rising demand for the metal, which is used in high-performance batteries that store energy for electric cars and other machinery.In the IBD Weekly for the Week of July 11, 2016, LIT was one of 26 ETFs highlighted in a table right below the ETF Leaders Index. It sported one of the best Relative Price Strength Ratings on the list at 88.Meanwhile, LIT's weekly chart would have helped you spot several excellent buy points.The first one? In July 2016, LIT was ready for a break. It had already rallied from 17.03 earlier that year to a 52-week high of 25.95, good for a 52% gain. No wonder, then, that the ETF moved sideways for months.But after the Nov. 8 U.S. elections, LIT was ready to rumble. By the end of the year, it completed a six-month saucer-with-handle base. After the new year, LIT broke out in the week that ended Jan. 13, rising 4% to 26.08 and surpassing the 25.91 buy point. In a saucer with handle, the buy point is 10 cents above the highest price within the handle.Notice on a weekly chart how investors rushed into Global X Lithium shares. Volume ballooned 229% above its 10-week average, and was sharply higher than the prior week.Such price-and-volume action was bullish. It gave the savvy ETF trader a strong clue that the big boys and girls in the market — namely, large investment advisors, hedge funds, banks, pensions, college endowments and the like — were anxious to load up on shares.(Keep in mind, however, that IBD research has so far found that volume may not carry as much importance in ETFs as it clearly does in individual stocks. So when judging the overall health of an ETF's current move, focus more on price, not changes in turnover.)Have you heard of that proverbial expression, that in a good breakout a stock moves like the water in a bathtub when a bunch of elephants jump in? It moves up. Fast and furious.And that's exactly what Global X Lithium has done. By Sept. 20 of this year, the ETF has reached as high as 39.83, up 54% from the original saucer-with-handle buy point of 25.91.As seen on the weekly chart, LIT has also bounced off its 10-week moving average along the way. The first two tests of this line (in LIT's case, near 26.57 in mid-March of this year and 28.33 in mid-May) offer great chances to either initiate a new position or add a smaller amount of shares to a winning initial position. In general, don't add more than 20% of the original stake. More-aggressive traders can decide to add a larger percentage.Defensive sell rules are just as important in ETF trading.In the IBD Weekly published for the week of Jan. 9 this year, the ETF Leaders table showed the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services (XES) at the top. At the time, this fund boasted an 86 RS Rating. It finished trading on Jan. 6 at 23.72, good for a 6.1% weekly gain.The good times in January did not last for XES.After a few weeks of treading water, XES skidded lower like a go-cart with greased wheels. From Jan. 26 to Jan. 30, the fund fell 1% or more in three straight trading sessions, losing as much as 8.5% in the process. On that third session, XES also closed just a touch below the 50-day moving average near 22.24.Notice how volume jumped 93% above average on that third down day? IBD compares a stock or ETF's daily volume with its average over the past 50 sessions.XES tried to rally. It gained back some ground in three of the next four sessions, but never came close to reclaiming its 52-week high. When the ETF made another sharp drop through the 50-day line, it was time to sell.By Aug. 17, XES finished the day at 12.96, down 42% from the Jan. 30 close.RELATED:How To Win With Charts: Know The Flat-Base PatternWhen To Buy Key Index ETFs: Use LeaderboardHow To Maximize Your Portfolio Return: Use This Key Sell Rule For Stocks And ETFs

881,NOV,"Apple's (AAPL) upcoming flagship smartphone, the iPhone X, is likely to be in short supply when it officially becomes available on Nov. 3, a Wall Street analyst says.XIn a report issued Wednesday, Raymond James chip analyst Christopher Caso said his supply-chain checks indicate a later production start for the premium handset than previously thought.""Interestingly, while the industry widely anticipated a shift in iPhone ramp timing, our checks suggest there was an incremental delay in the build plans — with orders firmed up as recently as last week — shifting production more into the December quarter,"" Caso said. ""While our checks are ongoing, initial feedback from our meetings suggests that final production of iPhone X has not yet begun, with production expected to commence in mid-October.""The production start is about a month later than expectations a month ago, and about two months later than expectations at the end of June, Caso said, according to Barron's.Apple announced the OLED-screen iPhone X at a media event on Sept. 12, along with two new LCD-screen phones, the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. The iPhone 8-series phones will be available in stores on Friday after a week of preorders.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 85, meaning it has outperformed 85% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more analysis of Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Analysts studying pre-order activity for the iPhone 8 handsets believe that many customers are waiting for the iPhone X, pronounced ""ten"" as in the Roman numeral. Preorders for the iPhone 8-series phones appear well below those of new models in recent years, according to reports by Rosenblatt Securities and KGI Securities.The iPhone 8-series phones are seen as incremental updates to last year's LCD-screen iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. By contrast, the iPhone X has a 5.8-inch OLED screen and a sleek new design. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus have screen sizes of 4.7 and 5.5-inches, respectively.Apple sank 1.7% to close at 153.39 on the stock market today.Apple shares also fell 1.7% on Wednesday on a report of technical problems with its Apple Watch Series 3 smartwatches, which go on sale Friday.

She thinks iPhone sales will be ""well below market expectations"" in fiscal 2018 and 2019. Apple's fiscal 2018 starts Sunday, Oct. 1.Scribner rates Apple stock as hold with a price target of 140. Apple shares fell 0.6% to close at 153.28 on the stock market today.""Historically, Apple's shares trade up into a new iPhone launch and see limited upside post a launch,"" she said. ""Into the iPhone 8/X launch, Apple's shares were up 37% year-to-date, beating the stock's performance into the iPhone 6 launch by 9 percentage points.""IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 74, meaning it has outperformed 74% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more analysis of Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Bullish Apple analysts expect the company's 11th-generation smartphones to kick off a ""supercycle"" of upgrade activity among iPhone users.Apple actually is introducing three new smartphones this fall: iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X. The iPhone 8 series phones went on sale last Friday and are upgraded versions of last year's LCD-screen handsets.The iPhone X, pronounced ""ten"" as in the Roman numeral, is set to go on sale Nov. 3. It features a 5.8-inch OLED display and the biggest redesign since the iPhone 6 came out three years ago.""Street expectations are modeling roughly 245 million iPhones (to) ship in fiscal 2018, which would be a record year for the company,"" Scribner said. ""Moreover, after a strong iPhone 8/X cycle in fiscal 2018, Street estimates expect a repeat in fiscal 2019. We believe it is more likely that unit forecasts decline, similar to the iPhone 6S cycle, and Street estimates for fiscal 2019 need to come down to reflect a more realistic down year following the iPhone 8/X cycle.""RELATED:Apple iPhone X Production Estimate Cut By Wall Street Firm

885,NOV,"The old craftsman's adage preaches, ""Use the right tool for the job."" But every artisan knows how to improvise in a pinch and often discovers in the bargain that the right tool is usually one's brain.So, what if we used Stock Checkup, a premium feature at Investors.com, in order to spot-check the quality of a stock's base? At the very least, it can get you off to a smart start.X Let's study the ETF asset management service company WisdomTree Investments (WETF) during its action in the spring and summer of 2013.At the time, the stock was carving higher in the 10th week of a V-shaped cup base. The base showed a reasonable correction that was 28% deep, and the stock had been climbing the right side for the past four weeks. That base ultimately failed, but a longer, stronger new cup base emerged and this one ultimately led to a profitable breakout.Scan down the Stock Checkup, which IBD readers can access at the Research section on the home page of Investors.com, and you would have found that most of the lights are green, a good sign.Technical factors will always weigh more heavily than fundamentals in scoring the base.On the technical side, WisdomTree got a red light on price, which was trading below 13 a share in late September 2013. It got a caution sign on the Up/Down Volume Ratio, which gauges buying and selling pressure on a stock. That ratio edged up to a neutral 1.0; 1.1 or higher is ideal.One of the most important things that the Stock Checkup tells you is whether you should be looking at other stocks in the group ahead of your current pick.WisdomTree had a solid Composite Rating of 97. Only one higher-rated stock was in the group. WisdomTree's 94 Relative Price Strength was fourth best. In both cases, it's easy to check the higher rated stocks and see how they compare.On the fundamental side, WisdomTree's EPS Rating ranked 17th in the group. This was surprising, given the stock's strong quarterly numbers. But WisdomTree had only two years of annual gains in earnings per share under its belt. This weighed down the ranking.Its top-notch SMR rating of A helped offset the difference and is equal to the best in the group.WisdomTree's Accumulation/Distribution Rating was a B-, 31st in the group. That's not great, but it also doesn't really jibe with the picture of institutional accumulation we get when we eyeball its weekly chart.The chart showed three out of four weeks up on the right side of the base trading in below-average volume. In all four of these weeks, however, WisdomTree ended in the upper half of the week's range; this suggests accumulation even if volume is weak.Also, the stock bottomed out in strong trade and ended high in the range in the week ended June 28 (1). These are both solid signs. The base's main weakness, other than the stock's low price, was its V-shaped outline.As the weekly chart shows, WisdomTree failed to break out of that flawed base, and its Checkup indicated that the stock wasn't truly the top dog. But the ratings remained good overall, and WisdomTree went on to form a much better cup pattern.Notice how the new 12-week cup base featured a shallower decline from head to toe, just 23%. The new cup featured a more rounded look, which was a hint that institutions were gradually accumulating shares and preventing the stock from making another sharp-nosed decline.What else was good about the new cup base? Almost all of the down weeks came in lighter-than-average turnover, a good sign. And volume picked up on the right side of the new base.In the week ended Oct. 25, WisdomTree broke out with a 6.7% gain in heavy trading. That big move sent the stock past a 13.93 buy point in a 12-week cup-type base that formed right next to another V-shaped and faulty cup base.WisdomTree then suddenly took a break. Over the next four weeks, the stock traded in a tighter range. Yet it still included a test of that buy point and a rebound off the 10-week moving average near 12.95 (2). At one point, shares fell 6.4% below the 13.93 entry to 13.04, which was not enough to execute the golden rule of selling.Plus, the positive reversal in the week ended Nov. 22 illustrates how waiting for the stock's finish by the end of the week can prove wise.WisdomTree's breakout finally got going. Ten weeks into the late-October breakout, the stock rallied as much as 29.8% to a high of 18.08, a great time to sell and lock in gains (3). WisdomTree soon peaked and suffered a serious correction that exceeded 50% from the stock's all-time high of 18.50.IBD'S TAKE: In the stock market, buying is important, but selling is perhaps more so. Catch several stocks at their breakout from a proper buy point and sell most of them when they reach 20% to 25%, and you'll have an excellent year for your portfolio. Learn more about this important sell rule in this recent Investor's Corner column.Final analysis? WisdomTree's example suggests Stock Checkup is helpful for added perspective or a cursory initial check. But it confirms that nothing substitutes for the skill of learning to directly read and study price-and-volume charts.(A version of this article first appeared in the Sept. 24, 2013, edition of IBD.)RELATED:When To Sell A Stock: Learn The Technique Of Counting BasesHow To Make A Million Dollars: Tips On Stocks And Investing For ChildrenWinning In Stocks: Do You Use A Great Checklist?

886,NOV,"A Wall Street brokerage cut its production estimate for the iPhone X Wednesday as Apple (AAPL) continues to face manufacturing issues with the highly anticipated new smartphone.XMizuho Securities said it now expects Apple to make 38 million units of iPhone X by the end of the calendar year. That's down about 20% from its July forecast, the firm said in a report.The report is the latest to raise concerns about Apple having a limited supply of the iPhone X for its Nov. 3 release.The iPhone X, pronounced ""ten"" as in the Roman numeral, is Apple's 10th-anniversary smartphone and will be its latest flagship handset. It features a 5.8-inch OLED screen with no physical home button interrupting the display. The iPhone X also uses facial recognition to unlock the device.The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Apple is having trouble securing enough 3D sensors for the facial recognition feature in its iPhone X, leading to lower production levels. The particular component in short supply is a dot projector that uses a laser to beam 30,000 infrared dots across a user's face to map the person's unique characteristics, the Journal said.Nikkei Asian Review reported Tuesday that Apple's contractors were struggling with low yield rates for the 3D sensor component. The yield rate measures the number of usable or salable units from a batch of components or final products produced.Over the summer, Apple dealt with problems with the iPhone X's OLED displays when it tried unsuccessfully to embed a fingerprint sensor into the screen.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 75, meaning it has outperformed 75% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more analysis of Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Mizuho analyst Abhey Lamba reiterated his neutral rating on Apple stock with a price target of 150.Apple shares were up 0.7% to close at 154.23 on the stock market today.The impending launch of the iPhone X was seen as a factor in the lackluster demand for the iPhone 8 series smartphones, which went on sale last Friday. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus have LCD screens measuring 4.7 and 5.5 inches, respectively, and are seen as incremental updates to last year's iPhone 7 series.Mizuho raised its production estimates for Apple's older model LCD-screen iPhones for the rest of the year. The assumption is that many iPhone users in need of an upgrade will opt for a less expensive iPhone model than the latest handsets, which sport higher prices than their predecessors.Mizuho raised its production forecasts for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus by 9% and 3%, respectively, assuming an uptick in demand on the back of price reductions.The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus start at $549 and $669, respectively. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus start at $699 and $799, respectively. The iPhone X starts at $999.Apple's sales and earnings in the December quarter could be pressured by customers choosing lower priced handsets and iPhone X sales being pushed into 2018, Lamba said.""Supply chain checks suggest higher procurement of LCD (iPhones) while OLED (iPhone) production moves lower on the back of recent concerns around the iPhone X ramp,"" Lamba said.RELATED:Apple Watch Series 3 Surprise Hit, Steals Limelight From iPhone 8Smaller Crowds Greet Apple's iPhone 8 As Many Wait For iPhone X

887,NOV,"U.S. stock indexes rebounded midday Wednesday on a bullish durable-goods report and on news that President Trump will unveil this afternoon his plan for tax cuts and changes to the tax code.XThe Nasdaq charged ahead 0.6%, while the S&P 500 added 0.1% after paring gains. The Dow Jones industrial average was flat, but the small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 0.6%.Volume in the stock market today was higher vs. the previous session's pace.Economic news set a bullish tone before the market's open.Durable goods orders for August rose 1.7% vs. the consensus view for 1.5%. The surprise in the report came in core capital goods. The increase was 0.9%, three times better than the consensus estimate of 0.3%. Core capital goods is a proxy for business investment.Meanwhile, Trump will release the details of his tax-cut plan in a speech this afternoon in Indianapolis. The Indianapolis Star reported that the plan would double the standard deduction to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly and to $12,000 for individuals; cut the corporate tax from 35% to 20%; and reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three.However, some taxes would go up. Bloomberg News reported that the federal tax deduction claimed for state and local taxes would be eliminated. This would mainly affect people in states controlled by Democrats, such as California and New York — states that did not support Trump.The tax talk comes with a dose of skepticism because the Republican Congress has not yet shown the ability to unite on policies.In the Nasdaq 100, tech stocks grabbed the biggest gains. Data storage firm Micron Technology (MU) gapped up 7% to a new high. Chip equipment providers Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) each popped 3%.Blue chips were mostly down. In the Dow Jones industrial average, losers led winners by a 9-to-7 ratio. Nike (NKE) scored the biggest loss, down 3.5% on a mixed quarterly report. Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) rose 1.6% and 1%, respectively.Banks led the stock market in the weeks after the November election. From Nov. 8 to Dec. 9 the money-center industry group rose 21% vs. 5% for the Nasdaq and 6% for the S&P 500. Money centers peaked in March with a 32% postelection gain and then corrected by 12%. In May, money centers began a rebound that took the group 13% above the May low.Bank of America (BAC) was a few pennies away from clearing a 25.45 buy point midday Wednesday. Other major banks, including JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley (MS), also were near buy points. Morgan Stanley is No. 2 among its industry group in Stock Checkup at Investors.com.Small caps also have seen a resurgence recently. From Election Day to Dec. 9, the small-cap S&P 600 jumped 18% but became a laggard this year. Yet, since Aug. 21, small caps have led the market's rebound — up 8% vs. 3% each for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500.The action among banks and small caps raises the question of whether investors aren't seeing a return to strength among some aspects of the so-called Trump trade. Moves in interest rates also have influenced banking stocks.Before the market's open Thursday, the final number on second-quarter GDP will be released. The Street's consensus view, according to Econoday, calls for 3.1% growth, up from the second take's 3% and the first reading of 2.6%.

888,NOV,"The plunge in Facebook (FB) shares in high volume this week triggered a sell signal on the social networking leader and caused some head-scratching among analysts on Tuesday as to why it happened.XFacebook shares fell 4.5% Monday, following news reports that ranged from Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg revealing plans to sell a big chunk of stock and a Washington Post story that suggested the company could get smacked by a probe into advertisements connected with the U.S. elections. It was Facebook's steepest one-day drop since the 5.6% decline on Nov. 3.Monday's stock drop was preceded by two announcements after the market close Friday. Zuckerberg, in a Facebook blog post, said he would abandon plans to create a new class of company stock with no voting power. Connected to that was a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, also late Friday, that said Zuckerberg anticipates selling 35 million to 75 million shares of Facebook stock over 18 months in order to fund his philanthropic initiatives.Smaller concerns included confirmation that China was blocking Facebook's WhatsApp messaging app.But the straw that broke the camel's back, FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi says, was a Washington Post story that said former president Barack Obama tried to warn Zuckerberg last November about the threat of fake news on the social networking site during the 2016 election.""That appears to be the 'straw' which led to significant selling in Facebook's shares,"" Seyrafi wrote.Zuckerberg had initially rejected the idea that fake news on his company's social network played a key role in the U.S. election. But last week he acknowledged that Facebook had indeed been manipulated and would provide more than 3,000 politically themed advertisements to Congress as part of an investigation into Russia's meddling in the U.S. election. That could potentially lead to some government regulation on political ads and subject Facebook to more regulatory scrutiny, Seyrafi wrote.After Monday's drop, Facebook shares were up 0.8% to close at 164.21 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.

889,NOV,"An analysis by IBD notes that on Monday Facebook shares fell sharply below its 50-day line as volume surged, triggering a sell signal. It was the deepest drop below the key support level since early November. The stock had been working on a narrow flat base with a 175.59 buy point. The base is second stage.Facebook has shown solid action after a breakout in January over a 129.37 cup-with-handle buy point. Short-term traders could have used the Aug. 10 drop below the 10-day moving average as a sell signal to lock in gains.If Facebook ends the week sharply below the 10-week moving average and sees volume rising at least 40% above the 10-week average, the chances of a significant correction and a new base are high. Such was the case after Facebook got drilled by sellers in the week ended Aug. 21, 2015, falling 9% that week in weekly volume that jumped 45% above average. The next week, stocks suffered from the August 2015 tiny flash crash.Another possible reason for the Facebook stock drop, said Seyrafi, is a general rotation out of technology stocks into financials and the Russell 2000.Seyrafi has an outperform rating on Facebook and a price target of 210.RELATED:Facebook Stock Quotes, Company News And Chart AnalysisFANG Stock Is At A Make-Or-Break Moment; Here's WhyFANG Stocks News & Quotes

896,NOV,"Stocks showed a tad of oomph on Tuesday after Monday's technology sell-off, but small caps and transportation-related issues continued to gain more traction in late-afternoon trading.XMeanwhile, Apple (AAPL) defied the listless action of the Nasdaq composite, which nevertheless rebounded a little more than 0.3% at 3 p.m. ET and is still holding the fort in its defense of the 50-day moving average. The former gained nearly 2% to 153.48 in heavy trading and is trying to snap a sharp four-day sell-off.The Nasdaq 100, a gauge of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the all-electronic Nasdaq exchange, is up more than 0.4%. But the Nasdaq 100-tracking Powershares QQQ Trust (QQQ) ETF remains a tad below its 50-day moving average. QQQ is up an impressive 20.9% since Jan. 1.Watch to see how turnover in Apple, the largest company on the Nasdaq by market cap, finishes today; Apple's average volume over the past 50 sessions is 29.2 million shares. A significant rise in above-average turnover would be bullish for Apple shareholders.The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 were up no more than 0.1% to 0.2%. Dairy, medical services, and select retail stocks rebounded, while gold mining, biotech, ethical drug, medical research and equipment, and fertilizer stocks lagged with losses of 0.7% or more.Truck, airline and other stocks helped push the Dow Jones transportation average up 0.7%, matching the S&P SmallCap 600's gain. Volume was running lower on both main exchanges vs. the same time on Monday.Since its Aug. 24 recent low, the Dow transports have rallied 8.5%, broadly outperforming the S&P 500's 2.4% rise over the same time frame. The Nasdaq composite is up just 2% over the four-week period.Despite growing fears, as seen in news headlines, that the market is getting frighteningly close to a major peak, the market's technicals continue to refute such thinking. On the NYSE, winning stocks were beating losers by more than a 3-to-2 margin, and ditto for the Nasdaq.As seen in the ""What's The Market Trend?"" page, a daily PDF link at the bottom of IBD's Big Picture column, the NYSE advance-decline line continues to mark new highs. A rising NYSE A-D line is one sign of a healthy uptrend.No doubt the huge advance since the March 2009 bottom certainly makes the market vulnerable to a correction, especially if a geopolitical event such as military conflict in North Korea takes hold, or the Federal Reserve suddenly accelerates its intention to raise the cost of money. However, for now, an improving U.S. economy, prospects for economic recovery in Europe, increasing global trade and low interest rates around the world could set the stage for further gains in global equity markets.The last time the S&P 500 fell more than 5% from its 52-week high was during a 12-week spell from Aug. 15, 2016, at 2193 to Nov. 4, 2016, at 2083, right before the historic Nov. 8 U.S. elections.Going back to Apple, even though the stock has recently pierced its 50-day moving average (as seen in red on a daily chart at Investors.com) and dipped below the 156.75 proper entry in a flat base, the recent action is not unusual. Many great stocks, both big cap and small cap, will test a breakout level and shake out uncommitted holders before resuming their runs.Consider that in the end of 2016, Apple spent nearly seven weeks trading below its 50-day line, then hopped back above it in December. That action ultimately produced an excellent cup-with-handle base that yielded a breakout on Jan. 6-9 this year at 118.12.In the most recent correction, the iPhone giant spent no more than five weeks below its 50-day line. Again, normal action.At this point, watch to see if Apple can rebound in decent volume and return back above the 156.75 entry (10 cents above the flat base's left-side high). If it does not immediately do so, then you can expect the stock to potentially form a new base.Apple's Relative Price Strength Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, is currently at a decent 78, which is not great compared with the turbo-charged high growth names seen in IBD 50, but is still higher than the 59 it scored on a scale of 1 to 99 at the start of the year.The 85 EPS Rating reflects the positive turnaround in profits in Apple, which has seen earnings turn from a 15% year-over-year drop in the fiscal fourth quarter of last year (ended in September 2016) to gains of 2%, 11% and 18% in the past three quarters.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising another 13% to $1.88 a share in the soon-ending fiscal fourth quarter on a 9% jump in revenue to $50.93 billion.In the Chinese social media sphere, YY (YY) roared into new high ground, rising more than 8% to 84.36 in brisk turnover and clearing an 83.10 entry in a six-week cup base.Volume is on track to almost double YY's average turnover over the past 50 sessions, a telltale sign that large institutions are anxiously grabbing shares.Notice how the stock's relative strength line, painted in blue in IBD's charts, has moved into new high ground, a good sign. A rising RS line means that a stock is outperforming the S&P 500.The buy zone in YY goes up to 87.26, 5% above the proper 83.10 buy point.YY had earlier flashed a follow-on buy signal when it bounced nicely off its rising 10-week moving average (please see a weekly chart) near 69 in the week ended Sept. 1 in solid turnover. That came after YY's breakout from a cup with handle at 56.31; that cup base was part of a long bottoming base pattern.As this Investor's Corner notes, some stocks can post excellent gains even after bolting out of a cup base that features no handle.YY scores a 99 Composite Rating, the maximum possible, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, due to its stunning combination of excellent fundamentals, relative price strength, and rising fund sponsorship. According to William O'Neil + Co. data, mutual funds and hedge funds owning shares in the mid-cap Nasdaq stock ($5.2 billion market value; $1.22 billion in sales in 2016) jumped from 214 funds at the end of the second quarter of 2016 to 346 funds in Q2 this year.Meanwhile, among other large-cap firms, McDonald's (MCD) is issuing a sell signal for recent new buyers as shares continued to fall deeper below the 50-day moving average. The restaurant chain was the worst performer within the Dow Jones industrials, tanking 2.47 or more than 3% to 153.79. Volume is running nearly 50% above its usual pace.McDonald's first showed weakness as it dived below its 50-day moving average in heavy turnover two weeks ago. At its recent peak of 161.72, the consumer play rallied as much as 24% past a saucer-with-handle buy point at 130.10.Those with giant gains in McDonald's can be more patient in holding the profit turnaround, as the stock still maintains a big air pocket of gains above its rising 200-day moving average. Large and megacap leaders tend to find solid buying support near or at this long-term moving average during significant pullbacks in price.The 50-day line is drawn in red on all IBD charts as well as on Leaderboard and MarketSmith charts.Any stock that rises 20% to 25% triggers a sell signal, based on IBD rules. That is, such gains are in fact hard to come by in many stocks, and it's a good time to sell on the way up. Many times, a stock will correct in price after rising that much following a solid breakout.IBD's TAKE: One of the keys to strong long-term results in stock investing is to take many gains when your stocks go up 20% to 25% or more from a proper buy point. Read more about this important sell rule in this Investor's Corner column.McDonald's earnings have been on solid footing after a 13% decline in 2014 to $4.82 a share. Since then, earnings rose 4% to $5.01 a share in 2015, 14.8% to $5.75 a share in 2016, and are seen rising another 14% to $6.55 this year.However, the global restaurant chain, despite launching an interesting ""NEXT"" eatery concept in Hong Kong that includes fresh vegetables, quinoa and other superfood items, has not been able to get out of its sales rut. The top line has fallen vs. year-ago levels for 12 quarters in a row.RELATED:Income Investing: Why You Should Watch This Major Utility Stock NowHow To Make Money In Stocks: How Do You Grow $2,500 Into Something Substantial?Tech News: The Latest In Artificial Intelligence And ChinaThe Key To Making Big Money In the Long Term: Sell On The Way Up This Way

897,NOV,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 8 saw lackluster demand during its first weekend of availability, but the tech giant's new smartwatch with cellular connectivity was a surprise hit, analysts say.XThe Apple Watch Series 3 smartwatch with high-speed LTE cellular connectivity launched Friday, the same day as the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. Unlike earlier versions of the Apple Watch, the new model doesn't need to be paired with an iPhone to be fully functional.It can make and receive phone calls and texts without having an iPhone nearby. It uses the same phone number as a user's handset.Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry said six Apple stores he checked in the Silicon Valley area sold out of the Series 3 with cellular by early Saturday.""Apple Watch sales were brisk, as customers were freely able to try on the watches,"" Chowdhry said in a report. Previously Apple treated customers ""as thieves, by keeping Apple Watches under lock and key.""Meanwhile, iPhone 8 sales got off to a ""slow and steady start,"" he said. Most customers his firm surveyed said they got the 11th-generation iPhone simply because their current handset was damaged or outdated.""Customers are buying new Apple iPhone 8, not because of any compelling innovation or for any compelling features, but because their current iPhone has reached the limits of (its) useful utility levels,"" he said.However, many other customers likely are holding out for Apple's premium handset, the iPhone X, which is set to be released on Nov. 3, he said.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 77, meaning it has outperformed 77% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more analysis of Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Loup Ventures managing partner Gene Munster said about half the people waiting in line Friday at Apple's flagship 5th Avenue store in New York City were there to buy the cellular Apple Watch. Many wanted to get their hands on the wearable right away because online sales are on back order and won't be fulfilled for three to five weeks, he said in a report.An internal analysis of the Apple Watch Series 3 cellular model by teardown specialist iFixit found that the new smartwatch is almost identical to the second-generation model. IFixit suggested that the previous version of the watch was cellular-ready, but Apple wasn't prepared to include the functionality in the device, which came out a year ago.The Apple Watch Series 3 with cellular costs $399 for the version with a 38-millimeter case and $429 for the version with a 42-millimeter case. Apple Watch Series 3 models without cellular start at $329.Apple shares fell 0.9% to close at 150.55 on the stock market today.RELATED:Smaller Crowds Greet Apple's iPhone 8 As Many Wait For iPhone XApple Watch Series 3 Tarnished By Cellular Glitch Reports

898,NOV,"Noticeably smaller crowds turned out to buy Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 8 on its first day of availability Friday as analysts chalked it up to Apple fans waiting for the company's premium iPhone X smartphone, due in six weeks.XApple shares fell once again, with the stock down more than 5% for the week as of Friday morning.Reuters described the launch of the iPhone 8 as ""muted"" in Australia and Asia, the first markets to start selling the new phone, compared with previous new handsets from the consumer electronics giant. It cited lackluster reviews for the iPhone 8 as a potential reason for the lack of enthusiasm for the device.Reviewers said the iPhone 8-series smartphones are incremental upgrades to the LCD-screen iPhone 7-series phones released a year ago. The iPhone 8 adds wireless charging and boasts improved cameras and other upgraded components, compared with its predecessor.By contrast, the iPhone X, pronounced ""ten"" as in the Roman numeral, sports an OLED screen, facial recognition for secure log-in and a revamped design. Preorders for the iPhone X begin Oct. 27 and the device goes on sale Nov. 3.Apple's Regent Street store in London had more employees than customers when it opened for business on Friday, Mashable reported. The atmosphere was subdued and the queue of customers was underwhelming, the website said.One of the first iPhone 8 phones sold went to iFixit, a company that specializes in do-it-yourself repairs and is known for its ""teardowns"" of consumer devices. It opened the iPhone 8 and documented what it found in terms of components and how it can be repaired.The iFixit teardown analysis of the iPhone 8 innards found the usual suspects when it comes to chip suppliers, including Broadcom (AVGO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).The iPhone 8 that iFixit inspected also contained several chips from Qualcomm (QCOM), including an LTE modem. Apple and Qualcomm are locked in a bitter legal fight over patent licensing terms and royalty payments. Because of this, Apple is believed to be replacing Qualcomm chips with Intel (INTC) chips in some devices.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 80, meaning it has outperformed 80% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more analysis of Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson on Friday reiterated his overweight rating on Apple stock and raised his price target to 196 from 190.Apple shares dropped just under 1% to close at 151.89 on the stock market today. Apple fell below a 156.75 buy point and its 50-day moving average earlier this week.Olson raised his sales and earnings estimates for Apple based on his assumption of higher average selling prices for iPhones because of the new handsets.Nomura Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal maintained his buy rating and price target of 185.""Anticipation for the iPhone X may be weighing on iPhone 8 orders,"" Kvaal said in a report Friday. ""A unifying theme of the iPhone 8 reviews has been that the changes from the 7 to the 8 are incremental. We believe consumers are waiting for the feature-rich X, just as they did for the dual camera feature on the 7 Plus.""RELATED:Apple iPhone X Production, Supply Likely Delayed: AnalystApple's Pricey iPhone X Lacks Wireless Data Bragging Rights

900,NOV,"The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow industrials all hit record highs during the week, but they ended little changed. Apple (AAPL) fell sharply amid iPhone and Apple Watch concerns while oil prices topped $50. The Federal Reserve will start paring its balance sheet and stuck to its hawkish plan for raising interest rates, pushing Bank of America (BAC) and other bank stocks toward buy points. Northrop Grumman (NOC) announced a big defense takeover.The Dow industrials rose 0.4%, the S&P 500 index edged up 0.1% and the Nasdaq dipped 0.3%, after all three major averages hit record highs during the week. The small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed. Apple was a drag on the major indexes but oil stocks rallied with crude futures while bank stocks climbed on a hawkish Fed and rebounding Treasury yields. Some recent breakouts, such as Apple and Tesla (TSLA), faltered during the week. Several other stocks topped buy points, but not by much and in light volume.Crowds were light for the iPhone 8 as it went on sale Friday, confirming reports of light pre-orders, as many customers await the high-end iPhone X due Nov. 3. Apple admitted that its cellular-enabled Apple Watch Series 3, which also went on sale Friday, has connectivity problems. Apple shares fell 5% to 151.89, below a flat-base buy point of 156.75 and its 50-day line.Meanwhile, Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Google announced that it will pay Taiwan-based HTC $1.1 billion to acquire and staff assets to make Pixel smartphones.

Policymakers also stuck to their plan for four interest-rate hikes by the end of 2018, including one more this year. That raised market odds of an increase by December. Treasury yields continued their rebound, helping Citigroup (C), Bank of America and other big banks hit or near buy points.RELATED: The Fed Doubles Down: Reverses QE, Keeps Hawkish TiltNorthrop Grumman (NOC) announced it would buy Orbital ATK (OA) for $7.8 billion in cash and assume $1.4 billion in debt.

The acquisition will give Northrop key missile-defense assets as Orbital builds the interceptor boosters for the Boeing (BA) Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system used by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. The deal could even help Northrop beat out Boeing to win the Air Force's Ground Based Strategic Deterrent contract to replace the aging Boeing Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2018 and will be a test case to see if the Trump Administration and Pentagon still have concerns over the size of prime contractors.RELATED:Why The Orbital ATK Buyout Is So Important For Northrop GrummanOPEC and noncartel members did not extend or deepen production cuts at Friday's meeting, but a move for increased monitoring and other steps hinted that production would not soar in 2018. Crude futures rose above $50 a barrel earlier in the week on Iraqi hints of extended output curbs, and they closed above that key level. Meanwhile, U.S. crude oil inventories rose by 4.59 million barrels in the latest week according to the Energy Information Administration, more than expected. U.S. gasoline supplies fell by 2.125 million barrels and distillates fell by 5.69 million barrels.

John McCain, R-Ariz., said he'd oppose the bill, making passage far less likely.Big news moved Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) and Adamas Pharmaceuticals (ADMS) into the stratosphere last week, as Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) and Aerie Pharmaceuticals (AERI) toppled on FDA reports regarding their drugs while Versartis (VSAR) crashed on a failed drug trial. Alnylam spiked 52% Wednesday after reporting strong late-stage data for a rare-disease drug, prompting rival Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) to plunge 8.8%. Adamas, on Tuesday, hit a 20-month high after announcing it will charge $28,500 per patient per year for its Parkinson's drug, Gocovri. Aerie, though, dipped to a three-week low after the FDA set a committee review date for its glaucoma drug, Rhopressa. Meanwhile, Intercept neared a four-year low Thursday after the FDA warned of liver damage and death related to its drug, Ocaliva. Versartis cratered Friday after its drug for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency didn't meet a late-stage trial goal.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) got the nod from regulators to purchase 1,932 Rite Aid (RAD) stores, less than what it agreed to in June, along with three distribution centers and other assets for $4.375 billion in cash. The announcement came nearly two years after Walgreens first announced a deal to buy Rite Aid. But its plans repeatedly ran up against concerns that the combined drugstore operator would harm competition. Drugstore stocks came under pressure amid fresh reports that Amazon (AMZN) might enter the pharmacy business.Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) disappointed investors with its targets for 2020. Best Buy stock tumbled 8% following its first investor meeting in five years. Best Buy's implied profit margins in its four-year outlook were below Wall Street's estimates. Analysts also expressed doubts that Best Buy could reach its promised annual sales growth of about 2%.Japanese video game firm Nintendo (NTDOY) could be poised to enter China with its Switch console, according to news reports. Nintendo recently revealed that it is bringing Tencent's (TCEHY) ""Honor of Kings,"" one of China's most popular games, to the Switch console this winter. Nintendo stock rose to its best levels in nearly eight 8 years.Amazon (AMZN) reportedly is developing smart glasses and a new camera security system, both of which tap into its Alexa virtual assistant and expand its growing presence in the smart home, to the detriment of Alphabet.Indications are that Facebook (FB) stands a good chance of getting approval to enter China, the world's largest internet market, following the recent success of Airbnb.

901,NOV,"U.S. stock futures initially turned lower overnight on a report that North Korea threatened a nuclear test in the Pacific Ocean, but investors took the latest saber rattling in stride.XNorth Korea's foreign minister said the country could test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean, according to a South Korea news agency. Earlier Thursday, President Trump announced new sanctions vs. North Korea on Thursday following tough talk at his speech before the United Nations. That spurred North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to respond, ""I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged U.S. dotard with fire.""Trump responded on Twitter (TWTR) Friday morning, said Kim Jong Un is a ""madman"" who will be ""tested like never before!""Kim Jong Un of North Korea, who is obviously a madman who doesn't mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 22, 2017However, North Korean weapons tests and heated rhetoric between that country and the U.S. no longer seem to be having as much effect on overnight trading as they did several weeks ago, when the missiles and threats first heated up. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said that North Korea is a ""terrible threat."" But, speaking in India, he told a CNBC affiliate that investors shouldn't change how they behave.Separately, Iran vowed to strengthen its missile capability, state media reported. But that news also had little impact on financial markets.S&P 500 futures were just below fair value Friday morning. Dow futures were fractionally higher. Nasdaq 100 futures lost nearly 0.2%. Those were well above overnight lows, but even those worst levels were modest.Asian markets retreated, with Japan's Nikkei down 0.25%, South Korea's Kospi 0.7% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng 0.8%. European markets were slightly higher.Looking more broadly, The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite are near record highs, but aren't making much headway either in recent months. The FANG+ stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), along with Apple (AAPL) — also are giving mixed signals. Apple's breakout has stumbled while Amazon and Alphabet are stuck below their 50-day moving averages. But Facebook and Netflix are just below buy points.Apple fell 1.7% to 153.39 in Thursday stock market trading amid speculation that the iPhone Model X could be in shorter supply than previously feared when it's finally released on Nov. 3. On Wednesday, Apple also lost 1.7% to undercut its 156.75 buy point and its 50-day moving average, flashing a sell signal to short-term holders. That day, Apple admitted that its Apple Watch Series 3 has some connectivity problems. More generally, Apple iPhone 8 preorders appear lackluster, as people await the high-end X. The iPhone 8 and latest Apple Watch go on sale Friday.Apple already is down some 4% this week through Thursday and 6% so far in September, significantly underperforming the market over that time.Shares dipped 0.7% in premarket trading Friday as iPhone 8 sales were subdued in Asia.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day and The Big Picture (take a free trial) after the close, for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.Facebook fell 0.6% to 171.11 on Thursday as it continues to trade tightly in a base going back to July 27. Facebook's buy point is 175.59. The stock appears to getting some support at its fast-rising 10-week line. Facebook edged lower in premarket trading.Amazon retreated 0.9% to 964.65, its fifth loss in six sessions. Shares are stuck back below their 50-day moving average again, as they've been for most of their current consolidation. Amazon is in a flat base going back to July 27, with a potential buy point of 1,083.41.Amazon was flat in the premarket.Netflix rose 1.8% to 188.78 on Thursday after Buckingham initiated coverage with a buy recommendation. Netflix is on track for its fourth straight weekly gain, closing on a 191.60 base-on-base pattern entry point. Netflix climbed 0.3% to 189.40 in the premarket.Netflix is a member of Leaderboard, IBD's premium service featured annotated charts of a select number of stocks, mostly growth names in or near buy zones.Alphabet rose 1 cent to 947.55 on Thursday, finding resistance at its 50-day moving average. Like Amazon, Google's parent has been trading below the 50-day line for most of its current consolidation, which is not a great sign. Alphabet is in a flat base with a 1,008.71 buy point. Alphabet was not active before the market open.Late Wednesday, Alphabet announced that it would pay $1.1 billion for Taiwan-based HTC's smartphone design business, with many HTC employees who worked on Google's Pixel smartphones joining the smartphone and Android giant.RELATED:The Big Picture: Indexes Drop, But This Group OutperformingAmazon Ad Revenue Rising, But Google And Facebook Stay DominantApple Falls Below Key Level In Heavy Volume, But Is It A Sell Signal Or No?Apple iPhone X Production, Supply Likely Delayed: AnalystFANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google

902,NOV,"Buying right is important, but it's where you sell that determines your bottom line.Have you ever heard a speaker or an attendee at an IBD seminar remark that selling a stock is a lot tougher than buying one? Maybe someone said something like that in the bar, at the gym, or during a cocktail party. It's true.IBD's TAKE: New IBD readers can quickly improve their results simply by following this one rule. IBD calls it the golden rule.X Since its founding in 1984, Investor's Business Daily has been on a mission to make its readers more successful in the game of equities. When it comes to selling a stock to cut losses, IBD could not be any clearer. Always exit a stock when it falls 7% to 8% below your purchase price. No ifs, no ands, no buts.  The reason is simple; the stock is simply not behaving how you expected it. Accept the loss quickly, and you save your capital to invest again at a better time or in a better company.How about when it comes to selling your winners to lock in gains, big or small? IBD categorizes profit-taking sell rules into two types: offense-style (or selling on the way up) and defense-style (when a stock is falling sharply).Today, we will tackle a defense-style sell signal: locking in profits on the day that a stock makes its biggest single-session point decline during a long advance.It's nice to be able to sell into strength, but human emotions often get in the way. They make the act of selling more complicated. How do you fight this complexity? You follow more smart, time-tested rules.Investors need to have a concrete exit strategy, or be resigned to watch hard-earned gains disappear fast. So consider at least selling some shares if your stock suffers its largest one-day point loss since breaking out from a base.After a long advance of many weeks or months, this negative action often signals that the stock has topped. If accompanied by other signs of weak price action, then you'll have more valid reasons to sell and lock in your profits.A dramatic single-day point loss tells you two things. First, some large shareholders are unabashedly taking profits. A biggest one-day point loss in above-normal turnover is especially worrisome: This tells you that some institutions, such as mutual funds and hedge funds, are dumping their holdings.Second, it represents a change in the stock's character. David Landry, an author and money manager, puts it this way: If someone who's usually mean to you suddenly starts treating you really nice, be wary. The change in character may mean that something is up.An easy way to check for a biggest one-day point drop is by eyeballing stock charts.On an IBD chart at Investors.com, if you place your cursor on a specific price bar and then hold down the left button, the exact point change will show up in a small pop-up window. Just make sure you're looking at a daily time frame and not a weekly. You can also do this with MarketSmith, which requires a separate subscription.The Big Picture, intraday market updates and other columns in IBD will alert you to stocks that have suffered their biggest daily point losses. Use the Stocks On The Move table to track big moves down in heavy volume among leaders.IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), nicknamed ICE, cleared an 88.97 buy point in a flat base Nov. 14, 2006 (1). The fast-growing derivatives exchange operator came public just a year earlier. It owned solid IBD Ratings at the time of its breakout, too: Composite 99, Earnings Per Share 96 and Relative Price Strength 97.By February 2007, the stock had bolted 88%. On Feb. 21, it hit an all-time high intraday (2), but finished little changed as volume grew from the prior session. This marked stalling, or bearish action.On Feb. 27, ICE gapped down and dived nearly 13 points — the biggest one-day point loss since its Nov. 14 breakout (3). Six sessions later, the stock sliced its 50-day moving average (drawn in red in the chart above) in the heaviest volume since the start of the move (4).In some cases, a stock will pierce its 50-day line, hover below it for a few days, then rebound higher to resume its climb. When you have a large paper gain in such a stock, you can afford to give it a little more leeway, then decide to hold or fold.As seen in ICE's chart, the stock attempted a rally the very next day after violating the 50-day moving average, but the rebound fell flat. By March 26, ICE melted to as low as 119.42, 28% below its February peak.(A version of this column originally appeared in the Jan. 6, 2011, edition of IBD.)RELATED:When To Sell A Good Stock I: Sometimes Multiple Signals Occur All At OnceWhen To Sell A Good Stock II: Watch For Dramatic Weakness Among The Industry LeadersHow Do You Spot Key Market Tops?

903,NOV,"When a stock gaps up sharply in price and volume expands to its highest amount in months, it's time to pay close attention. That's the attitude to take with Thor Industries (THO).  A daily chart shows a big move on June 6: Thor rose 10% to 104.26. Notice how the day's low of 102.87…

904,NOV,"Mohammed bin Salman, who is Saudi Arabia's new crown prince, could have a big impact on Exxon Mobil (XOM), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and other U.S. companies' relations with the kingdom, as the 31-year-old is expected to add volatility to oil markets and push for buying more U.S. weapons.U.S.-Saudi relations cooled under President Obama, but President Trump has rekindled the relationship and announced weapons deals valued at $110 billion during his May visit, which was orchestrated in part by Salman.""Trump seems to be in good with the Saudis,"" said Ivan Eland, senior fellow and director of the Center on Peace & Liberty at the Independent Institute. ""They are one of his favorite dictatorships. U.S. business will definitely benefit from the military/political alliance we have there.""During Trump's visit last month, General Electric (GE) said it had agreements for $15 billion worth of projects in the kingdom, Dow Chemical (DOW) said it would build a polymer and coatings plant, and National Oilwell Varco (NOV) announced a joint venture to make specialty drilling rigs and equipment in Saudi Arabia.Eland sees more infrastructure and tech deals on the horizon, and Salman is a key architect of the Saudi Vision 2030 program to diversify the economy and end the kingdom's dependence on oil revenues.Salman is somewhat of a known quantity in energy circles, making his mark in the spring of 2016, when he scuttled an oil deal at the last minute.""Oil traders are already aware of MBS and his brash personality,"" said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, using Salman's initials in his daily energy report Wednesday. ""Last April, the 31-year-old basically pulled out of the Doha oil accord, angering both friends and foes alike, as they all came to sign an oil agreement that was already agreed to before seasoned OPEC and non-OPEC ministers came to sign on the dotted line.""Still, Salman has an incentive to lift oil prices, at least in the short term, as the kingdom shops around its state-run oil company, Saudi Aramco, for an initial public offering next year.Aramco is also reportedly looking to Chevron (CVX) to help develop gas reserves, and Exxon has a history of petrochemical joint ventures in Saudi Arabia.As defense minister, Salman has pushed for a stronger stance against Iran and increased air strikes in Yemen, and pushed for sanctions against Qatar.Arms sales to Saudi Arabia would go ""up, up and away"" under the hawkish young Salman, said Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS.But business deals could come with a catch. Saudi Arabia will want foreign companies building products in the kingdom so Saudi Arabia can get licenses and jump-start its own industries, especially in defense, Eland said.Unlike defense orders to Asia with strings attached in the form of technology transfers, sales to the Middle East historically tended to be simpler, with Gulf allies shopping for off-the-shelf technology that they could use right away. In addition, cost was of little concern, especially when oil was more than $100 a barrel.Saudi Arabia still needs arms, but is now seeking tech transfers in the wake of crashing oil prices.During Trump's visit, for example, Lockheed signed a letter of intent with Saudi tech firm Taqnia to form a joint venture to support the completion of 150 S-70 Black Hawk helicopters.Over time, as Saudi Arabia develops a home-grown industrial base, fewer U.S. exports may be needed to fill demand.U.S. companies also might not have a monopoly on Saudi sales. Flaring tensions in the region has Riyadh looking at an unlikely ally as it plans to increase military spending by nearly 7% this year.""Keep an eye on Saudi relations with Israel,"" Bobbi said. ""I look at Israel as the silent broker in the Middle East, thanks in no small part to their technical prowess.""RELATED:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsEnergy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

905,NOV,"It's perhaps just as easy to get bounced out of a high-growth stock as it is for a veteran cowhand to get knocked off the muscular back of an annoyed bronco.Investing holds many parallels to human nature and the world we live in. How you respond to such an unpleasant experience may have a lot to do with how well you perform in growth stocks in the long run.Have you ever bought a stock that had all the right attributes, saw it rise steadily to a double-digit gain, then were forced to sell for a tiny gain or break even as the stock plunged back to the proper buy point?The experience can be especially frustrating for new investors who are following IBD's time-proven system for selecting, buying and selling the best stocks. Turn that frustration into determination. The beauty of stocks is that you are not penalized for buying a stock back. Your tennis partner doesn't have to know. Nor does your mother.""There's something important to know about losing, above and beyond the lessons it teaches about winning. After a loss, victory becomes more likely. All good athletes know this maxim,"" the veteran global macro trader Victor Niederhoffer wrote in his investing classic ""The Education of a Speculator."""" 'Watch the revenge factor' and 'Don't let up' are drummed into all players, in the Pee-Wee leagues and on up,"" Niederhoffer added.The second time, or even the third time, that a stock with true market-leading potential breaks out may be the proverbial charm.In some cases, a stock may give back all of its post-breakout gains, then take weeks to form a brand-new base. IBD calls such cycles of market behavior a base-on-base pattern, or a base next to a base. In the former, the lows of the second base hold near the top of the first base. In the latter, the lows of the second base may be deep in the belly of the prior base.Regardless of the pattern, always know this: The market can change direction as fast as the wind. So don't let feelings of anger, disappointment, disgust or frustration block you from making a fantastic second buy.The mental strength needed to recommit capital into a wild horse in the equity markets paid off in HealthEquity (HQY).On Aug. 29, 2016, the small-cap financial services firm broke out of a long cup with handle with a 31.79 buy point (10 cents above the six-week handle's 31.69 high), and appeared to have everything going for it. The Draper, Utah-based firm had these solid ratings: 98 Composite, 97 EPS, 82 RS. It went public in the summer of 2014 and was in our IPO Leaders screen, a key feature not just at Investors.com but also in each IBD Weekly newspaper. HealthEquity is the only significant publicly traded company that offers investors a pure play in the emerging field of tax-advantaged health savings accounts.In the span of just six weeks, HealthEquity's gain reached 22% and the stock hit 38.80 (1). That advance triggered an IBD sell rule to take profits frequently at 20% to 25%. But in October, HealthEquity fell fast amid a teetering stock market. On Oct. 11, IBD's Market Pulse table, found in the daily Big Picture column, noted a downgrade in the current market outlook to ""Uptrend under pressure"" from ""Confirmed uptrend"" after the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 got tagged with their fifth and eighth distribution days, respectively.HealthEquity caught a bad cold. The stock dropped in 11 out of 12 sessions from Oct. 20 to Nov. 4 (2). When HealthEquity cut through the 50-day moving average at 34.69 and failed to rebound quickly, a holder was forced to sell before the gain turned into a total loss.But a 12% gain in heavy volume on Nov. 9 (3) right after the U.S. elections changed everything. If you had gotten out of the stock, it was the right time to get back in. HealthEquity still had great ratings from IBD. You had to act quickly and decisively. The stock closed that session at 34.95, 9.9% above the original buy point. Volume exploded to 2.1 million shares, 283% above average and the heaviest in more than a year.However, one could have arguably bought back shares the next day on Nov. 10 as the member of IBD's outsourcing services industry group thrust back above the 50-day moving average for the first time since that Aug. 29 breakout.As seen in the daily or weekly chart, the rebound was so fast that HealthEquity did not spend enough time to form a proper new base. A cup must be a minimum of six weeks, a flat base a minimum five weeks.RELATED:When To Exit The Market: The Simple Way To Spot A Major Market TopWhen Do Breakouts From A Cup Without A Handle Work? What Are The Key Elements Of A Great Double-Bottom Base?Is The Equities Market Healthy?

906,NOV,"In 1859, when Manhattan still had many farms, near the Battery on the island's southern tip The Great American Tea Company was launched. It grew, and outgrew its name, becoming in 1870 The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, which in 1912 begat the first A&P Economy Store, a semi-modern grocery store.By 1920, there were 4,500 such stores; by 1930, 15,000. In 1936, in Braddock, Pennsylvania, A&P opened a ""supermarket."" By the 1950s, A&P was, briefly, what Wal-Mart  (WMT) now is, the nation's largest retailer, with a 75% share of America's grocery business. A&P was, however, about to learn that Karl Marx was right.In ""The Communist Manifesto,"" Marx testified to capitalism's transformative power: ""All that is solid melts into air."" Sixty-eight years after he wrote that, in 1916, in Memphis, just as Henry Ford's Model T was making personal mobility a universal aspiration, and that aspiration was making suburbs practical and alluring, the first Piggly Wiggly opened.This was the beginning of self-service grocery chains. Hitherto, shoppers handed their grocery lists to clerks, who plucked the goods from shelves. Soon shoppers were pushing carts along aisles lined with goods enticingly packaged to prompt impulse purchases.A&P flourished when people went downtown to shop. As new suburbs spread, A&P's stores were old and distant. A&P filed for bankruptcy in 2015. By Nov. 25, 2016, its last stores had closed.Last week, Kroger (KR) grocery chain's lowered earnings forecast caused a 19% drop in share prices, which had already declined 12% in 2017. This was before Amazon (AMZN) announced that it is buying the Whole Foods (WFM) grocery chain — more than 460 stores in 42 states, Canada and Britain — for $13.7 billion, which is approximately how much Amazon's market capitalization increased after the Whole Foods announcement.Whole Foods, like Kroger, had been experiencing difficulties from competitors and expanding consumer options. The Wall Street Journal reports: ""Consumers are buying more of their groceries outside of traditional supermarkets. Online merchants, discounters and meal-kit delivery services are all grabbing market share.""Daniel Patrick Moynihan's Iron Law of Emulation — competitive branches of government adopt their rivals' techniques — applies to the private sector, too. Neil Irwin of The New York Times writes of Amazon: ""The online retailer is on a collision course with Wal-Mart to try to be the predominant seller of pretty much everything you buy. Each one is trying to become more like the other — Wal-Mart by investing heavily in technology, Amazon by opening physical bookstores and now buying physical supermarkets."" Something similar, says Irwin, is happening in ""nearly every major industry,"" benefiting ""the biggest and best-run organizations, to the detriment of upstarts and second-fiddle players.""In the accelerated churning of today's capitalism, changing tastes and expanding choices destroy some jobs and create others, with net gains in price and quality. But disruption is never restful, and America now faces a decision unique in its history: Is it tired — tired of the turmoil of creative destruction? If so, it had better be ready to do without creativity. And ready to stop being what it has always been: restless.Americans just now are being plied with promises that the political class can, and is eager to, protect them from the need to make strenuous exertions to provide for themselves in an increasingly competitive world. If the nation really is ready to sag into a rocking chair, it can while away its days and ward off ennui by reading the poet Philip Larkin.""It seems, just now,

907,NOV,"To be happening so very fast.""Those lines are from Larkin's 1972 poem ""Going, Going,"" his melancholy, elegiac lament about the pace of what he considered despoiling change that was, he thought, erasing all that was familiar in his England. The first line of Larkin's final stanza is: ""Most things are never meant.""This is a profound truth: The interacting processes that propel the world produce outcomes that no one intends. The fatal conceit — fatal to the fecundity of spontaneous order — is the belief that anyone, or any group of savants, is clever and farsighted enough to forecast the outcomes of complex systems. Who really wants to live in a society where outcomes are ""meant,"" meaning planned and unsurprising?

909,NOV,"Oil traders are emptying one of the world's largest crude storage facilities, located near the southernmost tip of Africa, as the physical market tightens amid booming demand and OPEC production cuts.Total SA, Vitol Group and Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. are selling crude they hoarded in Saldanha Bay, South Africa, during the 2015-2016 glut when the market effectively paid traders to store oil, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing private operations.Crude demand is now seasonally outstripping supply, tightening the physical market for some crude varieties to levels not seen in the last two years and encouraging traders to sell their stored oil.""The market is selling inventories from everywhere,"" Mercuria Chief Executive Officer Marco Dunand said in an interview in Geneva.Although largely unknown outside the oil trading industry, Saldanha Bay is one of the world's largest crude storage facilities, with the capacity to hold 45 million barrels in just six gigantic, partially-buried concrete tanks. By comparison, Cushing, the better-known U.S. oil storage center in Oklahoma that serves as the pricing point for the West Texas Intermediate oil benchmark, can hold about 75 million barrels in more than 125 tanks.Mercuria, which operates a blending operation at the South African terminal, has been offering cargoes from the facility, with China the likeliest destination, according to traders with knowledge of matter. Total has also been seeking tankers primarily to load Nigeria's Escravos crude from its tank in Saldanha Bay. In addition, Vitol has been unwinding its crude stores at both Saldanha Bay and in northwest Europe, the traders said.Vitol and Mercuria declined to comment on their Saldanha operations. Total didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The structure of the Brent crude oil market has strengthened into so-called backwardation — when near-term prices are more expensive than those in later months, indicating tighter supply. For most of 2015, 2016 and earlier this year, the Brent market was in the opposite condition, known as contango, which encourages stockpiling. Contango allows traders to buy crude, put it into storage and lock-in a profit for a future sale by hedging forward.""Backwardation is going to increase a bit,"" Dunand said in the Sept. 15 interview. ""We are seeing a reduction in global inventories, although we can see another buildup in the first quarter of next year,"" he added.Brent futures for the nearest month have risen to a premium of about 30 cents a barrel to those the following month, meaning that time spread is in backwardation. In early July, that spread was in a contango of about 30 cents a barrel. Other key time spreads, including the price difference between the December 2017 and December 2018 contracts — a popular yardstick for measuring market conditions — have also moved into backwardation.The shift of the Brent curve toward backwardation is ""proof that the oil market is rebalancing,"" said Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. in London. ""Physical crude differentials are strong globally.""Mercuria's Dunand said he expects oil prices to move ""in a $50-to-$60 a barrel price range"" for the time being. He added that in addition to the stockpile buildup in the first quarter of next year, there could be another one in the second quarter.OPEC officials, along with other Big Oil producers including Russia, are gathering this week for a meeting to review progress on production curbs agreed last year. The review will help OPEC and non-OPEC oil ministers when they meet in Vienna on Nov. 30 to decide whether to extend their production cuts beyond March 2018.After months of pessimism, some oil traders see the potential for higher prices next year. Asked at an industry conference in Geneva last week whether he would buy or sell Brent at $60 a barrel on average next year, Trafigura Group Chief Financial Officer Christophe Salmon said: ""I will buy that.""

Apple began taking preorders for the device last Friday. The addition of cellular LTE connectivity is the biggest change to the smartwatch. Previous versions of the Apple Watch needed to connect wirelessly to an iPhone for full functionality.Verge writer Lauren Goode said the new Apple Watches she was testing tried to connect to unknown Wi-Fi networks instead of connecting to cellular when she was without her iPhone. A Wall Street Journal review reported similar problems.Apple stock ended the trading day down 1.7% to close at 156.07 on the stock market today, falling below their 50-day moving average, a key technical support level.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 86, meaning it has outperformed 86% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more analysis of Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Apple is the leading seller of smartwatches worldwide, but the business is a small one for Apple, which gets most of its sales and profits from the iPhone.The first of Apple's 11th-generation smartphones, the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, arrive in stores this Friday after a week of preorders. Analysts say iPhone 8 demand has been muted by Apple's premium iPhone X, which will arrive in stores on Nov. 3 after a week of preorders starting Oct. 27.""Our research suggests that iPhone 8 preorders are substantially lower than iPhone 7 and iPhone 6 levels,"" Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang said in a report Wednesday. ""We understand many customers could be waiting for the iPhone X, but we are concerned iPhone 8/8 Plus sell-through could bring some headwinds.""Apple could miss consensus estimates for the December and March quarters if iPhone 8 sales underperform and if Apple can't make enough iPhone X handsets to meet demand, he said.RELATED:Apple Stock Gets Price-Target Hike On Higher Product PricesApple iPhone 8 Demand Isn't Looking So Hot, Signs Show

911,NOV,"Amid a grinding-higher market, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Biogen (BIIB), Electronic Arts (EA), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) are highly rated big-cap stocks holding in buy zones after breaking out several days or weeks ago.XIdeally, stocks will blast out of bases and then rapidly add to gains, and there are some breakouts like that. But in the current market environment many stocks just edge past entry points, with shares soon pulling back below them, at least temporarily. Apple chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and chip-gear maker Teradyne (TER) both fell back below entry areas on Monday after breaking out Friday. While their breakouts aren't failures, their high-volume retreats aren't encouraging.Apple broke out of a flat base with a 156.75 buy point on Aug. 2, the day after reporting strong earnings and guidance. The iPhone giant did dip below that entry point a few times over the next few weeks, but since Aug. 21 the stock has stayed in a buy zone.Apple has trended lower since unveiling its new iPhones, with the high-end iPhone X not set for release until Nov. 2. Shares fell 0.8% to 158.67 in Monday stock market trading. One report said that iPhone 8 preorders appear so-so, perhaps as buyers hold off for the X model.Apple's 50-day moving average could offer further support as that key line has risen to about the entry level.Microsoft has been grinding higher in 2017, modestly outpacing the S&P 500 index. Microsoft has been breaking out, then pulling back below the entry area before finally moving higher, sometimes after forming a new consolidation.Microsoft cleared a base-on-base formation with a 74.52 entry back on Aug. 31. True to form, Microsoft pulled back the following day and didn't hold above the entry until Sept. 11. Shares hit a record-high 75.97 intraday Monday, but reversed to close down 0.2% at 75.16.Biogen soared 4.2% on Aug. 30, blowing past a 312.50 buy point from a 13-month consolidation. Shares continued to advance, becoming slightly extended at times but only closing above the 5% chase zone on Sept. 12. Since then, Biogen has retreated for the past four sessions, sliding nearly 1% on Monday to 318.18, still comfortably in a buy zone.Celgene just edged past a 139.10 buy point on Sept. 1, though that capped a huge 7.5% weekly gain as Celgene rallied on investor optimism for drugmakers with ties to CAR-T immuno-oncology treatments. Aside from an intraday drop on the next session, Sept. 5, Celgene has basically held in a buy range, slowly trending higher. Celgene rose 0.6% to 142.84 on Monday, setting a record 143.40 intraday.The video game publisher cleared a 116.14 buy point on July 26, just before the Nasdaq hit a short-term high. Electronics Arts tested that entry point several times, closing below it on Aug. 10-11. But since then EA has generally stayed within the 5% buy zone. Shares edged up 0.45% to 119.96 on Monday.EA's 50-day line has risen to just above the entry level, offering a possible backstop for the stock.Alexion, the last of three biotechs highlighted here, sold off from July 2015 to May 2017. But since then the stock has rebounded. On Sept. 1, shares cleared a 142.57 first-stage-base buy point. A week later, Alexion closed just below that entry, but hasn't done that since.Alexion will cut 20% of staff, the biotech said last week, to spend more on research.Alexion fell 2.1% to 143.64 on Monday.The casino giant rose strongly past a 139.77 flat-base buy point on Sept. 1. Since then shares have stayed in the buy zone, aside from flirting with becoming extended. Wynn Resorts rose 0.4% to 143.84 on Monday. Fellow Macau-centric casinos Melco Resorts (MLCO) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) have formed cup bases, with Melco just carving out a handle on Monday.Just because these seven stocks have generally held in a buy zone doesn't mean they'll stay that way. Some may begin to move sharply higher while others falter. As an investor, you want to keep a close eye on your holdings as well as the leading stocks generally and major market averages.RELATED:The Big Picture: Is This Market Pattern Set To Repeat Itself?Apple iPhone 8 Demand Isn't Looking So Hot, Signs ShowThis Defense Giant Just Broke Out; These 2 Rivals Are Near BuysCitigroup Breaks Out; These 4 Other Banking Giants Are Near BuysBiotech And Pharma Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

912,NOV,"Apple (AAPL) began taking pre-orders for its iPhone 8-series smartphones on Friday, but signs point to lackluster demand for the new handsets as Apple fans may be holding out for the premium iPhone X, due out Nov. 3.XIn a report Monday, KGI Securities said the upcoming iPhone X — pronounced ""ten"" as in the Roman numeral — is hurting demand for the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus handsets.Usually when Apple starts taking pre-orders of new iPhones, shipping dates quickly get pushed back three to six weeks. But the iPhone 8 models saw shipment dates pushed out just one to two weeks at most, KGI noted.The iPhone 8-series phones are seen as incremental updates to last year's LCD-screen iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.By contrast, the iPhone X has a 5.8-inch OLED screen and a sleek new design. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus have screen sizes of 4.7 and 5.5-inches, respectively. Apple will start taking pre-orders for the iPhone X on Oct. 27.BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk said U.S. wireless carrier Sprint (S) sweetened its deal for the iPhone 8 after its first weekend of pre-orders. That could be another sign of slack demand for the iPhone 8, he said.""It has only been three days since iPhone 8 pre-orders began, and Sprint already increased their promotion to a 'Free iPhone' headline offer,"" Piecyk said in a report Monday. ""This could be a sign that Sprint's pre-orders of the iPhone 8 did not live up to expectations. Other operators might be experiencing the same result with iPhone pre-orders but feel less pressure than Sprint to use costly promotions to drive subscriber growth.""IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 90, meaning it has outperformed 90% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more analysis of Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Sprint's new ""free iPhone"" offer requires a new line activation and the trade-in of a limited list of the five most valuable smartphones on the market, including Samsung's Galaxy Note 8, which just launched, he said.Meanwhile, Apple is seeing stronger-than-expected demand for its cellular-equipped Apple Watch Series 3 smartwatches. Shipping dates for the new Apple Watch models have been pushed back by three or four weeks, KGI said.Both the Apple Watch Series 3 and the iPhone 8-series handsets are scheduled to hit stores on Friday.Apple shares were down 0.8% to close at 158.67 on the stock market today.RELATED:Apple's Best iPhone — At Least Until November — Goes On SaleApple, Microsoft Lead 7 Top Stocks Holding In Buy Range

913,NOV,"Stock futures rose modestly Monday morning vs. fair value, suggesting continued momentum heading into this week's Federal Reserve policy meeting after the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow industrials all hit record highs on Friday.XApple (AAPL) broke out to a buy point in early August, but key iPhone chip suppliers struggled to break out. On Friday, Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Texas Instruments (TXN) surged past entry points. Keep a close eye on fellow Broadcom (AVGO), Qorvo (QRVO) and Applied Materials (AMAT), as well as giant Intel (INTC), which are approaching buy zones.Meanwhile, Northrop Grumman (NOC) reached a $9.2 billion deal to buy aerospace and defense firm Orbital ATK (OA).Looking ahead, the Federal Reserve will hold a policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, with wide expectations that the central bank will begin to pare its massive balance sheet. Treasury yields have rebounded from 2017 lows in the past few weeks, with several bank stocks nearing buy points.S&P 500 futures rose 0.2% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures also advanced 0.2% Dow futures climbed 0.25%.Asian markets rallied Monday as North Korean tensions receded, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng up 1.3%. European bourses rose modestly intraday.Several chip stocks broke out in Friday stock market trading, including a pair of iPhone chip stocks clearing cup-with-handle buy points in strong volume. That's notable because Apple suppliers had been building sound bases, sometimes flirting with buys, but not really joining their key customer in the buy zone. That raised some doubts about Apple's own breakout, especially with the stock moving sideways for several weeks.Skyworks, which briefly topped a 108.65 buy point intraday on Sept. 5, advanced 2.3% to close at 109.55. Texas Instruments rose 1.8% to 84.78, above an 84.34 entry and hitting a 17-year high.Are these just brief forays into buy zones or the start of a broad advance? One sign will be whether other iPhone chip plays follow suit.Broadcom briefly topped a buy point in late July but then reversed, falling sufficiently to make the old entry point invalid. Broadcom has since formed a new flat base with a 258.59 buy point. Broadcom tested that entry point late last month as the flat base was forming, but didn't close above it. Shares climbed 1.5% on Friday to 250.55, moving back above it 50-day moving average.Qorvo is in a cup base, and just completed a handle, giving it a lower entry point of 75.81. Qorvo jumped 2.7% to 75.49 on Friday, just below that entry.Applied Materials is a chip- and design-equipment giant. It's not a direct iPhone supplier. But some analysts have pegged it as an iPhone play, citing its OLED-related operations. The Apple iPhone X will boast an OLED screen, which is already being used by Samsung on some handsets.Applied Materials tried to break out of a cup-with-handle base on Friday, rising to just hit the 47.69 buy point. But shares pulled back, closing up 0.2% at 47.14.Intel has become a recent supplier of iPhone chips, though you wouldn't want to call the world's largest semiconductor maker an ""Apple play."" But you can say that Intel is near a buy point. Intel surged 5% last week to 36.96, just 2% below a 37.60 double-bottom base. Intel's Relative Strength line has been lagging in 2017 and really for the last several years, reflecting the stock's underperformance vs. the S&P 500 index.For its part Apple rose 1% to 159.88 on Friday, finding support near its 10-week line. That snapped a three-day mild decline following mild disappointment over the late release date for iPhone X. Apple remains in range from a 156.75 flat-base entry.Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus preorders began on Friday. While the tech giant may not indicate how those orders went, big wireless operators, electronics retailers and analysts may give their own estimates of demand.

923,NOV,"When a big name stock like Apple (AAPL) runs up in price, then drops in heavy volume, as it has recently, some investors are tempted to try their hand at short selling, expecting to make money as the stock continues to decline. But how do you know when it's time to go short instead of long?In a bear market or extended downtrend, short selling can be an effective way to make money. But just like with buying stocks on the long side, you need to know how to manage risk and keep the odds in your favor before you start shorting stocks.So if Apple's recent fall below the 10-week moving average has you thinking of shorting its stock, make sure you understand what signals to look for and the risks involved.Short selling is the process of selling borrowed shares of a stock in hopes of buying it back later at a lower price and pocketing the difference.In other words, short selling is essentially the mirror opposite of the more traditional approach to picking stocks in hopes of the share price going up. A short seller is betting that the share price will go down.Before you short a stock, keep the potential pitfalls in mind and have rules for both when to get into and when to get out of the trade. Here are five basic principles to follow.• Only short stocks in a down market.History shows that three out of four stocks move in the same direction as the general market (i.e., the major indexes, particularly the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite.)So if you try to short stocks during a strong uptrend, the odds of those stocks going down, rather than up, is not in your favor. Instead, restrict your short selling to bear markets or clear downtrends.• Focus on stocks that already made big moves.Timing is everything in the stock market, and that's certainly true with short selling.  Even the best-performing stocks will often rise 20% - 25% from a breakout, then start to pull back. If it's still early in that stock's run and the bull cycle is still going strong, it's likely the stock will form a new chart pattern and continue to climb, making short selling a risky proposition.To minimize the chances of getting caught in a sudden rebound, look for market leaders that have already made a huge run, often 300% or more in the current cycle. At that point, you'll often find that the underlying bull market is also getting long in the tooth.Such stocks are more likely to go into an extended and deep correction -- the ideal situation for short sellers.Ambarella (AMBA) in August 2015 provides a good example. From its IPO in October 2012 through July 2015, the chip designer made more than a 20-fold run, boosted by the popularity of GoPro (GPRO) cameras which used its products. Then Ambarella began to run out of steam, providing• Only short highly liquid stocks. As a general rule of thumb, a thinly traded stock is one with an average daily volume under 400,000 shares and/or a daily average dollar volume under $8 million.But when it comes to shorting, you want to focus on stocks with much higher, institutional-quality liquidity (e.g., average daily volume over one million and average daily dollar volume over $20 million).The reason is simple: it takes much more money and trading to move a liquid stock, therefore reducing more volatile swings, up or down.When Ambarella peaked in July 2015 and started to fall, it was highly liquid, trading about four million shares a day at around $120 per share.• Look for signs of a definitive break in the stock.When buying a stock, you look for a heavy-volume breakout from a sound chart pattern. When shorting, you're looking for the reverse: a sharp breakdown or clear change in trend, such as a definitive crash below the 10-week moving average line.Keurig Green Mountain had signaled that it was potentially running out of steam during the week ended Nov. 21, 2014. It fell over 9% on volume 124% above average and closed below the 10-week moving average. From there, the stock formed a head-and-shoulders pattern, a classic formation used by short sellers. (Keurig, which had traded under the GMCR ticker, announced it was being taken private in December 2015.)• Have a plan for taking profits.Just as you shouldn't buy a stock without having a selling strategy, also make sure you have a plan for when to cover a short sale trade.You can apply the same basic guideline used on the long side: take most short selling gains around 20% - 25%. In a particularly rocky or uncertain market, you might take those gains sooner, say, at 10% - 15%.As the old Wall Street saying goes, ""Bulls make money. Bears make money. But pigs get slaughtered."" So don't let your emotions get the best of you when a short trade is working well. Have a plan for locking in your profits and follow it.Editor's Note: This updated story was originally published Feb. 4, 2016.RELATED:How To Sell Stocks ShortThe Short Side: Tips And Lessons On Short Selling

926,NOV,"In the coming era of $1,000 iPhones, will wireless rivals AT&T (T), Sprint (S), T-Mobile U.S. (TMUS) or Verizon Communications (VZ) ever offer ""free"" Apple (AAPL) smartphones again?To make that happen, Apple may need to share in the cost of subsidizing devices. Without naming Apple directly, Sprint Chief Executive Marcelo Claure made that point at a Goldman Sachs conference on Thursday.Sprint does not have any plans to offer the high-end, iPhone X for free, Claure said. Apple's iPhone X starts at $999 for a 64-gigabyte version. Even with a promotion, Sprint would look for customers to put some money down as part of an installment plan, he said.If other smartphone makers follow Apple's lead and roll out higher-priced devices, they may also need to share in subsidizing the retail price, says Claure.""We are still not set in terms of financing an expensive device, the way it has been,"" Claure said. ""I think we should invite the manufacturers to share a little of the cash flow burden that comes with — as the price of devices goes higher. So we still haven't made a decision, whether we are just going to offer — finance $1,000.""""We obviously want to see what happens in a competitive landscape,"" Claure added. ""But we are not too excited with the prices going up, and also having to finance that.""Apple did not respond to an email asking if it's willing to share in iPhone financing costs. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus start at $699 and $799 — $50 higher than the entry-level iPhone 7 pricing a year ago. The iPhone X will not ship until Nov. 3, so early promotions may focus on the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus.Sprint currently offers 50% off an iPhone 8 leasing plan.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.T-Mobile intensified wireless wars last year by launching a ""free"" iPhone 7 promotion with the trade-in of an older device. Sprint, AT&T and Verizon responded with similar offers.This year, the company is giving $300 dollars of credit on the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus to new switchers along with an option to upgrade to the next year's new iPhone for free.T-Mobile CFO Braxton Carter, also speaking at the Goldman conference, said its free iPhone strategy in 2016 didn't work ""because everyone copied us in a few days.""""Free iPhones weren't a great way to get people to switch,"" Braxton said.While AT&T has announced a ""buy one, get one free"" promotion for the iPhone 8 that started today, Wall Street analysts say wireless firms are not offering promotions as aggressive as with the iPhone 7.""Investors are apt to look favorably on the rational behavior, which could soften the margin impact of this upgrade cycle,"" said Mike McCormack, a Jefferies analyst in a report.Apple stock gained 1% to close at 159.88 on the stock market today.RELATED:Verizon Aims To Slash $10 Billion In Costs To Fund DividendAT&T Fires Warning Shot Vs.

928,NOV,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials were little changed early Friday morning despite weak guidance from Oracle (ORCL) and a new North Korean missile launch. That follows a mixed Thursday session for the major averages, but leading stocks were more upbeat: Tesla (TSLA) and Square (SQ) broke out. Boeing (BA) closed just below a buy point, offsetting another dip by fellow Dow titan Apple (AAPL), which is still in buy range.XS&P 500 index futures fell nearly 0.1% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures sank 0.1% against fair value while Dow futures rose nearly 0.1%. All were off their Thursday evening lows.North Korea launched another missile over Japan after New York's market close.

But the software giant's guidance was weaker than expected.Oracle fell 3.6% to 50.90 in late trading on the stock market today, though it found support near its 50-day moving average around the 50 level. That would suggest a drop below a 51.95 flat-base buy point cleared on Monday.During the regular session, the S&P 500 index fell 0.1% and the Nasdaq composite slid 0.5%.

929,NOV,"The Founding Fathers didn't expect that serving in Congress would be a lifetime career. And for a century, it mostly wasn't. The first election in which more than half the incumbent members of the House of Representatives were re-elected was in 1898. Since then, the majority of House members have been returned in every election except the one in 1932.That's the context in which to weigh the fact that three incumbent Republican representatives who have been comfortably re-elected have announced they are retiring — and the rumors that more will do so. Incumbents tend to know — and be known in — their districts. They usually win, whereas open-seat contests often result in changes of party control.The three retiring Republicans are seven-termer Dave Reichert of Washington, seven-termer Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania and two-termer Dave Trott of Michigan.Reichert was re-elected by a 60-40% margin last year in a district dominated by affluent suburbs to the east of Seattle. It also includes some Republican farm country east of the Cascades. Donald Trump lost the district by a 48-45% margin, a little worse than Mitt Romney's 50-48% loss in 2012.Dent was re-elected by a 58-38% margin in a district that includes the industrial and suburban Lehigh Valley around Allentown. Trump carried the district 52-44%, more than Romney's 51-48% margin.Trott was re-elected by a 53-40% margin in a suburban district to the west of Detroit. Trump carried that district 50-45%, and Romney won it 52-47%.So all three ran ahead of Trump in closely divided districts. Demographically, Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District is tilted to non-college-educated whites, among whom Trump ran stronger than traditional Republicans; Washington's 8th District and Michigan's 11th District are tilted to white college graduates, among whom Trump ran behind Romney and George W. Bush.Democrats have been running ahead of Republicans on the generic voting question — which party's candidate will you support for the House of Representatives? — by a 46-37% margin in the RealClearPolitics average. That sounds big, but in the past, the generic vote has tended to overstate Democrats' support, and an unusual percentage chime in as undecided. Also, the clustering of Democratic voters in relatively few urban and university districts means the party could win the House popular vote but still fall well short of a majority, as it did in 2012.But as Real Clear Politics analyst David Byler has noted, the Republican generic numbers have been tracking close to Trump's approval rating. That has risen just a bit during hurricane season but is still underwater in post-Labor Day surveys — at 39.5% approval, 56% disapproval. His favorable/unfavorable numbers are negative, too, but they were similarly negative Nov. 8.The nightmare scenario for House Republicans is that their candidates, especially in open seats, run no better than Trump in high-education districts and no better than traditional Republicans in low-education districts. That's roughly what happened in the four seriously contested special elections this spring. That puts at risk the 241-194 majority Republicans won in 2016.The nightmare scenario facing Republicans like Reichert, Dent and Trott is that they get opposed by Trumpish (or Steve Bannonish) or tea party-type Republicans in their primaries and by well-financed Democrats, who have been lining up to seriously contest the general election.Plus, the reward for winning is coming back to a House Republican Conference split between leadership loyalists and the House Freedom Caucus and dissed and possibly spurned by Trump. Trump and the House Freedom Caucus types share a corrosive distrust of House Speaker Paul Ryan, but their views on important issues are often wildly divergent.House Republican rebels insist on purism and are oblivious to the history that legislative majorities, if they stick together, can move policy significantly in their direction.House Democrats — for example, Henry Waxman with the expansion of Medicaid — did this even in the Reagan years, but not by preventing the party's House leadership from amassing majorities for the basic task of governing.Republican incumbents may be choosing to retire to avoid harsh competition in primaries and in November. But they may also be motivated by something verging on despair over the fact that their party seems likely to fall far short of what it might reasonably have been expected to accomplish with the presidency and majorities in both houses of Congress.In those circumstances, they seem to be behaving as the Founding Fathers expected and as politicians routinely did until 1898 — pursuing other endeavors and letting someone else endure the frustrations of trying to govern.See How To Quickly Find The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch

931,NOV,"When a big name stock like Apple (AAPL) runs up in price, then drops in heavy volume, as it has recently, some investors are tempted to try their hand at short selling, expecting to make money as the stock continues to decline. But how do you know when it's time to go short instead of long?In a bear market or extended downtrend, short selling can be an effective way to make money. But just like with buying stocks on the long side, you need to know how to manage risk and keep the odds in your favor before you start shorting stocks.So if Apple's recent fall below the 10-week moving average has you thinking of shorting its stock, make sure you understand what signals to look for and the risks involved.Short selling is the process of selling borrowed shares of a stock in hopes of buying it back later at a lower price and pocketing the difference.In other words, short selling is essentially the mirror opposite of the more traditional approach to picking stocks in hopes of the share price going up. A short seller is betting that the share price will go down.Before you short a stock, keep the potential pitfalls in mind and have rules for both when to get into and when to get out of the trade. Here are five basic principles to follow.• Only short stocks in a down market.History shows that three out of four stocks move in the same direction as the general market (i.e., the major indexes, particularly the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite.)So if you try to short stocks during a strong uptrend, the odds of those stocks going down, rather than up, is not in your favor. Instead, restrict your short selling to bear markets or clear downtrends.• Focus on stocks that already made big moves.Timing is everything in the stock market, and that's certainly true with short selling.  Even the best-performing stocks will often rise 20% - 25% from a breakout, then start to pull back. If it's still early in that stock's run and the bull cycle is still going strong, it's likely the stock will form a new chart pattern and continue to climb, making short selling a risky proposition.To minimize the chances of getting caught in a sudden rebound, look for market leaders that have already made a huge run, often 300% or more in the current cycle. At that point, you'll often find that the underlying bull market is also getting long in the tooth.Such stocks are more likely to go into an extended and deep correction -- the ideal situation for short sellers.Ambarella (AMBA) in August 2015 provides a good example. From its IPO in October 2012 through July 2015, the chip designer made more than a 20-fold run, boosted by the popularity of GoPro (GPRO) cameras which used its products. Then Ambarella began to run out of steam, providing• Only short highly liquid stocks. As a general rule of thumb, a thinly traded stock is one with an average daily volume under 400,000 shares and/or a daily average dollar volume under $8 million.But when it comes to shorting, you want to focus on stocks with much higher, institutional-quality liquidity (e.g., average daily volume over one million and average daily dollar volume over $20 million).The reason is simple: it takes much more money and trading to move a liquid stock, therefore reducing more volatile swings, up or down.When Ambarella peaked in July 2015 and started to fall, it was highly liquid, trading about four million shares a day at around $120 per share.• Look for signs of a definitive break in the stock.When buying a stock, you look for a heavy-volume breakout from a sound chart pattern. When shorting, you're looking for the reverse: a sharp breakdown or clear change in trend, such as a definitive crash below the 10-week moving average line.Keurig Green Mountain had signaled that it was potentially running out of steam during the week ended Nov. 21, 2014. It fell over 9% on volume 124% above average and closed below the 10-week moving average. From there, the stock formed a head-and-shoulders pattern, a classic formation used by short sellers. (Keurig, which had traded under the GMCR ticker, announced it was being taken private in December 2015.)• Have a plan for taking profits.Just as you shouldn't buy a stock without having a selling strategy, also make sure you have a plan for when to cover a short sale trade.You can apply the same basic guideline used on the long side: take most short selling gains around 20% - 25%. In a particularly rocky or uncertain market, you might take those gains sooner, say, at 10% - 15%.As the old Wall Street saying goes, ""Bulls make money. Bears make money. But pigs get slaughtered."" So don't let your emotions get the best of you when a short trade is working well. Have a plan for locking in your profits and follow it.Editor's Note: This updated story was originally published Feb. 4, 2016.RELATED:How To Sell Stocks ShortThe Short Side: Tips And Lessons On Short Selling

932,NOV,"Investors dumped stocks in late-afternoon trading Wednesday after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates, as widely expected. The Dow industrials were holding up the best among the key benchmarks, losing less than 0.1% at around 2:45 p.m. ET, after marking a new all-time high of 21,354 earlier in the day.But the Nasdaq composite dropped 0.6%, while the S&P 500 was off 0.3%, disguising decent gains from grain, non-alcoholic beverage, homebuilding, automaker, packaged food, meat and tobacco stocks.Weak U.S. economic data on retail sales and consumer prices sent long U.S. government bonds soaring, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note falling to as low as 2.10%. That low takes the yield on the 10-year bond back to levels right after the Nov. 8 U.S. elections.While the fed funds rate is like to go up a quarter point to a target range of 1%-1.25%, banking stocks are falling amid poor data on U.S. retail sales (down 0.3% in May, vs. the Econoday consensus view for a 0.1% rise). However, damage is relatively limited among the top financial plays so far.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) dropped as much as 1.5% before shaving losses to around 0.7% at 86.66, but volume at 2:30 p.m. ET was running well below usual levels.Among the groups leading the upside, IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial industry group is a market leader, ranked No. 6 among 197 industry groups for six-month relative price performance.The group has at least eight companies boasting a Composite Rating of 95 or higher, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. They include NVR (NVR), Taylor Morrison (TMHC), MDC Holdings (MDC), Pulte Group (PHM), MI Homes (MHO) and Toll Bros. (TOL).NVR added 0.4% to 2,443 in dull volume. The luxury homebuilder in the East Coast ran past a 1,845.47 saucer-type base entry after reporting an 18% rise in fourth-quarter earnings per share on Jan. 25. For now, shares are extended. Taylor Morrison, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., is extended from a first-stage big cup with handle at 18.46. Shares are up more than 3% for the week at 24.49.Industry peer D.R. Horton (DHI) is not in this elite group, yet its 92 Composite Rating is still respectable. The Fort Worth, Texas, maker of single-family homes rose 2% to 34.63, poking briefly above a 34.64 entry in a long cup with handle.Horton has done a solid job of posting steady and solid gains on both the top and bottom lines.Earnings have nearly quadrupled over the past four years, from 67 cents a share in fiscal 2012 (ended in September that year) to $2.36 a share in FY 2016. Sales have jumped from $4.35 billion to $12.16 billion over the same time frame.However, the Street is expecting slower growth in the future, and that may have something to do with the stock's recent failed attempts to make much of a gain after a solid breakout. The stock, as seen in a daily chart, tried to clear a 34.15 handle buy point on April 17-18, but notice how volume was less than stellar. The stock sold off hard the next several sessions, but Horton has done a good job of not falling too far below its critical 50-day moving average.IBD's TAKE: Home Depot is not the only consumer spending stock that is excelling this year. Go to IBD Big Cap 20 to find at least six names that are benefiting from strong demand in the medical, leisure and building-related industries.Pulte bucked the decline with a 0.6% rise to 24.28 and volume was heavy. The stock briefly advanced past a 24.53 buy point in a new seven-week flat base. The 12% decline within the base falls within normal range for a flat base, one of the most bullish patterns that great stocks form en route to excellent breakouts and fantastic price gains.Despite some questionable action by the builders on Wednesday, the prospect of a continued slow rise in the cost of money should be a tail wind for these builders and related stocks, since low interest rates encourage home buying. Home Depot (HD) gained more than 1% to 156.42 in fast turnover, triggering a new follow-on entry point as it finds nice buying support at the 50-day moving average. It's the second test of the 50-day line since the DIY building products retailer cleared a 137.42 cup-with-handle buy point in January.The Dow 30 component and mega-cap retailer has a decent but not great Composite Rating of 82 on a scale of 1 to 99. But that masks reasonable EPS growth targets of 12% and 13% in the next two full fiscal years.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Apple (AAPL) surrendered minor early gains and fell nearly 1% to 145.21, but the tech leader is still trading just 2% below its rising 50-day moving average. As noted in prior Stock Market Today columns earlier this week, the iPhone maker is in the midst of a general turnaround in both earnings and revenue growth. The stock had broken out of a proper cup-with-handle base on Jan. 6-9, moving smoothly past a 118.12 entry, 10 cents above the handle's high. Apple has since rallied more than 30%.Five Below (FIVE) sank as much as 6% to a session low of 48, undercutting its 50-day moving average for the first time since March. The stock is trying to rebound off that low but is still down 5%. Volume is running more than double normal levels. A future rebound and close near or above the 50-day line, currently around 49.59, would mark a bullish shakeout.RELATED:In Stock Market Today: Is Apple Flashing A New Buy Signal?Top Growth Stocks Today: Check The Latest IBD 50Strong Large-Cap Names: What's In The Current IBD Big Cap 20?

934,NOV,"XIn general, pride doth cometh before the fall. So can excessive optimism or widespread complacency.However, there is also harm in relying on just one secondary psychological indicator to decide whether we are near or at the stock market's peak.This is one reason why IBD furnishes a set of multiple sentiment indicators. An entire webpage at Investors.com, called Psychological Market Indicators, is designed to help prevent you from seeing changes in investor emotion in a vacuum.The put-call volume ratio, discussed frequently not only in Investor's Corner but also IBD's The Big Picture column, should also go on your dashboard of investor-sentiment indicators. The Big Picture contains a link to a page that shows a line graph of the put-call ratio right below a large daily chart of the Nasdaq composite.Fundamentals are extremely important in the stock market. The interaction between equities and other financial assets is critical too, and so is the level of buying and selling by institutional investors. But never forget that greed, fear, hope and despair will always hold great force on the movement of stock and market index prices, particularly at market extremes.To figure out the put-call ratio, IBD adds up all of the put trades from the major U.S. options exchanges and divides that sum by the total volume in calls traded each day. Since puts are a contract giving the buyer the right to sell a security at a given price, they usually carry a bearish streak. Calls are generally bullish, since they give the buyer the option to buy the underlying stock at a fixed price.Since total puts make up the numerator and total calls make up the denominator, most of the time you will see the ratio below 1.00. The natural bias of equities is up. You would expect the crowd to be generally more bullish than bearish.So when puts are heavily traded relative to calls, you'll see the put-call volume ratio spike. As noted frequently in the Big Picture, a ratio hitting 1.15 or higher has proved bullish for equities lately.  A jump in bearish sentiment is often good. It means that more folks have bet against the market, thinking stocks will go down. When stocks keep moving up, these speculators are forced to reverse their bets and become buyers. Or they must cover short positions.The put-call ratio has made some big spikes over the past year, including 1.20 on Oct. 28, just two weeks before the U.S. elections. For every 100 calls traded, investors bought 120 puts. Bears crowded the options market.Yet soon after, the major indexes flexed strength, and the current outlook in The Big Picture switched to ""uptrend resumes"" from ""uptrend under pressure."" From its Nov. 4 low of 5034, the Nasdaq composite has catapulted more than 25%.That Oct. 28 spike in puts was not isolated; the put-call rose again to 1.22 on Nov. 1 and 1.21 on Nov. 4.U.S. stocks have had quite a nice run since November. Meanwhile, the recent dips in the put-call ratio have not really been that low.On Aug. 3, 2016, the ratio cooled to 0.65. For every 65 puts traded, investors bought and sold 100 calls. That still indicates a relatively high level of bearishness.Fast-forward to this past Friday, following a big sell-off in the Nasdaq composite, IBD's put-call volume ratio rose to 0.97. Puts nearly equaled calls.How low, then, is abnormally low?The March 2000 top in the Nasdaq composite offers a historical clue. After an Oct. 28, 1999, follow-through, the Nasdaq sprinted more than 45% higher in less than 10 weeks. By Jan. 14, 2000, the put-call shrank to 0.38 (1). Nearly two months later on March 10, the ratio hit a low of 0.36 (2). In other words,  optimism was running so high that roughly a third of the total calls traded daily were matched by puts.That 0.36 reading was also the lowest level since a 0.33 reading on Nov. 28, 1998.The Nasdaq peaked on March 10, 2000, at 5132, as institutional selling sharpened and multiple days of heavy distribution days popped up over a short time frame. The tech-rich index fell 78% over the next two years and seven months.RELATED:How To Find Major Market Tops The Simple WayThink A Market Pullback Is Due?

935,NOV,"Stocks racked up commendable gains in light trade Monday, hauling both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average further above their 50-day moving averages.The session opened boosted by Saturday's announcement of more than $300 billion in long-term deals between U.S. manufacturers and Saudi Arabia, a set of bargains timed to correspond with President Trump's first trip to Saudi Arabia. The news lifted defense plays led by Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN), as well as National Oilwell Varco (NOV) and others.  Boeing and Lockheed Martin ended up nearly 2%.Ford (F) held its early gain, ending Monday up more than 2% after announcing it had replaced Chief Executive Mark Fields with Jim Hackett, the former CEO of Steelcase (SCS) who has headed Ford's Smart Mobility experimental operations unit. Fields held the CEO seat for three years. Ford shares have been in a 34-month decline.The Nasdaq composite led, up 0.8%, as more than 10% of the Nasdaq 100 stocks climbed more than 2%.  Autodesk (ADSK) led the Nasdaq 100, up more than 3% to a new high and adding to the 15% gain posted last week. Fiber optic telecom stocks posted the session's best gain among industries, boosted by a handful of analyst reports. Acacia Communications (ACIA), Applied OptoElectronics (AAOI) and Finisar (FNSR) each gained more than 10%.Makers of medical software also scored high, skewed higher by a 23% gain by the thinly traded Polarityte (COOL).  Group leader Veeva Systems (VEEV) is extended. But peer Cerner (CERN) is trading just below a 66.37 buy point in a four-weeks tight pattern.The Dow Jones industrial average scaled up 0.5%. Cisco Systems (CSCO) led the index, rebounding 2% as it looked to salvage support at its 40-week moving average after diving 7% in gale-force volume last week.Losses among blue chips were generally modest, Pfizer's (PFE) fell hardest among the Dow industrials, down 1%.The S&P 500 scored a 0.6% gain. Jack Daniels distiller Brown Forman (BFB) ran atop the list with an 8% gain, clearing its prior high from August 2015.Chipmaker Qorvo (QRVO) sped 4% higher and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) jumped 3%, both taking new highs.Defense consultant Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) spiked 6%, possibly aided by Saturday's announcement of more than $300 billion in U.S-Saudi defense deals, but also because it reported first-quarter earnings and revenue above expectations, and hosted its full year revenue guidance past consensus targets.  The gap up gain lifted shares just above a 37.79 buy point in a flat base.RELATED:Dow Jones Industrial Average and Dow Stocks: News & AnalysisTop Housing Stocks Near Buy Points: Investing Action Plan

936,NOV,"X Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) were among firms that promised tech transfers and local development as part of $150 billion in deals with Saudi Arabia announced during President Trump's visit over the weekend.Technology transfers and local production could boost the kingdom's industrial know-how as it diversifies away from oil and potentially reduces its dependence on U.S.-made products, despite Trump's ""America first"" policy promise. However, some of the deals were negotiated under the Obama administration, and many aren't finalized yet, with more negotiations needed.Lockheed said in a release that Saudi Arabia wants to buy more than $28 billion in ""integrated air and missile defense, combat ship, tactical aircraft and rotary wing technologies and programs.""A letter of intent was singed with Saudi tech firm Taqnia to form a joint venture to support the completion of 150 S-70 Black Hawk helicopters.Lockheed has been eager to offer technology transfers and joint-venture opportunities to boost its market share overseas. The company wants 30% of all sales to be from foreign allies in the coming years.Last year, Lockheed offered tech transfers and offered to move its F-16 manufacturing line to India to secure a massive fighter jet order from New Delhi.Lockheed shares closed up 1.55% at 277.03 on the stock market today, still in buy range.The maker of Tomahawk cruise missiles and the Patriot air-defense system announced plans to form Raytheon Arabia, a Raytheon branch that will focus on boosting local Saudi defense and security capabilities.Shares finished 0.6% higher at 161.19, also still in buy range.The aerospace giant didn't give total figures for its agreements, which include a deal for Chinook helicopter and support services, guided-weapons systems and the P-8 reconnaissance plane.Boeing (BA) also announced a joint venture to provide sustainment services on military platforms as part of the Saudi Vision 2030 economic reform program Saudi Arabia announced last year to help ease its dependence on oil revenue.On the commercial side, Saudi Gulf Airlines said it would negotiate buying up to 16 widebody airplanes.Boeing shares rallied 1.6% to 183.67, trying to regain their 185.81 buy point.General Electric (GE) announced $15 billion in deals. GE said it will also provide digital technology for Saudi Aramco, the state-run oil company. Aramco announced $50 billion in agreements with U.S. companies, with $200 billion in overall deals.But GE noted that some of the deals were just memorandums of understanding, which need more deal-making before they are finalized.GE shares edged up 0.5% to 28.18.National Oilwell Varco (NOV) announced a joint venture to make specialty drilling rigs and equipment in Saudi Arabia. The deal will include $6 billion in investment over the next decade.Dow Chemical (DOW) said it would build a polymer and coatings plant in Saudi Arabia.Honeywell (HON) signed a $3.6 billion memorandum of understanding to localize products in Aramco's supply chain.RELATED: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsEnergy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

938,NOV,"For an education on China-based Sina (SINA), consider the similarities between it and longtime internet presence Yahoo.XBoth are pioneering but aging web portals. The two also have been targeted by activist investors seeking to shake up their board of directors and ignite major changes.In Yahoo's case, its crown jewel was a big stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA). Sina, meanwhile, controls social media firm Weibo (WB), whose Twitter- and Instagram-like app has 361 million users. Weibo's advertising revenue has boomed as it cashes in on hosting accounts from most of the country's pop stars, and it has served as Sina's bread-and-butter.Indeed, Weibo shares have shot up 144% in 2017. Sina stock has jumped 108%, partly due to its controlling stake in fast-growing Weibo and speculation that activist investor Aristeia Capital could win its proxy fight vs. Sina, in which it calls for a sale of the company or a divestiture of Weibo.""We estimate that Sina's stock price could go up by 15% to 45% if it potentially adopts the proposal raised by Aristeia,"" JPMorgan said in a note to clients.Aristeia also has proposed a complete spinoff of Weibo to Sina shareholders or a bigger stock buyback. Shanghai-based Sina spun out Weibo in 2014 but still consolidates its financials in earnings. Sina owns 46% of Weibo and controls 72% of voting power.There are some big differences between Yahoo and Sina, though. Starboard Value, the activist investor that targeted Yahoo, succeeded in forcing the sale of its core internet business to Verizon Communications (VZ). But U.S.-based hedge fund Aristeia faces an uphill battle in China, where proxy battles launched by foreign shareholders are rare.Sina holds its annual meeting on Nov. 3, where all shareholders will vote on Aristeia's proposal. The sale of Sina would come at a premium delivered to a third-party buyer. Alibaba looms as a candidate because it owns a 31% stake in Weibo. Another buyer could be Qihoo 360 (QIHU), the security software maker, analysts say.Sina management could make a counteroffer before the Nov. 3 meeting. So far, though, management has argued that Aristeia shouldn't have too much say in the company's direction, because it only holds a 4.2% stake.Aristeia would control 30% of Sina's board, if it expands to seven from five members. Aristeia is pursuing a ""short-term and self-serving agenda,"" Sina management said in a letter to shareholders.Another Aristeia proposal is a reverse merger in which Weibo would acquire Sina. But analysts see few synergies in recombining the two companies.Excluding Weibo, Sina doesn't have a growth engine. Sina's news portal is still popular, with 64 million  users, but it's unprofitable. On the plus side, its advertising revenue is expected to fall only 2% in 2017 compared with a 10% drop last year. Most non-Weibo ad revenue comes from online payments.Sina has leveraged Weibo to gain mobile users of its news app. But it faces keen competition from Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), Baidu (BIDU)  and others. In a blow, Chinese news aggregator Toutiao recently severed its links with Sina and Weibo. Toutiao owns the popular Today's Headlines service.One bright spot is internet finance, though revenue is still small, says Zhang Xueru, an analyst at 86 Research. Founded in 2009, Sina has dabbled in finance since late 2013.Sina aims to expand into microloans, online banking and online brokerage businesses. In the July quarter, ""online finance bore fruit after cultivation of this business over the past few years,"" said a Goldman Sachs report.Sina has created a $500 million fund for investing in internet-finance-related startups.Sina also owns stakes in Tian Ge, an online karaoke company and Leju, an online real estate broker. Sina also has invested in Yixia Technology, a developer of video apps for Weibo.Weibo's June-quarter revenue jumped 72% to $253.4 million from a year earlier, while earnings per share rose 138% to 38 cents. Weibo had been slow to put advertisements inside social streams over concerns that ads would turn off users. In the June quarter, advertisers reached 880,000, up 13% from the previous quarter.Weibo is readying a new advertising system that analysts expect to boost revenue in 2018. The new system consolidates Weibo's services and products and lets advertisers bid for ad slots.IBD'S TAKE: Sina has stayed mostly above a buy point reached in early August and has hovered above the buy zone since early September. Weibo, meanwhile, has been in a flat base since early September and is targeting a 108.40 buy point. The new system will also enable Weibo to provide targeted ads based on user data.Weibo's main rival has been Tencent's mobile messaging service WeChat, called Weixin in Chinese, whose users will top 490 million in 2017, says eMarketer. Weibo has told analysts it's aiming for 400 million monthly users by the end of 2017. Weibo is using partnerships with mobile phone makers to sign up new users in second- and third-tier cities in rural areas.""WeChat and Weibo are two different social platforms,"" said Zhang at 86 Research, in an interview. ""They've evolved to fill distinctive needs, with different user bases.""Many Weibo users are looking for entertainment and gossip news. Most of the country's movie stars, singers and other celebrities use Weibo accounts for publicity. Weibo users can buy gifts for celebrities through Weibo's online payment system.Similar to YouTube, controlled by Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google unit, Weibo allows users to post short videos. Weibo introduced livestreaming for users in mid-2016, borrowing a tack from Facebook (FB) and Twitter's Periscope. Pop stars are among the livestreamers.Karen Chan, a Jefferies analyst, expects revenue upside for Weibo in 2018 from its partnership with livestreaming specialist Yizhibo. Weibo users can view Yizhibo livestreams and videos and interact with its broadcasters. Yizhibo competes with Momo (MOMO).There's also Weibo Stories, launched in April. It's similar to Facebook Stories and allows Weibo users to share photos and videos with followers. The content disappears after 24 hours.  An HSBC report says 10% of Weibo users are already sharing content monthly.""Rich content is what differentiates Weibo from other social platforms,"" said Jialong Shi, an Instinet/Nomura analyst in a report.Sina shares dipped 1% Friday to close at 110.48 while Weibo was off 1.5% to finish at 95.48.RELATED:Sogou, Mobile Search Rival Of Baidu And Alibaba, Files For IPOThe Spigots Are Expected To Open Soon For This Energy ExplorerSquare Snares Sellers With Sticky Services In Financial TechMomo Is On Fire, Thanks To The Kindness Of Strangers

943,NOV,"While Apple's (AAPL) latest iPhones received the lion's share of media attention this week, the company's entrance into the augmented-reality field might have been the most significant development at its fall product launch event Tuesday.XApple's iPhone X and iPhone 8 series handsets have enhanced sensor arrays and software capabilities that aim to take AR mainstream.Augmented reality overlays digital information on to a person's field of view using either mobile device displays or special glasses. Potential applications include navigation, education, entertainment, e-commerce and providing useful location-related information.Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has touted the potential for augmented reality since June when the company introduced its AR Kit for software developers. He said Apple's mobile devices soon will be the largest platform for AR software.Apple's new iPhones set the stage for augmented reality to go mainstream, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said in a report Tuesday.""We believe AR has the potential to become the next killer app that accelerates smartphone upgrades and drives increased services monetization and growth,"" she said.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 90, meaning it has outperformed 90% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more analysis on Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.The new iPhones are the first smartphones designed for augmented reality, Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said at the launch event. That includes cameras calibrated for AR and new processors, gyroscopes, accelerometers and other sensors to drive the experience, he said.At its product launch event, Apple showed off four AR apps, including two video games that superimpose digital action onto real-world images: ""Warhammer 40,000: Freeblade"" from Pixel Toys and ""The Machines"" from Directive Games.The other apps provide users with situational information. The MLB At Bat app shows real-time player information and statistics on top of the baseball game you're watching. The Sky Guide app overlays a star map on the sky around you.Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said the AR demonstrations were ""fairly cool,"" but he doesn't see AR becoming a big deal until it makes the leap from smartphone displays to smartglasses.""While we continue to believe that AR in the near-to-medium term will have an immaterial financial impact on Apple, we see AR hardware (e.g., glasses) as a significant opportunity in three- to-five years, and AR Kit and developer engagement today are important longer-term building blocks to that goal,"" Sacconaghi said in a report Wednesday.Apple's AR Kit enables software developers to create augmented-reality apps for any iPhone starting with the iPhone 6S, which came out two years ago.""In the medium to long term, however, we see substantial opportunity for Apple to capitalize on AR technology by releasing its own set of smartglasses hardware,"" Sacconaghi said. ""Should they be successful, we believe that Apple smartglasses could potentially generate over $25 billion in annual hardware sales within three years of release.""Apple shares dipped 0.9% to close at 158.28 on the stock market today. Apple has now fallen for three straight days since its new iPhone unveiling.RELATED:Apple Unveils $999 iPhone X, But You Can't Get One Until Nov. 3Apple Not The Only Stock Play In Augmented Reality: Morgan Stanley

944,NOV,"Major indexes traded mixed in late afternoon trading Thursday, but remained in good shape overall.XMeanwhile, Square (SQ) showed a solid breakout from a second-stage base with a 28.07 entry. The electronic payments facilitator rose more than 4% to 28.77 and is still in buy range.As noted in IBD's premium stock-picking service, Leaderboard, the stock is in buy range. Don't buy shares more than 5% past the proper entry, or in this case 29.47.At 3:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite was off nearly 0.5% but remains up for the week with a 1.1% weekly gain. Plus, the Nasdaq's intraday range is narrow, suggesting that large players in the market — from mutual funds and hedge funds to banks, insurers and pension managers — are reluctant to sell with vigor.The S&P 500 was off just 0.1% and is within arm's length of its recent new all-time high of 2498. The S&P SmallCap 600 was down nearly 0.2%.Only a handful of IBD's 197 industry groups are up 1% or more; they include the solar, automaker, water utility, hospital, leisure product and semiconductor equipment names. Applied Materials (AMAT) is leading the chip gear names with a 2% gain to 47.19 in slightly above-average turnover.Watch for a potential breakout by the tech giant past a 47.96 base entry. Aggressive traders could act if the stock breaches the 47.59 near-term high.There doesn't seem to be too much hoopla about the possibility of the S&P 500 breaking the 2500 barrier. In fact, as seen in IBD's Psychological Market Indicators section, bullishness among stock newsletter editors tracked by Investors Intelligence has actually fallen to 47.1%, the lowest since the aftermath of the Nov. 8 U.S. elections.Meanwhile, the put-call volume ratio recently notched a high of 1.18 on Aug. 17, meaning that among options traders, pessimism is still rampant. And that's good for equities. Why? Pessimistic investors have generally sold stocks and raised cash, thinking that equities are due to fall. But if they don't, these pessimists could potentially become new buyers of stocks.The Dow Jones industrial average rose nearly 0.2% as four of the 30 components, including United Technologies (UTX), 3M (MMM) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), rose 1 point or more.United Tech is trying to reclaim its key long-term support level, the 200-day moving average, which is near 116. Meanwhile, the 50-day moving average is now trending lower. The manufacturer of aircraft engines, elevators and security systems triggered a sell signal for short-term investors when shares pierced the 50-day moving average near 122 during a high-volume sell-off on July 25.On that day, United Tech reported a 2% jump in Q2 profit to $1.85 a share. Earnings growth has been stuck in the low- to mid-single digits for four straight quarters, unlike the bigger EPS increases seen among members of IBD Big Cap 20, IBD's screen for premier growth companies with a market value of $15 billion or more.Like Apple (AAPL) in earlier years, when Steve Jobs reassumed the CEO post, then spurred a series of game-changing consumer electronic devices and digital services, San Francisco-based Square has made a big hit with its easy-to-use hardware and software for small shops and individual sole proprietors (think plumbers, taxi drivers and the like) to enable fast, secure transactions at the point of sale.IBD's TAKE: Notice how, on a daily chart, Square is showing two bullish traits. First, the stock found buyers near the 50-day moving average (painted in red on an IBD daily chart), a common occurrence among stocks that get strong institutional support. Second, the relative strength line, drawn in blue in both IBD charts and in IBD's professional-grade stock screening and charting service MarketSmith, has rocketed into new high ground. This means that Square is sharply outperforming the S&P 500.Square lost money from 2012 to 2015, but last year it notched earnings of 4 cents a share. Wall Street now expects profit to catapult 500% higher this year to 24 cents a share and another 79% to 43 cents in 2018.Revenue jumped 35% to $1.71 billion in 2016, up from $203 million in 2012. The Street sees the top line sliding 45% to $942 million this year, but then rebounding 25% to $1.17 billion in 2018.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Square gets a commanding 98 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, which means that the stock's fundamental, technical and fund sponsorship attributes place it in the top 2% of all companies in IBD's database.As noted in IBD Leaderboard, the current new base is second stage.Apple shares, meanwhile, continue to hold on to a thin gain following an Aug. 2 breakout from a second-stage flat base at 156.75. The stock was featured heavily in IBD's Stock Market Today column back in early January when the iPhone giant broke out of a first-stage bottoming base at 118.12. Shares have since climbed more than 39%.Apple is expected to post a third quarter in a row of double-digit EPS growth, up 13% to $1.88 a share in the September-ending fiscal fourth quarter.Apple's earnings rose 2% in the fiscal first quarter ended in December 2016, snapping a three-quarter streak of falling profits, then grew 11% and 18% in the next two quarters.In FY 2018, earnings are accelerating 21% to $10.91 a share, up from an 8% jump in the current fiscal year.Elsewhere, Oracle (ORCL) is hanging tight ahead of its fiscal first-quarter results due after the close. The stock, nearly flat at 52.74, holds a 12% cushion of gains after it gapped up powerfully on June 22 on improved Q4 results. That move sent shares past a 47.09 entry in a solid flat-base pattern.The database and cloud-based enterprise software giant is mimicking Apple's latest trend of slowly reaccelerating its growth. In the November-ended fiscal second quarter, Oracle's earnings slumped 3%, but then rebounded 8% and 10% in the past two quarters. Analysts see Q1 profit rising 9% to 60 cents a share on a 5% increase in revenue to $9.03 billion.In fiscal Q4, Oracle's net margin improved by 220 basis points to 34.5%.In other financial markets, WTI crude oil futures surged nearly 2% and reached as high as $50.50 a barrel intraday, while natural gas futures eclipsed the $3/million BTU level and hit its highest levels since May of last year. Futures got as high as $3.10.The sell-off in U.S. government bonds remained in place; the yield on the benchmark Treasury 10-year bond returned to the 2.20% level.The spread between the 3-month note (1.05% yield) and the 10-year bond remains healthy at 115 basis points.RELATED:When To Sell A Stock: Take Many Gains When The Profit Reaches This LevelHow To Invest: How To See If It's The Right Time To Buy StocksInvesting For Kids: How To Make A Million Dollars

945,NOV,"Not long after debuting a trio of new in-house brands, Target (TGT) said it is teaming up with HGTV stars Chip and Joanna Gaines to launch an exclusive home and lifestyle brand this November, Hearth & Hand with Magnolia.XThe move essentially confirms an earlier Investor's Business Daily story that looked at Target's trademark filings for a glimpse of possible planned exclusive brands.The Hearth & Hand brand, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office filing, was set to represent wood preservatives and stains, paints, potpourri, soap, lotions, digital scales, measuring spoons and cups and Christmas decorations.Target said late Tuesday that the new line, which launches Nov. 5 — ahead of Thanksgiving and Christmas — will include over 300 items across ""tabletop, home decor and giftables."" Unlike some other designer collaborations, this collection is not a limited-time-only offering; it will last ""multiple years.""Creating exclusivity has mounted in importance for retailers looking to set themselves apart from one another — and from Amazon (AMZN) — and build loyalty among customers. (Amazon, incidentally, has a slew of its own private-label brands.)""In a retail environment where differentiation has never been more important, we're doubling down and introducing more than a dozen new brands to provide guests with even more reasons to choose Target,"" said Target's merchandising head, Mark Tritton, in the corporate blog post Wednesday.Shares of Target rose 2.8% to 59.52 in the stock market today, closing just below the 200-day moving average after crossing above that support level for the first time since Jan. 4. Target slashed prices on ""thousands"" of items last week, sending shares downward and taking Wal-Mart (WMT) and Costco (COST) with it.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Women's apparel collection A New Day and menswear line Goodfellow recently hit Target shelves, and midcentury modern home-furnishings line Project 62 is slated to debut next week.Obvious Foods, Universal Thread Goods, United Thread, Blue & Other and Opalhouse are a few of the other trademarks that have been filed by Target in recent months.RELATED:EXCLUSIVE: Will These Trademarks Be Target's New Private-Label Brands?Target Cheerfully Slashes 'Thousands' Of Prices — And Investors FretRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To Watch

946,NOV,"Apple's (AAPL) 11th-generation smartphones received generally positive reviews from Wall Street analysts, but the later-than-expected launch of the company's flagship iPhone X handset put a damper on their enthusiasm.XApple shares slipped 0.8% to close at 159.65 on the stock market today.Apple announced the iPhone X (pronounced ""ten"") at a media event Tuesday along with two iPhone 8 smartphones, the Apple Watch Series 3 smartwatch and the Apple TV 4K set-top box.The star of the show was Apple's iPhone X, the company's 10th-anniversary smartphone. It features a 5.8-inch OLED screen with no physical home button to interrupt the display. The iPhone X uses facial recognition technology called Face ID to unlock the device and authenticate mobile payments.The iPhone X has an improved rear camera with dual optical image stabilization and better battery life than its predecessor. It comes in a sleek new design with front and rear glass panels.With a starting price of $999, the iPhone X is Apple's most expensive smartphone yet. And interested buyers will have to wait to get their hands on it. The iPhone X will be available for pre-order on Oct. 27 in more than 55 countries and territories, but won't be available in stores until Nov. 3. Even then, it's likely to be in short supply for months because of production constraints, analysts caution.The iPhone X doesn't have enough added functionality to justify its $999 starting price, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Andy Hargreaves said in a report.""IPhone X provides little to drive an upgrade beyond the look,"" he said. ""The device offered little that we view as compelling enough to justify a $300 premium to the iPhone 8.""William Blair analyst Anil Doradla disagreed, saying many consumers will splurge on the iPhone X.""Given the increasing dependence on smartphones and the role they play in consumers' daily lives, Apple is betting on consumers' willingness to pay up (which we believe is the right strategy),"" Doradla said in report.The iPhone X ""catapults Apple into the ultraluxury smartphone market,"" Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White said in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 92, meaning it has outperformed 92% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more analysis of Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.UBS analyst Steven Milunovich was surprised by Apple's name for its flagship smartphone.""We expected the iPhone X to be pronounced 'X' rather than 'ten,' "" he said in a report. ""Ten makes sense as the tenth year anniversary, but why not just call it the iPhone 10? Ten makes the new iPhone 8 sound old — maybe that's intentional to prompt customers to reach for the X. Also, where does naming go next year — to the iPhone 9 and 11?""Apple also introduced two traditional LCD-screen handsets, the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, which have display sizes of 4.7 and 5.5 inches, respectively. Those phones will be available for pre-order starting Friday and in stores a week later, on Sept. 22. That's six weeks before the iPhone X arrives in stores.The iPhone 8 is priced starting at $699, while the larger-screen iPhone 8 Plus starts at $799. They sport faster processors and other upgraded components vs. the current iPhone 7 series.The iPhone X and 8 series phones feature wireless charging and fast wired charging as well as new augmented reality capabilities. The wireless charging works with the established Qi ecosystem, including new wireless-charging mats from privately held Belkin and Mophie, a unit of Zagg (ZAGG).On Tuesday, Apple gave a sneak preview of AirPower, its wireless charging accessory coming in 2018. The charging pad has a surface large enough to charge up to three devices simultaneously. It can charge the new iPhones, the Apple Watch Series 3, and a new wireless charging case for AirPods wireless earphones.Apple decided to keep five older model iPhones in its lineup: last year's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the two-year-old iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, as well as the entry-level iPhone SE. It cut the prices of the iPhone 7 series and 6S series phones by $100 and trimmed the price of its SE model by $50.All told, Apple will be offering eight different model iPhones, with prices ranging from $349 to $1,149.""So many models may be confusing to consumers and Apple will likely need to simplify the portfolio in the next cycle or two,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long said in a report.Apple's iPhone pricing strategy is risky, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a report. The iPhone X costs $230 more than the current iPhone 7 Plus. Apple also bumped up the entry price for the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus by $50 and $30, respectively.""The risk is that the iPhone X and iPhone 8 are simply viewed as too expensive (and not sufficiently differentiated), and that consumers ultimately choose an older iPhone, given that Apple is continuing to sell the SE, starting at $349, the 6S at $449, and the iPhone 7 at $549,"" Sacconaghi said.Guggenheim analyst Robert Cihra pounded the table for Apple stock on Wednesday. He reiterated his buy rating and upped his price target.""With shares up 39% year to date vs. the S&P 500's 11%, many investors now feel they should 'sell the news' but we disagree and rather raise our price target to $200 from $190, as rising iPhone average selling prices further accelerate revenue growth,"" Cihra said in a report. ""We continue to see Apple now set up for its biggest iPhone cycle in 3 years, providing more runway for appreciation driven by our expectation for: 1) pent-up demand, 2) a multiyear OLED rollout and 3) double-digit increases in iPhone's blended average selling price.""RELATED:Apple Introduces $999 iPhone X, But Not Available Until Nov. 3Lumentum Slips, Analysts Ponder Apple's iPhone X Sensor Content

947,NOV,"Apple's (AAPL) 11th-generation smartphones could provide a lift for several chip companies, Wall Street analysts said Wednesday.Broadcom (AVGO), Cypress Semiconductor (CY) and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) are among the chipmakers expected to benefit from the launch this fall of Apple's iPhone X and iPhone 8 series smartphones, which were unveiled Tuesday. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus handsets are scheduled for release on Sept. 22, while the iPhone X (pronounced ""ten"") is due out on Nov. 3.Broadcom is the biggest direct beneficiary of the new Apple handsets, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh said in a report.""We view the launch of the new iPhones as most positive for Broadcom with (its) content expected to increase 40% and with the number of chips increasing to eight from five,"" Vinh said. ""We believe the three additional chips will be needed for 3D touch, wireless charging, and RF (radio frequency).""Other chipmakers likely to increase their content in the new iPhones include Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO).Skyworks is seen making double-digit content gains in the new iPhones, while Qorvo makes single-digit gains, Vinh said.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks now includes seven chip industry players, including Skyworks Solutions.Cypress Semi is likely to get a boost from Apple's use of fast-charging technology in its new iPhones.""We view the enablement of fast charging in the new iPhones as positive for Cypress, as we anticipate content of 30 to 40 cents in each of the new iPhones,"" Vinh said. ""We currently do not anticipate the iPhones will ship with the fast-charging cable and block in the box, as these will be add-on accessories.""While the new iPhones likely have wireless-charging chips supplied by Broadcom, rival Integrated Device Technology is seen as benefiting from the overall smartphone industry adoption of wireless charging.IDT already has secured design wins from Chinese smartphone makers, who are predicted to follow Apple in adding wireless charging to their devices, Vinh said.Needham analyst Quinn Bolton concurred that IDT will be an indirect beneficiary of Apple's adoption of wireless charging.""We view Apple's support of Qi wireless charging as a significant positive for the inductive wireless charging ecosystem and we believe inductive wireless charging will likely become a check-box feature in most new premium smartphone platforms,"" Bolton said. ""As IDT is the undisputed market share leader in inductive wireless power, we expect IDT to capture a meaningful percentage of this 'fast-follower' business.""Of the bunch, IDT was the biggest winner on the stock market today.IDT shares broke out of a cup base with a buy point of 27.19, and jumped more than 6% at one point. Shares ended the regular trading session up 2.5% to 26.98.RELATED:Late Debut For iPhone X Disappoints Apple InvestorsApple's Pricey iPhone X Lacks Wireless Data Bragging Rights

""Beyond the financial implications of an expanded Apple relationship, these announcements further flesh out the Dolby Vision ecosystem, firmly establishing Dolby Vision as the highest quality video experience.""Meanwhile, shares of Universal Display ended Wednesday down a fraction to 132.35.IBD'S TAKE: Universal Display is currently ranked No. 1 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.Universal Display is a key supplier of technology and materials for OLED displays and lighting. Its customers include OLED display makers like Samsung and LG Display (LPL).The iPhone X, due out Nov. 3, is the first Apple smartphone to use an OLED display instead of the traditional LCD screen. Organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays are seen as superior to liquid crystal display (LCD) screens in terms of color reproduction, contrast ratio, refresh rate and power efficiency.In a report Wednesday, analysts at investment bank Cowen said the iPhone X could mark the start of a transition that sees Apple moving to OLED displays and away from LCD.Apple's product launch event was bad news for Synaptics (SYNA), analysts said.

""Reported deals appear centered around trade-ins, allowing carriers to optimize the residual value from prior generation iPhones. Unconfirmed reports of an AT&T (deal) would be the most aggressive. Investors are apt to look favorably on the rational behavior, which could soften the margin impact of this upgrade cycle.""Apple's launch of the iPhone X and iPhone 8 may drive another wave of intensified competition, analysts say. There's been a lull since AT&T and Verizon Communications (VZ) reintroduced unlimited data plans in early 2017 amid market-share gains by T-Mobile and Sprint.New iPhone promotions generally drive higher churn (customers switching service providers), drive upgrades to more pricey ""postpaid"" service plans, and lower profit margins because of device subsidies.Anticipating Apple's iPhone launch, T-Mobile last week said it would provide Netflix's (NFLX) internet TV service for free to subscribers that buy two lines or more of unlimited data service.Apple's new high-end iPhone X starts at $999 for a 64-gigabyte version. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus start at $699 and $799 — $50 higher than the entry-level iPhone 7 pricing a year ago. The iPhone X will not ship until Nov. 3, so early promotions may focus on the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and at day's end The Big Picture (take a free trial), for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.Sprint is offering 50% off the iPhone 8 with an eligible trade-in for customers who sign up for a leasing plan.T-Mobile plans to offer a $300 trade-in credit for customers buying the iPhone X, as well as the new 8 and 8 Plus.

958,NOV,"Lumentum Holdings (LITE) fell Tuesday after Apple (AAPL) unveiled its newest iPhones as analysts scrambled to assess how much 3D sensor content will be built into the devices.XLumentum shares fell 2.1% to close at 57.25 on the stock market today. Apple edged down 0.7% to 160.82.In addition to facial recognition for unlocking screens, there had been speculation Apple would need 3D sensors for augmented reality applications. Apple showed photos of the new iPhones during its media event in Cupertino, Calif. It may be that no one will know for sure how much 3D sensor content is in the new iPhones until the smartphones are shipped.The new top-end, $999 iPhone X features new sensors on the front for ""Face ID"" as well as a glass back to support wireless charging. Because of production issues, Apple says the iPhone X won't ship until Nov. 3.One analyst told Investor's Business Daily on background that the iPhone X may have 3D sensors in the front for Face ID, while 3D sensors for backside cameras may not be in specifications.Apple also introduced the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, which do not have Face ID.Analyst had been expecting both low- and high-power versions of 3D sensors to support facial recognition as well as augmented reality. AR apps overlay digital imagery onto real-world settings.Speculation that Lumentum could win Apple as a customer for 3D sensor devices for iPhones has driven up its stock 46% in 2017, although shares sold off in recently when the company reported weak demand in China for optical parts built into telecom networks.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Analysts say Apple could have multiple suppliers of 3D devices, including Germany's AMS.

962,NOV,"An analyst reiterated his buy rating on Apple (AAPL) stock on Monday on the belief that President Donald Trump's tax reform plan will benefit the consumer electronics giant.XBank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Wamsi Mohan maintained his price target of 180 on Apple stock. Apple was up 0.4% to close at 155.84 on the stock market today.Trump's plan would cut the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35% and lower repatriation tax rates for accumulated foreign earnings of U.S. companies.The tax changes could allow for ""substantially all of Apple's foreign cash to be repatriated to the U.S.,"" Mohan said in a report.Apple has $223 billion of ""unrestricted"" cash held overseas that could be brought back to the U.S. under the plan's lower repatriation tax rate, he said.

967,NOV,"The stock of Two Harbors Investment (TWO) is still recovering from a long decline, but the company's dividend has been big enough to satisfy income investors.Two Harbors fell as much as 37% from a peak of 13.02 in March 2013 to a low of 6.91 in January 2016. The company was going through a long decline in profit growth that started to recover in 2014. The stock's climb now finds it forming a cup-with-handle base with a 10.35 buy point.Real estate investment trusts like Two Harbors normally don't produce big share-price rallies like growth stocks do, but income investors prefer to get the dividends and steady earnings performance.Two Harbors, a mortgage REIT, pays a quarterly dividend of 26 cents per common share, which translates to an annualized dividend yield of more than 10%. That's nearly the highest in IBD's Dividend Leaders screen.The dividend has varied over time. It was 23 cents a share a year ago, and 28 cents the year before that, according to the company's website.On Sept. 14, Two Harbors set a special dividend related to a transaction with Granite Point Mortgage Trust (GPMT), a company created by Two Harbors to expand its commercial real estate business. The dividend applies to Two Harbors' holders as of Friday's close.New York-based Two Harbors is a hybrid REIT, a corporate structure the company says allows it to ""take advantage of the evolving mortgage financing landscape"" and is superior to a single-sector investment strategy.The firm focuses on residential mortgage-backed securities (debt instruments tied to home loans) and mortgage servicing rights (in other words, mortgage payments). In another facet to its structure, assets are externally managed by PRCM Advisers, a wholly owned subsidiary of global asset manager Pine River Capital Management.IBD's TAKE: Although REITs are primarily income vehicles for investors, their charts can help investors decide when to start investing.

972,NOV,"It seems Tesla (TSLA) won't take reports that it is struggling to automate its production of Model 3 vehicles lying down, but the reports keep coming in fast and furious.The company rebuked as ""fundamentally wrong and misleading"" a Wall Street Journal report late Friday that it is building by hand large parts of the Model 3, a mass-market electric vehicle. The company's statement followed a Sunday tweet from Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, thumbing his nose at the Journal story with an video posted to Instagram of the automated Model 3 production line.In a statement to CNBC on Monday, Tesla spokesperson admitted that it will take time to gear up for higher volumes amid soaring demand for its Model 3 brand, which starts at $35,000. But the carmaker reaffirmed ""there are no fundamental issues with Model 3 production or its supply chain, and we are confident in addressing the manufacturing bottleneck issues in the near-term.""With a more affordable Model 3 brand, Tesla hopes to move beyond its image as a maker of luxury vehicles that sell for upward of $100,000.On the heels of Tesla's rebuttal, another report emerged Monday arguing the carmaker will struggle to meet its own aggressive Model 3 production goals. The report in auto info site WardsAuto gave two main reasons, citing unnamed sources:Shares of Tesla gave up 3.9% to close at 342.94 on the stock market today. They sit 7% below their Sept. 18 peak of 389.61, which followed a mid-September breakout from a cup-with-handle base with a 370.10 buy point.Various Wall Street analysts, in addition to the Journal, have raised concerns over whether the Silicon Valley company can ramp up Model 3 production quickly enough to meet demand.In the third quarter, Tesla totaled 26,150 vehicle deliveries, including 220 Model 3 cars, with the latter falling well short of analyst expectations of 1,000 or more.While Morgan Stanley said the miss was not that concerning, it led Goldman Sachs to reiterate a sell rating on Tesla shares in an Oct. 3 note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Tesla stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 68, meaning it has outperformed 68% of stocks in key technical and fundamental metrics over the past 12 months. But it ranks No. 5 out of 16 stocks in IBD's Auto Manufacturers industry group. For more analysis of Tesla stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.The Tesla spokesperson highlighted in comments to CNBC Monday that the company has been open and upfront about production speed bumps.Indeed, the Journal's report came as Musk tweeted comments Friday about Tesla being ""deep in production hell"" and said it was working to fix Model 3 bottlenecks. Tesla would put off the unveiling of the keenly awaited Tesla semi truck to November in the process, he added.Tesla Semi unveil now Nov 16.

973,NOV,"General Electric's (GE) attempts at an image makeover with a slew of cost-cutting measures and executive reshufflings may be signs that things are about to get worse instead of better at the industrial giant.XOn Monday, GE announced that Ed Garden, founding partner of Trian Fund Management, will join its board. Trian has pressured GE to cut its $2.4 billion in corporate costs and revive its slumping stock price. The move followed several C-suite changes at GE on Friday, including the departure of CFO Jeff Bornstein.Analysts at JPMorgan, however, slammed the leadership moves, saying they suggest ""core fundamental challenges are worse than consensus is currently discounting,"" while also reaffirming an underweight on GE stock.""Not only is the baseline of the now hotly debated 'reset' likely lower, but what we think investors are ignoring is the trend line on the businesses, some of which have secular issues (i.e. implications for multiple), a hole that is unlikely to be dug out of with simple cost cuts alone,"" JPMorgan's Stephen Tusa and his team wrote in a Monday note.Tusa was referring to expectations that new GE CEO John Flannery will offer an updated 2018 outlook next month. GE already has signaled that a current EPS goal of $2 for 2018 may be too high.Also, Vertical Research Partners analyst Jeff Sprague said Friday that the CFO change is ""especially troubling"" because Bornstein had been seen as Flannery's partner in his turnaround plan.Shares of GE dived 3.2% to 23.62 on the stock market today. Among industrial peers, 3M (MMM) edged up 0.1% to 216.64, just above a 214.67 buy point. United Technologies (UTX) rose 0.3% to 118.68 as it forms a flat base with a 124.89 entry point and an alternative entry of 120.29. 3M and United Technologies as Dow components, like GE.Honeywell (HON) dipped 0.1% to 143.54 after initially rising to a record 145.30 on reports that it's planning to spin off noncore assets into at least two public companies. Honeywell is in buy range from a 140.31 entry.IBD'S TAKE: Earnings season is about to kick off. Here's a list of Dow stocks near buy points to watch ahead of third-quarter results.On Friday, GE said Jamie Miller, who heads GE's transportation business, will assume the CFO role on Nov. 1. Bornstein exits at the end of the year, with two other GE vice chairs and longtime veterans.JPMorgan's Tusa questioned the ""rationale for a seemingly heavy focus on internal candidates"" in selecting a new CFO and added that the likelihood of a dividend cut ""moves materially higher.""Vertical Research Partners analyst Jeff Sprague also said Friday that a dividend cut is now more likely.""The dividend consumes all or most of GE's industrial FCF (free cash flow) for the foreseeable future,"" Sprague added. ""A dividend cut could crush the stock as retail investors flee, but maintaining it gives GE little or no excess cash to grow the company. ""And now that activist investor Trian is getting a board seat, RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray says its engagement in shaping GE policy will intensify.""We expect Trian to promote value-adding moves like transitioning closer to GAAP EPS reporting, further boosting structural cost-out, and rationalizing the portfolio,"" he said in a Monday note, adding that the move highlighted that Flannery ""clearly wanted to avoid a messy proxy fight with Trian's Nelson Peltz.""Trian's $2.5 billion bet on GE in October 2015 is now worth about $1.7 billion, with Trian trimming its GE holdings by more than 20% as the stock has underperformed over the past year, Dray noted.RELATED:These 5 Dow Stocks Are Near Buy Zones As Earnings Season BeginsHoneywell's Expected Spinoffs Fall Short Of Investor's PlanDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisGE Shakes Up Top Execs While More Perks Fall To Cost-Cutting Drive

976,NOV,"Call it the industrials revolution. After dominating the sector fund universe for much of this year, techs and biotechs are being dethroned by energy and other industrials.XRising oil futures boosted energy stocks and funds in September, though prices have slipped this month.The accompanying table shows the top sector ETFs for the past month handily outperforming the S&P 500. But nearly all have lagged the benchmark index by a wide margin over the long haul. Only one, Global X Lithium & Battery Tech (LIT), produced an average annual return that beat the S&P 500 over the past three years.Eleven of the 13 funds shown are oil and gas plays. SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services (XES) led with a 20.2% gain for the past month through Oct. 3, according to Morningstar Direct. It retook its 50-day moving average Sept. 12 after spending most of the prior seven months below the support line. Shares are 34% off their 52-week high.The $334.2 million fund, launched in June 2006, aims to provide exposure to small-, mid- and big-cap companies. It tracks the S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services Select Industry Index. Top holdings as of Oct. 5 included Fairmount Santrol Holdings (FMSA), Ensco (ESV) and Transocean (RIG). The top five names represented 19% of assets.Up next is iShares U.S. Oil Equipment & Services (IEZ), with a 15.4% one-month return. Its price action looks similar to XES. The 11-year-old fund, which tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Oil Equipment & Services Index, has gathered $196.4 million.IBD'S TAKE: On the hunt for ETF ideas that may be worth a closer look? Check out IBD's weekly ETF Leaders column for a featured fund and a list of highly rated ETFs.IEZ's top names were Schlumberger (SLB), at 16% of assets, Halliburton (HAL) 10%, and Baker Hughes (BHGE) and National Oilwell Varco (NOV) at about 6% each. The portfolio contained 34 stocks; the top five holdings accounted for 43% of assets. IEZ offers a hefty annualized dividend: 3.4% vs. the S&P 500's 1.9%.VanEck Vectors Oil Services (OIH), with $1.3 billion in assets, and $2.3 billion SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) came in third and fourth with respective one-month returns of 14.3% and 12.2%. These two are among the biggest energy sector ETFs. Further down the list are $16.7 billion Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) and $3.9 billion Vanguard Energy (VDE).LIT, mentioned above, came in fifth with a one-month return of 12%. The $760.9 million fund, which tracks the Solactive Global Lithium Index, is also a top year-to-date performer with a 57% gain. It invests in the lithium cycle, from mining and refining through battery production.Top holdings included FMC (FMC), Chile's Sociedad Quimica Y Minera (SQM), South Korea's Samsung SDI and Tesla (TSLA). The top five names made up nearly 58% of assets as of Oct. 4.RELATED:Stocks Dip; 2 Breakouts To Watch If You Like Big DividendsMaximize Portfolio Returns With These ETF Investment StrategiesThese 2 Indexes Beat The Nasdaq; Which Sectors Scored Most New Highs?

978,NOV,"DETROIT — With biblical succinctness, and foreshadowing a resurrection, Mike Duggan said, ""Let there be light!"" and 65,000 LED streetlights replaced the 40% of the city's streetlights that were broken when he took office in 2014. They are among the many reasons that on Nov. 7 he, the first white mayor here in 40 years, will win a landslide re-election in a city that is 83% black. Identity politics is frivolous; Detroit, after a bruising rendezvous with reality, is serious about recovering from its near-death experience.In Duggan, Detroit has found its Fiorello La Guardia — a short, stocky, cheerful, plain-spoken incarnation of his city. In 1983, when Duggan returned, fresh from the University of Michigan Law School, ""there was nobody my age on the streets."" The Houston Chronicle was being sold at a busy intersection to unemployed autoworkers scanning the classifieds for Texas jobs. In 1950, Detroit was comparable to, and perhaps richer (by per capita income) than, Chicago. Soon, however, it was bleeding population, heading for bankruptcy as Greece on the Great Lakes, a dystopia plagued by deindustrialization, soaring crime, packs of feral dogs and a political class featuring incompetents leavened by felons.Duggan, a Democrat in a city with nonpartisan elections, won in 2013 as a write-in candidate, telling voters, ""You invite me to your home, I show up."" Hundreds of house parties later, he was custodian of a prostrate city that had shed 260,000 residents in 13 years. Its 143 square miles could hold San Francisco, Boston and Manhattan with room to spare. By 2000, cattle could have been grazed in vast post-urban swathes. In 1950, the city had been home to 1.8 million; by 2013, it held two-thirds fewer. In the stampede away, many people abandoned their houses to the Midwestern elements. Most mayors brag about building; Duggan does, too, but also about demolishing — 12,000 abandoned structures since 2014. His ""board-up brigades"" — this is distinctively Detroit — will seal off 11,000 and demolish 9,000 within two years. Says Duggan: ""Tear down the burned-out houses, people will buy the others.""Police and EMS response times have been drastically reduced; 275 parks are fully maintained, up from 25 four years ago, when the grass was sometimes taller than the 8-year-olds. Such granular attention to the small stuff is having a huge payoff: Residential utility hookups are increasing. For the first time in his 59 years, the city is expected to grow. ""We can't build office space fast enough"" for firms moving here because ""millennials don't want to move to the suburbs and drive a minivan."" However, a successful city requires a large middle class, which cannot exist without good schools to anchor young families. Detroit's future hinges on this.And on candor about Detroit's past. In this 50th anniversary of the 1967 riots (43 killed, 342 injured), Duggan in a recent speech recalled the 1943 riot (34 killed, 700 injured) ignited by housing grievances among the 200,000 Southern blacks in congested wartime Detroit, the ""arsenal of democracy."" Duggan said:The seeds of Detroit's violent decline were sown by federal policy. Created in 1934, the Federal Housing Administration invented and enforced ""redlining,"" explicitly steering new mortgages away from blacks in order to maintain the racial homogeneity of neighborhoods. A 1946 FHA manual said: ""Incompatible racial groups should not be permitted to live in the same communities."" And: ""Properties shall continue to be occupied by the same social and racial classes."" And: ""Appraisers are instructed to predict the probability of the location being invaded by ... incompatible racial and social groups."" Invaded.During the war, when a developer sought FHA guarantees for proposed housing on the last of the farmland still within the sprawling city, the FHA initially refused because the development would be contiguous with a black neighborhood. The real estate magnate proposed a solution: I will build a wall. It would be between his development and the incompatibles. He did; you can see it today. Mollified, the FHA guaranteed mortgages on the white side.Almost half of all postwar suburban homes built in America had FHA mortgage guarantees. From 1934 through 1962, whites received 98%. The 1948 U.S. Supreme Court case that struck down racially restrictive real estate covenants came from Detroit, but too late to prevent deleterious racial residential patterns. In the 1960s came ""urban renewal,"" aka ""Negro removal"" as administered by several of the last white mayors before Duggan, who, in an unlikely place, might be America's most accomplishing politician.More Political News and Commentary from Investor's Business DailyLearn how to make more money in stocks at IBD University.

979,NOV,"Apple (AAPL) stock was back in the red on Friday amid a fresh report from Asia that the new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus could have a battery issue.According to the reports, iPhone buyers have claimed the device's battery swells, causing the case to open up and expose the smartphone's components.China's state media reported a battery problem on Friday, following earlier incidents in Taiwan and Japan. Apple told tech website TechCrunch that it's looking into the matter. Reports surfaced earlier in the week about a possible battery problem.Delays in shipping the high-priced iPhone X have already been a drag on Apple's stock.Shares in Apple edged down less than 0.1% to close at 155.30 on the stock market today. Apple stock has gained 35% in 2017. But Apple is trading below its 50-day moving average, a negative signal.Apple stock has dropped in 16 out of the last 24 trading days since Sept. 5.  The stock had been up five out of the last eight trading days before reports over a battery issue resurfaced.IBD'S TAKE: The FANG group of closely watched internet stocks is made up of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet. For the latest news on the group, visit IBD's page on FANG stocks.Apple is scheduled to release the iPhone X — with the ""X"" signifying the Roman numeral 10 — on Nov. 3, with preorders starting on Oct. 27.Numerous analyst reports have speculated that the company's new OLED-screen handset will be in very short supply because of manufacturing issues related to its new display and the new facial-recognition security technology.RELATED:Google Hardware Launch Takes More Shots At Apple Than AmazonWhy Amazon's Echo Buyers Also Purchase Apple iPhones
"
980,NOV,"The gain by Apple (AAPL) in above-average turnover on Tuesday following a sharp two-session sell-off, plus rallies by a large number of cyclical areas of the stock market, appeared to suggest that the bull run is not dead yet.Transportation, part of the cyclical sector, is rallying today with the Dow Jones transports up nearly 0.5%. In the mobile home and RV space, Cavco Industries (CVCO) (97 EPS Rating) survived a wild open to rally more than 9% to 129.80, rising more than 6% past a new flat base with a 121.80 buy point. The manufactured home specialist reported a 55% jump in fiscal fourth-quarter earnings to $1.19 a share, smashing the consensus estimate by more than 16%, on a 12% pickup in sales to $198 million.On Friday, IBD's current outlook for U.S. equities was downgraded to ""Uptrend under pressure"" from ""Confirmed uptrend"" after the Nasdaq composite suffered a 1.8% drop in sharply higher volume, a telltale sign of unusually heavy professional selling. Over the past 25 sessions, the Nasdaq has encountered three such days of what IBD calls distribution, including a 2.6% slide on May 17.Yet for now, the uptrend remains in place, and investors can cautiously buy new breakouts with the knowledge that downside risk is elevated. In fact, as IBD's The Big Picture column has noted over the years, breakouts that occur late in a run-up tend to show a higher rate of stumbling.The current market uptrend really caught fire after the Nov. 8 U.S. elections. Since then, the Nasdaq has rallied more than 25%, a solid gain amid its nine-year rally that began with the March 2009 bottom.On Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite led the key averages with a closing gain of just over 0.7%. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average posted gains of 0.4% to 0.5% each. Volume fell sharply vs. Monday, according to preliminary data.As seen in the daily chart PDF accompanying IBD's Big Picture column, the Nasdaq composite now has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of C, which is neutral, but the S&P 500 sports a B grade and the Dow industrials a B+. A grade of B- or higher suggests that institutional investors are on net accumulating stock.Keep in mind that although the Dow has a better Accumulation rating than the Nasdaq, it is lagging the latter index in terms of year-to-date gains, up less than 8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite is up nearly 15%. Yet on the Dow 30, 16 names have an individual Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B- or better. See this rating and others at IBD Stock Checkup. Apple, up nearly 1% to 146.59 in heavy turnover, is up more than 24% from a recent breakout at 118.12 and continues to act like a market leader because its drop below the 50-day moving average was not that deep. The megacap tech and Dow 30 component is now just a few points below the 50-day line (currently near 148.64) and paring losses.IBD's TAKE: In the fourth quarter of 2016, Apple formed a bottoming base, a bullish chart pattern. Early-stage bases give an investor better odds of making money. Learn more about this pattern and other bullish bases at Investor's Corner.IBD Chairman Bill O'Neil has said frequently that a top market leader in fundamentals, stock-price action and fund sponsorship that falls below the 50-day or 10-week line should continue to be watched if it does not sink through the key support level in the heaviest volume since the start of the move.As seen in a daily chart, Apple's volume in the two recent down days do not exceed the 112 million-share day on Feb. 1 after the iPhone maker reported a clear turnaround in the top and bottom lines. Apple broke out of an early-stage cup with handle at 118.12 on Jan. 6-9.Apple is forecast to grow earnings in FY 2017, ending in September, by 8% to $8.94 a share, then accelerate profits with an 18% jump in FY 2018. That latter estimate seems to bake in expectations of a strong product replacement cycle when the next iPhone comes out, likely in the fall of this year.Apple's revenue growth is back on track as well; the top line rose 3% to $78.4 billion in the fiscal first quarter ended in December and 5% to $52.9 billion in Q2 (ended in March). The Street sees further revenue growth in Q3 (up 6%) and Q4 (up 8%), helping fuel EPS increases of 11% and 13% in the same periods.In the prior four periods, Apple's profit dropped 23% and 15%, then turned around with gains of 2% and 11% vs. year-ago levels.Elsewhere in the stock market today, economically sensitive issues are pacing the market's upside, including RV makers, automakers, oil drilling, ship transport and agricultural chemical producers. But water utility, gold, dairy product and gaming companies are also showing gains of well more than 1%.Burland East, manager of the Altegris/AACA Opportunistic Real Estate mutual fund, told IBD that he sees very attractive opportunities in companies that have a large exposure to Macau because gaming-related revenue in the region has seen midteen growth in Q1 and Q2, a nice turnaround from what he sees as the bottom in the third quarter of last year.""The pressures from the Chinese government have pulled back a bit, and it appears a new low has been set (in terms of business there),"" East said. ""For those with a five-year investment horizon, we think Macau will be very attractive.""Indeed, Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) have been market outperformers in 2017, so far up nicely since recent breakouts at 59.95 and 104.49, respectively. Wynn on Tuesday added 3% to 134.16. The stock has yet to touch its rising 50-day moving average since surpassing the proper cup-with-handle entry in mid-March.Las Vegas Sands, up nearly 1.5% to 64.87, has now advanced 8% past the proper buy point. On the daily chart, notice how the stock had traded on the north side of its 50- and 200-day moving average lines while finishing its nearly six-month cup with handle.The best cup bases tend to show declines from head to toe of 12% to no more than 33%. A milder decline means that a stock has less work to do to rally back near its highs before potentially breaking out.Also, in Sands' cup with handle, the drop from the handle's high of 59.85 to its low of 56.33 was a mere 6%, less than the typical maximum allowed decline of 8% to 12%. Add 10 cents to the high of the handle to determine the exact buy point.As of March 31, East's $151 million Opportunistic Real Estate fund shows a 10.9% net exposure in the gaming sector.RELATED:Apple News: It's Confirmed; Apple Is Going Into The Driving Tech FieldInvestor's Corner: How To Spot Major Market Tops The Easy WayIs Apple Near A New Buy Zone?Top-Performing Companies In The Sector Leaders: How Are They Doing?

981,NOV,"Electronic Arts (EA) and Microsoft (MSFT) captured early buzz heading into the E3 video game convention, which starts Tuesday, with weekend announcements about new products.XElectronic Arts wowed gamers with footage from its upcoming ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" game at a company event Saturday in Hollywood. It also revealed details of a version of its ""FIFA 18"" soccer game for Nintendo's (NTDOY) Switch game console. Plus, it previewed two new video game properties: two-player co-op adventure game ""A Way Out,"" due out in early 2018, and science-fiction action game ""Anthem,"" set for release in fall 2018.Microsoft detailed its next living-room game console called Xbox One X, previously code-named Project Scorpio, at a media event on Sunday. It said the console will be available on Nov. 7 for $499, a price many analysts found rather steep.Microsoft described Xbox One X as the world's most powerful game console, capable of running video in 4K ultra-high-definition quality. It will co-exist with the original Xbox One console and the smaller Xbox One S model.Microsoft also announced 42 upcoming Xbox One games, including 22 with console exclusivity.The EA and Microsoft events were ""incrementally positive"" for EA, Mizuho Securities analyst San Phan said in a report Monday. He reiterated his buy rating and price target of 115 on EA stock.EA stock was down 1.4% to close at 108.90 on the stock market today. EA shares hit an all-time high of 116.04 in intraday trading on Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on the E3 conference, check out IBD's E3 news page. E3, short for Electronic Entertainment Expo, runs Tuesday through Thursday in downtown Los Angeles.EA's ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" game is poised to outsell its predecessor thanks to improved game play and a larger installed base of current-generation consoles, Phan said. The new Star Wars game has three times the content of the 2015 game with more characters and settings from across the Star Wars universe, he said. It also features a single-player campaign mode that the original lacked.""Based on what was shown and our hands-on play time, we believe EA has improved the game in nearly every aspect, including multiplayer, which now includes soldier classes and appears more robust,"" Phan said. ""We also really like EA's decision to make downloadable content free for 'Battlefront 2' as it keeps the player community together vs. fragmenting it (benefiting engagement). The game will still feature in-game microtransactions where loot boxes can be purchased in addition to being earned.""EA's ""Anthem"" looks ""astounding,"" Phan said. The new game should give Activision Blizzard's (ATVI) similar franchise, ""Destiny,"" a run for its money, he said.Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said ""Anthem"" looks ""impressive"" and ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" looks ""solid.""He reiterated his overweight rating on EA and price target of 115 in a report Monday.Wall Street analysts were taken aback by the pricing of Microsoft's Xbox One X console, saying the high price tag could limit its appeal.""The launch price is a bit steep in our opinion,"" Phan said in a report. ""The Xbox One X bests the technical specifications for the (Sony (SNE)) PlayStation 4 Pro with native 4K gaming and an Ultra HD Blu-ray drive, but at $499, it'll cost $100 more than the PlayStation 4 Pro, which we expect will have stronger exclusive titles over the next year.""Baird's Sebastian agreed.""It remains unclear whether Xbox One X's superior horsepower will be noticeable enough to offset the $100 price premium to PS4 Pro or the two-times premium to the Xbox One S ($249),"" Sebastian said. ""It could appeal to hardcore gamers looking for more PC-level immersion in a 'lean back' console environment, particularly as developers better leverage the console specs over time.""Microsoft stock was down 0.8% to close at 69.78 Monday after finding support at its 50-day line intraday. Microsoft hit a record high of 72.89 on May 5.RELATED:E3 Show To Set Expectations For Big Holiday Video Game Launches
"
982,NOV,"XThe E3 video game convention next week is expected to be more of a showcase for games coming out this fall rather than a launchpad for future titles, Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju said in a report Friday.""As online/digital (delivery) continues to account for a progressively greater part of the revenue mix for all publishers and, further, as product release slates are for the most part well known, the likelihood for a surprise to emerge out of E3 over the years has diminished."" Ju said.He views the event as more of an opportunity for the game press and analysts to get their hands on soon-to-be-released games, so they can set proper expectations. The three-day E3 show officially opens on Tuesday in Los Angeles.As important as the initial game sale is, publishers also are putting a greater emphasis on selling digital add-ons and online services for those titles, Ju said.Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is expected to use E3 to tout ""Destiny 2,"" due out Sept. 8, and ""Call of Duty: WWII,"" due out Nov. 3.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on the E3 conference, check out IBD's E3 news page.Electronic Arts (EA) will heavily promote ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" and its major sports franchises like ""Madden NFL"" at a preshow event that starts Saturday, as well as through console makers Microsoft (MSFT) and Sony (SNE) at the show.""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" is scheduled for release on Nov. 17.Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) is expected to highlight its sports games ""NBA 2K18"" and ""WWE 2K18"" at E3.RELATED:These 3 Stocks Are Plays On The Fast-Growing E-Sports Market

983,NOV,"Thursday trading opens with several gold ETFs hovering near buy points and investors eager to see how the markets react to the beginning of former FBI Director James Comey's testimony before Congress.Gold prices took a breather Wednesday, after spiking in the previous session to their highest level since Nov. 9.X Two gold ETFs, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU), remain near their respective buy points. GLD on Tuesday gapped up 1.1% to break above a long-term downtrend and climb past a 123.17 entry of a cup-with-handle base. Shares closed below the entry Tuesday, and gave up 0.5% on Wednesday.The fund, which was launched in November 2004, has gathered $35.6 billion. It's outperformed the equity market with a 12.3% year-to-date gain through June 6 vs. the benchmark S&P 500's 9% return.But over the longer haul, performance suffered due to three down years from 2013 to 2015. GLD's five-year average annual return was negative 4.8%, according to Morningstar Inc. Over the past 10 years, however, it averaged a 6.4% return.IAU shows similar numbers: 12.4% YTD, -4.6% five-year and 6.5% over 10 years. The fund has attracted $8.5 billion since its January 2005 launch. It got close to a 12.54 cup-with-handle buy point during a Tuesday gap up, before also dipping 0.5% Wednesday.Keep in mind the gold funds are not your standard ETFs — instead of a basket of stocks, it generally tracks the day-to-day price movement of gold bullion.Investors often flock to gold as a safe haven, for instance, during times of perceived economic or geopolitical risk or as the dollar declines. The precious metal had not traded above $1,300 an ounce since early November. In April, George Milling-Stanley, head of gold investment strategy at State Street Global Advisors, told IBD that he expected gold to top the $1,350-to-$1,400 range this year.He cited among key factors boosting gold: geopolitical concerns in Europe, Syria and North Korea; the Fed's gradual rate-hike stance; and President Trump's tilt toward low interest rates and a weaker dollar.Shifting gears to Wednesday's ETF picks, iShares MSCI Philippines (EPHE) edged 0.2% higher to close above a 37.52 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. It remains in buy range. Meantime, iShares MSCI Thailand Capped (THD) eased slightly but held above its 50-day moving average and just below a 79.24 entry.RELATED:Gold Gaps Higher; Is This The Right Time To Buy?Gold Road Map: Investing Pros Make Bull And Bear Case For This MetalToo Late To Buy Foreign Stocks?

984,NOV,"Gold is taking aim at $1,300 an ounce. The metal has rallied to the highest level since November as investors position themselves for the outcome of the U.K. election and potential drama of former FBI Director James Comey's testimony, while also tracking tensions in the Middle East.Bullion for immediate delivery was at $1,290.17 an ounce at 12:19 p.m. in New York, holding near Tuesday's intraday peak of $1,296.15, the highest since Nov. 9, according to Bloomberg generic pricing. The climb has been supported by a fall in the dollar, which is near the lowest since October.Gold has risen 12% in 2017, and a Bloomberg survey this week signals more gains. The latest leg up has been buttressed by rising haven demand as U.K. voters head to the polls Thursday, with the result set to dictate how the country handles Brexit. The same day, Comey appears before a Congressional panel to testify about his probe into President Donald Trump campaign's ties to Russia, while the European Central Bank issues a policy decision.""The two main drivers of gold are the value of the U.S. dollar and uncertainty,"" said Jeffrey Halley, market strategist at Oanda in Singapore, referring to the Middle East tensions, the ECB decision and the U.K. election. ""We have both in abundance at the moment. The double whammy has seen traders pile into gold and, given the power of the rally this week, I can't see any other outcome than a test of $1,300 sooner rather than later.""Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Qatar on Monday citing its support for rival Iran and for extremist groups. The crisis pits U.S. allies against each other, disrupting trade, flights and business activity in one of the world's most strategically important regions.Gold may end the year at $1,350, according to the median estimate of 15 people surveyed at a conference organized by the Singapore Bullion Market Association this week. Twelve respondents were bullish, citing the geopolitical uncertainty that continues to weigh on market sentiment. Separately, Westgold Resources Managing Director Peter Cook said Wednesday that prices will gain on global volatility to reach $1,400 by the end of 2017.While gold has rallied, investors remain mindful that the Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates again next week, adding to increases in December and March. Still, beyond that hike, the Fed isn't going to be overly aggressive, according to TD Securities. A gauge of the dollar has lost 6% this year.""The amount of uncertainty in the world has increased,"" said Avtar Sandu, Asian commodities manager at Phillip Futures.

EA will be promoting movie tie-in game ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" and other major titles at the fan-focused event.""'Star Wars Battlefront 2' will be the largest focus"" for EA, Wingren said. ""Generally, the previous edition wasn't that well received by critics. The new version promises a revamped experience. It's the most important game release of the year for EA, in our view.""Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) isn't expected to make much of a splash at E3 because its biggest upcoming game ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" was delayed until spring 2018 from this fall. Instead, Take-Two is likely to show off its upcoming sports titles ""NBA 2K18"" and ""WWE 2K18.""IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks now includes two game companies: Activision and NetEase.Meanwhile, Ubisoft is expected to tout the newest game in its ""Assassin's Creed"" series, among others.Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said the star of E3 week for gamers and investors alike is expected to be ""Star Wars Battlefront 2.""""Unlike its predecessor, the newest Battlefront will include a single player campaign, multiplayer classes, and locations from all three eras (prequel, classic, and new trilogy),"" Pachter said.While EA won't be exhibiting at E3, its games likely will be spotlighted by console makers Microsoft (MSFT) and Sony (SNE).Sony's PlayStation 4 console is the top-selling living-room game box in the current cycle, with Microsoft's Xbox One coming in a distant second.Microsoft hopes to win over hard-core gamers with its Project Scorpio console, which will feature 4K gameplay and support for virtual-reality headsets when it is released this holiday season.""The key question mark about Project Scorpio is its price, with speculation that its supposedly unrivaled power will require a starting price of $499 or more,"" Pachter said. ""If that is the case, we expect Project Scorpio to underwhelm at retail, as has PS4 Pro, which costs $399.""NPD Group analyst Mat Piscatella said Microsoft's Project Scorpio is what he's most interested in hearing about at E3. He wants to get details on pricing, software support and services at the show, he said in a report.Nintendo's (NTDOY) Switch console has gotten off to a brisk start since its supply-constrained launch on March 3. But to keep the momentum going it will need to announce a rich game software slate at E3, Pachter said.Big upcoming releases for Nintendo Switch include ""Super Mario Odyssey"" and ""Splatoon 2,"" both of which will be highlighted at E3, Pachter said.Virtual-reality gaming will be a popular topic at E3 again, with Sony expected to announce multiple new games for its PlayStation VR headset, Pachter said. Sony announced Monday that it has sold over 1 million units of PlayStation VR.Another hot topic will be e-sports, or professional video game tournaments. Activision Blizzard, EA and Take-Two all are investing in the fast-growing segment of the games business.RELATED:Take-Two Gallops Higher On Bullish Analyst Reports

The stock also pierced its 50-day moving average.The negative action hints that institutional investors are not all ready to take shares higher after its Aug. 2 breakout from a new flat base at 156.75 failed to make a lot of headway.For now, watch to see if the stock can limit its decline as a new base may form.Apple is trading just 5% below its 164.94 peak. At that peak, the iPhone, iPad and digital services titan advanced as much as 39% from a Jan. 6-9 breakout from a first-stage cup with handle.At 3 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite slipped nearly 0.6% after being down more than 1% amid a sharp drop in Chinese stocks. Overnight, the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong dropped 1.9% to 28,159, suffering its biggest drop since Aug. 11 on the 30th anniversary of the Black Monday stock market crash on Wall Street.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were both off less than 0.1%.

A ratio of 1.0 or higher is generally favorable when selecting stocks to buy. Read this Investor's Corner to learn more about the usefulness of this easy to use technical indicator for selecting growth stocks.Notice how Control4 found nice buying support at or near the 50-day line in mid-April, the end of June, and on Aug. 4.

That base featured a 21% drop from head to toe, too deep for a flat base, but well within the parameters of a normal cup with handle or double-bottom base.Weibo, a leader in online social networking in China, is trading beneath the 50-day line but is bouncing off intraday lows.

1000,NOV,"Electronic Arts (EA) shares fell Wednesday as investors reacted to news that the video-game publisher is shutting down a studio that was making a future Star Wars game.Redwood City, Calif.-based EA announced late Tuesday that it is closing its Visceral studio, delaying an action-adventure game set in the Star Wars universe. The game was supposed to launch during the company's fiscal year 2019, which runs from April 2018 through March 2019. EA is moving development of the title to another team with leadership based in Vancouver.""It has become clear that to deliver an experience that players will want to come back to and enjoy for a long time to come, we needed to pivot the design,"" Patrick Soderlund, executive vice president of EA Worldwide Studios, said in a post on the company's website. ""While we had originally expected this game to launch late in our fiscal year 2019, we're now looking at a new time frame that we will announce in the future.""EA was down 2.4% to finish the regular trading session at 113.16 on the stock market today.Investment bank Morgan Stanley cut its price target on EA stock to 126 from 128 on the news, but kept its overweight rating.""Disappointing titles from earlier this year and the delay (in the Star Wars game) will likely fuel bearish sentiment; however, we remain positive on (the) shift to digital (distribution) and strong results from core franchises,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak said in a report.Nowak lowered his fiscal 2019 estimates for EA's earnings per share by 8% after removing the Star Wars game from his model.""We acknowledge this delay, combined with the disappointing 'Mass Effect' title from earlier this year, is likely to fuel some investors' cries around the company's lackluster track record in developing new (intellectual property) and titles … and the multiple investors will pay for this asset,"" Nowak said. ""These are challenges for EA to work through, but in our view EA is still likely to benefit and drive the digital gaming transition, and we remain positive on the strong results set to come from 'FIFA,' 'Battlefield' and 'Star Wars: Battlefront.' ""IBD'S TAKE: Electronic Arts is currently ranked No. 34 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.EA is scheduled to release ""Star Wars: Battlefront 2"" on Nov. 17.Cowen analyst Doug Creutz says the delay in the Visceral Star Wars game is likely to be lengthy.""We doubt this will be a short-term delay as the game appears likely to undergo a substantial rework, from a linear story-based game to a broader (read: live services-enabled) player experience,"" Creutz said. ""Fiscal 2021 is likely the earliest we will see the title.""Meanwhile, rival game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) received a price-target increase on Wednesday from BMO Capital Markets.BMO analyst Gerrick Johnson upped his target to 125 from 100 and kept his outperform rating.Take-Two stock was up 0.7% to end the day at 104.61.""Sales of 'Grand Theft Auto 5' and monetization in the GTA Online game mode have been occurring at a faster rate than we previously expected,"" Johnson said in a report.

1001,NOV,"General Electric (GE) is a leaner, meaner industrial machine under new leadership, but has it been strengthening its free cash flow? Investors may find out when GE reports Friday.XAt the heart of anxiety about GE's industrial FCF (free cash flow) is the dividend that springs forth from it. GE currently pays an annualized dividend of 96 cents, translating to a tasty 4.1% yield. That has made this Dow component a favorite blue chip for income investors.But some analysts have warned of a potential dividend cut as GE prepares to report earnings amid major turnover in its corporate leadership.New CEO John Flannery has slashed expenses and trimmed the portfolio since assuming the reins on Aug. 1, though the effect on FCF going forward isn't clear yet. Next month, he is expected to unveil the results of a strategic review that calls for ""thousands of corporate-level job cuts and scaling back of GE's global structure,"" including the closure of three research centers, according to the Wall Street Journal.Analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research see EPS increasing 56% to 50 cents as revenue climbs 9% to $31.92 billion.Organic revenue and industrial orders are two key closely watched metrics. GE must increase attachment rates on service contracts, which can underpin sustained growth in organic revenue, writes Morningstar analyst Barbara Noverini.The industrial giant's profit target of $2 per share for next year is another key issue to watch. Analysts who cover GE, as well as GE management, are turning cautious about its ability to achieve that goal. The company could address its forecast Friday or reserve the topic for Flannery's update to investors on Nov. 13.Shares of GE slipped 0.3% to 23.12 on the stock market today, after pegging a two-year-plus low of 22.83 last week. The stock has plunged more than 25% so far this year.IBD'S TAKE: As earnings season heats up, here's a list of Dow and other stocks near buy points to watch ahead of third-quarter results.Meanwhile, fellow industrial giant Honeywell (HON) reports the same day, while Dover (DOV) precedes its larger peers with a report Thursday.Analysts see Honeywell's EPS growing 4% to $1.74 on a 1.6% rise in revenue to $9.96 billion.The company recently said it will spin off its automotive turbocharger business as well as its home HVAC, fire and security business, following a portfolio review. It kept its aerospace business, which hedge fund Third Point has targeted for divestiture.Analysts expect Dover's EPS to jump 28% to $1.11 on a 16% increase in revenue to $1.98 billion.As with Honeywell, progress on efforts to streamline a diverse portfolio will be closely watched. Dover is considering a sale, spinoff or merger of its upstream energy businesses, known as Wellsite.Honeywell shares rose 1 cent to 143.44 Wednesday and are still in buy range from their Sept. 21 breakout. Dover fell 0.5% to 93.57.RELATED:Why GE Stock May Get Worse Instead Of Better As Leadership Turns OverDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisGE Shakes Up Top Execs While More Perks Fall To Cost-Cutting Drive

1004,NOV,"Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk says Puerto Rico needs a lot of help amid Hurricane Maria's devastation of the island territory, but that plus a number of other factors will delay the unveiling of the company's coming electric semi truck.Musk, also the CEO of SpaceX, has offered to come to Puerto Rico's rescue with solar-energy technology, via Tesla's Solar City unit. Most of Puerto Rico remains without power, weeks after it was hit by Hurricane Maria.Electric car maker Tesla last year merged with another Musk startup, SolarCity. The maker of solar panels specializes in storing large amounts of electricity in power banks.""The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too,"" Musk claimed in a tweet.Later on Friday, though, Musk said in a tweet that his Puerto Rico plans plus recent issues disclosed with the Model 3 production have pushed back the release of the Tesla truck. The truck was due to be released Oct. 26 but now is delayed to Nov. 16, Musk tweeted.""Diverting resources to fix Model 3 bottlenecks & increase battery production for Puerto Rico & other affected areas,"" he said.Repairing Puerto Rico's shattered electrical infrastructure with solar energy technology would be cost-effective and environmentally friendly, says Musk. He added Thursday on Twitter that the company could scale up its power-storage technology for an island the size of Puerto Rico. Tesla has installed a solar power grid on a few small islands, such as Ta'u in American Samoa.Ricardo Rossello, the governor of Puerto Rico, was receptive to the idea.""Do you want to show the world the power and scalability of your Tesla technologies? Puerto Rico could be that flagship project,"" Rossello said in a tweet.Shares in Tesla were up about 1% to around 359 near the end of Friday's market session.Musk had called the combination of Tesla and SolarCity ""a no-brainer,"" believing that the acquisition would result in a vertically integrated energy company that would be able to sell electric cars, make and sell energy storage for buildings and the grid, and make and install solar panels, all under one roof.Tesla, meanwhile, said it had sent Puerto Rico hundreds of its Powerwall battery systems, which can be paired with solar panels.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.After visiting Puerto Rico on Oct. 3, President Trump shocked the bond market by commenting that the island's debt might have to be entirely wiped out in order for it to recover from the hurricane's devastation. The price of Puerto Rico's general obligation bonds fell more than 30% the next day.Trump earlier suggested that Puerto Rico's debt should be wiped out because of its costs to rebuild, rattling Wall Street and the island's bondholders. Prior to the hurricane, the island territory of 3.4 million people had $73 billion in outstanding debt.While administration officials later said eliminating all of the island's debt was not in the cards, analysts speculated that bondholders might have to take a substantial ""haircut"" on what's owed.Musk and Trump have had their differences. Musk in June quit two of Trump's business advisory councils after the president announced that he would pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement.RELATED:Home Depot Taps Tesla, GE For Solar-Power ExpansionTesla Stock Falls On Model 3 Production Miss Due To BottlenecksSolar Power's New Dawn

1005,NOV,"General Electric (GE) announced several executive changes late Friday, another in a raft of measures that it's taking to cut costs, restructure the portfolio and streamline operations.XJamie Miller, CEO of GE Transportation, takes over as chief financial officer Nov. 1, replacing Jeffrey Bornstein, who is also a vice chair at the industrials giant.Bornstein leaves GE Dec. 31 after 28 years of service. Two other vice chairs and longtime GE veterans, John Rice and Beth Comstock, depart at the same time.Under new CEO John Flannery, GE is showing it's serious about trimming $2 billion in costs by the end of 2018. Late Thursday, news emerged that is whisking away corporate cars on the heels of grounding its corporate jet fleet — perks that senior executives have enjoyed for decades.Top bosses at GE were informed via email that their leases on company cars will only be good through the end of 2018, CNBC reported Thursday evening. The move affects roughly 700 execs, and a GE spokeswoman confirmed the report.In September, the Dow component eliminated the use of GE-owned business jets for company executives to get to meetings around the globe. They will take charter and commercial flights instead.GE plans to eventually sell those aircraft, revealing last month that it had spent $258,000 on personal jet travel for former CEO Jeff Immelt in 2016, and another $75,000 on travel for other top executives.Shares of GE dipped 0.6% to 24.39 on the stock market today and are down 24% year to date. GE earns an IBD RS Rating of 11, meaning it has underperformed 89% of stocks over the past 12 months. Among other diversified industrial giants, Honeywell (HON) and Roper Technologies (ROP) inched up 0.4% Friday, and United Technologies (UTX), Siemens (SIEGY) and 3M (MMM) also clawed out fractional gains.IBD'S TAKE: Market-leading stocks usually boast an RS Rating of 80 or higher. This IBD screen helps you identify top growth stocks with superior price performance relative to the S&P 500.Flannery has promised an ""intense focus"" on operations and a review of the industrial conglomerate's vast portfolio of businesses, as investors worry about cash flow and margins. GE sold its industrial solutions unit in September and finalized the sale of GE Water this month.Also this month, Jeffrey Immelt retired as chairman about three months ahead of schedule and left the board. Flannery, who took over as CEO from Immelt in August, has replaced him as chairman.The industrial giant is also undergoing a restructuring at its corporate headquarters and in some other areas that could result in job cuts, according to news reports.RELATED:GE Is Cutting This Decades-Old Executive Perk To Save MoneyDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisImmelt Exits GE Ahead Of Plan As New CEO Adds Chairman Role

1006,NOV,"Best known for processing credit card payments for small businesses like food trucks and farm-stand vendors, Square (SQ) has expanded into a host of financial services as it aims to become a more critical support partner for its customers.XAmong its latest ventures, Square recently revealed that it plans to create a banking arm to offer business loans, take deposits and provide other services. It already offers small loans through its Square Capital unit.""The premise is small businesses don't have access to capital to start, run and grow their business,"" Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said. ""Our typical loan type is about $6,000. This is not a playground that the banks typically can serve in any sort of profitable way. So we felt there was a market need.""It's all part of Square's master plan to continue serving the often neglected small business market, as well as to move upmarket to larger businesses.""Today where we're being most successful is that move upmarket,"" Friar said. Square is more than a payments company, she adds. Speaking at a recent technology conference, she said Square provides the financial hardware and software to get small businesses up and running and to grow.""That's really what Square revolutionized,"" Friar said. ""We bring to a seller a cohesive commerce ecosystem.""San Francisco-based Square broke into the financial technology scene in 2009 with its tiny credit-card swipe dongles — hardware attachments that plug into computers, smartphones and tablets. Since then it has grown in scope, scale and ambition.In addition to processing payments, Square provides software for point-of-sale and back offices in order to manage inventory and other tasks. It also offers customer relationship management software so businesses can do targeted marketing to their clients.Square's software and services have proved to be incredibly sticky, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Josh Beck said in an Oct. 2 report.Square's rivals, mostly traditional payments firms, have tried undercutting it on price, but customers appear to be sticking with Square, according to a recent survey by KeyBanc.Among the larger businesses that Square serves — those doing more than $200,000 in annual sales — 60% have received lower-price offers from Square's competitors, Beck said. But 80% say that they plan to stay with Square for more than a year.Square has created a stickier business by offering payroll and lending services to the small businesses that already rely on it to process payments.The survey results suggest that ""the value and breadth of services (from Square) exceeds the potential expense savings"" of lower fees for processing payments through rivals, Beck said.Square has created a business platform that is differentiated by ease of use, transparency, system integration and innovation, he said.""The survey data indicates to us that Square is rapidly innovating new features to accommodate a variety of needs, forming a platform that generates a substantial moat,"" Beck said.He reiterated his overweight rating on Square stock and raised his price target to 32 from 29.Square went public in November 2015 at $9 a share and reached an all-time high of 30.90 before ending trades Thursday at 30.76. Shares were unchanged Friday.Square is one of 28 companies in IBD's Finance-Credit Card and Payment Processing industry group, which currently ranks No. 51 out of 197 groups. The biggest companies in the group by market cap are Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), American Express (AXP) and PayPal (PYPL).The company is scheduled to announce third-quarter results on Nov. 8 after the market close. Square has guided to adjusted earnings per share of 5 cents on sales of $565 million. In the third quarter last year, Square earned a penny a share on sales of $439 million.In the second quarter, Square earned an adjusted 7 cents a share, up from 5 cents in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 26% year over year to $552 million, ahead of the $536 million consensus view.IBD'S TAKE: With an IBD Composite Rating of 96, Square ranks third among companies in its industry group. For analysis of Square stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.In the first six months of 2017, Square got 87.4% of its revenue from handling transactions, 10.7% from subscriptions and 1.9% from hardware.Square has several drivers that could sustain revenue growth and margin expansion, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane said in a Sept. 14 report. They include continued penetration of its core small business market, its move upmarket, and expansion into e-commerce and international markets.""The power of Square's platform continues to be undervalued by investors,"" Keane said. He rates the stock as buy.Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider sees Square continuing to grow its user base and to sell them more services. He rates Square as buy.""We expect the company to achieve significant growth driven by further growth in payment processing, and bolstered by cross-selling subscription and service-based products to its base of nearly 3 million merchants,"" Schneider said in a Sept. 11 report. ""We believe Square can continue to drive margins higher as it builds scale outside payments.""Square's other offerings include Square Cash, a way for businesses and people to send and receive money, and Caviar, a food ordering service for popular restaurants.On Sept. 28, Square announced a deal to process payments for ticketing service Eventbrite as part of its push into online commerce, an area dominated by larger players like PayPal. Square will handle Eventbrite's online, mobile and in-person payments.Square also invested $25 million in Eventbrite, which lets event organizers sell tickets and promote and manage live events.RELATED:PayPal A Buyer, Not Seller, And May Seek A Big Target: AnalystSquare Goes Retail To Offer Hands-On Support For Merchants

1008,NOV,"There's a whiff of complacency around the world's biggest bond market, according to strategists at Morgan Stanley and money managers at a unit of Goldman Sachs Group.Treasuries have continued to surprise in a rally that's almost wiped out the climb in benchmark yields that followed President Donald Trump's election victory and sent implied volatility crashing to the least in nearly two years. Morgan Stanley proposes investors would be well served by bets that volatility will rebound, while Goldman Sachs Asset Management is attracted to trades that benefit if long-term yields increase as inflation pressures build.Expectations for price swings have collapsed across most asset classes this year in line with the unwind of so-called reflation trades that erupted after Trump's surprise win. Disappointing economic data, such as Friday's weaker-than-expected report on the U.S. labor market, as well as China's efforts to cut financial leverage and the U.K.'s planned exit from the European Union have undermined optimism that global growth can regain momentum. That turnaround in sentiment has gone hand in hand with the evaporation of volatility in bonds, currencies and stocks.""With an increasingly uncertain U.S. political landscape and the Fed looking to reduce accommodation, the market feels oddly complacent,"" Morgan Stanley strategists including Sam Elprince wrote in a note to clients.The Merrill Option Volatility Estimate, or MOVE Index, has tumbled 18 points this year and reached 53.49 on May 30, a level last seen in August 2014. The gauge measures swings based on one-month options for two- to 30-year Treasuries.Traders and investors are selling volatility because that offers them decent returns at a time when yields are low and yield curves are flat, the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. They recommend putting on forward positions related to two-year rates as the best way to profit from a rebound in expectations for price swings in the Treasuries market.Goldman Sachs Asset feels yields are close to bottoming out at a time when the Federal Reserve is planning to raise benchmark interest rates two to three times this year.  Philip Moffitt, the unit's Asia-Pacific head of fixed income, said it would be prudent to look through last week's jobs data to an extent.""I'd suggest that we're still going to get the Fed moving two or three times this year,"" he said in an interview on Monday with Bloomberg Television. U.S. jobs numbers ""were a bit of a miss, but they're still strong.""Benchmark 10-year U.S. yields declined for the past five months, the longest stretch since 2010. They dropped as much as seven basis points to touch 2.14% Friday, the lowest since Nov. 10.""You'd expect the Fed would like tighter financial conditions, and that means higher rates and/or a higher dollar,"" Moffitt said.

1009,NOV,"Dow Jones industrial average component JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and other bank stocks fell Friday on a weak jobs report and flattening yields.JPMorgan Chase shares fell 0.5% to 82.64 on the stock market today, paring losses as the major market averages hit record highs. JPMorgan had fallen to 81.98 intraday. Bank of America dropped 0.8% to 22.45, off morning lows of 22.16. Wells Fargo (WFC) dipped 0.5%. Fellow Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) fell 0.8%.Citigroup (C) rose 3 cents to 61.11. Citigroup has been an outperformer among financials in recent weeks, holding above its 50-day moving average and not far from a buy point of 62.63. Morgan Stanley (MS) sank 0.2% dropping just below its 50-day line as it trades around that key level.Bank stocks, along with falling energy plays, have limited the gains in the Dow industrials and S&P 500 compared to the Nasdaq.Friday's losses weren't huge, but banks are all trading near recent lows, except for Citigroup. Bank of America, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley warned on second-quarter trading revenues earlier this week, pushing shares of BofA, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs below the lows of their recent consolidations.The Money Center and Super Regional bank groups were the week's worst performing industries aside from a number of energy and commodity groups as well as Retail-Home Furnishings. Bank groups have been trending lower for several months.On Friday, the Labor Department reported that only 138,000 jobs were added in May, below the 190,000 jobs Wall Street expected. While the unemployment rate fell to a 16-year low, it was due to workers leaving the labor force.While stock surged on the news, so did Treasuries. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to their lowest levels of the year. Meanwhile, analysts expect the Federal Reserve to raise short term interest rates on June 14.That further flattened the yield curve, meaning banks will see lower net interest margins from lending.Investors will bullish on banks after President Trump's election in the hopes that his proposed tax cuts and other pro-growth agenda items would spur  economic growth, expanding lending and the yield curve. But the administration's political headaches have taken the spotlight, with analysts now pushing back expectations for tax reform to next year, if at all.JPMorgan's Relative Strength line, which tracks its stock performance vs. the S&P 500, has fallen to its lowest level since Nov. 9, the day after President Trump was elected.RELATED:Four Reasons You Should Withdraw From Bank StocksSlow Hiring, 16-Year Low Jobless Rate Shifts Fed OutlookWeek In Review: Stocks Hit Highs; Broadcom, Palo Alto Hot; JPMorgan, BofA Warn

1020,NOV,"China is getting serious about weaning its economy off torrid credit growth, and data and financial markets already are showing early withdrawal symptoms. As regulators step up reforms, GDP growth could plunge 50% by 2020.Credit has been growing twice as fast as nominal GDP for years. The diminishing returns suggest that many loans are going to unprofitable ventures. They also signal that sustainable economic growth is far less than current growth rates. Such a rapid deceleration from the world's No. 2 economy would sap demand and prices for raw materials such as copper, exacerbate overcapacity issues and act as a drag on an already-sluggish worldwide economy.Chinese regulators and monetary officials are working in tandem, instead of cross purposes. The central bank has limited some liquidity. Regulators are enacting new rules to prick the housing bubble. And authorities are trying to rein in massive wealth management investments that are held off banks' balance sheets.That's already having an impact. The Shanghai composite is a global laggard, the latest economic reports have been unexpectedly weak and metals prices have fallen sharply.Wall Street still expects only a modest slowdown from the first quarter's 6.9% year-over-year growth in real GDP. After all, China proved the bears wrong a year ago by unleashing yet another massive credit wave that buoyed its own economy and global financial markets. And President Xi Jinping will want a strong economy heading into November's 19th National Congress of the Communist Party.But Chinese authorities are taking action now, ahead of that key leadership conference. That underscores how worried they are. And the world should be worried too, because when China stumbles, the effects are worldwide. In January 2016, China's Shanghai composite crashed more than 24% amid a botched yuan devaluation and clumsy regulatory action. The S&P 500 plunged more than 11% to its early February low. The Federal Reserve, which raised rates in December 2015 and planned on four hikes in 2016, backed off and didn't move again until last December.Vanguard's Qian Wang, a senior economist in Asia, and her colleagues have outlined four scenarios for China's economy. Even in the best outcome, GDP growth is likely to be just 4% by 2020. That assumes a smooth transition from lumbering state-owned enterprises and overinvestment in real estate.""As China's growth slows, there likely will be global deflationary pressure, through both lower import prices and commodity prices,"" Wang wrote.Vanguard gives 30% to 40% odds of a smooth transition, with a 20% to 30% chance of a hard landing. The other less-likely scenarios involve insufficient reform that leads to Japan-style stagnation or instability.""A supportive macro policy cushion and, hence, a stable growth environment could buy China time to implement painful structural reforms,"" Wang writes. ""However, if maintained for too long, these policy cushions could weaken the incentive for reforms and sow the seeds of future volatility. In our view, the ongoing tension between the short-term policy cushion and the long-term necessity for structural reforms could easily tip China from one scenario to another.""On Wednesday, Moody's Investors Service downgraded China's sovereign credit rating to A1: ""China's financial strength will erode somewhat over the coming years, with economy-wide debt continuing to rise as potential growth slows.""Moody's expects that China's reforms ""will be too slow to arrest the rise in economy-wide leverage"" as investment slows, the fall of the working-age population that started in 2014 accelerates and a productivity growth slowdown fails to reverse.Moody's followed up on Friday, saying further downgrades were possible down the road unless China got its debt under controls.The increasingly confident consensus doesn't see cause for alarm, though. Strong first-quarter growth from Alibaba (BABA), Weibo (WB), and a slew of other U.S.-listed Chinese internet companies highlights that China's technology boom continues.IHS Global Insight forecasts that China GDP growth will continue to run at 6% or slightly higher through 2020. Morgan Stanley sees average growth of 6.1% through 2020 and more than 5% for the coming decade, predicting that high domestic savings will shield China from financial crisis and no real let-up in growth as it shifts from a debt-fueled to a sustainable investment-led boom.Yet even the bullish case presumes that China will get a handle on its surging debt, which Morgan Stanley put at 279% of GDP as of the end of 2016. But China faces a basic math problem, which is evident from the diminishing returns of credit growth.""The change in the flow of new credit as a percentage of GDP appears to be providing less bang to output for each additional yuan of credit, underscoring questions over how much lending is going to unproductive 'zombie' companies,"" wrote New York Federal Reserve economists Jeff Dawson, Alex Etra and Aaron Rosenblum in February.The Fed economists note that China's mortgage loans increased by 35% in 2016. They also highlight a sixfold increase to $4 trillion in wealth management products from 2011 to 2016. Smaller banks have shifted from relying on traditional deposits to promoting investments that provide guaranteed higher returns.""In 2016 alone, credit outstanding increased by more than $3 trillion, with the pace of growth still roughly twice that of nominal GDP,"" they wrote.China's sustainable growth rate is about half the current GDP growth pace, or roughly 3%, argues Michael Pettis, finance professor at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management. That would mean that excess credit growth is generating an extra 3-4 percentage points of GDP growth each year.China bulls believe sustainable growth is close to 6%, according to Pettis, meaning the ongoing ""explosion in debt boosts growth by only one percentage point.""But that's hardly good news, he notes.The implication is that ""a mind-boggling amount of debt (is) required to achieve very little benefit, and the only way to make it intelligible is to assume that the amount of bad debt that is rolled over each period is significantly larger than we think,"" which would only add to concerns about China's non-performing loan problem.The reason Pettis sees the bull case as highly implausible is that as China inevitably puts the brakes on debt growth, requiring propped-up industries to restructure and slowing investment, income growth must also slow sharply, unless Beijing institutes household-wealth transfers that are too massive to be viable.April economic data showed a significant slowdown. The Caixin/Markit manufacturing PMI dropped to 50.3, just above the neutral 50 and the weakest reading since last fall. Industrial production and retail sales growth slowed more than expected. Fixed asset investment also cooled and property sales growth was the weakest since December 2015.Prices of copper, hot rolled steel and iron ore have fallen amid a buildup in inventories. China's Shanghai Composite is down about 5.5% since early April. It's still 40% below its June 2015 level.China bond defaults, unheard of a few years ago, have become more common and exposed another danger. When aluminum producer Qixing Group defaulted in March, corn oil producer Xiwang Group revealed that it had guaranteed $420 million of Qixing's debt, highlighting a web of off-balance sheet guarantees.A key near-term question is how China will respond to the slowdown and financial market weakness.""Whenever growth falters, it is always tempting for government to apply temporary fixes like aggressive public investment,"" wrote DBS Group Research economist Nathan Chow, ""But it might be different this time,"" he said, noting that tighter regulation has been accompanied by tighter monetary policy.""We must not neglect a single risk factor or hidden danger,"" Xi told a gathering of China's financial regulators in April. ""Safeguarding financial security is a strategic and fundamental matter for China's social and economic development.""Meanwhile, mortgage restrictions in China's large cities appear to be removing some of the real-estate market froth. New rules deny first-time homebuyer incentives for newly divorced couples amid an apparent boom in property-driven divorces. First-time buyers in Beijing have to put up a 35% down payment, up from 30%, starting in September. Mortgages for second homes require a 60% to 80% down payment.April home prices in first-tier Shenzhen and Shanghai rose 62% and 28% from a year ago, respectively. But second-home prices fell vs. March in Shenzhen, while sales in both cities have fallen by 60%.Yet, despite the growing seriousness of Chinese leaders in addressing spiraling credit, Chow expects policymakers to walk a tightrope.Wealth management products have become key to what has been called China's ""faith-based banking"" system, with the faith only likely to last as long as investors are protected from defaults. But these short-term investment vehicles, backed by long-term assets such as housing developments or coal mines, are a problem waiting to happen, Fitch Ratings and others have warned. Chinese banks have been diverting many guaranteed-return assets to nonbank financial institutions that don't have the same leverage restrictions.Fitch says these entrusted investments have fueled credit growth since 2015 and now make up about 20% of the assets of midtier banks. By comparison, such investments account for just 1% of assets at China's big-four state-owned banks — China Construction Bank, Bank of China, ICBC and Agricultural Bank of China.Guo Shuqing, the new chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, has unleashed what the South China Post called a ""regulatory storm,"" pushing banks to curb the rapid growth of off-balance-sheet lending. Banks must provide greater disclosure by June 12 and clear up excess leverage and other irregularities by Nov. 30, according to Bloomberg, citing a CBRC document.The fear is that heading off longer-term crisis will choke off credit now, raising doubts about whether Guo and others will hold firm.""Whether regulators are willing to sustain the deleveraging pain is yet to be seen this round, as history suggests they routinely flip-flop on the tightening course, conditional on growth momentum,"" Chow wrote. ""Indeed, the latest batch of data indicates the window for tightening may be narrowing. Diminished scope for higher interest rates will add pressure for the yuan weakness, which could reignite capital flight.""Still, the deleveraging efforts made to date, even before November's twice-a-decade leadership test, demonstrate that China sees debt-fueled growth as a major risk. Those measures may only be a down payment toward aggressive restructuring in 2018 and beyond.Chow notes that slower-growth state-owned enterprises still dominate many industries. Private investment only accounts for 21%-27% of the total in the transport, utility and education sectors.""For now, China's GDP growth is largely driven by the political calendar. President Xi must consolidate economic decision-making in the run-up to this year's Party Congress if he is to implement the difficult reforms that will break China out of its debt cycle, and higher growth early in the year will make this politically easier to do,"" Pettis wrote.""If he is successful in overcoming the vested-interest opposition that has for nearly a decade prevented necessary adjustments in the Chinese economy, GDP growth will probably begin to drop sharply, declining to barely above 6% by year end, and will continue to decline sharply over the rest of this decade.""

1022,NOV,"Apple's (AAPL) contract manufacturers might not reach mass production of the iPhone 8 until late October or early November, three months later than usual for the annual iPhone update, investment bank Cowen said Wednesday.X Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri said he doesn't expect any OLED screen iPhone 8 sales in the September quarter. Apple typically introduces and begins selling next-generation handsets in September.Apple's manufacturing partners have had difficulties integrating the Touch ID fingerprint sensor into the display, he said. The iPhone 8 is expected to feature a borderless 5.8-inch OLED display with no physical home button.""The goal continues to be finalizing fingerprint sensor specifications by end of May, but mass assembly schedule of this OLED version might be delayed to late Oct./early Nov. vs. the normal late July/August time frame, and this would effectively delay shipment and product launch,"" Arcuri said.Any delay would simply postpone iPhone 8 sales, since potential buyers are likely to wait for the new handset instead of purchasing a rival product, Arcuri said.The ""powder keg"" of iPhone 8 sales will shift to the December quarter, he said.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 96, meaning it has outperformed 96% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more information, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Arcuri reiterated his outperform rating on Apple stock with a price target of 160.Dow component Apple closed down 0.3% at 153.34 on the stock market today.Last week, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said her firm saw no evidence of a delay in the iPhone 8, which is expected to launch on schedule in SeptemberRELATED:This Is Why Apple Is Losing Ground In The World's No. 1 Smartphone MarketApple Market Cap Could Reach $1 Trillion In 12 To 18 Months: RBC

1023,NOV,"Video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) early Tuesday appeased investors worried about the delay of its big title ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" by delivering strong sales and earnings growth in its fiscal fourth quarter. Its stock surged to a record high on the news.New York, N.Y.-based Take-Two earned 89 cents a share, up 85% year over year, on sales of $572 million, up 52%, in its fiscal Q4 ended March 31.The biggest contributors in the quarter were ""Grand Theft Auto 5"" and ""Grand Theft Auto Online,"" ""Mafia 3,"" ""NBA 2K17,"" ""Sid Meier's Civilization 6"" and ""WWE 2K17.""On a non-GAAP basis, Take-Two earned 67 cents a share on sales of $407 million in the March quarter, vs. analyst expectations of 57 cents and $355 million.Take-Two shares soared to a record high of 76.70 in morning trading on the stock market today. In mid-morning trading, the stock was up 6%, near 73.30. Take-Two stock fell 10% in after-hours trading Monday after Take-Two's Rockstar label announced that its highly anticipated Wild West action game ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" had been delayed from this fall until spring 2018. Analysts said the delay was not a surprise and had been rumored for some time.""We attribute this slip to Rockstar's infamous perfectionism and don't think it changes the overall unit sales potential for the game,"" Jefferies analyst Timothy O'Shea said in a report.Take-Two on Tuesday forecast fiscal 2018 revenue that was well below Wall Street's targets because of the game delay. For its fiscal 2018 ending March 31, Take Two expects adjusted sales of $1.42 billion to $1.52 billion. Analysts were modeling for $2.23 billion.Earlier this month, Electronic Arts (EA) blasted Wall Street's estimates with its Q4 earnings, and Activision Blizzard (ATVI) also obliterated the Street's targets with its Q1 sales and earnings.The delay of ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" is good news for Activision and EA, because it lessens the competition this holiday season. Big game releases later this year include Activision's ""Destiny 2"" (Sept. 8) and ""Call of Duty: WWII"" (Nov. 3) and EA's ""Star Wars: Battlefront 2"" (Nov. 17).Activision Blizzard stock was up 1%, near 57.70, in morning trading Tuesday.

1026,NOV,"Allergan (AGN) was already facing a ""public relations backlash"" after transferring patent rights for its Restasis eye medication to a Native American tribe, when a judge on Monday then invalidated four of those patents.XNow, Allergan faces an uphill battle in regaining credibility on Wall Street, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote in a note to clients. He cut his price target on Allergan to 243 from 266, but kept his outperform rating.""We generally have been fans of the Allergan management team, but find it challenging to defend the steps that were taken with the patent agreement,"" he wrote in a note to clients. ""We believe it will take some time for the management team to regain the credibility it has lost through this process.""The process involved transferring the rights to its Restasis patents to the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe in September to avoid a patent challenge. As a Native American tribe, St. Regis Mohawk has sovereign immunity. But the play has been called both creative as well as controversial.On Monday, a judge invalidated four patents covering Restasis. Judge William Bryson said the ideas covered by the patents were too obvious to protect. He also expressed serious concerns regarding the legitimacy of the transfer to St. Regis Mohawk.IBD'S TAKE: Allergan has an IBD Composite Rating of 54 out of a best-possible 99. It lags top players like AbbVie with a CR of 98, meaning it performs in the top 2% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other high-ranking drug stocks.Even before Monday, Allergan stock had lost 12% of its value following the agreement, Divan wrote. The loss in district court also does nothing to ""erase the public-relations backlash the company has suffered from going through with the agreement in the first place.""Combined with a push by the Food and Drug Administration to approve generic drugs at a faster clip, Divan assumes a generic launch of a Restasis drug by mid-2018, up from his earlier view for 2022. Mylan (MYL) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) are among those working on generic versions of the drug.For longer-term investors, Divan sees 198 as an attractive entry point to the stock. In the short term, catalysts include third-quarter earnings on Nov. 1 and the potential for a guidance update with and without generic Restasis competition.""If guidance is not provided on the Nov. 1 call (at least at a high level), investors will likely have to wait until the January time frame for the company's 2018 guidance,"" Divan said.Data readouts include a late-stage trial in treating acute migraines and a midstage trial of a drug to prevent migraines in the first half of 2018. Both belong to a class of drugs called anti-CGRPs. Teva, Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) are also working in this arena.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Allergan slipped 0.3% to close at 197.78, after ending Monday trades down 3.5%.RELATED:Allergan Tanks After Judge Invalidates Restasis PatentsWhy Allergan's Hepatitis Drug Likely Won't Get FDA ApprovalGeneric Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don't

1027,NOV,"The Dow Jones industrial average remained the leading key index in late-afternoon trading Wednesday, courtesy of the biggest single-point gain by IBM (IBM) in years.XThe 30-stock Dow industrials rose nearly 0.7%, better than a 0.1% lift for both the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500. However, small caps also signaled that institutional investors are still seeking to accumulate stocks.Small caps also are outperforming. The Russell 2000 is up nearly 0.7%.IBM gapped up more than 14 points, or nearly 10%, and climbed back above the critical 200-day moving average for the first time since mid-April. That move, following a halting of significant revenue declines, was a big step in Big Blue possibly forming the right side of a new base.IBM, at 161.07, is now slightly less than 12% below a 52-week high of 182.79.Watch to see if IBM's Relative Price Strength Rating, currently a horrible 18 as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, improves quickly by the end of the week.The Street expects IBM's fourth-quarter profit to inch up just 3% to $5.15 a share, but that would mark the biggest gain in four quarters.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) caught its breath, falling just 0.2% to 160.18 in bone-dry turnover. The leading megacap tech, up 38% since Jan. 1 and holding on to a superb gain since it broke out of a perfect cup with handle at 118.12 on Jan. 6-9.Apple, which reports on Nov. 2, also appears to be forming a new shallow base that's next to an 11-week flat base pattern. On Aug. 2, Apple rushed past the flat-base buy point of 156.75 but did not gain much ground. Intrepid investors, however, could have bought shares as the iPhone giant returned back above the proper entry earlier this month.Top industry groups for the day included railroads, wood products, home furnishings retailing, truck transport and leisure products. Leading stocks in these industries include RH (RH), CSX (CSX) and Old Dominion Freight (ODFL).The Dow transports rallied almost 1%.In the IBD 50, China Lodging (HTHT) was among the biggest decliners, falling more than 2% to 130. However, volume is light compared with its 50-day average turnover of 386,000 shares, and the market leader is not issuing any sell signals for now.The fast-growing hotel chain has more than tripled since clearing an early-stage base near 39.29 in the week ended July 15, 2016. China Lodging's earnings per share have grown 71%, 10%, 40%, 74% and 19% vs. year-ago levels in the past five quarters.The Street sees Q3 profit up 50% to 96 cents a share.Numerous names within the top 10 of the IBD 50 hail from China, which is rallying in the wake of President Xi Jinping address in a party congress and a recent forecast by the Chinese government aiming at brisk GDP growth in the second half of the current fiscal year. In a twice-a-decade meeting of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi told a crowd of more than 2,200 delegates that the country will aim to be a global superpower by 2050.IBD's TAKE: The IBD 50 has showcased companies that are the new powerhouses of the U.S. and global economy.

1041,NOV,"It is safe to say the election of President Trump stunned liberals — the media, politicians and voters alike. They put their full trust in their anointed queen, Hillary Clinton, and countless national and state polls helped them sleep at night.But both Clinton and the polls failed them, drastically.Everyone in the Liberal Reich was shocked and, in many cases, brought to tears. They were left pondering: How could everything we believed in fail so miserably?On the other hand, all of us in the Trump campaign — supporters, conservative media and Donald Trump himself — were confident of victory from a very early stage. When the polls were plus ten for Clinton and 99% of the media were negative toward Trump, we kept the faith that he would be the 45th president.We all saw past the ""fake news"" media and polls.Why? The rallies.The Donald Trump rallies throughout the 2016 Republican primary and general election were (and are) among the biggest in political history. For two years Trump was able to fill stadiums and airport hangers several times a day.The crowds grew and became more enthusiastic. The people finally had their champion.At the same time Hillary Clinton couldn't fill an elementary school gymnasium. Something was happening: A movement was beginning, and it was being ignored by the political establishment, the media, and top polling firms (with the exception of Investor's Business Daily's IBD/TIPP Poll).The rallies showed that Trump, his campaign and his supporters were headed for a massive win on Nov. 8.We were more than right — The final Electoral College tally was  306-232.President Trump has been criticized for still holding rallies with his supporters. He does this for two reasons, and he is very smart to do so.The rallies are the best way to continually gauge the support the president has with his supporters — and whether that support is increasing or waning.The national approval ratings from the major polling companies that got the election so wrong are consistently showing the president with historically low numbers.These numbers have led to countless in the media, Democratic politicians and liberals to point to a losing midterm election for Republicans and, thus, a repudiation of Trump's agenda.But Trump is still very popular, and enthusiastic rallies point to the same continued support that won him the Oval Office. This same enthusiasm will win Republicans more seats in the 2018 midterms. This is especially true in the Senate, where over a dozen Democratic senators are up for re-election in states where Trump won handily.These rallies with his fans give Trump and his team a continual gauge of the support for the president and his policies. They let them connect with the people who actually turn out the vote, and tell them whether to stay or change their course.All the political rules were thrown out with the election of Donald Trump, and the accuracy of most polling firms' data became an open question. When it comes to Trump, the rallies are the best way to gauge his support and whether there will be a big turnout in special elections and the 2018 midterms.Another reason Trump still holds his rallies is that he is a man of the people. He feels more at home at a rally in Tennessee, Florida or Pennsylvania than rubbing shoulders with politicians in Washington, D.C..Trump won the presidency by connecting with people and promising to do their work in the White House, and it is that personal connection Trump places great faith in. These rallies remind him of the job he was sent to do, and his supporters give him the courage and energy to accomplish them.Right now, the president is still on top and still has the very enthusiastic support of those who put him in the White House. It's a long way to go till 2018, and I suspect we will continue to see President Trump holding rallies to connect with his supporters. (Oh, and yes, he might also like the attention of a screaming sea of supporters a little bit.)RELATED:First 100 Days: We Must Not Forget Student Loan ReformThe Millennial Job DeficitMillennials Need Pro-Growth Economic Policies, Stat

1042,NOV,"X Stocks kept a positive bent at lunchtime Tuesday as the stock market braced for another big wave of quarterly results.Among the key reports to watch, Nvidia (NVDA) (99 Composite Rating), Coherent (COHR) (99), Primerica (PRI) (92), and thinly traded Kornit Digital (KRNT) (98) all report earnings after the close.The Nasdaq composite, boosted again by large-cap techs, rose nearly 0.4% in midday trade. The index has risen 1.8%, 2.3% and 0.9% in the prior three weeks.The S&P 500 advanced 0.1%, while the Dow Jones industrial average was barely above flat. Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, perhaps showed that it's determined not to stay stuck with a $800 billion valuation. The stock added 1.39 to a new all-time high of 154.40, boosting its market value to $805 billion based on 5.261 billion diluted shares outstanding.The iPhone maker and giant in digital entertainment joined IBD Leaderboard as a premium growth stock hitting a proper buy zone on March 29. It had set up a three-weeks-tight follow-on entry at 141.12 after the stock cleared a cup with handle at 118.12 from Jan. 6 to 9. That cup with handle was part of a long bottoming base, which can often be a very bullish development after a company has suffered a long, deep correction.Primerica, also on Leaderboard, was virtually flat in the stock market today at 85.60, up less than 2% past a new flat-base buy point at 84.25. Coherent, up nearly 1% to 219.51, is extended after pulling back last month below a 200.63 entry in a narrow flat base. As seen on a daily chart, the stock showed solid footing at the 50-day moving average.Wall Street sees profit vaulting 136% to $2.45 a share after an 11% increase in the year-ago quarter.Returning to Nvidia, the giant in graphics processors for a growing range of industries (including video games and self-driving automobiles) is expected to increase earnings 46% to 67 cents per share in the fiscal first quarter ended in April.Nvidia has shown excellent EPS growth acceleration over the past two years, with earnings per share rising 14%, 13%, 18%, 21%, 39%, 56%, 104% and 117% vs. year-ago levels in the past eight quarters.Q1 sales are seen up 46% to $1.91 billion, following increases of 12%, 13%, 24%, 54% and 55% in the prior five periods. Nvidia's four-month-plus correction has been impressive in that the maximum slide from a 120.92 peak never exceeded 21%. A good cup with handle or double bottom can feature a decline of as much as 30% to 33% from high to low.Given that Nvidia had made a spectacular move from its March 2016 breakout past a 33.16 cup-with-handle entry, it deserves continued attention as a potential long-term tech leader. The up/down volume ratio, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, has improved to a neutral 1.0, and the Relative Price Strength Rating has remained in the high 90s for weeks.Research by IBD shows that the average RS Rating among big market winners at the time of the breakout to new highs and big gains is 87.Kornit, which trades just 256,000 shares a day, fell 2% to 21.98 but is still in a solid uptrend following a breakout past 11.80 in the week ended Nov. 11, 2016. The stock went public at 10 a share on April 2, 2015. In recent months, it has shown a tendency to briefly pierce the 10-week moving average, then rally back above the intermediate-term support line.Kornit specializes in digital printing, ink and software for the textile industry. Its products allow clothing makers to do large-scale printing of complex images and designs directly on finished garments in short runs. The Israeli firm's earnings have risen each year since 2013 and have jumped from 4 cents a share that year to 31 cents in 2016, up 675%.The Street sees earnings of 3 cents in Q1, up 50%, and 50 cents for the year, up 61%.The market continues to benefit from a confluence of positive factors, including steady growth in the U.S. labor market, rising economic confidence in Europe, a recent pause in escalating tensions in the Korean Peninsula, and the prospect for mild inflation that more or less meets the Federal Reserve's minimum target of 2%.Meanwhile, IBD announced that consumer confidence remains steady as the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index came in at 51.3 for May, down slightly from 51.7 in April. The May figure also remains slightly above the 12-month average of 51.The index marked an eighth straight month above 50, which indicates overall optimism.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Why Snap's Breakout Prospects Have ImprovedInside Stock Spotlight: What's Driving The Big Fundamentals At Coherent?How To Invest: Have You Mastered The Art Of Discovering A Great Cup With Handle?

1047,NOV,"X Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP) will get a lot of attention this week as it reports earnings for the first time since its March initial public offering. But it's just one six recent IPOs releasing quarterly results. Acacia Communications (ACIA), The Trade Desk (TTD), e.l.f. Beauty (ELF), Ichor Holdings (ICHR) and Presidio (PSDO) also are on tap.Snap is an innovative, fast-growing social media company, but it's unprofitable and is facing a withering counteroffensive from much-larger Facebook (FB).Snap actually has the lowest Composite Rating of the six IPOs reporting earnings. The Composite Rating, which goes from 1 to a best-possible 99, combines several proprietary IBD ratings, including the EPS Rating, into one measure.

Revenue should soar to $150 million vs. $38.8 million a year earlier.Snapchat is doing a better job of monetizing its users, but analysts and investors will want to know about the service's user growth and engagement. Heading into its IPO, Snap had noted slowing user growth. Since then Facebook has only accelerated its success at imitating popular Snap features. Facebook's Instagram now has 700 million users, with more than 200 million users for its Instagram Stories. Facebook, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger also are adopting Snapchat-like features. Snapchat said in its IPO prospectus that it has 158 million users, dominated by teens and young adults in North America.RELATED:Snap's Earnings Will Shed Light On Facebook Impact, User GrowthIf You Think Netflix, Amazon Disrupted Hollywood, You'll Love Snap, FacebookIBD'S TAKE: For data tables and analytical stories of top-rated new issues, check out IPO Leaders in IBD's Stock Lists.Acacia Communications has a Composite Rating of 63.

And the good news is that the younger you are, the greater the opportunity is.If you have $15.26 in your pocket, it takes 16 doublings of your money to reach $1 million.Now skeptics might read that and say, ""That's nuts. Doubling on the low end is easy. Doubling on the high end is near impossible.""Like a game show host, we can only ask, ""Is that your final answer?"" If negative thinking is your final answer, no one can help you.What are the tools that a teen or preteen can use to build wealth?The first tool is belief in yourself. If you don't think you can do it, you won't put in the time to prepare to succeed. As IBD founder William J. O'Neil is fond of saying, ""I've never met a successful pessimist.""The second tool is a job. As Marshall Brain wrote in ""The Teenager's Guide to the Real World,"" some young people ""live in a protected dream world that totally isolates them from the realities of financial life."" Get a job.If you're too young for a job, find chores to do for neighbors: lawn mowing, dog walking, etc.The third tool is frugality. How much money you make isn't as important as how much you save.Tool four is to avoid money pits. A car makes wealth-building hard, so take a bus or bike. Likewise for a baby, so take cold showers. ""Spend some time with someone who has a baby and see how much work is involved,"" Brain writes.As you launch your wealth quest, be aware that starting early is important. Most people don't think about wealth ""until they are well into their 20s or 30s. By then it is more difficult to do anything about it,"" Brain writes.From age 10 to 15, a kid can climb part of the 16-step wealth ladder.Realistically, a kid living at home can save 50% to 75% of income. Getting to the ninth or 10th rung by the time you're 16 is achievable.In many states, 16 is when a teen can get a minimum wage job. Your savings should accelerate.Doubling, though, calls for a new tool. This is the time to learn about the stock market.Read ""How to Make Money in Stocks"" by William J. O'Neil.After you read it, you might become enthused. If so, read it again. Enthusiasm is the wrong mentality to bring into the stock market.Now if you can blend frugal living with investing, you'll build wealth.The stock market will alter the way you look at life. You'll see small and big consumer purchases as money that could go into your brokerage account.What about college?If college is your idea of a place to drink beer and socialize, skip it. If you think college is a place to ""change the world,"" you're probably a menace to yourself and society.

1060,NOV,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average pared overnight losses Friday morning with Hurricane Irma bearing down on Florida. The U.S. dollar fell for a seventh straight session as Treasury yields neared the key 2% level.XS&P 500 and Dow futures fell a fraction vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were flat against fair value. The major market averages are trading modestly below all-time highs and slightly above their 50-day moving averages. The euro rose to its highest levels vs. the greenback in nearly three years while the Japanese yen set a 10-year highs. Gold futures continued to advance. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to a 10-month low of2.03% after a sharp drop on Thursday.Not coincidentally, bank stocks were big losers on Thursday. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) undercut a buy point, the SPDR Financial (XLF) bank ETF, fell below its 200-day line and industry leader Citigroup (C) dropped below its 50-day line. Morgan Stanley (MS) knifed below its 200-day moving avergage while Wells Fargo (WFC) and several superregional bank stocks hit 2017 lows.The current retreat is just one reason to steer clear of bank stocks. Hopes for tax cuts and other Trump agenda items continue to fade. Interest rates and yield spreads have steadily declined. And over the long term, bank stocks have not outperformed. The case for avoiding bank stocks was clear at the end of May; the evidence is even stronger today.Bank stocks briefly outperformed in late 2016, especially following President Trump's election win. But since early 2017 most banks began to follow the market, with clear underperformance in recent weeks, with several signals along the way.Bank stocks rallied after Election Day in part on hopes for sweeping tax cuts, which would lower their own IRS checks as well as bolster economic growth and interest rates, and accelerate Federal Reserve rate hikes. But the odds and timing of a tax hike have steadily declined, with Goldman Sachs now predicting that the odds of tax reform are down to 40%. On the positive front, the Trump administration is still making moves to ease crisis-era financial regulations, potentially freeing up capital for lending and buybacks.With the Trump agenda stalling, Treasury yields have been sliding for weeks. The 10-year Treasury yield fell sharply on Thursday to fresh 2017 lows, in part due to euro gains on European Central Bank hints of tapering asset purchases. The yield is at its lowest levels since Nov. 9, the day after the presidential election. Meanwhile, the spread between short-term and long-term yields has been falling sharply. That's bad news for banks, whose traditional profit model is borrowing short and lending long. It's also not a great sign for the economy when the yield curve flattens out.Bank stocks can be solid investments over certain periods, including right after the election. But they haven't tended to outperform the S&P 500 index significantly over time. Citigroup has been the best-performing U.S. bank stock in 2017, but its Relative Strength line is back about where it was at the start of the year. That means that Citi is trading even with the S&P 500 index. Looking further back, JPMorgan has been one of the better financials, but its shares haven't been long-term outperformers.Investors might be better off buying a broad index fund or ETF, which often will have financials as big holdings, to provide similar performance without the sector or single-stock risk.RELATED:The Big Picture: Stocks Hold Serve, But Banks Face Break PointFour Reasons You Should Withdraw From Bank StocksThese 5 Dow Titans Are Near Buys In Bullish BasesTrump's Debt Deal With Democrats Sinks Tax-Cut Hopes: Goldman SachsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksBanks And Financial Stock News

1062,NOV,"The U.S. Air Force ""sniffer plane"" was collecting air samples off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula on Sept. 3, 1949, when it gathered evidence of radioactivity, confirming that the war-shattered Soviet Union had tested a nuclear device. The Soviets' Aug. 29, 1949, test had come faster than expected.Dating from the detonation at Alamogordo, New Mexico, on July 16, 1945, the basic science of nuclear explosions is more than 72 years old — three years older than the North Korean nation. Ballistic missile technology is more than 60 years old. The problems of miniaturizing warheads for mounting on missiles, and of ensuring the warheads' survival en route to targets, are not sufficient to stymie a nation — consider Pakistan, whose annual per capita income is less than $2,000 — that is determined to have a nuclear arsenal.North Korea has one and is developing ICBMs faster than expected and with ostentatious indifference to U.S. proclamations. On Jan. 2, President-elect Donald Trump scampered up the rhetorical escalation ladder, unlimbering his heavy artillery — an exclamation point — to tweet about North Korea's promised ICBM test: ""It won't happen!"" It did. North Korea's most audacious act, firing a missile over Japan, came seven days after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson praised North Korea's ""restraint.""Pyongyang's ""signaling"" does not involve abstruse semiotics: It wants a nuclear arsenal, and as The Economist magazine says, the world's unpalatable options are the improbable (productive negotiations), the feeble (more sanctions) and the terrifying (military pre-emption). Concerning the latter, there is no bright line, but there is a distinction to be drawn, however imprecisely, between pre-emptive war and preventive war. The former constitutes self-defense in response to a clear and present danger — repelling an act of aggression presumed with reasonable certainty to be imminent. The latter is an act of anticipation — and, to be candid, of aggression — to forestall the emergence of a clear and present danger.When Trump threatened North Korea with ""fire and fury like the world has never seen,"" was he threatening to cross the nuclear weapons threshold? This has been contemplated before regarding North Korea. Former Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who had been fired by President Harry Truman for insubordination, handed President-elect Dwight Eisenhower a memorandum on how ""to clear North Korea of enemy forces"": ""This could be accomplished through the atomic bombing of enemy military concentrations and installations in North Korea and the sowing of fields of suitable radioactive materials, the byproduct of atomic manufacture, to close major lines of enemy supply and communication. ... ""MacArthur badly misjudged Eisenhower, whose biographer Jean Edward Smith says that during the Potsdam Conference (July 17-Aug. 2, 1945), when Eisenhower was told of the Alamogordo test — his first knowledge of the new weapon — ""he was appalled"" and ""was the only one at Potsdam who opposed using the bomb."" Smith says:""As president, Eisenhower would twice be presented with recommendations from his National Security Council and the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the bomb be used; first, in Vietnam to protect the French at Dien Bien Phu, then against China at the time of the Formosa Strait crisis. Both times Eisenhower rejected the recommendations. As a former supreme commander, Eisenhower had the confidence to do so, where other presidents might not have. And by rejecting the use of the bomb, there is no question that Eisenhower raised the threshold at which atomic weaponry could be employed — a legacy we continue to enjoy.""See How IBD Helps You Make Money In StocksBut for how long? The nonproliferation regime has been remarkably successful. During the 1960 presidential campaign, John Kennedy cited ""indications"" that by 1964 there would be ""10, 15 or 20"" nuclear powers. As president, he said that by 1975 there might be 20. Now, however, North Korea, the ninth, might be joined by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, among others, unless U.S. leadership produces, regarding North Korea, conspicuously credible deterrence. The reservoir of presidential credibility is not brimful.On Aug. 1, Sen. Lindsey Graham said that Trump had told him that ""there will be a war with North Korea"" if it continues to develop ICBMs capable of reaching the United States. ""We'll see,"" said Trump on Sunday, responding to this shouted question: ""Will you attack North Korea?"" You?Are Congress' constitutional powers regarding war so atrophied that it supinely hopes for mere post facto notification? Ten months after Nov. 8, that day's costs, until now largely aesthetic, are suddenly, although not altogether unpredictably, more serious than were perhaps contemplated by his 62,984,825 voters.RELATED:Yes, China Steals U.S. Intellectual Property, But That Doesn't Mean Trade With China Is A Bad ThingTrump's Trade War With China Is War On North Korea By Other MeansNo, North Korea's Nuclear Threat Isn't Fake News

1065,NOV,"With the strong market reversal Aug. 29, it's a good time to revisit what reversals look like in individual stocks. The benefit of reversals? They provide a way to purchase shares for a swing trade at a lower price than a breakout. In fact, buying the reversal can often get you a 5% profit by the time the stock hits its breakout price.As a reminder, we aren't looking for beaten-down stocks at their lows. We want pullbacks in stocks that are otherwise showing strength.Ideally, a leading stock will retreat in modest volume for a few days and then find enthusiastic support, causing it to reverse powerfully. That change in character creates a buying opportunity.Take Arista Networks (ANET), which showed a dramatic reversal Nov. 4 on the heaviest volume in three months (1). The company reported earnings the day before, beating estimates by 40%, and the stock closed well near the top of its range, but not above the previous day's high at 83.92. We waited for a continuation of the strength to confirm the reversal.Arista was added to IBD's SwingTrader the next trading day as it surpassed 83.92 and got back above its 10-day line (2). Using the low of the reversal day as the stop loss, at 79.05, meant we would be risking a 6% loss, much higher than desired. In that situation, you can tighten your stop loss, which carries its own risk of stopping you out unnecessarily. Or you can reduce your position size to keep the dollars risked constant. The position-size adjustment requires a little math, or you could use the Position Size Calculator on SwingTrader. In this case, we adjusted our stop loss to 82.13 after noticing it as an identifiable area of support on the intraday chart.After the presidential election shocked the market, Arista fell considerably, breaching a number of its moving averages: the 5-, 10-, and 50-day lines, but it held above the stop loss (3). It righted itself by the end of the day, closing back above all three moving averages and demonstrating why we usually act on moving-average-line breaches at the close rather than intraday.Arista ended up being a slower mover from there but eventually hit a 5% profit goal (4). This would often lead to selling just half the position, but the stock was getting resistance at 89, had already been held for 10 days and was reversing off highs.The sell meant we missed a 7% jump the next day as news broke of import approval coming from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. While it sailed past its 10% profit goal (5), holding it longer wouldn't have helped much. The first decisive close below the 5-day moving average (6) happened just below the 10% profit goal.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED: Buying Early But Buying Smart With Stock ReversalsSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

1066,NOV,"Gold rose to the highest this year after North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan, boosting haven demand and extending a rally fueled by declines in the dollar. An index of precious-metals mining stocks touched a four-month high.An index of the greenback touched the lowest since January 2015 before paring losses later on Tuesday. Stocks fluctuated as North Korea's ballistic missile test rattled markets. Palladium extended gains and platinum rose above $1,000 an ounce for the first time since March.""Gold prices have rallied to their highest level since U.S. elections"" in November, analysts at Goldman Sachs Group including Abhinandan Agarwal said in a note to clients. ""Expect precious-metal stocks to outperform today.""Bullion for immediate delivery rose 0.3% to $1,314.23 an ounce at 1:57 p.m. ET, according to Bloomberg generic pricing. The metal gained as much as 1.2% to $1,326.08 an ounce, the highest since Nov. 9. Gold futures for December delivery climbed 0.3% to settle at $1,318.90 at 1:42 p.m. ET on the Comex.A Bloomberg Intelligence index of gold-mining companies climbed 3.5%, touching the highest since April, with AngloGold Ashanti (AU) and Harmony Gold Mining (HMY) leading gains.Gold has surged almost 15% this year, rising every month except June, as investors weigh the possibility of conflict in Asia, with Kim Jong Un's regime pushing on with missile tests and U.S. President Donald Trump vowing a stern response. Prices have also climbed as the Federal Reserve is expected to go slow on further interest-rate increases.

"
1068,NOV,"Bond investors have finally done it, stretching out pricing for the next Federal Reserve rate hike beyond the point of absurdity — all the way to June 2018, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.Tuesday's market action saw the 10-year Treasury yield sink 3 basis points to 2.13%, briefly falling to the lowest level since Nov. 10, two days after Election Day reset expectations for the U.S. economy.Yet the odds that financial markets are betting correctly about the rate outlook look minuscule at a time when so much is going right for the U.S. economy and the broader global economy.Industrial commodities prices are surging, a reflection of the most broad-based global expansion in a decade. Wage pressures are building, according to the Paychex-IHS Markit Small Business Employment Watch, which on Tuesday reported 3% annual wage growth for the first time since the recession. The jobless rate is at a 16-year low 4.3% and numerous economists expect it to fall to 4.0% within a matter of months and keep falling.Even tragedy may lift U.S. economic growth. While Hurricane Harvey's devastating floods will depress immediate economic activity, as the waters recede there likely will be a construction boom in Houston, with the need to replace thousands upon thousands of ruined vehicles.Bank stocks have been paying the price for falling Treasury yields and the downgraded Fed rate-hike outlook, which cast doubt on the expectation of higher rates and wider net-interest margins that helped make the sector one of the winners of the postelection rally. Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) have all slipped below their 50-day moving averages. Bank of America and Morgan Stanley have both fallen below buy points, potentially negative signs advising investors to remain on the sidelines. JPMorgan remains in a buy zone above an 89.23 buy point from a double-bottom base.IBD'S TAKE: Bullish chart patterns showing a stock breaking out of base into a buy zone give investors the best chance of reaping near-term gain, especially when a series of other important factors is present.While headlines about North Korea drove a safety bid in Treasuries early on Tuesday, stocks recovered from early losses and turned in decent gains. The real game-changer for markets has been the disinflationary trend that has seen the Fed's preferred personal consumption expenditures annual inflation rate slide from 2.2% in February to 1.4% in June, with core inflation easing to 1.4% from 1.9%. (July figures are due out on Thursday morning.)But markets are seriously overestimating the Fed's patience. The reason for the current consensus to keep rates on hold until at least December is that Fed policy makers have pretty clearly decided to use this window to shift their reinvestment policy and begin gradually scaling back the central bank's $4.5 trillion balance sheet. The change, allowing principal in maturing Treasury and mortgage bonds to run off, rather than reinvesting it, is itself a tightening of policy, so the Fed doesn't want to hike rates at the same time.With wage growth creeping higher and the jobless rate sinking, Fed members are very likely to hike again sooner than markets expect. Industrial metals prices, a leading indicator of inflation, are on the rise, with copper, aluminum, and zinc all at multiyear highs, which has sparked breakouts of mining stocks like BHP Billiton, Southern Copper and Vale over the past week.The weakness in Treasury yields as miners surge doesn't make a ton of sense. While higher commodity prices partially reflect dollar weakness, eventually that weak dollar will put upward pressure on prices of U.S. imports.Hurricane Harvey could intensify an apparent shortage of construction workers, while a surge in used car demand could at least temporarily ease a supply glut that's weighing on used car prices.Meanwhile, Trump policies also may have inflationary consequences. The Commerce Department is collecting preliminary duties of 17% to 31% on Canadian softwood lumber used in home building. Trump may decide this week to walk away from President Obama's deportation deferral program for people who arrived in the U.S. as unauthorized immigrants when they were children, which would gradually phase out their work permits.While subdued inflation pressure reflects competitive pressures in a wide of array of industries, including the grocery industry that just saw Amazon.com buy Whole Foods, the inflation outlook won't be tame enough to keep the Fed on the sidelines for long with unemployment headed to 4%.RELATED:4 Miners, 2 Clinical Trial Plays Ace Buy Points, Take New HighsLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

1069,NOV,"Major indexes kept to the south side but losses remained extra-mild in afternoon trading Thursday. At 2:30 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average all shaved their early declines to less than 0.1%, a bullish sign.XHowever, if the Nasdaq composite, which fell more than 0.5% at one point in the stock market today, finishes the session down at least 0.2% and sees higher volume by day's end vs. the prior session, it could rack up another bearish day of distribution. It would be the 10th such bout of intense professional selling over the past 25 sessions.Volume is running mildly higher on both major exchanges vs. the same time Wednesday.Serious distribution, combined with terrible action by the leading stocks, would signal that a significant correction may be in the works.Indeed, some former leaders have fallen enough to suggest that the market, following big gains since mid-November, is in need of a serious break. The S&P 500, down minimally in the stock market today, hasn't had a pullback of more than 5% from highs since the 5% slide from Aug. 16 to Nov. 4 of last year.The Dow Jones industrial average, at 21,799, is up 10.3% since Jan. 1, better than a 9% lift for the S&P 500.Snap (SNAP), meanwhile, displayed some of the poor reversal-type action that it's shown in recent months. Shares in the Snapchat social network operator rose more than 10% in the prior two sessions and showed an early-morning gain Thursday before butting heads with the falling 50-day moving average near 15.14.For short sellers, such action would make it seem ripe for a short-sale entry. After all, the stock backtracked immediately after piercing through the upside of the 50-day line with a 6.8% rise on May 25 in heavy volume. Snap went on to plunge 22% over the next three weeks.But notice on a daily chart how Snap has logged numerous up days in heavy turnover since it posted  a high-volume reversal on Aug. 14.Those big up days in heavy volume suggest that some institutions are building positions and defending the stock.Also, please see a weekly chart. Last week's big gain came in even higher volume than the prior six down weeks. When you want to short a stock, you'd like to see the opposite happen first. That is, a stock, after plummeting in heavy trade, creeps up in lighter weekly volume.Finally, selling short those stocks that trade in the low or high teens is challenging because there tends to be more price volatility in such stocks after a huge correction.Elsewhere in the market today, Burlington Stores (BURL) jumped as much as 9% to an intraday high of 92.78 before cooling off. Volume is running more than triple usual levels. The deep-discount chain is also trying to rally back above the critical 50-day moving average, which itself is sloping lower.Burlington has staged impressive profit increases even with sales growing just in the mid- to high teens. Earnings per share rose 39%, 105%, 104%, 21%, 39% and 85% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters.If more money continues to flow into the retail sector, these names may also be worth watching:Five Below (FIVE): Up nearly 1%. Back above the 50-day line. Solid track record of EPS growth (up 38%, 25%, 17% and 25% in the past four quarters) and sales gains. But recent EPS estimates have been shaved (FY 2018 earnings seen up 26% to $1.26 a share, FY 2019 earnings seen up 18%).Floor & Decor (FND): up 1.3% to 34.34, but still in a big new base. IPO at 21 in late April.The large-format chain for flooring products remains more than 60% above its initial offering price. The Georgia-based firm has a reasonable float of 77 million shares. Sales grew 32%, 32%, 34% and 34% in the past four years and broke through the $1 billion barrier in 2016 ($1.05 billion).Earnings jumped 90% to 55 cents a share last year. The Street sees earnings up just 9% this year, but then accelerating 23% to 74 cents in 2018.In the tech sector, Inphi (IPHI) is also basing. Shares in the data-center and fiber-optic technology expert are up more than 4% to 38.52. Watch to see if the stock can further build the right side of a new base.IBD's TAKE: Are you making decent gains but would like your portfolio to do better than the market?

The stock tripped again, falling more than 2% in heavy volume and crossing below the 200-day moving average. A breakout June 30 on an earnings report has failed, and the stock is likely to remain in the long-term sideways trend it's been in for more than a year.The Dow utilities index led with a 0.4% increase after news of a major acquisition in the sector.Sempra Energy (SRE) topped a 117.69 buy point on news that it is acquiring privately held power transmission firm Oncor for $9.45 billion.

1072,NOV,"Major stock indexes were mixed and mostly unchanged Tuesday afternoon, unfazed by better-than-expected July retail sales data.XThe dollar surged and and bonds were under pressure, sending the yield on the 10-year Treasury note higher by 4 basis points to 2.26%.Apple (AAPL) continued to attract serious buying as shares rallied more than 1.2% to 162.01. Volume was running slightly above usual levels. At 162.01, the stock is still in buy range from an Aug. 2 breakout past a 156.75 flat-base entry.An earlier Stock Market Today column back on July 24 alerted readers to a follow-on entry point for Apple near 149 as the mega-cap tech burst back above its critical 10-week moving average.Meanwhile, another round of dim top-line results from a host of retailing giants suggests that investors are further cutting their exposure to certain areas of the vast retail sector.Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS,) which issued a key sell signal on Dec. 22 last year when shares dove below the 50-day moving average near 58 in massive trade, plunged 7.20, or more than 20%, to 27.71 in huge volume. The sporting goods chain reported a 17% rise in fiscal Q2 earnings to 96 cents a share, missing the consensus forecast by 4 cents. Revenue rose 10% to $2.16 billion, extending a streak of double-digit top-line growth to four quarters, but the company fell short of Wall Street's same-store sales views.Notice how on a historical daily chart, Dick's had tried to clear a 62.04 buy point in a seven-week flat base on Nov. 14 last year, but the breakout quickly failed. That was an early warning that institutional demand for the former big market winner was fading quickly.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Coach (COH) gapped down at the open and dropped more than 12% to 41.74. Volume already surged past 14 million shares, vs. its 50-day average turnover of 2.62 million. The purveyor of luxury handbags, wallets and shoes posted an 11% rise in fiscal fourth-quarter profit to 50 cents a share, better than EPS gains of 10%, 10% and 5% in the prior three quarters. However, sales edged 2% lower to $1.13 billion, a tad below Wall Street's consensus view of $1.15 billion.While the stock appears to be finding a floor of support near the 200-day moving average, the stock has also given back all the advance from a May 2 breakout from a 41.80 entry in a nearly 10-month cup-with-handle pattern.In normal circumstances, a leading stock in terms of fundamental, technical and institutional sponsorship characteristics should be able to rally 20% to 25% from a proper base breakout before correcting significantly in price. In Coach's case, the stock rallied 16.9% from the latest base to a high of 48.85 before showing signs of fatigue.RELATED:When Did Apple Trigger A New Follow-On Buy Point?

1073,NOV,"Is there any surprise to why many people invest and trade in ETFs today? Definitely not. Exchange traded funds can be bought or sold in real time. They offer an amazing diversity of choices. The fund expenses are low.But if you really desire to succeed in the game of making money with these speculative vehicles, there's at least one thing you must do that is no different from investors in individual growth stocks. You must use charts correctly and get your market timing right.You must also be wise on the selling side. Know when to exit so you can lock in gains appropriately when you are right and keep losses small when you are wrong. IBD's golden rule of selling applies as much as to ETFs as it does to stocks.Let's consider the WisdomTree India Earnings (EPI) ETF. According to the WisdomTree literature, EPI ""seeks to track the investment results of profitable companies in the Indian equity market.""  The top 10 holdings include a few companies whose American depositary receipts (ADS) trade in the U.S., including Infosys (INFY) and Icici Bank (IBN).As seen in the accompanying weekly chart, EPI has thrived in 2017 so far. Despite Wednesday's 1.5% drop, to 26.18, the ETF closed Wednesday with an impressive 29.6% gain since Jan. 1. That even pounds the 17.6% advance by the leading U.S. equities benchmark, the Nasdaq composite.Yet buying a country-sector ETF at the start of the year and hoping for a marvelous gain does not guarantee your portfolio will glitter like gold.What if you bought $10,000 worth of shares on the first trading day of 2016 at 19.50? In less than six weeks, your investment would have fallen to $8,500 as the ETF fell to as low as 16.55. EPI eventually rebounded, but still finished the year only slightly ahead.Given the expectations that India has emerged as a long-term economic growth story, you might wonder if an ETF such as WisdomTree India Earnings would be much better as a buy-and-hold strategy. Not necessarily.In the week ended Nov. 5, 2010, EPI peaked at 28.72, then began to fall. If you bought shares at the start of the new year in 2011, at around 25, then you certainly got a ""discount"" from the all-time high. But over the next three years, EPI kept sliding. By late August 2013, the ETF dropped to 12.99, down 48% from 25 and down 55% from the all-time peak of 28.72. Today, EPI is still a few points below that high water mark.For these reasons, why not employ IBD's chart-analysis technique to time your buy into ETFs as well? You may not have learned about stock charts during your days in high school, college or grad school. Fine. That doesn't mean they cannot help improve your results.If you watched the action of WisdomTree India Earnings from September 2016 to January of this year, you would have spotted the ETF forming a 24-week flat base. In a flat-base pattern, the decline from head to toe must not exceed 15%. In EPI's case, it corrected just 13% to a low of 19.43. The high in the flat base was 22.38; add a dime to get the precise buy point.On Feb. 21, EPI shot past the 22.48 buy point with a 1.9% gap up to 22.57. Volume grew 26% above its 50-day average. You could have bought shares over the next 15 sessions and your timing would still be excellent. EPI finally jumped out of buy range on March 15; the fund closed up 2.1% at 23.92, more than 5% above the proper entry.In July, the ETF broke out again, this time clearing a 25.57 buy point in a new seven-week flat base. Because EPI didn't rally 20% from the first base before producing this new pattern, the base stage stays the same at first stage. One, in fact, could call the pair of bases a base-on-base pattern.When's the right time to sell? One good exit point: when EPI rises 20% to 25% above either of the two entry points. Have superb conviction? You can decide to hold longer.IBD's TAKE: To see a historical chart of WisdomTree India Earnings ETF, please check out MarketSmith, IBD's professional-class charting service.

1076,NOV,"One of the most important market turning points in recent years did not actually feature a bullish follow-through day.Nevertheless, did you catch the U.S. equity market's major inflection point in early November? If yes, great. If no, can you learn something by studying it? For sure.The past nine months have illustrated that good buying opportunities, in both individual stocks and ETFs, can emerge when the stock market suddenly shows unbridled demand after a mild pullback within a general uptrend. Consider the sell-off that occurred in the end of October. As the daily chart of the Nasdaq composite shows, the major benchmark suffered a nine-day sell-off as tensions over global terrorism, the Federal Reserve's intentions on interest rates, and uncertainty over the U.S. presidential elections grew.The nine-day decline (1) amounted to a 5% pullback, which isn't deep. Yet it was enough to send the Nasdaq below the 50-day moving average, which itself was flattening out. (The 50-day moving average computes the average closing price of a stock or index over the 50 most recent trading sessions. A rising line means that the stock or index is in a general uptrend.)On Nov. 4, the Nasdaq hit 5034, down 5.8% from its recent high of 5342. The healthy decline kept investors honest, but it was not a serious correction. An intermediate correction is by definition a minimum 10% drop from a high; a bear market, at least 20%.Only in the latter two situations would you expect to see the market follow through with a big up day in heavier turnover, four days into a new rally attempt or later. But the market got hot on the eve of the Nov. 8 U.S. elections as IBD coverage noted a good chance that Donald Trump would land an upset victory over Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. The following day on Nov. 9, with Trump's victory confirmed, the Nasdaq bounced sharply off early lows to rise 1.1% and jump back above its 50-day moving average (2). Notice how volume soared to the highest level in months (3). The large charts PDF that is linked to the daily Big Picture column shows the 50-day line (in dotted form) very clearly.Although that was Day 3 of a new rally attempt and thus would not normally qualify as a follow-through because it was too soon into the rally, the Nasdaq showed a true change in character. So did the S&P 500. On the same day, The Big Picture column noted that the current outlook was upgraded to ""Uptrend resumes,"" which means that the prospects of good breakouts were higher and it's the best time to actively form a watch list and be ready to pounce.XThe next few days were bumpy, but stocks continued to roar ahead. Through Thursday, the Nasdaq has risen from the Nov. 9 close of 5251 to 6352, a 21% lift.Examples of solid winners since then range from Adobe Systems (ADBE), Apple (AAPL), Alibaba (BABA) and Netflix (NFLX) on the big- and megacap end to TAL Education (TAL), Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) (Jan. 12 breakout; $1.8 billion market cap), Arista Networks (ANET) and TransUnion (TRU) on the small- to midcap end.IBD's TAKE: After you spot an emerging market uptrend, be sure to actively use the IBD 50, Big Cap 20, Sector Leaders, Stocks Near A Buy Zone and IPO Leaders to identify new bases, follow-on entries, and important exit points.

1077,NOV,"Activision Blizzard (ATVI) stock received at least nine price-target increases from Wall Street analysts on Friday after the video game publisher delivered much better-than-expected second-quarter results.XHowever, Activision stock ended the regular trading session down 3.1% to 62.01 on the stock market today, likely because of the company's mixed guidance.For the third quarter, Activision expects to earn 45 cents a share excluding items on adjusted sales of $1.7 billion. Wall Street was modeling 48 cents and $1.65 billion.Of the analysts upping their price targets on Activision stock, Jefferies analyst Timothy O'Shea was most bullish. He rates Activision as buy and increased his price target to 78 from 68.O'Shea compared Activision to entertainment giant Walt Disney (DIS).""With its stable of core franchises and a multitude of future growth opportunities, Activision is building a Disney-type media business for the 21st Century, but with (much) higher operating margin,"" O'Shea said in a report. ""We see large opportunities around e-sports, ads, mobile games, full-game downloads, and consumer products. But for Q2, the big beat was driven by in-game spending, the biggest opportunity of them all.""IBD'S TAKE: Activision is currently ranked No. 30 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.Activision generated $1 billion in in-game spending in the second-quarter, which is a meaningful driver of profit expansion, O'Shea said.Upcoming games ""Destiny 2"" and ""Call of Duty: WWII"" should drive strong results in the second half of this year, he said. ""Destiny 2"" is set for release on Sept. 6, followed by ""Call of Duty: WWII"" on Nov. 3.Also Friday, BMO Capital Markets analyst Gerrick Johnson raised his price target on video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) to 100 from 87 and reiterated his outperform rating on the stock.On Thursday, nine analysts raised their price targets on Take-Two stock following the company's better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results.Take-Two was down 1.3%, near 87.90, in midday trading Friday.RELATED:Activision Blizzard Beats Second-Quarter Views, Offers Mixed OutlookGame Publisher Take-Two Posts 34% Sales Hike, And Shares Jump

1078,NOV,"FedEx Corp. (FDX) squared off against rival United Parcel Service (UPS) Thursday, announcing that it will skip additional charges for most residential deliveries this holiday season. The package delivery services are locked in a duel as Americans increasingly make their purchases at Amazon.com (AMZN) and other online retailers.XFedEx will, however, slap a fee for packages that are oversized or unauthorized, or require additional handling, the shipping giant said. It noted in a statement that the volume of oversized packages during the holidays has increased by approximately 240% over the past 10 years, and larger, heavier packages now account for 10% of all ground volumes.""To support our millions of loyal small business customers and consumers shipping holiday gifts at FedEx Office and FedEx Onsite locations, FedEx will not apply holiday season surcharges except for packages that are oversized, unauthorized or require additional handling,"" Patrick Fitzgerald, a senior vice president, said. The extra levies, in effect from Nov. 20 to Dec. 24, amount to $3 per package for additional handling, $25 per package for oversized packages, and $300 per package for unauthorized shipments.UPS said in June that it will charge retailers an extra fee for deliveries around Black Friday and Christmas. That surcharge is expected to offset additional costs as the delivery services shell out more for extra planes, trucks and employees during peak holiday season.Both FedEx and UPS have been investing heavily to handle more e-commerce shipments.While rising volumes and the need for ever-faster deliveries are straining the shipping services, especially around the holidays, a longer-term challenge looms in the form of one of their biggest customers, Amazon. The online behemoth has expanded its airfreight fleet via Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW).Shares of FedEx dipped 0.1% to 209.38 on the stock market today. Shares are back in buy range following two down weeks. But FedEx has been finding resistance at its 50-day moving average.UPS added 0.2% to 111.49. UPS has recently retaken its 50-day line, but is well off a potential buy point at 120.54.IBD Leaderboard stock Amazon lost 0.9% to 986.92, falling further below its 50-day moving average.Atlas Air shed 2.4% to 65.20. Atlas Air gapped up nearly 12% Wednesday on strong earnings.RELATED:Are Drone Deliveries And Robotic Gofers Ready To Serve You?

1079,NOV,"One of the qualities that makes a great trader is knowing how to adjust to different market environments. Having a sense of how much the market is willing to give you leads to tweaks in what rules to apply.The market environment in the past year has been one of tighter rules for IBD's SwingTrader: taking half profits at 5%, selling at decisive closes below the 5-day, and has included many periods of limited trading or at least limited position sizes.But that isn't always the case. At the end of 2014, the Nasdaq composite started trending above its short-term 10-day moving average line after a 10.7% correction that bottomed in October. Corrections over 5% help set the stage for more swing trading opportunities, which is why they should be welcomed and not feared. After trending above 10-day for a few weeks, a shift in expectations for profits would be justified and rules should be modified accordingly.Take AMN Healthcare (AMN) made a move that started with a reversal (1) on Nov. 18 amidst this trend in the Nasdaq.  The stock had just bounced from a brief spell below its 50-day moving average, its first breach in over four months, and volume came in heavier than average on the reversal. A purchase could have been made near the closing price of 16.26.Within three days (2) the stock was already up 5% and, as usual, the stop would be raised to the 1% profit level. But rather than taking partial profits at 5%, the stronger market would allow you to give it more room, holding the stock for a bigger gain and also using a decisive close below the 10-day moving average line instead of the 5-day. That allowed you to stay the course when the 5-day line was breached (3) and led to a 10% profit goal getting accomplished on Dec. 5 (4).Over the next seven days, AMN reached as high as 15% profit before falling back near the 10% profit level. This would have put you at a crossroads. The stock closed below the 10-day moving average but still within 1% while volume came in lower (5) so could be held. Taking of partial profits would also be understandable.From there, the stock hit the 20% profit level in the next three days (6), an excellent opportunity to lock in a good gain in just over a month's time. If the stock was held beyond that, still using a decisive close below the 10-day for protection, the sell would have come on Jan. 2 still leaving you with an 18% gain from the purchase price (7).The current market environment could be setting up for a correction of at least 5% to 10%. If that's the case, just remember what ample opportunities could lie on the other side.Subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader have access to current and past trading ideas as well as Market Action analysis.

1081,NOV,"Memory-chip maker Micron Technology (MU) late Thursday posted fiscal second-quarter earnings that beat expectations on in-line sales. It also guided to much higher sales and earnings for the current quarter.Micron stock jumped nearly 10% in after-hours trading on the stock market today. During the regular session, Micron shares rose 1.6% to 26.47. Micron hit a 52-week high of 26.61 on Monday. It broke out of a flat base with a buy point of 18.43 on Nov. 17.Results: Micron earned 90 cents a share excluding items on sales of $4.65 billion in the quarter ended March 2. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the Boise, Idaho-based company to earn 86 cents a share excluding items, vs. a year-earlier loss of 5 cents a share, on sales of $4.65 billion, up 58%.Outlook: For the current quarter, Micron expects to earn $1.50 a share ex items on sales of $5.4 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street had been modeling for Micron to post adjusted earnings of 90 cents a share, vs. a year-earlier loss of 8 cents a share, on sales of $4.72 billion, up 63%, in its fiscal third quarter.""Strong demand and limited industry supply for Nand and DRAM solutions, combined with significant progress on our cost reduction plan, produced excellent results for our second quarter,"" Micron Chief Executive Mark Durcan said in a statement.

1082,NOV,"Accenture (ACN) reported flat fiscal second-quarter adjusted earnings that topped views with revenue that just fell short of forecasts. Shares in the global tech consulting and services company slipped Thursday.In May, Accenture expects to record a principally noncash settlement charge of about $425 million, pretax, in connection with the termination of its U.S. pension plan. This settlement charge will reduce the company's fiscal 2017 GAAP EPS by approximately 39 cents.""Our strong performance reflects our continued rotation to new, high-growth areas such as digital, cloud and security services — which now account for more than 45 percent of total revenues — as well as our increasingly innovation-led approach to creating cutting-edge solutions for clients,"" said Pierre Nanterme, Accenture's chairman and CEO, in a release.Offshore information technology outsourcing (ITO) companies have shown decelerating revenue growth in recent quarters. Dublin-based Accenture's outlook for IT spending and plans for investments in digital, cloud and security will be key, analysts say. Accenture competes with IBM (IBM) India's Infosys (INFY), Tata Consultancy Services, and others.Wall Street fiscal Q2 estimates: Analysts estimated earnings would slip 3% to $1.30 a share, with revenue rising 5% to $8.34 billion.Results:  For the quarter ended Feb. 28, Accenture earned $1.33 per share, down a penny vs. a year earlier. Revenue climbed 4.7% to $8.32 billion, the third straight quarter of gradually decelerating growth.Fiscal Q3 and 2017 guidance. Accenture expects revenue in a range of $8.65 billion to $8.9 billion, up 5% to 8%, vs. analyst estimates of $8.8 billion. Accenture sees full-year revenue growth of 6% to 8%, slightly up from its earlier forecast of 5% to 8%. The company lifted its non-GAAP EPS outlook to $5.70 to $5.87 from $5.64 to $5.87.Fiscal Q1 results:  For the quarter ended Nov. 30, Accenture reported fiscal first-quarter profit that topped views, but net revenue that missed estimates. Accenture said it earned $1.58 per share, up 23% from $1.28 per share in the year earlier period, vs. consensus estimates of $1.49. Accenture said net revenue rose 6% to $8.52 billion from $8.01 billion, missing analysts' estimates of $8.59 billion. Accenture lowered its full-year earnings guidance, citing the currency exchange rate impact on its business.Stock: Accenture stock closed down 4.5% at 120.76 on the stock market today, dropping below a 125.82 buy point from a cup base cleared on Wednesday, when it rose 1.5% to an all-time high of 126.48.RELATED:Why This Is The Time Of Year Cisco Investors Love The StockIBM, Alibaba, Google Shine In Morgan Stanley Cloud Outlook

1083,NOV,"Oil dropped as U.S. crude supplies rose to an all-time high while investors await a meeting between OPEC and its allies that may signal whether they'll extend output curbs.Futures fell on both sides of the Atlantic, sending Brent to its lowest close since November. American crude output continued to rise along with inventories last week, an Energy Information Administration report showed on Wednesday.While OPEC won't formally decide until May whether to prolong production cuts, officials will meet this weekend in Kuwait to discuss their deal's progress.West Texas intermediate and Brent crudes dipped below $50 a barrel this month for the first time in 2017 as rising U.S. inventories weighed on output cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih has said the group would extend the deal if oil stockpiles remain high. The Russian cuts are ""slower than what I'd like,"" Al-Falih said in an interview with CNBC March 7.""There's a lot weighing on the market and I believe it's a matter of time before we move lower,"" John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy, said by phone. ""Saudi patience is being tried by Russia and others that aren't abiding by the agreement.""WTI for May delivery dropped 34 cents to close at $47.70 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 20% below the 100-day average. Prices are up 20% from a year ago.Brent for May settlement fell 8 cents to $50.56 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It's the lowest close since Nov. 30.

1084,NOV,"In a week chock-full of news, the party that on the night of Nov. 8 found itself, much to its surprise, very much out of power has been having difficulty finding a way to return.Democratic senators, urged on by the left blogosphere and party activists, peppered Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch with hostile questions, but to no apparent effect. They have failed to raise fears that Gorsuch would vote to repeal the 44-year-old Roe v. Wade, and their argument that he is a shill for big corporations is an obvious dud.But ""the base"" — or ""the resistance,"" as it calls itself, as if it were opposing Hitler — is demanding all-out opposition, including a filibuster. In which case Republicans will eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees as Harry Reid and Democrats did in 2013 for lower-court and executive-branch nominees.Republicans won't hold their Senate majority forever, but they aren't likely to lose it in 2018, when Democrats will defend 10 seats in states carried by Donald Trump and Republicans will defend only one in a Hillary Clinton state.Democrats did gain — or retain — a talking point in the Monday House Intelligence hearings when FBI Director James Comey said that there's an ongoing investigation of Russian ties with persons involved in the Trump campaign.But none of them is in government now, and so far the Trump administration has done nothing to coddle Vladimir Putin. Moreover, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes revealed that there was ""incidental"" intelligence surveillance of Trump associates and that their names may have been disseminated. And Comey said that the dissemination of this classified information is a felony punishable by up to 10 years in federal prison.A third issue, still pending as this is written, is whether House Republicans will pass the health care legislation, advertised as the first of three steps in repealing and replacing ObamaCare, patched together by Speaker Paul Ryan and supported by President Donald Trump.Party leaderships usually win votes like this, though sometimes it takes a three-hour roll call to squeeze out the last votes, as on the 2003 Medicare prescription-drug bill (whose market mechanisms, incidentally, have resulted in costs much lower than estimated by the Congressional Budget Office).When House leaderships have failed to win such votes, as Democrats did in August 1994 and Republicans in September 2006, debacle at the polls in unanticipated proportions has followed in November, as Ryan and Trump have presumably been reminding wavering members.Democrats are basically bystanders on this vote. Like the Republicans on ObamaCare in 2009-10, their advice and support have not been sought. They note that some recent polling shows, for the first time, majority approval for ObamaCare, and hope that dissatisfaction with what the Republicans pass — or fail to pass — will work to their benefit.Maybe so. But it's also possible that Democrats have missed a chance to expand rather than contract government-supported medicine, as Democratic (but pro-Trump on immigration) blogger Mickey Kaus argues, in calling for lowering Medicare eligibility to age 55.Last-ditch opposition to Gorsuch, re-litigation of the Russian collusion charges aired already last fall and refusal of any engagement on health care — these are all positions demanded by a furious Democratic base, but which may harm rather than help the long-term interest of the Democratic Party.Undoubtedly, some Democratic officeholders realize this but feel helpless to urge a different course, fearing the rage of angry and even violent crowds and the threat of primary opposition.Even those with no sympathy for the Democratic base should be able to understand the causes for their rage. They believed, with some reason, that the Democratic Party had an advantage in presidential elections.The theory that increasing numbers of nonwhite, single women and millennial voters would help Democrats, advanced in Ruy Teixeira and John Judis' 2002 book and amplified by journalist Ronald Brownstein and pollster Stanley Greenberg, was over-interpreted. An advantage was seen as a guarantee.Democrats came to believe that their party would always hold the White House. So Barack Obama decided to govern by pen and phone, ignoring the possibility that his executive orders could be rescinded by a Republican successor. Mainstream media took a Clinton win for granted and ignored the evidence that prompted FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver to give Trump a 1-in-3 chance of winning.In retrospect, the belief in a Democratic lock on the presidency ill served the Democratic Party. And the rage triggered when that belief was shattered may not be serving it very well, either.

1085,NOV,"XFord Motor (F) on Thursday offered a first-quarter profit outlook well below analyst expectations, and the company said lower used-vehicle prices, among other factors, could weigh on industry results in the U.S.Ford said it expects first-quarter earnings per share of 30-35 cents, well short of consensus for 47 cents, citing increased costs and weaker demand. Ford earned 68 cents a year earlier.Ford, in an SEC filing, blamed the weak guidance on: ""higher costs (including commodities, warranty, and investments in emerging opportunities); lower volume (primarily fleet); and unfavorable exchange.""Shares of Ford fell 0.85% to 11.67 on the stock market today. The stock sank as low as 11.50 in morning action, the worst since Nov. 9.General Motors (GM) retreated 0.4% and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) 1.6%.Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler have been down sharply in recent days — Ford stock has fallen about 8% since March 16 — amid growing concern about used-car prices, slowing auto sales and the stability of the ballooning auto-loan market.Morgan Stanley recently issued a bearish note on Ford, saying Ford Credit is particularly exposed to falling used-car prices. Ford said it continues to expect Ford Credit's pretax profit to be about $1.5 billion in 2017 and to improve in 2018.Still, even though Ford expects incentives to creep up this year for the industry, the company during the presentation said it expects the economy to continue growing.CFO Bob Shanks said Ford would be closely watching any developments over the GOP's attempts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which could have a considerable impact on the Trump administration's broader plans for the economy.As for other policy matters, the company said potential tax reform under President Trump would help, and that any infrastructure investment would amount to ""all positives"" for the company's large truck business. The company said it also expected U.S. consumers to continue to shift from cars to SUVs and trucks in the years to come.Ford said the impact from potentially higher interest rates would be mixed, and that attempts to rework NAFTA could hurt its business.""Anything that's done that puts some sort of wall or barrier or incremental cost of bringing in vehicles either from Canada or Mexico into the United States would obviously be a drag on our business,"" Shanks said.Ally Financial (ALLY) on Tuesday also warned on profit, citing weaker auto prices. Fitch Ratings said Wednesday that falling used-car prices and a shakier subprime loan market will put pressure on lenders.""Subprime credit losses are accelerating faster than the prime segment, and this trend is likely to continue as a result of looser underwriting standards by lenders in recent years,"" Fitch Ratings Director Michael Taiano said in a statement on Wednesday.Fitch added that lower prices for used cars ""have accelerated more recently which will likely pressure recovery values on defaulted loans and lease residuals."" However, the firm added that the stronger economy should act as a counterweight to credit losses.Ally Financial lost 1.2% Thursday and is down more than 10% so far this month.Rental car companies such as Avis (CAR) sold off on Tuesday as investors grew concerns about the impact of used-car prices on their future vehicle sales. Avis fell nearly 8% and Hertz (HTZ) almost 9% that day. Avis skidded 2.6% on Thursday while Hertz has lost 4%.RELATED:U.S. Car Sales Falling Off A Cliff: Ford Fusion Dives 35%, GM Malibu 42%General Motors Dives On Margins, Trump 'Uncertainty'; Tesla Tests Buy Point

1086,NOV,"Sometimes a small prod is all it takes to make a hot investment idea go cold in no time — as small as a quarter-point bump in a benchmark rate in the case of low volatility and dividend stock ETFs.As the era of zero ends and interest rates rise, investors in exchange traded funds have turned away from certain high dividend and low volatility strategies this year. Instead, they favored more cyclical exposures that benefit from a tick up in rates — banks and transporters, for example.""Yet, thanks to product innovation, there are now strong smart-beta strategies that combine defensive and cyclical components,"" Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA, wrote in a March note. Smart beta ETFs seek to achieve better returns or lower risk vs. cap-weighted counterparts.As examples of ""next-generation products"" for a rising rate environment, Rosenbluth offered these two names:As relatively new products without a three-year history, both ETFs should be traded with care. However, Rosenbluth considers them worthy choices for large-cap stock exposure in light of the March rate hike and the Fed's signals of more gradual rate hikes this year.XRLV is the younger sibling of PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV), an ETF that aims to give investors a smoother ride in the stock market. SPLV invests in the 100 least volatile stocks in the S&P 500 and surged in popularity during 2016's choppy markets. So did iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility (USMV).But this year through March 21, SPLV and USMV saw net outflow of $1.238 billion combined, according to FactSet data — a big chunk of their total assets, which now stand at roughly $19 billion.Hefty stakes in defensive, high-yielding sectors could be hurting them.Those equity sectors, such as consumer staples, real estate and utilities, are seen as ""bond proxies"" because of their higher yields. They have historically lagged the S&P 500 when bond yields are rising.As the Federal Reserve seems inclined to keep raising rates this year, more pain may lie in store for SPLV and USMV, in Rosenbluth's view.XRLV has little to fear in this context. It boots out the 100 most rate-sensitive stocks from the S&P 500 and so has virtually no exposure to utilities and real estate. Gas and electric companies such as Dominion Resources (D) and Southern Co. (SO), which belong in the older sibling's portfolio, are missing here.Instead, it skews heavily toward financials, technology and industrials, such as JB Hunt Transport Services (JBHT). Those economically sensitive sectors tend to perform well amid rising interest rates.Basically, XRLV is defensive — but not too much.""It's a middle ground for investors who are expecting more choppiness in the marketplace but also wish to participate in an improving economy,"" said Rosenbluth.XRLV has gained 10.3% since the Nov. 8 election, roughly in line with the S&P 500 and outpacing the 9.2% advance of the low volatility heavyweights, SPLV and USMV.While the Fidelity dividend ETF also holds stocks that perform well when rates are rising, it avoids big sector bets.It is up 4.8% year to date and has a 30-day SEC yield of 3.05%.RELATED:The Best Lage-Cap Growth ETF For 10 Years, But Is It Best For You?

1087,NOV,"The dollar swung between gains and losses as a slump in stock markets spurred haven demand for the yen, while investors reduced their exposure.Risk aversion was evident in both the spot and options markets: Dollar-yen was lower a seventh day, set for its longest losing streak in two months, while bearish sentiment as expressed through risk reversals touched its strongest level in six weeks. Aussie-yen, a common risk barometer, was lower by the most in three months on a two-day basis.Refuge seeking amid equities' tumble and the possibility that President Trump's fiscal policies will be delayed until Autumn didn't result in a sharp drop for the greenback. According to Europe-based traders, who asked not to be identified as they aren't authorized to speak publicly, opposing market forces kept the greenback in consolidation mode. Some investors were seen cutting back on their longs given the currency's latest weakness while others, mainly short-term accounts and fast-money names, faded the latest dip.The greenback as measured by the Dollar Index may be due for a rebound, a relief one at least. DeMark's TD Sequential points to a recovery as a Buy Countdown was completed on March 17 while Wednesday price action also satisfies a Buy Setup series. A further 1.2% drop in DXY would suggest current decline is to extend as DeMark risk level would be breached.Dollar bulls would have trouble finding comfort from the price action vs. the yen. The pair slipped by as much as 0.5% to 111.14, its weakest level since Nov. 23; a daily close below 111.60, the Feb. 7 low, could drag U.S. yields lower and keep pressure on the dollar. Interbank names attempted to fade the dip below 111.30, albeit in small sizes, the traders noted.
"
1088,NOV,"As the GOP's fractious debate over health care reform drags on, some Americans are beginning to look back on ObamaCare through rose-colored glasses. Although voters put in power on Nov. 8, 2016, a party committed to repealing and replacing ObamaCare, public approval for the health law just reached 54% — an all-time high.But a sober assessment of ObamaCare's brief history should be enough to cure anyone of nostalgia for the law.House Speaker Paul Ryan has promised a vote on the American Health Care Act today — ObamaCare's seventh anniversary — which includes a Manager's Amendment to try to get more GOP votes. To commemorate the law's unhappy birthday, here are seven of the many calamities ObamaCare has visited on American patients.President Obama's promise that ""if you like your health plan, you can keep it"" was vital to selling ObamaCare to an unwilling public.It was also deeply dishonest. Roughly 4 million Americans with policies that didn't meet ObamaCare's ""essential health benefits"" requirements had no hope of keeping their plans. Many were forced to leave their doctor, thanks to the limited provider networks of many ObamaCare exchange policies.ObamaCare's exchanges were supposed to make comparison shopping easy and provide instant checks on eligibility and subsidies.In reality, they were a mess. Several state-run exchanges — including those in Oregon and Maryland — were plagued by major malfunctions from day one. Both of those states eventually adopted the federal HealthCare.gov marketplace instead.Of course, HealthCare.gov was so dysfunctional in the beginning that many individuals were unable to sign up weeks after enrollment began. It proved to be a monument to government waste, too — costing over $2 billion.In lieu of a ""public option,"" ObamaCare created government-subsidized nonprofit ""CO-OPs"" in 23 states to compete with private plans. Nineteen of them have gone bust. Their failure wasted $2.2 billion in taxpayer loans and forced nearly a million people to find new health plans.Insurers have been fleeing the marketplaces amid huge financial losses — especially in recent years. Humana just announced that it is dropping out of ObamaCare entirely next year. Aetna exited all but four exchanges this year, with CEO Mark Bertolini claiming that the exchanges are ""in a death spiral.""Defections like these are the reason that exchange enrollees in one-third of counties have only one insurance provider to choose from.ObamaCare was supposed to make double-digit premium increases a thing of the past. Instead, it made them a fixture of the insurance market.Average premiums on bronze exchange plans jumped by 21% this year alone. Many states have suffered even more severe rate shocks. Average premiums for the second-cheapest silver exchange plan for a 27-year-old shot up 53% in Pennsylvania, 69% in Oklahoma, and 116% in Arizona.As recently as 2015, the Congressional Budget Office projected that 25 million people would be getting their insurance through ObamaCare's exchanges in 2017. Actual enrollment was roughly half that.The young and healthy, who were supposed to comprise 40% of the individual market in order to make the exchanges financially viable, stayed away in droves, largely because the insurance on offer has been so expensive. That left the exchange pools far sicker and costlier than promised.ObamaCare's partisans often celebrate the fact that the law drove the uninsured rate down to ""record lows."" But almost all of that decline is the result of ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion.Between 2013 and 2015, the number of Americans with insurance rose by 14 million — nearly 12 million of whom gained coverage through Medicaid. Today, Medicaid covers more than 74 million people.In other words, ObamaCare's most touted accomplishment is moving millions of Americans in the 32 states (including the District of Columbia) that expanded Medicaid into a program whose ""beneficiaries,"" according to a recent study of Oregon patients, fare no better as far as health outcomes go — and visit the emergency room more often — than the uninsured.Funneling more patients into Medicaid is nothing to brag about.For Americans exasperated by the GOP's repeal-and-replace efforts, it's helpful to remember just how much harm ObamaCare has delivered to American patients in just seven short years.

1090,NOV,"China internet giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) is set to report fourth-quarter results before the market open Wednesday, with expectations of strong double-digit growth.The consensus looks for Tencent to report revenue of $6.4 billion, or 44.25 billion yuan, up 45% in local currency year-over-year.

It also reportedly holds a 12% stake in Activision Blizzard (ATVI).When Tencent reported Q3 earnings on Nov. 16, it missed on EPS but beat on revenue, which nearly doubled.Tencent's primary competitor in China is e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA).

1091,NOV,"U.S. stock indexes staggered to hefty losses Tuesday, as utilities provided one of the few hiding places.The small-cap Russell 2000 led the way down, dropping 2.7%. The Nasdaq followed with a 1.8% loss. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average kept their losses at 1.2% and 1.1% respectively. Volume in the stock market today was up sharply from the previous session.Conservative and defensive groups did best. The Dow Jones utility average rose 1.4%. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the day's best performers included gold miners, utilities, beverages, food and soap.The worst performers were steel producers and banks — both heretofore market leaders.

Micron hit a 52-week high of 26.61 on Monday. It broke out of a flat base with a buy point of 18.43 on Nov. 17.Hosseini increased his estimates for Micron to account for the company's positive preannouncement earlier this month.Still, Micron's quarterly earnings and gross profit margins are seen as peaking in the second half of 2017 as average selling prices for DRAM and Nand flash memory start to decline, he said.""Despite such average-selling-price trends, Micron could still demonstrate gross margin upside (above our updated assumptions) and thus deliver earnings upside if it were to execute in moving DRAM to the 18-nanometer node (helping with a 20%-plus decline in cost per gigabyte) and scaling its 64-layer 3D Nand.""IBD'S TAKE: Micron stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 74, meaning it has outperformed 74% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.

1094,NOV,"The anti-Donald Trump movement is growing and organizing at a much faster rate than any pro-Donald Trump movement is and, certainly, faster than the current White House PR team.Another Republican administration cannot underestimate or ignore America's most powerful voting bloc — millennials — if they want to keep control of Congress and the White House.Trump was swept into the White House in a historic win as Florida, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania turned red last November. And, when the votes were analyzed, one thing was very clear: Donald Trump became the 45th President of the United States based on the way the millennial vote turned out. Or, in some cases, did not turn out.Starting the day after the election, Nov. 9, many young people across the country took to the streets to protest the election of Donald Trump. These protests were filled with so much vitriol, disgust and ignorance they often turned to rioting and ushered in a new and more militant ideological policing of anything but liberal ideas.All of this was often fueled by the mainstream media, ignorant celebrities and, worst of all, Democratic politicians. Not once did Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama or any other Democratic leader denounce the violence or hysteria. And in many cases they encouraged it.A progressive group called ""Indivisible"" was founded shortly after the election, its main goal to ""resist"" President Trump and his policies. Members of this group have been the main players at contentious Republican town halls and protests, made up of mostly young people.Headed mainly by millennials who formerly worked together on Capitol Hill, Indivisible has been called a safe place for young progressives and echoes the similar fiery outrage of the Tea Party in 2009. This group started in Washington, D.C., but is seeing chapters spring up from coast to coast in hopes of creating a midterm win for Democrats. Just as conservatives were angered by the liberal policies of President Obama, liberals are angered over the conservative policies of President Trump.A recent poll by GenForward found that a whopping 57% of millennials view Donald Trump's presidency as illegitimate and three-quarters of minority millennials have the same views.This view is a powerful Election Day motivator to get to the polls. Republicans cannot, once again, underestimate the ability of Barack Obama to organize and spur this group to turn out for elections.There was very little young-voter outreach from the Trump campaign during the election, and that has continued into the administration. With the same campaign staffers running the White House communication team there looks to be no interest in reaching out to young voters to win them over and counteract the great amount of fake news being spread about President Trump and his policies.Luckily, Donald Trump's message during the campaign was universal. It transcended age and won over significant millennial support in the Rust Belt states.But now Trump and his administration need a comprehensive plan for millennial outreach if they want to counteract the constant ""fake news"" about him and his policies in order to gain support for the 2018 midterm elections, specifically because they have no previous campaign organization to pivot to.The approach needed is threefold:1. Hire a White House strategist: The administration needs a strategist who understands how independent millennials think. That means not hiring a Republican or conservative, but an Independent who can craft the right message and strategy to push Donald Trump's agenda. Someone not anchored by one political ideology but who embodies many since the majority of millennials identify as Independents.2. Active engagement: This is the most important tool to win millennials over going forward. Millennials need to know the Trump administration is paying attention to them and their issues. Engaging with millennials and working with Republican and Libertarian groups on college campuses is key. Having these groups speak to their peers on how the administration is helping them will win them over more readily than a political ad or State of the Union speech. An engagement plan also requires a millennial council to discuss issues they care about with the president. This council needs to reflect the millennial generation: diverse, educated and drowning in student-loan debt.3. Hire a spokesperson: The Trump White House needs a millennial spokesperson that is able to help millennials overcome the extreme bias they receive from the liberal media, liberal academia, and a vocal Obama. They need this spokesperson to go where traditional spokespeople don't; Comedy Central, YouTube web shows, podcasts, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, HBO, Hulu, and other nontraditional areas of media where many millennials spend their time getting their news.2016 was the beginning of the fight, and President Obama will undoubtedly be spending his time undermining President Trump and pushing ""fake news"" to manipulate millennials in order to regain control of Congress and the White House for Democrats.If Republicans aren't careful, millennials could be the Tea Party of 2018. But a credible millennial strategy mixed with what will be a very successful Trump presidency could create a Republican majority for decades.RELATED:The Millennial Job DeficitMillennials Need Pro-Growth Economic Policies, StatNew Test Raises Fresh Concerns About U.S. Education Quality

1095,NOV,"The major indexes mainly treaded water late in Tuesday's relatively quiet session. The Dow Jones industrial average, however, is showing bullish action by maintaining strength at its 50-day moving average.The Dow Jones industrials, enjoying strong gains by the likes of industrial giants Caterpillar (CAT) and United Technologies (UTX), edged up around 0.1% during a day of narrow-range trading. That's in contrast with Monday, in which the 30-stock blue-chip index fell to an intraday low of 20,517, but bounced higher after a challenge of support at the key 50-day moving average.The Dow showed an earlier test of strength at this intermediate-term support line on March 27.Cat tried, but failed on Tuesday to climb back above its 50-day moving average. Leading stocks tend to travel above their 50-day lines in preparation for a potential breakout. The good news for Cat shareholders is that the stock is trading less than 6% below its 52-week high of 99.46.United Tech, meanwhile, has made limited upside progress since the stock rallied past a 109.52 cup-with-handle entry point in late November and early December.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite were practically flat. However, losing stocks were outpacing winning issues by a nearly 4-to-3 margin on the Nasdaq. On the NYSE, winners and losers were roughly evenly matched. The Russell 2000 lost 0.2%.Volume was running mildly lower vs. the same time Monday on both main exchanges.While the medical sector remains a laggard, here are four stocks to consider for your watchlist. PRA Health (PRAH) is ranked No. 32 on the IBD 50. The stock edged 0.2% lower to 64.62, but is showing gains after busting through stubborn resistance at 60.The Raleigh, N.C., clinical trials firm has grown earnings per share 108%, 74%, 34%, 34%, 23% and 20% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. Due in part to a tough year-over-year comparison, Wall Street sees earnings up just 9%, to 60 cents a share, in Q1.PRA holds a good 94 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 from IBD Stock Checkup.Celgene (CELG) has been trading quietly lately, but at 124.35 the top-performing biotech is still up nominally from a Feb. 28 breakout past a 122.49 cup-with-handle entry.Celgene is trading firmly above its 50-day moving average, which itself has been rising for more than six weeks. A 73 Relative Price Strength Rating is not superb, but it's a meaningful improvement from as low as 35 eight weeks ago. A 73 RS rating means that the large-cap biotech, which specializes in treatments for cancer and immunological disorders, is now outperforming 73% of all stocks in IBD's database over the past 12 months.Other notable leaders in IBD's biotech group are Incyte (INCY) and small-cap epilepsy and ADHD specialist Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN). Both are up sharply for the year so far. A fourth  member of the biotech group is Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), which rose 4% to 111.45 in heavy trading, four days after it zoomed up 20% in massive trading on positive clinical trial data regarding its two-pill treatment for cystic fibrosis.And Loveland, Colo.-based Heska (HSKA), a thinly traded expert in veterinary products, continues to soar after it cleared a 57.51 buy point in huge volume on Nov. 1.Keep in mind that Heska, up 2% to 104.37, trades just 102,000 shares a day. Elsewhere in the stock market today, InterActiveCorp (IAC) roared off its 50-day line, rising more than 2% to 75.73 in heavy volume.The search engine operator has found nice support at its 50-day for months, after the stock cleared a 60.40 buy point within a long bottoming-base pattern in October last year.On Feb. 2, InterActiveCorp staged a profit turnaround with fourth-quarter earnings rising 84% to $1.38 a share, crushing the consensus analyst estimate by nearly 47%, despite a 4% drop in sales. That halted a four-quarter streak of shrinking profits.Now, Wall Street has revised full-year EPS estimates higher, with 2017 earnings seen up 13% to $3.34 a share and 2018 earnings up 32% to $4.41.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Is It Time To Take Profits In These 5 Leading Techs?The Income Investor: Will These 3 Dividend Leaders Finish Big In 2017?Inside The IBD 50: These 7 Leaders Are Thriving, Even After Testing The 10-Week Moving Average

1096,NOV,"XU.S. auto sales fell in March to an annual rate of 16.64 million, down from 17.58 million in February and the lowest in two years as automakers struggle to push vehicles, especially sedans and other cars, out the door despite higher incentives and easy credit.General Motors (GM) reported weaker-than-expected March U.S. sales on Monday as unsold vehicles pile up. Meanwhile, Ford Motor (F), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) and Toyota Motor (TM) reported year-over-year declines.

1100,NOV,"John Krystopolski, a student of the stock market who's been reading IBD for several years now, retired two years ago after a 38-year career as a maintenance technician at Sealy Spring in Delano, Pa.Several of his stock trades illustrate how having a sound investing method can have a meaningful impact on the quality of your retirement lifestyle.He's in his early 60s now and has more time to hone his skills in the market. Krystopolski has been in the market seriously for about the past 10 years and reading IBD for the last eight.""I've always had two or three jobs in my life. My parents owned a restaurant/bar and I was always there, filling napkin containers, grating cheese, folding pizza boxes, you name it,"" he said. ""I even ran a bicycle repair shop when I was 12, out of my grandfather's garage.""These days, he's content with his real estate license to close one or two gas station/convenience store deals a year. He uses the commission to fund his stock investment account, which has grown nicely over the years thanks to some big winners.IBD's Composite Rating is his go-to stock rating because it uncovers stocks with strong potential. The rating helps uncover stocks that not only are strong fundamentally but also are showing leading price performance. He also focuses on leading industry groups in the market using IBD's 197 industry group rankings.Krystopolski is not risk-averse, preferring to own one or two stocks at a time, instead of 20 to 30 like some of his friends. ""I never understood how you could invest money with that much diversification,"" he said. ""Some go up, some go down and you eventually tread water, not making meaningful gains.""Krystopolski tried the diversified route with a financial advisor in the early going but left after six months when a mix of U.S. stock, bond and emerging market mutual fund exposure resulted in diluted performance.During confirmed uptrends, when a positive market tide is working in his favor, Krystolpolski isn't shy about making big, focused bets. Just recently, his portfolio tilted aggressive because one of his big winners, Nvidia (NVDA), was still working nicely.But Krystopolski sees his portfolio slanting toward more conservative in the not-so-distant future, favoring some high-quality, dividend-paying names with healthy charts, as he gets ready to start construction of his retirement home, helped by profits he's made in individual stocks.""I have friends that own stocks with high dividend yields, but the great yield is offset by weak price performance. They're comforted by a strong yield, but that doesn't mean much if a stock is going down in price and lagging the market,"" he said.He really pays attention to what's ""new"" at a company that's driving big earnings growth. Nvidia showed that in spades last spring. It was expanding from graphics chips to new markets, like autonomous driving.A well-timed buy with Nvidia when the chip firm was breaking out of a base near 33 resulted in a huge gain over the next several months. And Krystopoliski profited even more when Nvidia soared around 30% on Nov. 11. He eventually locked in a big gain but continues to trade the stock.Krystopolski has learned that risk-management is key when investing in fast-moving growth stocks. He's a big believer in knowing where his exit price will be after buying.Early last year, he bought shares of Amazon.com (AMZN) when the stock was trading around 660. Soon after, though, IBD changed its outlook to ""market in correction,"" and Krystopolski knew he had to play defense. Shares started to bleed and Krystopolski sold around 620 for a manageable 6% loss. From there, the stock lost another 23% before rebounding. ""I'm not a point in my life where I can afford to let a small loss spiral out of control,"" he said.Another big winner for Krystopolski was Baidu (BIDU). He first bought shares soon after the start of the bull market in March 2009. ""I remember my nephew was telling me to buy shares of Google in the early stages of its move, but I passed. When IBD started writing a lot about a Chinese search engine with outstanding growth, I didn't want to miss out."" Baidu's advance was such that the stock split 10-for-1 in May 2010.Krystopolski knows the value of monitoring shifts in market outlook by using IBD's Big Picture column. A good portion of his big winners came during confirmed uptrends when the institutional money was coming in from the sidelines, providing the fuel for big market leaders.Three pieces of advice Krystopolski has for investors:""Just before Nvidia's earnings, someone was on television saying sell Nvidia ahead of earnings and buy Intel. I'm glad I didn't listen.""Aside from having more time to spend with the grandchildren, fishing and travel, many retirees in their early 60s and beyond, use the newfound time to hone their stock-picking skills.If you're looking for a sound investing system, a good place to start is IBD Weekly and investors.com for timely coverage of market news and stocks on the move.Growth screens like the IBD 50, Sector Leaders or IPO Leaders can be used to find newer stocks still in the early stages of upside moves.IBD workshops or Leaderboard summits are available for those wanting to learn what really makes a winning stock tick. Knowing those traits is the first step in becoming a truly good stock-picker.Of course, people in the early stages of retirement have different risk-tolerance levels, with different time horizons.Some are content to use 10% of their portfolio to speculate in individual stocks. More aggressive types might increase that to 20%-30% or more, especially in the early stages of a bull market. That's when it's pretty clear that fresh money is coming into the stock market from the sidelines, helping to drive up prices. That's always a good environment for growth stocks to run higher.RELATED:Best Stocks To Buy And WatchFind The Best Mutual Funds For Your Retirement Account

Strong consumer spending helped boost imports.The 10-year yield has swum within a relatively tight range of around 2.3% to 2.6% since December.Back to stocks, on the upside, banking, finance, farm equipment and building-related groups excelled with gains of well more than 1%. Techs also rallied. Data storage giant Western Digital (WDC) bolted more than 3% in strong turnover to 83.72, surpassing a new flat-base entry point of 81.77.Notice on an IBD daily chart that Western's relative strength line is charging into new high ground. Western Digital's up/down volume ratio is at 1.4, well above the neutral 1.0 level, and the Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B+ suggests strong accumulation by institutions.Western Digital sports an excellent 97 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup on a scale of 1 to 99, and the data storage group enjoys an excellent No. 7 ranking among 197 industries ranked each day by IBD.Western had suffered a severe decline that finally ended with shares hitting bottom at 34.99 in May 2016, more than 69% below an all-time peak of 114.69. But after the Nov. 8 U.S. elections, the Irvine, Calif., company broke the long-term downtrend with a strong move past the 60 price level.Aggressive investors could have bought even earlier.On Sept. 16, Western gapped up 3.1% to 54.94 in robust turnover, 89% above its 50-day average. In so doing, the stock cleared a 54.51 entry in a seven-week cup with handle. Notice on the daily chart that the handle met the minimum length of five days. Plus, the stock had broken out after it had rallied back above the 50- and 200-day moving averages.However. it would have been totally understandable to have passed on this breakout attempt. While 54.94 was sharply higher than the recent low of 34.99, Western still down sharply off its then 52-week high of 86.39. Industry peer Seagate Technology (STX) is staging its sixth gain in seven sessions, rising more than 2% to 46.91. Shares are finding support at the 50-day line, a bullish sign.Seagate also sports enviable ratings from IBD, including a 92 RS Rating, meaning that over the past 12 months, it's outperformed 92% of all public companies. FY 2017 profit is expected to rebound 99% to $4.49 a share. Keep in mind that the data storage companies tend to show volatile earnings swings. In FY 2016, ended in June, Seagate's profit fell 50% to $2.26 a share.RELATED:Managing A Stock Portfolio: Concentrate Positions, Bolster Your Overall ReturnStock Market Today: Do These 7 Highly Rated Chipmaking Stocks Deserve A Spot On Your Watch List?How Much Is The Data Storage Group Up This Year: Check The Daily 197 Industry Group RankingsIs The Market's Uptrend Still Healthy?

1102,NOV,"The clues were there. Facebook (FB) is back among the Sector Leaders, but before making the list, the chart was offering positive clues. The first positive development came in early November. As the stock consolidated it undercut the low of the previous base. This constituted a shakeout of weak holders, which made the next breakout more likely to work. But wait, wasn't…

1103,NOV,"Biotech sector funds ruled the roost last year but technology focused funds are the clear winners now.Of 217 sector funds that are 10 years or older with at least $100 million in assets, three of the five top sector funds of 2016 were focused on technology. The other two represented the financial services and transportation sectors.All five sector funds featured in the 2017 IBD Mutual Fund Awards beat the benchmark S&P 500 for the past one, three, five and 10 years. Apple or iPhone-related chip stocks were a common underlying theme among the three technology funds.Fidelity Select Semiconductors Portfolio (FSELX) was the top-performing sector fund last year with a 32.4% return. Its three, five and 10-year average annual return is 23.3%, 22% and 10.9%, respectively. The S&P 500 rose nearly 12% last year and 9.9%, 14.7% and 7% for the same periods. Fidelity Select Semiconductors is still beating the S&P 500 so far this year with a gain of 8.58% vs. 5.09%, though it's trailing the top sector funds by about eight percentage points.The Fidelity fund, launched in July 1985, has $2.8 billion in total assets. In October, it changed its name from Fidelity Select Electronics Portfolio to better reflect its focus on chipmakers and chip designers.""Despite a subdued macro environment — semiconductor industry revenue was essentially flat for the past couple of years — semiconductor stocks performed well,"" Steve Barwikowski, who has managed the fund since 2009, told IBD. ""The biggest factor has been M&A with roughly $100 billion worth of deals in each of the last two years.""More than 99% of the fund's assets were in tech stocks, while less than a percentage point was in communications services. Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), Analog Devices (ADI) and Applied Materials (AMAT), its top five holdings at the end of the year, accounted for 52% of the fund's assets.Barwikowski thinks the chip industry could benefit from the new administration's pro-growth policies in areas such as tax and trade.""I am optimistic that the chips are poised for the best growth we have seen in a few years driven by a combination of healthy supply chain inventories, a more stable personal computing market, continued secular growth in the auto and cloud markets, a strong mobile phone cycle in the second half of the year, and potentially a healthier global macro environment,"" he said. ""Strong fundamentals are somewhat balanced by higher valuations, but there are definitely good opportunities for stock picking.""Up next is RMB Mendon Financial Services (RMBKX) with a 29.7% return in 2016. The $557.4 million fund, managed by Mendon Capital Advisors founder Anton Schutz, was launched in June 1999.As of Nov. 30, the fund was 85% invested in U.S. stocks and had less than 4% in cash. The top five holdings in the 62-stock portfolio were BNC Bancorp (BNCN), Yadkin Financial (YDKN), OceanFirst Financial (OCFC), Atlantic Capital Bancshares (ACBI) and Opus Bank (OPB).""Most of the gain in the financial services sector came in the last two months of the quarter following the surprising results of the presidential election,"" Schutz wrote in the fund's Q4 commentary. ""With visibility increasing around who the decision makers will be in Washington for the next four years, it became clear this was a significant inflection point for financial services in terms of both fundamentals and valuations.""He noted tail winds including corporate tax reform, amendments to Dodd-Frank and the delay of new Department of Labor rules.Fidelity Select Transportation Fund (FSRFX), with $644.7 million in assets, returned 10.5% last year. Industrials accounted for 99.1% of assets as of Jan. 31, with consumer cyclicals and technology making up less than 1%.Its top holdings by weighting as of Dec. 31 were United Parcel Service (UPS), Union Pacific (UNP), FedEx (FDX), CSX (CSX) and American Airlines Group (AAL).""My approach centers on the concepts of value and risk,"" fund manager Matthew Moulis said on Fidelity.com. ""In particular, I look for stocks that I think represent good value, where value is related to the price paid for attributes such as expected profit growth, return on capital and conversion of free cash flow.""Red Oak Technology Select Fund (ROGSX) came in third with a 24.6% return last year. Its average annual gains for the past three, five and 10 years were 12.9%, 18.4% and 11.5%, respectively. The Red Oak fund held total assets of $412.6 million as of Dec. 31, according to fund tracker Morningstar.Technology accounted for 86% of the fund's holdings as of Dec. 31, followed by consumer cyclical, financial services and industrials, at less than 6% each. Mark Oelschlager manages the fund. The fund's top five holdings were Alphabet (GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC), which recently agreed to by Mobileye (MBLY). Nearly a quarter, or 23%, of the fund's assets were in these names.Red Oak Technology and Fidelity Select Semiconductors both owned Intel, which had a 20% run in Q4. The chip giant's shares have dipped 2% this year, but IBD's overall chipmaker industry group has gained 8% this year and is ranked No. 38 among the 197 tracked by IBD.Columbia Seligman Communications & Information (SLMCX) rounds out the top five with a 15.4% return in 2016. Paul Wick has managed the $4.9 billion fund for 27 years. The fund was 91% invested in technology, 3% each in financial services and consumer cyclicals, and a little over 1% in industrials.Several chip names made its top five as of Jan. 31, including Lam Research (LRCX), Broadcom and Qorvo (QRVO). The three stocks rose 12%, 23% and 26% in Q4 last year. Apple (AAPL), up 20%, was also a top holding. The iPhone maker has rallied this year — it's close to the 20% profit-taking zone from a Jan. 9 breakout past a 117.12 cup-with-handle entry.""We are generally positive about the technology sector going forward despite many of the end markets being challenged for growth, whether that be in PCs, smartphones or networking,"" the managers said in their Q4 commentary. ""We are feeling optimistic about U.S. economic prospects in the wake of the election. In particular, we are enthusiastic that a less onerous regulatory environment should lead to more robust U.S. economic growth and that repatriation of cash held overseas will benefit a huge swath of technology companies in which the portfolio is invested.""RELATED:What's The Stock Market Doing Now?

1104,NOV,"Large-cap and megacap names dominated their small-cap peers as the stock market thrived on a broad rebound in afternoon trading Tuesday. Amid a 1.7% rebound in WTI crude oil futures, oil exploration firms helped lead the upside, and a 1-point gain by Dow 30 component Chevron (CVX) is helping the Dow Jones industrial average keep its head above the important 50-day moving average.WTI futures, helped by news about further trouble at Libya's oil-shipping ports, are currently near $48.45 a barrel, still down nearly 11% off their Feb. 23 peak of $54.45.At 2:45 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average accelerated gains to nearly 0.9%, practically equaling the gain by the S&P 100 index, which tracks the largest 100 companies in U.S. equity markets by market cap.The S&P 500 was also up around 0.9% amid reports that Republican leaders have vowed they will not quit at passing reforms to the Affordable Care Act, perhaps the biggest legacy from the President Obama administration. The Nasdaq composite slightly trailed with a nearly 0.7% lift. The Russell 2000 is catching up, rising more than 0.7%.Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility index, a key measure of fear among index options traders, dropped nearly 6% to 11.65. On Monday, the VIX hit as high as 15.11, marking the highest level since Nov. 14.Among those giant companies, at least five names are showing excellent action after breaking out over the past five months. They deserve a close look. Home Depot (HD), a member of the Dow industrial average, sports the highest EPS Rating within the 30 components at 97. The stock, which earns a 95 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup, broke out past a 137.42 saucer-with-handle entry.Home Depot may benefit from the reported rebound in demand for single-family homes among the large millennial generation, in addition to ongoing strength in the do-it-yourself home-improvement market.Home Depot is No. 14 in the IBD Big Cap 20 in the latest IBD Weekly.Please see the top of page A2 in the current IBD Weekly print edition. The ""Vital Signs"" economic shapshot of three housing industry-related graphs showed that the supply of existing homes for sale in February dropped 6.4% vs. a year ago. ""Tight supply is limiting choices and boosting prices. That's good news for new-home sales, which jumped last month to their second-best reading of the current recovery,"" IBD noted in the commentary adjacent to the charts. Visa (V) is second best in the Dow with a 96 EPS Rating, meaning that its long- and short-term earnings growth is superior to 96% of all publicly traded companies. The megacap firm is acting well following its Jan. 24 breakout past a shallow cup-with-handle-like base at 82.59.Wall Street expects Visa to post a 16% jump in fiscal second-quarter profit to 79 cents a share on an 18% bump up in revenue to $4.29 billion. For FY 2017, ending in September, analysts currently forecast EPS up 17% to $3.32 a share and revenue up 18% to $17.73 billion.Boeing (BA), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) also deserve close watch as all three have decent dividend yields that are higher than the 1.95% yield for the S&P 500 itself. Plus, all three stocks have shown nice advances following their own breakouts.Cisco sports the highest annualized yield among the three at 3.4%, followed by Boeing at 3.2% and JPMorgan at 2.3%.Solid earnings prospects are likely one key driver of these three stocks' current moves up.The Street sees earnings in FY 2017 rising 29% to $9.31 a share for Boeing, 4% to $6.57 for JPMorgan (followed by a 15% jump in FY 2018), and 1% to $2.38 for Cisco, which would mark the eighth straight year of increasing profits.Gold miners fell sharply and were the biggest decliners among 197 industry groups and subgroups covered by IBD. Greenwood Village, Colo.-based heavyweight Newmont Mining (NEM) slid more than 3% to 32.91 and continues to struggle since falling below its 50- and 200-day moving averages on Feb. 22 and 27, respectively.The Accumulation/Distribution Rating of Newmont is positive at a B-, but that's more than offset by a poor Relative Price Strength Rating of 39 on a scale of 1 to 99. In general, focus on those companies with excellent growth in sales, profits and an RS Rating of 80 or higher. Snap (SNAP) sank nearly 4% to 22.95, which is a natural pullback following strong gains in the prior six sessions.A key technical line of support and resistance for Snap may in fact be the 10-day moving average, which responds more quickly than the traditional 50-day line. For now, Snap showed bullish action when the stock burst back above the 10-day line on March 22 in the sixth highest volume in a single session since its March 2 debut.If Snap holds its recent gains, expect the 10-day line to keep rising and catch up with the stock itself. The 50-day moving average won't show up on a Snap daily chart until late May.You can see the 10-day moving average in green in all Leaderboard charts. In Leaderboard, markets writers and editors note when a sharp decline below the 10-day line following a strong breakout and gains of 10% to 15% or more can provide a timely sell signal for short-term traders.The highly popular social media firm will clearly need plenty of time and a strong rebound in order to fashion the possibility of a good breakout.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Should Snap Stay On Your Watch List?Stock Market Today II: Is It Time To Add These 7 Chip Industry Leaders To Your Portfolio?Stock Market Today III: Why You Could Hold These 7 Dow-30 Stocks Longer For NowHow To Invest: First, Know The General Market Direction Via The Big PictureWhat To Buy: These Stocks Are Near The Proper Buy Zone

1105,NOV,"The bullish sentiment following OPEC's deal is almost all gone.Hedge funds haven't been so skeptical on rising West Texas Intermediate crude prices since Nov. 29, the day before the cartel agreed to cut output, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. Their net-long position, or the difference between bets on a price increase and wagers on a decline, has dropped 37% from a record touched last month as American crude production climbed, sending inventories to an all-time high.""Things trend, and sentiment from the hedge funds has turned bearish,"" Mike Wittner, head of commodities research at Societe Generale SA in New York, said by telephone. ""People rushed into the market and their patience ran out, so they ran for the exits. They need a strong signal, and that will be U.S. stockpile draws, probably a few in a row, before they return.""The net-long position on WTI dropped 9.8% in the week ended March 21, following a record decline in the previous week, according to the CFTC. WTI slipped 0.8% to $47.34 a barrel in the report week, and closed at $47.73 on Monday.""This is a market that's very much on the defensive,"" Tim Evans, an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York, said by telephone. ""Although net length is greatly reduced, money managers still have a lot of net length. They still remain vulnerable to further price declines.""The agreement between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and 11 non-OPEC producers to cut output for six months starting Jan. 1 helped spur a wave of buying. That optimism has crumbled with the resurgence of U.S. drilling rigs and mounting stockpiles in the world's biggest crude consumer.U.S. crude stockpiles rose to 533.1 million barrels in the week ended March 17, the highest in weekly data going back to 1982, according to Energy Information Administration data. Production climbed to 9.13 million barrels a day, the highest since February 2016. The nation's active oil- rig count has more than doubled since May to 652 last week, according to Baker Hughes Inc.""The whole market is fixated on U.S. inventories,"" Rob Thummel, a managing director and portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC who helps manage $17.2 billion, said in an interview. ""We should start to see them fall as early as early April. When we see that, prices will move back into the $50s.""The net-long position fell by 28,197 futures and options to 260,577. Longs slipped 4%, while shorts advanced 13%.Speculators' wagers on Brent crude, the international benchmark traded in London, also fell. Their net-long position dropped by 4,288 contracts to 401,698, data from ICE Futures Europe showed.Part of the glut in U.S. stockpiles stems from a surge in imports last month. Arrivals into the country reached the highest level in more than four years in the week ended Feb. 3 as barrels that were pumped before OPEC and its partners made cuts arrived at U.S. ports. These shipments will probably slip in the weeks ahead, according to Thummel.""Lower OPEC imports and the ending of refinery maintenance will reduce inventories eventually,"" Thummel said.U.S. refineries typically increase activity in April as they finish maintenance before the summer peak driving season. Crude processing volumes have increased in the second quarter in each year in EIA data going back to 1989.""Rising inventories are temporary headwinds,"" Mark Watkins, the Park City, Utah-based regional investment manager for the Private Client Group at U.S. Bank, which oversees $136 billion in assets, said by telephone. ""We're anticipating strong future demand growth, and with the summer driving season inventories will start to decline.""RELATED:How Are Energy Groups Doing In IBD's 197 Industry Sub-Group Rankings Today?

1106,NOV,"Red Hat (RHT) reported fiscal fourth-quarter revenue that topped estimates and in-line earnings, plus it forecast current quarter and full-year fiscal 2018 revenue above expectations.Red Hat forecast current quarter profit, however, that was below estimates.Still, shares in the No. 1 provider of open-source Linux software for corporate data centers jumped in after-hours trading on Monday.Analysts were looking for traction in Red Hat's public cloud business as customers shift computing workloads to cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN) and a Red Hat partner.Red Hat, similar to Dow component Microsoft (MSFT) and VMware (VMW), has aimed to leverage its existing customer base as cloud computing gains momentum. More companies are outsourcing business workloads to cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services.Fiscal Q4 results:  Red Hat said earnings rose 17% to 61 cents with revenue climbing 16% to $629 million.Fiscal Q1 and full-year 2018 guidance: Red Hat said it expects fiscal first-quarter revenue of $646.5 million at its mid-point of guidance and unadjusted earnings in a range of 52 to 53 cents a share. For all of fiscal 2018, Red Hat forecast revenue of $2.74 billion and earnings of $2.62 a share vs. consensus estimates of $2.7 billion and $2.59.Wall Street fiscal Q4 estimates: Analysts projected adjusted earnings of 61 cents a share, up 17% from the year-earlier quarter, with revenue rising 13.8% to 618.7 million. In the current quarter, analysts estimated earnings of 59 cents vs. 50 cents in the year-earlier period and 13% revenue growth to $642 million.Fiscal Q3 results: Red Hat on Dec. 21 reported revenue that was below expectations and forecast fourth-quarter revenue well below consensus estimates, sending shares plummeting. Red Hat said adjusted earnings rose 27% to 61 cents a share from the year-earlier quarter, topping views of 58 cents. Revenue for the quarter ended Nov. 30 rose 17% to $615 million, missing consensus estimates of $621.7 million.Stock: Red Hat stock jumped 4.5% to 85.90 in late trading in the stock market today. In Monday's regular session, shares dipped nearly 1% to 82.19. Red Hat stock has bounced back from the late December sell-off, rising nearly 19% in 2017 and moving above its 50-day moving average. The stock hit a high of 84.86 on Feb. 24, clearing a buy point of 82.83, and has been consolidating.Red Hat has the second highest Composite Rating, a CAN SLIM investing metric, of the eight companies in IBD's Computer Software-Desktop group. Adobe Systems (ADBE)  has a composite rating of 96 out of a possible 99, while Red Hat's composite rating is 93.

1107,NOV,"Stocks are showing an impressive rebound after Monday's opening sell-off, with the Nasdaq composite turning a near 1% loss into a 0.2% gain.The Nasdaq 100, reflecting resilience in large- and megacap techs, rose 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average is turning a drop of nearly 1% into a loss of just 0.2% after falling more than 1% last week.Early Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average briefly clipped its 50-day moving average for the first time since it fell to the south side of the key support and resistance line Sept. 9. Back then, it took nearly two months for the 30-stock Dow to rebound back above the 50-day line.Helping the Dow were DuPont (DD), which was the sole component to rise 1 point or more. At 80.66, the diversified manufacturer is a legitimate leader in the stock market today, up 9.9% since Jan. 1. Shares also are up by 13% from a recent breakout on Nov. 30, past a 71.19 flat-base buy point.The S&P 500 was down less than 0.2%.IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards: View The Winners By CategoryAmong new issues, Snap (SNAP) is getting plenty of attention on the back of positive comments from analysts and new buy ratings. Shares strode more than 6% higher to 24.18, possibly setting up its highest close in more than two weeks.On its market debut, the Snapchat social media site operator leapt past its 17-per-share IPO to finish at 24.48, then catapulted another 20% to as high as 29.44 before coming down to earth. Over the next 10 sessions, Snap slid 36% to a low of 18.90. In a normal cup or double-bottom base, the decline usually runs no more than 33% to 35% from high to low — based on IBD's research of big winners over the past 22 bull- and bear-market cycles. So, in Snap's case, the decline is on the heavy side, especially given the fact that the gain from the 17-per-share IPO did not exceed 100% or more.Despite recent positive Wall Street comments, Snap is on course to lose money in 2017 (consensus estimate of a net loss of 45 cents a share) and 2018 (-$0.32).Still, the stock deserves a close watch if the rebound continues and the stock gets to within 5% to 15% of its 29.44 peak.In most excellent cup-with-handle patterns, a stock tends to form the handle — the last final shakeout of uncommitted holders before a big breakout to new highs — while trading no more than 15% off its 52-week or all-time high.While the Trump-supported American Health Care Act never saw the light of day Friday, investors should continue to watch leading names in the medical and health care services industry groups. Celgene (CELG), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) were among the day's biggest point-winners.Celgene ranks No. 1 in the Big Cap 20; see the whole list in the latest IBD Weekly on page B19.The failure of the American Health Care Act, and future changes in former President Obama's Affordable Care Act, are unlikely to suppress demand for superior medicines to treat patients with deadly diseases such as multiple myeloma. Celgene is No. 1 in that field, and also is becoming a force in the treatment of chronic illnesses such as psoriasis.Celgene gets a wonderful 98 EPS Rating from IBD Stock Checkup due to its consistent pattern of long-term profit increases and solid gains in the short term as well. Over the past six quarters, earnings per share rose 27%, 17%, 23%, 17%, 28% and 36% vs. year-ago levels. That's an average EPS gain of 24.7%, which is outstanding for companies with market caps of $15 billion or higher.Celgene has a $96 billion market value and 775 million shares outstanding, which is large but not excessively so. As a point of comparison, Pfizer (PFE) has 5.95 billion shares outstanding.The Street sees fiscal year 2017 profit rising 22%, to $7.22 a share, on an 18% lift in revenue to $13.29 billion. Revenue rose 24%, 27% and 26% vs. year-ago levels in the prior three years.Intuitive, meanwhile, remains top of the hill in the field of robotic surgery systems. Wall Street sees earnings rising 12% to $4.93 a share in the current quarter, which would accelerate the 3% increase seen in Q4 2016.Sales are seen rising 13% to $670.2 million in Q1, up from 12% growth in Q4.Intuitive presented two buy points in 2017 so far. On Feb. 21, the stock spurted past a 72.35 cup-base entry in volume expanding nearly 40% above its 50-day average,  a sign of healthy demand by mutual funds, large investment advisers, pensions, insurers and the like. But go to a daily chart, and you'll also see a very narrow handle that formed from Jan. 26 to Feb. 1, creating a hard-to-see 700.52 early buy point.Add 10 cents to the highest price within any handle to obtain a handle entry point. Notice on a daily chart how the stock gapped up in huge volume on Jan. 25 in reaction to decent fourth-quarter results (EPS up 3%, revenue up 12%).Intuitive currently gets a solid 93 Composite Rating, better than Regeneron's 80 score. Watch to see if Regeneron musters the strength to rise back above the 50-day and 200-day lines, create some space above those key resistance lines, and earnest start forming the right side of a new base pattern.RELATED:How To Invest: Add The 10-Week-Line Pullback To Your Trading PlaybookHow To Invest: The Keys To A Great Cup-With-Handle BaseStock Market Today: Do These 7 Leading Chipmakers Deserve A Spot On Your Watch List?Inside IBD 50: What Do These 5 Big Winners Have In Common?Tech News At IBD: Why Snap Is Getting Some Love On Wall Street

1108,NOV,"Metal stocks crumpled Thursday, extending a sharp recent sell-off as weak manufacturing data out of China weighed on global demand for industrial metals, adding to weaker hopes that President Trump will enact pro-growth policies.BHP Billiton (BHP), the world's top mining company, shed about1% on the stock market today, falling intraday to its lowest since Oct. 13. Rio Tinto  (RIO), the second largest, gave up 0.8%, but found some support intraday at its 200-day moving average. Vale (VALE) tumbled 4.9%, also testing its 200-day line. Freeport McMoRan (FCX) lost 2.8% to its lowest in nearly six months. BHP, Rio Tinto, Vale and Freeport McMoRan all suffered significant losses on Wednesday.The Caixin China manufacturing PMI for April rang in at 50.3 vs. estimates of 51.3 and March's 51.2, Brendan Ahern, CIO of Krane Funds Advisors, wrote on Monday""Caixin, which tracks small and medium enterprises, followed the official PMI lower due to a tighter regulatory and monetary environment,"" he said. ""This was the weakest release in seven months.""Deleveraging has led to lower commodity prices, which affects the prices that make up purchasing managers' indexes, he added.Copper, a barometer of the global economy, shed 1.4% Thursday on the heels of a 3.5% tumble on the London Metal Exchange Wednesday, which took the base metal to its lowest level in almost two years. Iron prices saw huge losses in various exchanges.Among steel producers, U.S. Steel (X) was down 0.4% and Ternium (TX) lost 2.3%.United States Steel dived nearly 27% on April 26 to its lowest level since Nov. 4. Shares were hammered on the steel giant's big earnings miss and weak guidance.President Trump's Nov. 8 election win sparked a commodity and industrials rally.

1109,NOV,"Stocks opened Friday in tightly mixed formation, after April payrolls data topped expectations and investors looked toward Sunday's final-round presidential election in France.The Nasdaq composite rose 0.2% and the S&P 500 index 0.1%, while the Dow Jones industrial average futures was just below negative.Friday's session is substantial on a number of fronts. The economic headline for the day, the Labor Department's April payrolls report, blew past expectations but with some mixed details. Nonfarm employers hired 211,000 workers during the month, more than double the initial March estimate of 98,000 new hires and a giant step above economist projections for 185,000 new jobs. But the department also revised its March estimate downward, to 79,000 from 98,000.The unemployment rate dipped to 4.4%. Consensus views projected an increase to 4.6%. Average hourly earnings climbed 0.3%, up from 0.2% in March and in line with estimates.Markets also are bracing for the final round of France's presidential election, set for Sunday, which could determine the future of the European Union.

Earnings were hurt by distributor terminations as the company continues the integration in its partnership with Coca-Cola (KO).

Monster shares have been trading tightly below their 200-day moving average since March, but moved above the line Friday.Universal Display (OLED) sailed 18.5% higher, reporting first-quarter results after Thursday's close that trashed analyst targets.

A 200% earnings gain and a 13% rise in revenue topped expectations, and management boosted its second-quarter earnings and revenue guidance past views. The stock is in the sixth week of a consolidation. Shares climbed back above the 50-day moving average Friday.Herbalife (HLF) rattled off an 8.5% gain. The diet supplement marketer's first-quarter earnings and revenue slipped less than forecast.

1110,NOV,"X The major indexes rose to a mixed close Thursday, as a successful health care reform vote in Congress outweighed the negative effects from a sharp dive in oil prices.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rebounded from midsession lows to grasp fractional gains at the closing bell. The Dow Jones industrial average fought a good fight, also rising from lows to end with the thinnest of losses. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 ending down 0.2%.A 217-213 vote in the House of Representatives moved the GOP health care reform bill — the American Health Care Act — through to the Senate, moving Congress closer to its pledged repeal of the Affordable Care Act.Oil prices clearly hindered the session, with West Texas Intermediate crude dropping nearly 5% to below $46 a barrel — its lowest price since Nov. 29. Oil-related stocks posted five of the S&P 500's 10 widest losses. Oil-related industries posted four of the session's five worst losses. Caterpillar (CAT), which has a high correlation to oil prices, tumbled 2.3% to the bottom of the Dow industrials, followed closely by Chevron (CVX), down 1.8%, and Exxon Mobil's (XOM) 1.3% decline.Among the stocks pounding out big gains on earnings, Railcar America (RAIL) spiked 23%, Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) soared 18%. Fitbit (FIT) rose 12% and fiber optic communication gear maker Lumentum Holdings (LITE) notched an 11% gain.Regeneron Phamaceuticals (REGN) was the top dog among S&P 500 stocks, springing up 7% despite reporting mixed Q1 results. But robust sales of its Eyelea treatment for macular degeneration cheered investors, sending the stock to less than 5% below a 453.06 buy point in a flat base. Aggressive investors may have charted an alternative buy point at 401.31.Animal health drugmaker Zoetis (ZTS) clawed out a 6% gain after delivering first quarter results above analyst targets. The move retook a 56.60 buy point in a three-month flat base.

Shares remain extended after an April rebound from the 10-week moving average.Tesla (TSLA) dropped 5%, erasing all but 3% of the stock's gain above a flat-base buy point of 287.49.

1112,NOV,"Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings Tuesday, sending shares of the Trump infrastructure play surging.Martin Marietta earned 67 cents per share on revenue of $791.7 million. Analysts expected the Raleigh, N.C., provider of construction materials to earn 66 cents a share, down from 69 cents a year ago. Revenue was seen slipping to $724.7 million from $734.0 million. Year-earlier results were lifted by weather delays in late 2015 that lumped more activity in the first quarter of 2016.Outlook: Martin Marietta maintained the same full-year guidance it offered in February: $3.75 billion to $3.95 billion in revenue and an EBITDA range of $1.05 billion to $1.13 billion.Stock: Shares of Martin Marietta shot up 7.6% to 239.85 on the stock market today, the highest since late January and approaching a 244.08 buy point. Vulcan Materials (VMC), which reports earnings on May 10, popped 4.1% to 128.45.IBD'S TAKE: Markets may no longer be banking on President Trump's trillion-dollar national building program, at least in the near term, but infrastructure investors are excited about big state spending plans.Prior to the report, shares of Martin Marietta have climbed back above their 50-day moving average. The shares initially vaulted into a buy zone on Nov. 9, after the surprise election of Donald Trump. A follow-on breakout attempt in late January, after the inauguration, failed. The stock drifted lower after disappointing first-quarter earnings and lack of progress on Trump's big infrastructure plans.On Monday, IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates group rose 2%, sixth best among 197 industry groups. President Trump's comments that he would support a gas tax to fund infrastructure investment likely contributed to the gain. Summit Materials (SUM) hit a nearly two-year high on Monday.Monday's gains came despite news that a five-month budget deal in Congress won't include any funding for Trump's border wall, once seen as a potential boon to cement makers with facilities near the border.Martin Marietta noted that it saw ""broad-based pricing improvements"" across its aggregates product line, led by the Southeast group's 10.3% increase. The company's revenue gain was padded by acquisitions that added $27 million, with modest margin contribution. Management noted that it ramped up investment in the quarter on operations and staffing, adding that the investment should result in better operating leverage as growth continues.RELATED: Stock Futures: These 10 Big-Cap Earnings Are On Tap TuesdayHere's Why U.S. Concrete Shares Sank Like A StoneMartin Marietta 'Encouraged' By Trump Infrastructure Talk, But Earnings, Guidance Light

1113,NOV,"The banking and financial sector ETFs — which for four months were the backbone of index investing — crumpled in a sudden sell-off Tuesday. What's next?For these nine exchange traded funds in IBD's ETF Leaders screen, the wounds are deep. All nine plunged below their 50-day moving averages in heavy volume. That marked a break of support and a likely change in direction to the downside.For how long? That's impossible to know, but the severity of the selling suggests a recovery won't come soon.Shares stabilized after Tuesday's tumble but so far are not rebounding. Most of the ETFs wiped out all gains since they climbed to new highs in mid-February. Because the financial ETFs slid below a key support level, the implication is that they are going through a consolidation period that may take at least several weeks. Had funds found support at the 50-day lines, there would be more reason to believe a brief pullback was occurring.All nine ETFs have crafted similar-looking charts, and none showed any problems ahead of Tuesday's collapse. Since peaking at the start of March, shares had been in a measured decline and holding above the 50-day line.First Trust Nasdaq ABA Community Bank (QABA) behaved a bit differently than the others. It started trading below its 50-day line on March 8, earlier than the rest. The ETF — which ensures a small-bank portfolio by excluding the 50 largest banks — had been consolidating since mid-December and never broke out to new highs. The earlier weakness foreshadowed First Trust Community Bank's woes: The ETF is down more than most of its peers, about 10% from the 52-week high.SPDR Financial (XLF), Fidelity MSCI Financials Index (FNCL), Vanguard Financials (VFH), iShares U.S. Financials Services (IYG) — funds that are more broad than the pure-play banking ETFs — came out of the rout in relatively better shape, down about 6% from prior highs.PowerShares KBW Regional Banking Portfolio (KBWB), SPDR S&P Bank (KBE), SPDR S&P Regional Bank (KRE) and iShares U.S. Regional Banks (IAT) — the other funds weighted toward regional banks — lost about 10% in the sell-off.Banks small and large rallied after the Nov. 8 election on hopes that Republicans would roll back regulations, notably the Dodd-Frank legislation. But signs the past week that health care reform was stalling caused Wall Street to think other parts of President Trump's agenda face higher hurdles than first thought.RELATED:What Is Sending Oil And Gold ETFs In Opposite Directions As Dollar FallsNext-Gen ETFs For Rising Rates Offer High Yields And Low Volatility

1114,NOV,"Tense, late-stage maneuvering at the White House and the Capitol kept markets on edge straight to Friday's close, with major indexes ending mixed and the Dow Jones industrial average chalking up its worst week since the Nov. 8 presidential election.The Dow lost 0.3% Friday and 1.3% for the week. Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) took what were far-and-away the Dow's worst losses for the week, down 6.5% and 4%, respectively.Also in the Dow 30, Apple (AAPL) and McDonald's (MCD) each managed modest gains for the week and Nike (NKE), which on Wednesday dived more than 7% after a weak earnings report, on Friday trimmed its decline for the week to less than 3%.The S&P 500 sagged 0.1%, ending the week with a 1.3% loss — also its worst week since just before the election. Heavy engineering, steel and suppliers of construction materials took the S&P 500's heaviest hits on Friday. Vulcan Materials (VMC), Martin Marietta (MLM), Fluor (FLR) and Nucor (NUE) each dumped more than 2% in Friday's session. It's well-worth noting that all of those losses occurred in light trade.Micron Technology (MU) and Under Armour (UA) pegged the S&P 500's best gains.Micron spiked 7% as earnings rose to 90 cents a share, up from a penny in the year-ago quarter. Revenue soared 58%. But the industry took particular heart in Micron's Q3 outlook, which placed the midpoint of earnings guidance 61% above consensus views. Micron shares ended the week up 11% and at a new high, extended from a February rebound from 10-week support.Under Armour popped 4% following an upgrade to buy, from hold, by Jefferies. The stock suffered a 63% sell-off over the past 11 months, but the Jefferies note diagnosed the correction as having formed a bottom and, given market circumstances, ""an inflection has formed and the buying (opportunity) is now."" CAN SLIM investors can minimize risk by waiting for a proper base to form.The Nasdaq composite held its loss Friday to less than 0.1%, ending off 1.2% in its sharpest weekly slip since December. Micron topped the Nasdaq 100, with Western Digital (WDC), Tesla (TSLA), Cerner (CERN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) all advancing 2% or more.Tesla chairman Elon Musk teased investors with tweets revealing new details regarding the company's upcoming Model 3, and more distant Model Y and Roadster vehicles. Tesla shares are five weeks into a consolidation — holding nice support at the stock's 10-week moving average, but it's slightly too deep to qualify as a flat base.Among IBD 50 stocks, China's TAL Education Group (TAL) jumped 3% Friday in its eighth straight daily advance. Shares are taking out new highs and are well-extended above a three-weeks-tight buy point of 83.97.BioTelemetry (BEAT) also gained 2%, narrowing its loss for the week to less than 3%. The stock bounced off its 10-week moving average on Thursday, but week volume nullified the move as a buying opportunity.RELATED:ObamaCare Repeal Vote Failure Threatens Tax Cuts — And Stock RallyChip Gear Makers Rise On Upbeat Micron OutlookStock Market Today: Do These 6 Chip Names Have A Shot At Big Gains In 2017?

1116,NOV,"Stocks opened higher Friday, as investors monitored an increasingly tense health care bill standoff in Washington.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.1%, the S&P 500 added 0.2% and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.5%.GOP lawmakers delayed a scheduled Thursday night vote on their American Health Care Act, intended to revoke and replace ObamaCare. Lack of support for the bill led President Trump to urge the vote be pushed to Friday, and White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney informed congressional leaders that the president had finished negotiating. He said if Congress was unable to pass the bill Friday, the White House would move on to other issues.How markets will react remains uncertain. The Dow industrial average ended Thursday down 1.2% for the week and tacking toward the index's worst performance since the week just prior to the Nov. 8 presidential election. The S&P 500 was down 1.4%, also looking at its worst weekly showing since the week before the election. The Nasdaq was down 1.4% — it suffered harder hits during two separate weeks in December.All three indexes are near their 50-day moving averages, which suggests a positive session could bring support at that technical level. A tumble below that moving average, particularly in heavy trade, would suggest a loss of support.Intel (INTC), DuPont (DD) and Untied Technologies (UTX)were modestly higher on the Dow industrials.Key tech names: Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) all traded 0.3% to 0.4% higher at the open.Micron Technology (MU) fired off an 11% gain after a huge jump in fiscal second-quarter earnings beat analyst forecasts, and revenue rose 58% to meet views. Management's third-quarter guidance was far above the consensus target. Micron shares are extended after an early March rebound from support at their 10-week moving average.Under Armour (UA) gained 3% at the open, boosted by an upgrade to buy from hold from Jefferies. Shares have been in a steep sell-off for 11 months.Western Digital (WDC) climbed 6%. The diversifying computer storage play climbed back above the 50-day moving average and is working on a flat base.Retailers GameStop (GME) and Finish Line (FINL) posted two of the deepest early losses after reporting fourth-quarter results late Thursday.Video game chain GameStop tanked by 11% as a flat earnings report met expectations and revenue fell 14%, further than expected. Finish Line tumbled 16% on a wide earnings miss. Both stocks are in deep corrections.New orders for durable goods rose 1.7% in February, the Commerce Department estimated, down from January's 1.8% increase, but above consensus views for a 1.5% gain.

1117,NOV,"Oil closed at the lowest level since November, erasing the gains that followed OPEC's deal to cut output, as U.S. crude supplies are forecast to climb.Futures dropped 1.8% in New York, erasing an early gain, while the S&P 500 Index fell the most in five months, as investors assessed the prospects for Donald Trump's pro-growth policies gaining congressional approval.The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute was said to have reported that U.S. supplies rose last week. Government data Wednesday will probably show stockpiles climbed to a record, a Bloomberg survey showed. Prices increased earlier amid speculation OPEC may extend its supply-cut deal past June.""There's a generalized sell-off here,"" Bill O'Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, said by telephone. ""Oil has been tracking the S&P 500 pretty closely, and of course has its own issues. General expectations about what Donald Trump would do for growth helped both oil and stocks. Those are fading fast.""Oil dipped below $50 a barrel this month for the first time in 2017 as record U.S. stockpiles and rising output weighed on the reductions by OPEC and its allies. While the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries won't decide until May whether to prolong the cuts, ministers and officials from outside the group, including Russia's Alexander Novak, will meet this weekend in Kuwait to discuss the deal's progress.West Texas Intermediate for April delivery, which expired Tuesday, dropped 88 cents to $47.34 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

House Republicans warned that a failure to pass a health care bill could imperil tax and spending reform.""The catalyst is concern over demand due to potential difficulties with President Trump getting his pro-growth agenda through,"" Bart Melek, the head of global commodity strategy at TD Securities in Toronto, said by phone.U.S. crude inventories eased off the highest level in more than three decades in the week ended March 10, dipping to 528.2 million barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a 3 million-barrel increase for the week ended March 17, which would take supplies to a new high.Nationwide crude stockpiles rose 4.53 million barrels last week, the API said, according to people familiar with the data. Supplies at Cushing, Okla., the delivery point for WTI and the biggest U.S. oil-storage hub, rose 1.97 million barrels. If the EIA reports a Cushing gain of the same size it would leave stockpiles at a record high.WTI is nearing key technical resistance levels, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 50% Fibonacci retracement from the August low of $39.19 to the January high of $55.24 stands at $47.22. The 38% retracement of rally is $45.32. Investors typically sell contracts when prices dropped below technical support.""This is a do-or-die time for the oil bulls,"" Stephen Schork, president of Schork Group, a consulting company in Villanova, Pa., said by telephone.

1118,NOV,"Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) regained recent buy points in the latest week following post-earnings sell-offs. But these two tech titans' stock charts raise some warning flags.Alphabet broke out of a cup-with-handle base with an 824.40 buy point on Jan. 6. Volume was only average. You want to see heavy buying on the breakout, a sign that mutual funds and other big institutions are adding shares. Still, the Google parent consolidated just above the buy point for two weeks, when it pushed to record highs ahead of earnings.Alphabet's earnings were significantly below analyst forecasts. The next day, the stock initially rose to a fresh high of 867, but reversed in above-average volume. Several more active-trading sell-offs continued, undercutting the buy point. Alphabet did find support at its 50-day moving average. The 824.40 buy point is still valid.Alphabet rose 0.5% to 838.96 on the stock market today, its eighth straight advance Monday, but mostly small moves on light volume. Alphabet's ""D"" Accumulation/Distribution Rating also suggests big institutions aren't rushing to buy GOOGL shares.Alphabet's relative strength rating is 51 out of 99, which means the stock outperforms just 51% of all other stocks. Its relative strength line (the blue line in the chart below), which tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500, is off recent and long-term highs.Amazon cleared an 821.75 cup-with-handle entry point on Jan. 24. Volume was below normal, and was only so-so in the following two trading sessions.Amazon reported weaker-than-expected sales and guidance late on Feb. 2. Amazon Web Services, the e-commerce giant's huge cloud-computing unit, reported a 47% revenue gain, but that was less than views and down from Q3's 55% advance.IBD'S TAKE: It's the undisputed king of e-commerce, but can Amazon succeed in brick-and mortar retail?On Feb. 3, Amazon shares gapped down, closing off 3.5%, below the buy point. Shares rallied for the last four sessions, closing back above the buy point on Friday. But the gains were on increasingly below-average volume, with Friday's trade the weakest for an up day since the post-Thanksgiving half-session on Nov. 25.Amazon rose 1.1% to 836.53 Monday  on about average volume.Amazon's RS rating is a decent-but-unspectacular 73. Its RS line is well off its October peak.Alphabet and Amazon shares may overcome these problems and deliver solid gains. But investors may want to look at other stocks, perhaps less well-known, that have fewer chart flaws.RELATED:

1119,NOV,"Semiconductor and display equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT) received a couple of price target hikes on Monday, ahead of the company's fiscal first-quarter earnings report, due after the market close Wednesday.The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is seen posting its fourth straight quarter of accelerating sales and earnings-per-share growth when it delivers Q1 results.Applied Materials is expected to earn 66 cents a share excluding items, up 154% year over year, on sales of $3.27 billion, up 45%, in the quarter ended Jan. 29.For the current quarter, its fiscal Q2, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Applied to earn 63 cents a share ex items, up 85%, on sales of $3.26 billion, up 33%.IBD'S TAKE: Applied Materials stock has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. It is ranked No. 11 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.Applied Materials stock rose 0.4% to 35.46 on the stock market today. It broke out of a cup base with a buy point of 31.17 on Nov. 18. It climbed to a more than 16-year high of 35.85 on Thursday. It was two cents shy of that high in intraday trading Monday.Stifel reiterated its buy rating on Applied and raised its price target to 42 from 37.Cowen maintained its outperform rating and hiked its price target to 40 from 33.Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri expects Applied to see strong sales of equipment for making 3D Nand memory chips, 10-nanometer chips and displays.Needham analyst Edwin Mok reiterated his buy rating and price target of 40 on Applied Materials on Monday. However, the company will need to address investor fear of a falloff in sales in the second half of 2017, Mok said in a report.""We expect management to calm concerns over sustainability of business level,"" Mok said. ""Potential softness in second-half calendar 2017 remains the No. 1 investor concern for the group and AMAT.""Applied Materials Chief Financial Officer Bob Halliday told IBD Dec. 20 that the chip equipment sector ""is less volatile than it used to be.""Cyclicality ""has diminished a lot,"" he said.Sustained strong sales of chip manufacturing gear are being driven by several factors, Halliday said. Those factors include more semiconductor content in existing products such as smartphones and new applications for chips (including self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality).Also, consolidation among chip manufacturers has led to a more demand-driven business and more prudent production decisions, Halliday said.Plus, new technologies such as the shift to 3D chips from planar, or flat, chips has increased opportunities for vendors like Applied Materials, he said.And the move to OLED displays from the traditional LCD screens for smartphones has been a boon for Applied Materials and other equipment suppliers, Halliday said.""Those OLED displays take three times as much equipment to manufacture,"" he said.RELATED:Chip Gear Maker Applied Materials Gets Price-Target HikeBrooks Automation, Ultratech Lead Chip Gear Sector Higher

1120,NOV,"The Dow Jones industrial average continued to reaffirm that ""Dow 20,000"" is just another signpost in its Trump Bump of solid advances since the Nov. 8 elections.The 30-stock collection of large and megacap blue chip stocks led the major indexes with a gain of 0.8% to 20,434. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.6%.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) continued to show why it could be the top dog of the Dow in 2017 as the iPhone, iPad and iTunes media giant added more than 1%, to 133.69, hoisting its overall gain from a Sept. 14 breakout to 21%, out of a bottoming base pattern at 110.33.A number of Apple supplier plays continued to show fortitude. Lumentum (LITE), which reportedly may have a big components supply deal with Apple's future iPhone 8 model, surged for a fifth straight session, rising more than 4% on Monday to 49.60.The optical communications parts maker is well extended past a 44.80 buy point in an eight-week cup pattern that stands right next to an earlier cup base. An alternative entry is at 45.35.InterDigital (IDCC), the mobile technology patent holder that in December signed new licensing deals with Apple, rose more than 2% to 99.20, rolling past a 98.10 flat-base entry in heavy turnover. Earlier in the session, InterDigital got as high as 102.05, 4% above the proper entry point. InterDigital's 50-day average volume is 353,000 shares, which sounds low, but its dollar volume is ample at more than $35 million. Watch to see if it can close above the 98.10 proper entry, and how the final volume fares.Broadcom (AVGO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), fellow chipmakers who also supply products to Apple, continued to act well following their moves past buy points of 179.52 and 82.37, respectively. Skyworks also has crafted a three-weeks-tight pattern with a 94.59 follow-on entry.Skyworks is up 0.5% to 92.64 in light turnover. In a strong market uptrend, use the 3-weeks-tight pattern as an opportunity to add a small amount of shares to a winning position. Wait for the stock to burst past that buy point, ideally in heavy volume.IBD's Stock Market Today column on Sept. 14 of last year covered Apple's breakout from the cup with handle on the day of that significant game-changing move for the megacap tech, which is now valued by the market at $701 billion.Going back to the Dow Jones industrials, after much media hype, the popular benchmark eclipsed the 20,000 barrier on Jan. 25, then quickly got yanked back below the psychologically significant price level.However, the decline below 20,000 was brief and shallow. The Dow fell to as low as 19,784 by Jan. 31, a drop of just 1%, before settling down and resuming its rally.Notice on a daily chart how the Dow continues to trade above its rising 50-day moving average (currently 18,616), a sign of strength. Elsewhere in the stock market today, Nvidia (NVDA) triggered a short-sale entry by falling more than 7% below a recent later-stage cup without handle at 120.03. Shares dropped more than 4% to 108.43, more than 8% below that 120.03 entry.Volume has hit 24 million shares, already 27% above its 50-day moving average of 18.8 million shares.However, notice how the stock is still well above its 50-day moving average (currently near 108.41), making it a risky short sale. Why?IBD's studies of former big winners show that a stock that is breaking down after a huge run-up tends to cross below the 50-day moving average in big volume, then show further declines.

1122,NOV,"For the first time since Wall Street began to focus on the GOP's border-tax plan, retailers joined the rest of the stock market in a broad rally on Thursday, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite to record highs.After a strong day for retail on Wednesday, Dow component Wal-Mart (WMT) shares rose another 1.9% to 69.08 on Thursday, the highest close in more than a month. Dollar Tree (DLTR) surged 3.6%, Gap (GPS) added 2.8%, and Costco (COST) rose 2.6% to an all-time closing high. Dollar General (DG) raced ahead 3.5% to its highest close since Nov. 30 as its former CEO, Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., made waves with his forceful opposition to the border-tax plan. (Wal-Mart retreated 1.5% on Friday as retailers were mixed overall).Meanwhile, fell Dow component Nike (NKE) shares sprinted 2.7% Thursday, retaking its 200-day moving average for the first time since August. Nike added 1.7% on the stock market today to a fresh four-month high. As ex-CEO at Nike rival Reebok, Perdue also must be looking at the border-tax debate from the view of the footwear industry that does most of its manufacturing overseas.Yet even as hopes dimmed for the GOP House plan that would cut the corporate tax rate to 20%, funded by a 20% tax on imports, the broad market charged higher on the back of President Trump's comments to airline executives that he'll be announcing a ""phenomenal"" tax plan in the next two or three weeks.Goldman Sachs (GS) helped the Dow claim new heights, rising 1.6% Thursday and 0.5% Friday. Tesla (TSLA) cruised ahead 2.7% Thursday, as it breaks out of a long base, holding its gains Friday.Steel stocks were especially strong Thursday, with U.S. Steel (X) up 8.3%, Steel Dynamics (STLD) 5.7% and Nucor (NUE) 4.6%. All three stocks rose fractionally Friday.Yet assuming Perdue stands firm, the GOP can only afford to lose one more senator to keep the border tax alive. And Perdue didn't appear to leave much wiggle room to reverse his opinion: ""The clear effect of the proposed border adjust tax is an increase in consumer prices,"" he wrote in a letter to colleagues. ""This would hammer consumer confidence and lower overall demand, thus putting downward pressure on jobs.""IBD'S TAKE: Supporters of the border tax plan say that the dollar would rise by 20% vs. other currencies, meaning that it wouldn't harm either corporate profits or consumers. But it does pose a risk to U.S. investors holding shares of companies like Alibaba or international ETFs.The retail stock revival and record high for the major averages raise this question: If the border tax isn't going anywhere, what does Trump have up his sleeve? If the border tax dies, Wall Street analysts have largely concluded that corporate tax cuts would have to be scaled back in a big way to make it through reconciliation, a legislative maneuver that means the GOP can pass tax cuts with only a majority vote if the package is revenue neutral in year 11 and beyond.Without a border tax, some think the effort to cut corporate taxes could collapse. At best, the corporate tax rate might be cut to 25%, but even that might be out of reach.Yet a closer look suggests that investors didn't really get carried away with Trump's mystery tax plan. Even though advancing stocks led declines by roughly 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange, Raymond James strategist Jeffrey Saut noted that the percentage of volume going into advance stocks ""was among the lowest in history"" on days when the S&P 500 has hit a 52-week high and closed positive on the day.RELATED:If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May CollapseWhy Tax Reform Could End In Tears For Trump And GOP

1124,NOV,"XInvestors brushed off concerns of a slowdown in consumer prices and most key indexes gained on Monday. But the Dow Jones industrial average edged 0.1% lower on the back of 1-point drops or more by at least 4 of the Dow industrials' 30 components.The Nasdaq composite led the rally, rising 0.7% for the day, while the S&P 500 rose nearly 0.2%. Volume fell on both main exchanges, according to preliminary data.The Dow Jones transports slipped 0.3%.Last week, the S&P 500 large-cap benchmark rallied 1.5%, on top of a nearly 0.9% lift in the prior week. The Nasdaq had risen more than 4% over the prior two weeks, a clear signal that money continued to flow in the technology sector.In a heavy day for economic data, even bond investors didn't seem overly concerned about a surprise 0.1% dip in the March PCE prices gauge, excluding volatile energy and food prices, the first month-on-month drop since September 2001, according to Reuters. Plus, in the 12 months through March, the PCE index was up just 1.6%, vs. up 1.8% through February.The Federal Reserve has made it widely known that it wants to see inflation hitting at least 2% before taking more steps at reducing liquidity from the banking system. On Monday, meanwhile, investors sold U.S. government bonds hard; the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond inched up to 2.32%. The spread between the 2- and 10-year yields have slimmed a tad over the past 30 days.The interest-rate-sensitive Dow Jones utility average fell nearly 0.7%.Back to equities, looking at IBD's rankings of 197 industry groups, four of the top 10 groups come from the telecom and tech sectors (wireless services, semiconductor equipment, computer networking and computer data storage).Other top groups within the top 20 included the gaming group, which has vaulted from No. 80 to No. 13 over the past six weeks. Restaurants have jumped from No. 82 to No. 17 over the same time frame, while the lodging group has risen from No. 70 to No. 14.Among the four tech groups mentioned above, these names have stood out.Brooks Automation (BRKS) was up more than 5%, to 26.76, in heavy volume. The expert in automation and cryogenic systems for chipmakers and life sciences companies is extended sharply after a successful rebound off the 10-week moving average, near 16.90, in late January.Brooks also has been highlighted in the IBD Stock Spotlight.Western Digital (WDC) was down 1% to 87.97. The stock probed 52-week highs on Friday and has overall done well since it burst past an 81.77 flat-base buy point March 30. The stock is up almost 30% year to date, and harbors an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. Watch to see if Western Digital, thriving after its acquisition of SanDisk, eases back within the 5% buy zone from the 81.77 entry, or up to 85.85. At the moment, it is too far up from the buy point to be considered for purchase.Western gets a superb 99 Composite, the maximum allowed, from IBD Stock Checkup, as well as an A for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity) Rating on a scale of A to E.Lam Research (LRCX) was up nearly 3% to a new high of 148.85. Shares are extended and it could be weeks before another entry develops. EPS growth in Q1 accelerated to 137%, up from gains of 20%, 0% and 43% in the prior three quarters, as sales rose 64%.Lam has been a fixture on the IBD Big Cap 20 (see the Stock Lists section on Investors.com) for several months, and currently ranks in the top 10 within the IBD 50.Other chip equipment names with outstanding Composite Ratings and excellent stock price action include ASML Holding (ASML) (broke out past an 110.24 early entry in late December, 2nd test of the 10-week moving average), and Applied Materials (AMAT), part of IBD Big Cap 20.Also in the group, Cabot Microelectronics (CCMP) is trading at new highs. But its recent pullback has produced a faulty cup base that falls short of the six-week minimum. Notice on a weekly chart how Cabot has gone two weeks down, then two weeks up into new high ground.At the same time, the 9.3% drop within the narrow consolidation was perhaps not enough to justify the V-shape-like action as an outright sell signal.Cabot faces a tough comp in fiscal Q3 earnings as profit grew 103% in the year-ago quarter that ended in June. Q3 profit this year is seen rising 5% to 83 cents a share.Among the fast-rising nontechnology groups:Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) was up more than 1% to 479.29 as it made a rebound off Monday's session low. The stock has climbed sharply in recent weeks, and last week the taco-and-burrito chain marked a solid Q1 rebound in profit ($1.60 a share on an adjusted basis) and revenue ($1.07 billion, up 28%, the largest gain in 10 quarters).The strong top-line result indicated that Chipotle is winning back trust among its customers. In Q1, the Denver-based firm, with founder Steve Ells now back as sole CEO, added 57 new shops while closing 15 ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen restaurants and one Chipotle restaurant. Total restaurant count on March 31 reached 2,291.Operating margin at the restaurant level jumped to 17.7% from 6.8%, but that's still off from the 20% to 30% levels seen in prior years.Chipotle arguably broke out of a first-stage bottoming-base pattern at 434.79 at the end of March and also is extended.The Denver-based fast-casual dining pioneer sports a decent 77 RS Rating; other high-quality companies in IBD's Retail-Restaurants group with even better RS Ratings are Dave & Buster's (PLAY) at 83; Restaurant Brands (QSR) at 84; and Yum China (YUMC) at 87. Yum China, a spinoff from the KFC and Pizza Hut giant Yum Brands (YUM), has rallied 17% past a 29.45 aggressive entry within a four-month IPO base.Shares went public on Nov. 1 and ended their first trading session on the NYSE at 26.19.The Street expects earnings to grow 17% this year to $1.41 a share and 11% the next.RELATED:Stock Spotlight: The Secret Ingredient Behind These 5 Stocks' Big Moves UpHow To Invest: The Latest From IBD's Investor's CornerWhen Will Commodities Rebound?

1127,NOV,"XStocks thundered to a second day of strong gains Tuesday as big-name earnings reports powered weighty moves across the market.The Dow Jones industrial average brought home a 1.1% gain, gaining some breathing room above its 50-day moving average and closing within 1% of its March 1 peak. The Nasdaq cleared the 6000 level, rising 0.7% to another fresh high. The S&P 500 climbed 0.6%, ending just below its March 1 high.Alcoa (AA) surged 9%. Miner Freeport McMoRan (FCX) rattled off a 6% gain. Whirlpool (WHR), Biogen (BIIB) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU) rose 4% apiece.Caterpillar (CAT) was a prime mover, powering up 8% — easily leading the Dow industrials and the S&P 500 — and pushing the stock's two-day gain to 11%, marking its best week since the Nov. 8 presidential election. The heavy-equipment maker reported a 100% gain in Q1 earnings and a 4% rise in revenue, its first revenue advance in ten quarters.The stock move cleared two buy points, a traditional flat-base entry of 99.46 and a more-aggressive entry of 97.99, leaving shares at their highest level since November 2014.Netflix (NFLX) streamed 6% higher to top the Nasdaq 100 on news that the company landed an agreement with iQiyi, owned by internet search giant Baidu (BIDU), to begin offering content in China. Chinese regulators have barred Netflix from offering content directly to consumers in the country. Netflix also announced Monday it would issue a $1.08 billion bond offering to investors outside the U.S. to fund new content and strategic acquisitions. The gain sent Netflix shares past a 148.39 buy point in a three-weeks tight pattern. Baidu shares rose 4% Tuesday, to just below a cup-base buy point of 188.64. Earnings from Baidu are due Thursday after the close.Steel alloys specialist Allegheny Technologies (ATI) forged a 10% gain after reporting that earnings growth accelerated to 128% and revenue popped 14% in the first quarter. Shares ended the session up 16% so far this week, beginning up the right side of a three-month consolidation.On the downside, weak quarterly results sent Ryder Systems (R) down 13% and ExpressScripts (ESRX) to an 11% loss.Verizon (VZ) marked the Dow's worst loss, down 0.6% after news reports said Verizon offered $1.8 billion for Straight Path Communications (STRP), outsizing AT&T's (T) earlier $1.6 billion offer. Straight Path bolted 15% higher. AT&T eased 0.2%.Earnings reports scheduled after the close include  AT&T, Exxon Mobil (XOM), Illumina (ILMN), Cree (CREE) and Macon Technology Solutions (MTSI), among many others.RELATED:Caterpillar Breaks Out, Steamrolls Earnings EstimatesNetflix Enters China - And A New Buy Zone

1129,NOV,"Major indexes padded their recent gains Friday and the Dow Jones industrial average looked poised to add nearly 1% for the week. Equity investors continue to feel good about upcoming plans by President Trump to cut taxes.The Nasdaq composite, blue-chip Dow, S&P 500 and NYSE composite each captured gains of 0.4% to 0.5%. Small caps also rose in unison; the S&P SmallCap 600 and the Russell 2000 both hustled ahead 0.8%.At 2 p.m. ET, volume edged slightly up on the Nasdaq vs. the same time on Thursday but was down mildly on the NYSE.Nvidia (NVDA), however, sat out Friday's advance despite opening higher. After hitting as high as 120.85 in the early going, shares fell 1.3% to 114.91 in massive volume. The 50-day average turnover for Nvidia is 18.2 million shares, and already more than 32 million shares have changed hands.Friday's session certainly did not disappoint in terms of brand-new breakouts from high-quality growth companies.Activision Blizzard (ATVI) unleashed a torrent of buying as the stock gapped up to 45 at the open and jumped as high as 47.64, enough to trigger a breakout past a 45.65 cup-base buy point. Shares are now up more than 16% to 46.38.The 5% buy zone extends up to 47.93. The video game giant posted an 11% jump in fourth-quarter earnings to 92 cents a share, a smaller increase than gains of 44%, 315% and 152% in the prior three quarters. However, Q4 profit smashed Wall Street's consensus view by 26%.Revenue was grand, jumping 49% to $2.0 billion and smashing analysts' concerns over video game sales over the holiday quarter.Also in the stock market today, video game industry peer Electronic Arts (EA) also fired up a breakout, rising more than 3% to 86.11 and climbing past an 84.35 buy point within a nearly 19-week cup with handle.Web.com Group (WEB) raced more than 7% higher to 21.60, clearing a 21.30 buy point within a long, deep bottoming base pattern in volume running triple its 50-day average. The e-commerce support firm for small and medium businesses posted a third quarter in a row of big double-digit revenue gains as the top line grew 35% to $187.2 million in the fourth quarter.In a bottoming base, a stock can drop 40%, 50% or even more, hit bottom, then rally enough to form a base in which it stands a good chance of breaking out to 52-week highs. Web.com had peaked in early 2014 at 37.72 and dropped as much as 66% to a low of 12.90 on Nov. 4 before rebounding.Adjusted earnings was 4 cents a share, but fiscal 2017 earnings are seen vaulting 40% to $2.86 a share. Jacksonville, Fla.-based Web.com is a small cap with a $1.1 billion market value and trades just 361,000 shares a day.Returning to Nvidia, even the most experienced traders and investors may be enticed to sell Nvidia short. After all, it was the second biggest gainer in 2016, based on IBD's research of market winners that year (stocks had to trade a minimum $12 a share on Jan. 1, 2016).IBD's TAKE: The right time to sell stocks shorts is during a pronounced market downtrend. Use IBD's The Big Picture column each day to know signs that the market's general direction is changing. Also, the ""Short Selling"" section, found in the Research tab at Investors.com, includes numerous articles on how to time your short sales and improve your overall selling technique.However, Nvidia has not triggered any IBD-style short selling signals. The first sell signal is a failure from a late-stage base breakout. Nvidia's latest base is at least third stage, following a terrific cup with handle that finished in March and a finely crafted flat base that completed in mid-September.At this point, it would take an 8% decline from Nvidia's latest cup-without-handle buy point of 120.03, or 110.43, for a potential short sale entry to emerge. Second, Nvidia has in no way even begun to initiate a head and shoulders pattern, which normally takes five to seven months to construct and involves several attempts to rally back above its 50-day moving average.As seen in Nvidia's daily chart, the stock is still well above its fast-rising 50-day line, currently at 104.51. The head and shoulders is IBD's second classic pattern for shorting.Conclusion: Watch and wait.Nvidia's earnings estimates have taken an interesting turn. Wall Street now sees earnings falling 11% in fiscal 2018 (ending in January next year) to $2.71 a share. If the analysts are right, that would mark the first year-over-year profit drop since fiscal 2014, when earnings sank 15% to 99 cents a share.One reason for the expected decline: Earnings rose 104% in the October-ended fiscal third quarter and 117% in the latest quarter, making for very tough comparisons down the road. However, Nvidia apparently has done a masterful job of managing analysts' expectations as it crushed Wall Street views (by 45% in Q3, and 36% in Q4) the way Apple (AAPL) had done in the mid-2000s.For now, the Street sees Nvidia's Q1 profit rising 39% to 64 cents a share.RELATED:Nvidia Sinks On In-Line Q1 Sales Outlook, Higher Expenses How To Trade: What Sell Signal Did Nvidia Give To Signal A Near-Term Market Top?How To Trade: Can A Great Stock's Breakout Still Work Despite Thin Volume?How To Trade Tech Stocks: The Latest News From IBDIBD Videos: Sharpen Your Investing Skills With 2-Minute Tips

1130,NOV,"Applications for unemployment benefits in the U.S. unexpectedly declined last week to an almost three-month low, echoing a vibrant job market.Jobless claims fell by 12,000 to 234,000 in the week ended Feb. 4, a report from the Labor Department showed Thursday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for 249,000. The average number of applications filed over the past four weeks reached the lowest point since 1973.The latest results extend a trend of historically low claims, with applications staying below 300,000 in the longest streak since 1970. A shortage of skilled workers is prompting companies to hold on to existing employees while continuing to add more workers to help fulfill demand.Economists' estimates in the Bloomberg survey for initial jobless claims ranged from 235,000 to 260,000. The previous week was unrevised at 246,000.The four-week moving average decreased to 244,250, the lowest since the period ended Nov. 3, 1973, from 248,000.No states estimated jobless claims last week, and there was nothing unusual in the figures, according to the Labor Department.The latest tally marks 101 straight weeks of claims below 300,000, the level economists consider consistent with a healthy labor market. The 161-week period that ended in April 1970 was the longest such streak in records back to 1967.The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits rose by 15,000 to 2.08 million in the week ended Jan. 28. The unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits held at 1.5%. These data are reported with a one-week lag.

"
1132,NOV,"Stupid but legal. Such is the Trump administration's travel ban for people from seven Muslim countries. Of course, as with almost everything in American life, what should be a policy or even a moral issue becomes a legal one. The judicial challenge should have been given short shrift, since the presidential grant of authority to exclude the entry of aliens is extremely wide and statutorily clear. The judge who issued the temporary restraining order never even made a case for its illegality.The Ninth Circuit has indeed ruled against the immigration ban, but even if the ban is ultimately vindicated in the courts (as is likely), that doesn’t change the fact that it makes for lousy policy. It began life as a barstool eruption after the San Bernardino massacre when Donald Trump proposed a total ban on Muslims entering the country ""until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.""Rudy Giuliani says he was tasked with cleaning up this idea. Hence the executive order suspending entry of citizens from the seven countries while the vetting process is reviewed and tightened.The core idea makes sense. These are failed, essentially ungovernable states (except for Iran) where reliable data is hard to find. But the moratorium was unnecessary and damaging. Its only purpose was to fulfill an ill-considered campaign promise.It caused enormous disruption without making us any safer. What was the emergency that compelled us to turn away people already in the air with already approved visas for entry to the U.S.?President Trump said he didn't want to give any warning. Otherwise, he tweeted, ""the 'bad' would rush into our country. ... A lot of bad 'dudes' out there!""Rush? Not a single American has ever been killed in a terror attack in this country by a citizen from the notorious seven. The killers have come from precisely those countries not listed — Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Lebanon, Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan (the Tsarnaev brothers). The notion that we had to act immediately because hordes of jihadists in these seven countries were about to board airplanes to blow up Americans is absurd.Vetting standards could easily have been revised and tightened without the moratorium and its attendant disruptions, stupidities, random cruelties and well-deserved bad press.The moratorium turned into a distillation of the worst aspects of our current airport-security system, which everyone knows to be 95% pantomime. The pat-down of the 80-year-old grandmother does nothing to make us safer. Its purpose is to give the illusion of doing something. Similarly, during the brief Trump moratorium, a cavalcade of innocent and indeed sympathetic characters — graduate students, separated family members, returning doctors and scientists — were denied entry. You saw this and said to yourself: We are protecting ourselves from these?If anything, the spectacle served to undermine Trump's case for extreme vigilance and wariness of foreigners entering the United States. There is already empirical evidence. A Nov. 23 Quinnipiac poll found a 6-point majority in favor of ""suspending immigration from 'terror prone' regions""; a Feb. 7 poll found a 6-point majority against. The same poll found a whopping 44-point majority opposed to ""suspending all immigration of Syrian refugees to the U.S. indefinitely.""Then there is the opportunity cost of the whole debacle. It risks alienating the leaders of even nonaffected Muslim countries — the 57-member Organization of Islamic Cooperation expressed ""grave concern"" — which may deter us from taking far more real and effective anti-terror measures. The administration was intent on declaring the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization, a concrete measure that would hamper the operations of a global Islamist force. In the current atmosphere, however, that declaration is reportedly being delayed and rethought.Add to that the costs of the ill-prepared, unvetted, sloppy rollout. Consider the discordant, hostile message sent to loyal law-abiding Muslim-Americans by the initial denial of entry to green card holders. And the ripple effect of the initial denial of entry to those Iraqis who risked everything to help us in our war effort. In future conflicts, this will inevitably weigh upon local Muslims deciding whether to join and help our side. Actions have consequences.In the end, what was meant to be a piece of promise-keeping, tough-on-terror symbolism has become an oxygen-consuming distraction. This is a young administration with a transformative agenda to enact. At a time when it should be pushing and promoting deregulation, tax reform and health care transformation, it has steered itself into a pointless cul-de-sac — where even winning is losing.RELATED:Now We Know: Those 'Spontaneous' Anti-Trump Airport Protests Weren't Spontaneous At AllTrump's Executive Orders Are Nothing Compared To Obama's 'Pen And Phone' Abuses51% Back Trump's Temporary Ban On Refugees — IBD/TIPP Poll

1133,NOV,"The last thing President Trump now needs is for the stock market to go south on him. After all, he's got worries aplenty: abroad, North Korea, Syria, Russia and Brexit; at home, the stalled effort to repeal ObamaCare; and uncertainty surrounding ""tax reform."" Compared with this tapestry of troubles, the stock market has been a splendid blessing.It's called the Trump Rally or the Trump Trade. By whatever name, it's been impressive. On Election Day, Nov. 8, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 18,332.74, not much different from a year earlier. By March 1, the Dow hit 21,115.55, a gain of 15%. Although stocks are slightly off this peak, the market increase remains about 11% and represents roughly $2.8 trillion of paper wealth, reports Wilshire Associates.To Trump, this must be immensely gratifying. Among other roles, the stock market serves as a general barometer of confidence that is independent of — and can't by manipulated by — Trump's nemesis, the detestable ""mainstream media."" One message from the market, he doubtlessly thinks, is that he's doing much better than his vocal critics acknowledge.The theory of the Trump Rally is simple: He's brightened the economic outlook. Big business and personal tax cuts, combined with relief from overregulation and higher infrastructure spending (roads, ports), will boost economic growth. Faster growth will raise profits — and higher profits tomorrow justify higher stock prices today. In theory, stocks represent the present value of (estimated) future profits.But there's the rub. What if those profits don't materialize?Immediately after the election, it was possible (though naive) to think that Trump could quickly convince the Republican Congress to pass his economic agenda. Now, that optimism seems unrealistic. The difficulty of repealing the Affordable Care Act showed the limits of the White House's power. Similarly, big tax cuts may be doomed by budget deficits. Progress on infrastructure and regulation is also grudging.So: If the main reason for the Trump Rally is missing, what's holding stock prices up? Good question.Let's be clear: Stock prices are historically high by many traditional measures. Consider the price-earnings ratio, or P/E. It shows the relation between stock prices and underlying earnings (profits). Since 1936, the P/E ratio of the Standard & Poor's 500 stocks has averaged 17 based on the latest profits and stock prices, says Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices. Now, the P/E is almost 24.Stock prices have outrun profits' growth. To Silverblatt, either added profits will materialize or, if they don't, stocks will decline. ""The P/E is high,"" he says. ""We are paying (in today's stock prices) for future and expected earnings. At some point, we need to see them.""Stock valuations are tricky. With hindsight, the market can stay above or below levels reflecting economic fundamentals for long stretches. Whatever the case today, stocks are nowhere near the absurd heights of the ""tech bubble"" at the turn of the century. It's possible that a general improvement in the global economy justifies higher stock prices. The International Monetary Fund and some private economists have recently raised their forecasts.""Compared with a month ago,"" says Global Insight, a major forecasting firm, ""(our predictions for economic growth) in the United States, Canada, Japan, Brazil, India and Russia have all been marked up a little.""But the Trump Rally could be an exercise in over-optimism. Hefty expectations of tax cuts, regulatory savings and higher government spending may be disappointed, writes Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics. Or the rally could succumb to a foreign policy crisis. Take your pick: North Korea, the Middle East or others.If so, the rally could backfire. Rising stocks cause consumers to spend more; falling stocks curb their spending. Zandi figures this so-called ""wealth effect"" at about 5%: A one dollar change in stock market wealth prompts consumers to alter spending by about 5 cents. If the entire $2.8 trillion rally were erased, that would imply a $140 billion loss in consumer spending.Indeed, Zandi thinks the effect could be greater, because many heavily invested baby boomers — in or near retirement — ""would be very sensitive to a decline in stock prices.""What may be holding up stocks is inertia, herd behavior or wishful thinking. One test comes this week when, says Silverblatt, nearly 200 major companies report profits for 2017's first quarter. Strong profits would vindicate the rally. For Trump and everyone else, the question is whether the rally rests on illusion or reality.

1138,NOV,"Investor sentiment may be a fickle thing, but investor psychology is not. Most ETF investors want a Ben ""Two-Way"" Garland to manage their money, playing both offense and defense in the stock market, just as the Falcons lineman did for his team.After the 2008 financial crisis, Americans were thirsty for investment solutions that could avoid the massive losses their portfolios had twice sustained in the preceding decade. And a slew of money managers sprang up to offer portfolios of exchange traded funds combining an aggressive growth focus with strong defensive capabilities.Among them was David Haviland, managing partner and portfolio manager at Beaumont Capital Management, a Needham, Mass.-based asset management firm. In Haviland's opinion, investors often talk of active management when what they really seek is a manager who can make both the buying and selling decisions on their behalf.""Active management is typically investing to a style or benchmark, but does not defend against large losses,"" Haviland told IBD recently. ""Tactical management seeks to do both, which is what investors want and need.""The tactically oriented BCM U.S. Sector Rotation strategy seizes growth by investing across the entire S&P 500. To limit downside risks, it can pare back exposure to declining sectors and go to cash in tough markets.In an interview conducted over phone and email, Haviland discussed his flagship sector rotation strategy, the changes in its portfolio since Nov. 8, his rules for investing in ETFs, and more.Beaumont Capital had $3.57 billion in total client assets as of December 2016.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2017IBD: What is the goal of the BCM U.S. Sector Rotation?
"
1139,NOV,"David Haviland: The strategy seeks growth in the U.S. equity market by investing in ETFs representing the sectors of S&P 500. It is also designed to get defensive if specific sectors, or the market as a whole, has a significant loss of momentum.The strategy will typically seek to be fully invested in all sectors in equal weights. However, when one or more sectors begins to substantially decline, the system will seek to sell the weak sectors and reinvest in sectors that still have positive momentum. If less than four sectors are owned, we start to raise cash and can go to 100% cash in complete market failures like 2008.(Editor's note: Beaumont's sector rotation strategy launched Feb. 1, 2011).IBD: Why does it generally equal-weight sectors?
"
1140,NOV,"Haviland: Over time, market-cap weighting can hurt performance. The reason is that you buy more of what has already appreciated and less of what has been beaten down or just not run as far. The market-cap weighting of the sectors reflect these market movements.Technology in late 1999 and financials in 2007 are two examples of how sectors can grow disproportionately large relative to the other sectors of the S&P 500, and both of these suffered sharp losses soon thereafter.IBD: What changes did the strategy make before and after the Nov. 8 election?
"
1141,NOV,"Haviland: The strategy was well positioned to take advantage of the Trump election's ""buy the rumor"" rally.In the two weeks leading up to the election, the strategy went from 10 sectors to eight, selling its health care and REITs (real estate) exposure. In the week following the election, the strategy sold two more sectors, utilities and consumer staples. The strategy remained equal-weighted in the remaining six sectors (materials, energy, financials, industrials, technology and consumer discretionary) through the end of 2016.The strategy has overweights to materials, energy and industrials and an equal weight to financials relative to the index, which has helped performance in the postelection cyclical sectors rally.IBD: How many sectors does it currently own?
"
1142,NOV,"Haviland: As of Jan. 30, the strategy owns seven of the 10 sector ETFs, and the three not owned are real estate, utilities and consumer staples.The proposed fiscal stimulus from the Trump campaign has ignited a cyclical rally, which has reignited industrials, materials, energy and financials; all are equal- or overweighted holdings.IBD: How does the strategy identify momentum to capture growth?
"
1143,NOV,"Haviland: It is all in the research and the rules of the system. Think of sector rotation as trend following — positive trends are invested in and ridden until they end and negative trends are typically sold relatively quickly.Sometimes all 10 sectors have a positive trend and sometimes only a few. Either way, ""the trend is your friend.""IBD: How does it reduce volatility and avoid weak sectors?
"
1144,NOV,"Haviland: BCM U.S. Sector Rotation's default is to stay invested in the 10 sector ETFs of the S&P 500 to achieve growth.However, when a sector's trend turns negative and is experiencing high volatility, our rules seek to sell it and reinvest in sectors with a positive trend. This, in turn, will typically reduce the volatility and drawdown of the overall strategy.IBD: What are the triggers or signals you use to get defensive?
"
1145,NOV,"Haviland: We use price trend, volatility, change in volatility and volume as our main inputs. Price trend determines if there is a change in direction, while the other three determine the speed of our reaction time.As an example, when energy fell off a cliff in late 2014, we sold it quickly because the trend was cascading down, there was a sudden spike in volatility, the volatility level itself was also abnormally high, and the trading volume was significantly higher than the norm.On the contrary, if a sector's trend has just barely turned negative and is not experiencing abnormal volume or volatility, the strategy has more patience and waits to sell until a trend — either way — is truly established.IBD: When was the last time the strategy went to 100% cash?
"
1146,NOV,"Haviland: The strategy has never been in 100% cash. As a growth strategy, it wants to stay invested. It has only raised cash three times since inception, twice going to 50%, in the third quarter of 2011 and Q1 2016, and once to 75%, in Q4 2015.IBD: What is tactical investing?
"
1147,NOV,"Haviland: Tactical management is what most investors associate with active management. Investors want a manager to do the buying AND selling for them. In good times, they want us to stay invested where there is positive momentum, and in bad times they want (and need) us to sell failing sectors to help smooth the ride and avoid large market losses.Active management is typically investing to a style or benchmark, but does not defend against large losses. Tactical management seeks to do both, which is what investors want and need.IBD: Why did the strategy underperform its benchmark, the S&P 500 index, in 2016 and since its February 2011 inception?
"
1148,NOV,"Haviland: Much of any underperformance comes from the expenses in running the strategies including trading, management and program fees. In a rip-roaring bull market, like the last seven years, we tend to lag a bit.Yet when the markets enter periods of failure, we expect to dramatically outperform by losing less. Over a full market cycle, we expect to outperform.IBD: How often are changes made in the strategy?
"
1149,NOV,"Haviland: The strategies are reviewed internally on a daily basis. This strategy has the ability to trade on a weekly basis but can often go months with no trades if there is no change in the 10 sectors' trends.We also offer the BCM U.S. Sector Rotation (Monthly) strategy, which trades on a monthly basis for investors who are more concerned about turnover or cost.IBD: Who is the target investor?
"
1150,NOV,"Haviland: Growth investors who want a rules-based system to make the buy AND sell decisions for them, seeking to avoid large market losses in times of market duress.IBD: What are its assets under management and fees?
"
1151,NOV,"Haviland: We run this strategy using several ETF families. Including the weekly and monthly, as well as all ETF families, the total assets of U.S. Sector Rotation is roughly $468 million as of December 2016.The typical BCM client will pay a 50 basis point management fee for the weekly strategy. Underlying expense ratios can vary based on the ETFs used.IBD: How can one invest in it?
"
1152,NOV,"Haviland: Typically through your financial representative, who can access us on 9 turnkey asset management programs (TAMPs) and countless broker-dealer platforms.Visit our website to see the platforms where we can be accessed currently.IBD: What key criteria determine whether or not you will invest in an ETF?
"
1153,NOV,"Haviland: BCM only invests in long-only ETFs, and we avoid complicating factors such as margin, inverse, options and shorting.Additional criteria include liquidity, ETF expense ratio and trading expenses, as well as the index followed.RELATED:High-Yield Strategy Uses 10 ETFs To Deliver All-Weather Income With Low Risk

1154,NOV,"Growth stocks provided a rich seam of gains for domestic stock ETFs in the past month, as shares of tech leaders Facebook (FB), Adobe (ADBE) and Apple (AAPL) rekindled after noticeably lagging the postelection rally.Investors in exchange traded funds were in a perhaps exuberant mood as stock market volatility hit its lowest level in years and the venerable Dow Jones industrial average crossed the psychologically key 20,000 mark, Matthew Bartolini and David Mazza of State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) wrote in a recent note.A risk-on mood seems to prevail among ETF investors as ""the current U.S. equity bull market is less than 30 trading days away from its eighth birthday,"" they added.However, there are some yellow flags.""Valuations are elevated and earnings growth is positive, but not overwhelming so,"" said Bartolini and Mazza. ""Confounding the exuberance is the fact that bond market volatility remains decidedly elevated, nearly 6% higher than prior to the election, while equity volatility has fallen by over 36%.""SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) climbed 0.9% in the month ended Feb. 8, padding gains of 2.6% year to date and 12% in 2016.International stock ETFs did even better in the past month.Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO) advanced 4.4% and iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), investing in foreign developed markets, added 1.2%.Equity ETFs listed in the U.S. notched just under $30 billion in net inflow in January — the third month in a row since the Nov. 8 election that investors poured more than $25 billion into equity ETFs, according to SSGA. Fixed income ETFs saw $13.41 billion in net inflow last month, following the record $90 billion of fresh assets they gathered in 2016.Bartolini and Mazza suggest that truly exuberant ETF investors should consider allocating to ETFs which are tracking sectors that may benefit from President Trump's policies, such as real assets, oil and gas producers and regional banks.Other ETF investors may want to position for downside risk in the stock market and consider investing in gold, they added.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2017These are among the year's best-performing ETFs in some key asset classes, screened for trading volume:First Trust Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted (QQEW) gives every stock in its underlying tech-focused, nonfinancial index an equal share of assets.

JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said last week that banks could stay within the range they're in now until details on tax policy become more concrete.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon urged patience.""You all should expect, as a given, that when you have a new president, and they get going, that the nine months after the 100 days is gonna be a sausage-making period,"" Dimon told analysts on the bank's first-quarter earnings call. ""There will be ups and downs, wins and losses, stuff like that.""JPMorgan and Citigroup beat estimates on the top and bottom lines, while Wells Fargo's EPS was above views. Trading results were strong for JPMorgan and Citigroup, helped in part by the outlook on interest rates.But JPMorgan's consumer and industrial loan growth was roughly flat quarter-to-quarter. Management said some of the slowdown might be due to past big acquisitions and because companies have other options, such as bonds, for financing.Citigroup also tempered its expectations for loan growth. And Wells Fargo saw auto-loan originations drop due to stricter underwriting standards, while home-loan originations also fell.RELATED:JPMorgan CEO Signals Patience As Trump's Growth Agenda Stalls

At least nine names in the 30-component Dow industrials rose 1 point or more, including tech services play IBM (IBM) and insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH).IBM, expected to report Q1 results after the close on Tuesday, rallied more than 10% after it cleared a 164.76 saucer-with-handle entry in early December, but the stock has now faded below the 10-week line for more than five weeks. Analysts see profit flat at $2.35 a share and just rising 1% to $13.78 a share for the year.UnitedHealth, up 1.4% to 167.18, is making its third general test of the 50-day line since January. The managed care firm broke out of a flat base at 144.58 once in October, then again on Nov. 10 in strong volume.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.9%, just a nose ahead of the nearly 0.9% gain in the S&P 500. The Nasdaq composite was up almost 0.9% while the Russell 2000 gained 1.2%. Volume fell on both main exchanges, according to early data.Top-performing industry groups included wireless telecom services, diversified operations, movies, travel booking and internet-based retail. But money-center, tobacco, car retail and computer-systems stocks also flourished, with groupwide gains of 1% or more.The U.S. dollar wilted. Near-term U.S. crude oil futures sank more than 1% to $52.61 a barrel.Returning to Zayo, the Boulder, Colo., member of IBD's Computer-Networking industry group has lost money every year since 2010. But last year the net loss shrank to 31 cents a share, and Wall Street expects Zayo to earn 35 cents in 2017 and 57 cents in 2018.Revenue jumped 28% to $1.72 billion in 2016, accelerating from a 20% gain in 2015.The 5% buy zone in shares of Zayo following the breakout goes up to 35.82.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Snap (SNAP) continued to slump after a promising rebound in late March gave the stock the appearance that it could work on the right side of its very first base pattern. While the market rose, Snap shares fell 1.3% to 19.93 and could close below 20 for the week for the first time since the week ended March 17.Despite some rosy comments by some Wall Street analysts, the Snapchat operator must deal with the primary challenge of proving to investors it can in fact make money in the long haul. Analysts have cut their estimates, and the company is expected to lose 55 cents a share in 2017 and 33 cents in 2018.These expected net losses are substantial, given that Snap has 1.16 billion shares outstanding. The float is 364 million.Fundamentally, one critical issue is whether Snap can rein in its ballooning operating costs. Revenue jumped a magnificent 590% to $404 million in 2016, but research and development costs more than doubled to $184 million, while sales and marketing expense rocketed 357% to $124.4 million.Full-year operating losses came to $520.4 million, up from a $382 million operating loss in 2015.The Street sees Snap losing 20 cents a share in the first quarter of this year.Snap's RS Rating of 9 is meaningless because this rating is based on 12-month relative price performance. So, for now, watch to see if institutions come in and shore up support for the stock near 20. It came public March 2 at 17 a share.Key earnings results on Tuesday include a batch of financial firms, such as Charles Schwab (SCHW) (earnings per share seen up 28% to 37 cents), Bank of America (BAC) (EPS seen up 25% to 35 cents, following an 11% drop and gains of 8% and 48% in the prior three quarters), and Goldman Sachs (GS) (EPS up 98% to $5.31).Traders will also be eyeing data on U.S. housing starts for March on Tuesday and the Federal Reserve's beige book survey of regional economic activity on Wednesday.RELATED:The Income Investor: Should You Own These 4 Dividend-Rich Utilities?Stock Market Today: Is It Time To Hold These Dow 30 Stocks Longer?Inside The IBD 50: Which Names Hold Terrible Accumulation Ratings?How To Invest Like A Pro: Lessons On Focus On Risk Control From A Master Race PilotWhich Sectors To Invest: The Top 3 Among 33 Broad Sectors Are All From Tech Land

1160,NOV,"Early gains faded, sending the major indexes to the lowest levels of the session in afternoon trading Thursday.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were down 0.4%. Dow component JPMorgan (JPM) reversed lower, shedding 1%, after the bank reported first-quarter results that topped expectations.Two other big banks that announced earnings all fell. Citigroup (C) also reversed lower and Wells Fargo (WFC) fell to its 200-day moving average, the first time it has been there since Nov. 9. Financials have been flagging since March, shadowing a decline in the 10-year Treasury yield, and today's earnings didn't do much to restore confidence in the sector.The Nasdaq was 0.2% lower, getting some help from gains in fiber optic, business software and biotech industry groups. In biotechs, one chart to study is Incyte (INCY), which is rising from support at the 50-day moving average.Netflix (NFLX), one of the Nasdaq's top components, inched higher but more importantly it held support at the 50-day moving average. The video-streaming company could benefit from a possible strike by Hollywood writers, a Barclays analyst says.  Also, Guggenheim raised its price target on Netflix to 173 from 160 and kept a buy rating ahead of Monday's earnings report after the close.Volume was tracking lower, not surprising on the last day ahead of a three-day weekend for Wall Street. Stock exchanges are closed Friday for the Good Friday holiday.Steel and energy stocks led the market lower. Retail and banks also were laggards as earnings from three major banks this morning were mixed.Steel producers and alloys makers were at the bottom of the 197 IBD industry groups in today's market. U.S. Steel (X) fell 4% and is below the 30 price level for the first time since Nov. 22, when it was breaking out of a base. The stock has been trending lower for about eight weeks and selling intensified this week as doubts grew about the so-called Trump Trade — a potential boom in infrastructure spending.Glaukos (GKOS) tumbled below the 50-day moving average in heavy volume, a sell signal for the maker of a glaucoma treatment. The company announced late Wednesday it had acquired sensor-system assets and related liabilities from DOSE Medical Corp. for $5.5 million in cash, plus performance-based payments of up to $9.5 million. DOSE is a former subsidiary of Glaukos that was spun off.RELATED:Hollywood Writers Strike Threat: Netflix, Facebook, Amazon Seen As WinnersFacebook, Netflix Get Price-Target Hikes; SkyWest A Strong Buy

1162,NOV,"Video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) late Tuesday murdered Wall Street's fiscal third-quarter targets thanks to hot games like ""Mafia 3"" and the continued success of the ""Grand Theft Auto"" franchise, sending shares to an all-time high early Wednesday.The New York City-based company earned 99 cents a share excluding items, up 11% year over year, on adjusted sales of $745 million, up 53%, in the December quarter. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Take-Two to earn 96 cents a share on sales of $706 million.For the current quarter, the company's fiscal Q4, Take-Two said it expects to earn 53 cents a share ex items on adjusted sales of $342 million, based on the midpoint of guidance. Analysts were modeling for 53 cents EPS and $291 million in sales for the March quarter.Take-Two stock jumped as much as 5.6% in early trading on the stock market today, hitting a record high of 56.71. But shares soon reversed, and Take-Two stock ended the day up just a penny, at 53.71. Take-Two broke out of a flat base with a buy point of 46.88 on Nov. 3.IBD'S TAKE: Take-Two Interactive Software has an IBD Composite Rating of 71, meaning it has outperformed 71% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. But it ranks No. 4 out of 15 companies in IBD's Computer Software-Gaming industry group. To see which companies lead the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Take-Two lost 33 cents a share in the December quarter, compared with a year-earlier loss of 51 cents.The largest contributors to Take-Two's revenue growth last quarter were ""Grand Theft Auto 5"" and ""Grand Theft Auto Online,"" ""WWE 2K17,"" ""NBA 2K17"" and ""Sid Meier's Civilization 6,"" the company said.""Take-Two had a highly successful holiday quarter,"" Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said in a conference call with analysts. ""Consumer demand for our new releases and catalog was strong throughout the period and players continue to engage significantly with our games after purchase.""""Grand Theft Auto 5"" and ""Grand Theft Auto Online"" continue to outperform expectations, he said. ""GTA 5"" has sold more than 75 million units since its launch in September 2013.Crime saga game ""Mafia 3,"" released Oct. 7, has sold about 5 million units to date.Take-Two received at least seven price-target hikes from investment banks after reporting Q3 results. Firms raising their price targets on Take-Two stock included Baird, Benchmark, Cowen, Macquarie Capital, Mizuho Securities, Oppenheimer and Piper Jaffray.Take-Two is the second of three major U.S.-traded video game publishers to report holiday quarter results. Electronic Arts (EA) on Jan. 31 reported fiscal Q3 sales and earnings that beat expectations. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter results after the close on Thursday.RELATED:Video Game Publisher Activision Added To Wedbush 'Best Ideas List'

1165,NOV,"Oil dropped to the lowest in more than two weeks amid estimates that U.S. crude and gasoline inventories continue to climb.Futures slipped 1.6% in New York. Crude stockpiles probably rose for a fifth week while gasoline supplies approached a record, according to a Bloomberg survey before an Energy Information Administration report on Wednesday. The gasoline crack, the profit from processing oil into gasoline, fell. U.S. crude production is projected to climb to a 48-year high next year, according to a separate EIA report.Oil has fluctuated above $50 a barrel since a deal to trim output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 11 other nations took effect on Jan. 1. While OPEC members implement pledged cuts and Russia says its own reductions are ahead of schedule, U.S. production has edged higher as drillers boosted the rig count to the most since October 2015.""Gasoline is just getting slaughtered today, and it's dragging crude with it,"" Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, said by phone. ""A 2-million-barrel gasoline build would bring us to an all-time high, and crude inventories have been climbing too.""West Texas intermediate crude for March delivery fell 84 cents to $52.17 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It's the lowest close since Jan. 19. Total volume traded was near the 100-day average at 2:56 p.m. ET.Gasoline futures for March delivery dropped 1.5% to $1.4875 a gallon, the lowest close since Nov. 29. The March gasoline crack spread, a rough measure of the profit from refining crude into the fuel, dropped as much as 4.7% to $9.932 a barrel.Inventories of gasoline probably increased 1.6 million barrels to 258.7 million last week, according to the median forecast in the Bloomberg survey. Stockpiles of the motor fuel reached a record 258.7 million barrels in the week ended Feb. 12, 2016.Crude supplies probably rose 2.5 million barrels, the survey showed. Stockpiles are at 494.8 million barrels, the highest seasonal level in more than three decades, according to weekly data compiled by the EIA since 1982.U.S. crude output will average 9.53 million barrels a day in 2018, up from 9.3 million projected in January, the EIA said in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook released Tuesday. That would be the highest since 1970, agency data show.The trading boom that cushioned the profits of Royal Dutch Shell PLC and  BP PLC through the price slump appears to be over. BP said on Tuesday it made a ""small"" loss trading oil in the fourth quarter, while Shell last week said profits ""flattened"" in late 2016. These companies' trading divisions thrived in 2015 and 2016 because an unusually strong contango — where contracts for future delivery trade higher than spot prices — made it profitable to store oil.Brent for April settlement fell 67 cents, or 1.2%, to $55.05 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.

1167,NOV,"The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index climbed to 56.4 in February, rising eight-tenths of a point to hit the highest level since October 2004 in a vote of confidence for Trumponomics.Americans' view of federal economic policies rose to the highest level in a decade as Amazon.com (AMZN), Alibaba (BABA), Wal-Mart (WMT), General Motors (GM) and other companies announced hiring plans in the weeks leading up to Donald Trump's inauguration. (Executives and analysts, however, have cast doubt on how much his prodding mattered.)Meanwhile, as the Dow Jones industrial average broke through 20,000, more Americans were expecting good things for their finances over the coming six months than at any time in the past dozen years.The Economic Optimism Index registered above the neutral 50 level for the fifth straight month, after signaling pessimism for 17 months from May 2015 through September 2016.The Economic Optimism Index is a composite of three major subindexes that track views of near-term economic prospects, the outlook for personal finances over the coming six months and views of how well government economic policies are working.The gauge of the six-month economic outlook dipped to 55.6 from 56.0 in January and 56.3 in December 2016, but that's still a huge recovery from 36.7 in July '16.The personal financial outlook index rose a half-point to 62.8, the highest since October 2004.The measure of confidence in federal economic policies jumped 2.4 points to 50.9, signaling optimism for the first time since February 2007. Among rural Americans, the approval rating of federal economic policies surged to 60.7% from 45.5% in December, marking the highest level since April 2003, the month after the war in Iraq began.IBD'S TAKE: As the Trump rally hits a bit of turbulence, check out IBD Leaderboard to find which leading stocks are holding up, which are nearing a buy point, and which are signaling that it may be time to take profits. Among self-described investors, overall economic optimism jumped 2.3 points to 58.0, the highest in more than a decade. Trump's agenda of cutting personal and corporate taxes, along with a burst of infrastructure spending, has helped fuel a stock market rally since Nov. 9.While Trump's economic policies are getting broad support so far, there's something of a disconnect between rising economic optimism and negative feelings about his overall job performance. The IBD/TIPP poll found that just 42% approve of the job he's doing as president, while 48% disapprove.The IBD/TIPP poll was conducted from Jan. 27 through Feb. 2, and includes a sample size of 885 people who were surveyed using live interviewers on cellphones and landlines. The poll's margin of error is +/- 3.3 percentage points.RELATED:IBD/TIPP Poll: Economic Optimism Index 51% Back Trump's Temporary Ban On Refugees — IBD/TIPP PollWhy Trump Immigration Order May Weigh On Stocks

1168,NOV,"XPresident Trump's directionless policy agenda and his bear hug of dovish Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen are wreaking havoc on market expectations, with an assist from international uncertainty.The 10-year Treasury yield on Thursday sank to 2.23%, a level not seen since the week after Trump's election. Wells Fargo (WFC) tumbled 3.3% to its worst close since Nov. 9, the first day of the postelection rally, after reporting weaker-than-expected revenue. Dow component JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C) cleared analyst estimates with their first-quarter reports, but saw modest early gains turn into losses of about 1%, with both stocks stuck below their 50-day averages.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index both appeared headed for a third straight lower close as weakness continued to extend beyond financials to infrastructure stocks, another group that soared on the Trump agenda. The Dow, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite are all trading below their 50-day moving averages.Dow construction equipment giant Caterpillar (CAT) slipped 1.9%, while steel maker U.S. Steel (X) tumbled 5.9%. U.S. Steel crashed 10% on Wednesday, its worst loss in nearly a year, as steel makers and miners plunged with iron ore prices.IBD'S TAKE: While the stock market rally has stalled out in the U.S., emerging markets stocks are rallying. Learn why they're rising, and which emerging markets are outperforming their peers.This week's action appears to represent the biggest reversal of the Trump effect to date. The reversal is more obvious in the Treasury market, where yields have fallen to their lowest levels in almost five months, than in equity markets that are still not too far from the lofty postelection peaks. Perhaps the clearest evidence of the change is visible in Fed rate expectations.Despite the Fed's stated intention to raise rates twice more this year and also to begin unwinding its balance sheet by a change in its reinvestment policy, which represents a third tightening, markets are now only pricing one more hike this year, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool. What's more, the second rate hike isn't seen until at least March of 2018. That's basically where expectations stood before Trump's election led the Fed to take a hawkish shift.Trump's announcement this week that he is putting repeal of ObamaCare back at the top of his agenda, even though prospects for success look negligible, seem to have cemented doubts that Trump will be able to enact pro-growth tax cuts and infrastructure. That's a bitter pill for investors who had been banking on big corporate tax cuts in the Trump era.The White House also revealed this week that it is undertaking a broad search for options to offset the cost of tax reform. While the possibility of success can't be completely ruled out, the outcome will likely hinge on whether Trump can get near-unanimous support among GOP senators for a big deficit-increasing tax cut at a time of high and rising debt levels.The latest blow to Fed expectations and banks came when Trump told the Wall Street Journal in a Wednesday interview that he liked low interest rates and would consider reappointing Yellen as chair at the end of her term in February 2018. There are three Fed governor openings that Trump has to fill, and there's now substantial doubt that he'll appoint any hawks. That's quite a surprise, considering that Trump said Yellen's low rates had created a ""big fat, ugly bubble"" during the campaign. Prospects for faster growth and higher rates that allow for a wider margin between lending and borrowing rates had made banks among the big winners of the Trump rally.RELATED:Stock Rally Tiring As Trump Policy Agenda Runs In CirclesThis 'Explosive' Protectionist Signal From Trump Looks Like A Dud

1169,NOV,"Just as an ace baseball pitcher mixes his throws, top mutual fund managers vary their investments. Managers of Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund are mingling semiconductor stocks with biotech stocks, online travel agencies and a Chinese fast-food chain, all to good effect. That's been a benefit to investors with retirement accounts and other portfolios.The $3.3 billion fund is working its way back toward its multiyear top-notch outperformance. This year going into Wednesday, the fund's 8.97% gain topped 62% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the 5.75% advance by the S&P 500.That's an improvement over its showing during the past 12 months, when the fund outpaced just 54% of its direct rivals with a nonetheless decent 15.49% rise. So its year-to-date relative performance is a turn back toward what it accomplished over the past three years, when it beat 89% of its direct rivals.A key piece of credit goes to the fund's stake in technology stocks, which was the portfolio's largest sector as of Feb. 28 with a 34% weighting, nearly double the second-largest sector then, consumer discretionary. The S&P 500 has a tech weighting of 20%.The fund's semiconductor stocks include Lam Research (LRCX), up 19% so far this year; Micron Technology (MU), up 22% this year; and Broadcom (AVGO), up 18%.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. Its 99 Composite Rating is the highest possible, and its earnings per share growth has accelerated for four quarters in a row. See how its additional easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' at IBD's Stock Checkup.Biotech bets include Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), up 56%, and Celgene (CELG), up 8%. Two of the fund's consumer discretionary plays are online travel agencies Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia (EXPE), which are up 19% and 14% respectively this year.And China-based restaurant chain Yum China (YUMC) is another security to like in the consumer discretionary space, up 25% this year.They've also trying to make plays with multicategory straddlers Alibaba (BABA) and Amazon (AMZN).Lam has benefited from two trends. One is the growing complexity in some semiconductors and their manufacturing equipment, says Peter Deininger, one of three managers of the fund. The second is consolidation in the semiconductor equipment space. That has cut inventory volatility, and smoothed out industry cycles. ""That means higher margins and higher returns for Lam,"" Deininger said.In addition, Lam is a leader in the etching and deposition segment of the semiconductor equipment field. ""That's helped them increase market share at a rate in excess of other players,"" Deininger said. ""Combined, all of this has put the company in a good situation, which we anticipate has legs to go.""Micron makes memory and data-storage devices. Its industry has gone through enough consolidation that pricing is stable to rising in Micron's key DRAM and NAND products, Deininger says. That leads to rising margins, he adds.Industrywide, with earnings and share prices doing so well last year, might the segment be near a top? That could explain the recent pullback in this space, which affected Micron among other stocks.But Deininger is not ready to retreat yet. ""There continues to be very balanced supply, pricing remains firm, and lead times for products are modestly extended,"" he said. ""Combined with a lack of significant new capacity, that argues that (share-price strength) should hold for some time going forward.""Fund manager Tchintcia Barros likes Vertex's existing treatments for cystic fibrosis as well as another in development. Vertex gapped up 20% on March 29 amid news about favorable results in a late-stage trial for that new treatment, a combination therapy. Vertex plans to add another drug to create a three-drug cocktail that could treat thousands more cystic fibrosis patients, Barros says.""Several months ago, a competitor (Galapagos) created some fears (among investors) around whether Vertex would have that portfolio of treatments to itself,"" Barros said. ""But data show that (Galapagos) is three years behind Vertex.""The fund's managers have mixed feelings about the consumer discretionary space. On the one hand, since the end of last year they have shifted to an underweight from an overweight in the sector vs. the Russell 1000 Growth Index.They've sold out of positions in branded apparel manufacturer VF (VFC), yogawear chain store Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and pharmacy operator CVS Health (CVS). ""Online companies have put a lot of pressure on traditional retail areas,"" manager John Wilson said.On the other hand, the fund still likes online travel agencies Priceline and Expedia.And the managers like Yum China as a pure play on China restaurant stocks.Yum China gapped up 9% on April 6, the day it released first-quarter financial results. Earnings per share grew 19%. Despite a 1% slip in sales, sales nosed above the consensus estimate. The company opened 133 new stores in the quarter, including its Little Sheep and East Dawning outlets.In its guidance for fiscal 2017, the company said it would open at least 550 new stores and that operating profit would grow at a double-digit pace.Yum Brands (YUM) — which the fund also holds — said it had completed its spinoff of Yum China on Nov. 1, 2016. Since they began trading that day, shares in the new company are up 25%.RELATED: Why This Top Columbia Fund Loads Up On These Stock LeadersYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

United Airlines (UAL) suffered a PR fiasco, and Apple (AAPL) buzz roiled iPhone suppliers. Tesla (TSLA) became the most valuable U.S. automaker, briefly. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) headlined big bank earnings, while Wal-Mart (WMT) is making physical stores an asset in its online battle against Amazon (AMZN).The Dow industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite all fell below their 50-day moving averages on Wednesday. Investors worried about tensions with Syria, North Korea and Russia, while President Trump said tax cuts will have to wait on health reform. Steel, mining and other infrastructure-related stocks kept falling. Many chips fell on Apple uncertainty, while fiber-optic stocks rebounded Thursday on blowout preliminary earnings figures from Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI). JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) fell after reporting earnings. Wal-Mart stepped up its battle with Amazon, with both retail stocks in buy zones. The 10-year Treasury yield continued to slide, hitting its lowest level since November.United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz apologized multiple times after a video of Chicago police dragging an elderly Asian man off an overbooked flight sparked outcry on social media. Weibo users in China questioned if the incident was racially motivated and called for a boycott of the airline. In an earlier a memo to employees, Munoz blamed the passenger for being ""disruptive and belligerent"" and said that United had ""followed established procedures."" In March, the carrier came under fire for turning away two teenagers for wearing leggings while flying under a special friends-and-family ticket.United Airlines shares fell 2.55% for the week, not much more than the airline stock group.RELATED:Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported mixed first-quarter results but forecast positive Q2 unit revenue, an important efficiency metric Wall Street has long wished would improve. As airlines confront higher fuel and labor costs, Delta said that it expected ""the entirety of our 2017 margin pressure"" to have occurred during Q1. The carrier said the roughly 4,000 flight cancellations that resulted from thunderstorms around Atlanta would cost it $125 million in Q2 pretax income, but it said it was not understaffed. In light of the forcible removal of a passenger from a packed United Airlines flight, Delta said extra regulation wasn't needed and that it handled overbookings better than rivals.Delta shares rose 4% intraday Wednesday but reversed to close slightly lower, and continued to slide Thursday, closing at their lowest levels since Nov. 9.RELATED:Apple's internal chip development efforts grabbed the spotlight, raising investor worries that some iPhone suppliers could be phased out after a report said the Dow-industrials tech giant will replace power management devices made by Germany's Dialog Semiconductor with in-house technology, possibly as soon as 2019. The Dialog report followed U.K.-based Imagination Technologies' warning to investors that Apple could replace its graphics chips in iPhones. A Pacific Crest analyst said Apple is unlikely to develop its own radio frequency or audio chips for iPhones. Shares in Qorvo (QRVO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) sold off.In a countersuit, Qualcomm (QCOM) claimed Apple covered up how iPhone 7s equipped with its chips outperformed those with Intel (INTC) chips. Qualcomm also alleged that Apple lied to regulators to spur investigations of the wireless chipmaker. Apple on Jan. 20 filed a lawsuit vs. Qualcomm over its technology licensing practices.RELATED:Dow component Wal-Mart will begin offering price discounts for 10,000 goods picked up at a store location, expanding to one million items by the end of June. It's the latest evidence the discount giant is driving e-commerce innovation under new online chief Marc Lore, leveraging its brick-and-mortar locations vs. Amazon.com. Wal-Mart will offer varying discounts, using technology developed by Jet.com, which Lore sold to Wal-Mart last year for $3.3 billion. Heavy but inexpensive items will get bigger price cuts.

1171,NOV,"Has the stock market taken its skis off for a breather? Or does a spread-eagled spill lie ahead? Those questions niggle at ETF investors as U.S. stocks stall for the second time since the Nov. 8 election, but perhaps they should not cause undue concern.Smart ETF investors, like the best skiers, don't get stuck looking at the tips of their skis. They push forward when fear creeps in, taking in the full view of the landscape, refining their action plan, and trusting themselves to make a successful run.That is what Herb Morgan, the founder, CEO and CIO of Efficient Market Advisors, is doing. His outlook for the second quarter is cautious, but a wider perspective of political shifts under President Trump and global economic conditions makes him bullish on stocks for the year ahead.""Beyond Q2, we expect to begin to see the positive impact of the pro-business agenda start to hit the bottom line,"" said Morgan, whose San Diego-based registered investment advisor (RIA) firm has a long track record of investing in ETFs and $1.15 billion in assets under management.Here are Morgan's three best ETF investment ideas, in his own words:At Efficient Market Advisors, we think the second quarter could be one of those periods where stock market performance diverges from economic performance. We are decidedly in the camp that sees a pickup in U.S. and global economic activity. However, we also believe that financial asset prices fully reflect this reality.The global economic uptick, while led by the U.S., is seeing other nations and regions begin to participate. It was fueled initially by massive central bank liquidity, but we now see a growing willingness to accept that monetary policy alone cannot manage an economy.In the U.S., this realization has led to an election which swept to power policymakers set on pro-growth fiscal policies. We see a strong benefit from tax reform, regulatory reform, repatriation of foreign profits and a possible large-scale infrastructure program. Other G-7 nations and beyond are experiencing similar shifts in political sentiments.Because of this, the markets have gotten rather optimistic and have priced risk assets appropriately. The S&P 500 now trades at 21.5 times earnings, while the Nasdaq Composite is at nearly 43 times earnings. Foreign markets are not immune to the lofty valuations and optimism. The FTSE 100 index is now at 30 times earnings on optimism over Brexit. Even the French CAC 40 index is at 19.5 times and Germany at 19.8 times.So, for valuation reasons only, we expect a modest equity market correction in the second quarter. Beyond Q2, we expect to begin to see the positive impact of the pro-business agenda start to hit the bottom line.These three ETFs could be poised to do well in the market conditions we anticipate.(Editor's note: ProShares Rising Inflation Expectations ETF is a fairly small fund with lower trading volume, but the liquidity of the underlying assets matters more to investment managers like Efficient's Morgan, who can transact in the primary market.)RELATED:3 Best ETFs For U.S. Stocks With Positive Momentum, High Dividends

1173,NOV,"Each month, the IBD/TIPP poll, a collaboration between Investor's Business Daily and TechnoMetrica, produces an exclusive Presidential Leadership Index. This index combines results from several questions in the monthly IBD/TIPP poll to gauge how well the president is viewed when it comes to leading the country, both domestically and internationally.The index includes questions on presidential approval, favorability measures on the president's handling of domestic and foreign policy issues, as well as whether the president is providing strong or weak leadership.In addition, IBD/TIPP each month asks questions focused on the public's outlook overall. These questions include satisfaction with the direction of the country, a forecast about people's quality of life, and an index of the U.S. standing in the world.IBD/TIPP also produces the Economic Optimism Index at the beginning of each month.See the schedule of upcoming IBD/TIPP poll releases.See Questions & Full ResultsThe IBD/TIPP Presidential Leadership Index dropped sharply in February, the first month that the poll has asked about President Trump. The Presidential Leadership Index dates back to January 2001, when it stood at 64.6 for the newly inaugurated President Bush.The Leadership Index is comprised of three sub-indexes measuring the president's favorability, job approval (see below) and whether he is providing strong or weak leadership. Trump's low favorability and job approval numbers drove down the Index, but Trump did score higher than Obama on the the specific leadership question -- 53.8 compared with 50.7.President Trump comes into office with very low approval numbers. The Job Approval index is just 46.5, down sharply from President Obama's last rating of 57. Obama's average was around 50 for his eight years in office. Since IBD/TIPP started polling on presidential approval in January 2001, the highest it ever got was 88.7 under President Bush. The lowest was 27.8, also under President Bush.The Direction of the Country index climbed again, reflecting a more upbeat view of the public since the November elections. At 48.7, this index is highest it has been since 2005. The February poll found that 50% are satisfied with the direction of the country.This index dipped slightly in February after taking a big jump in January, to its current 58.9. The average under President Obama was 53.7. Unlike other measures, this has been relatively steady for the past 16 years. It peaked at 63.1 in January 2004. It's lowest level was 43.5 in June 2008.Another measure included in the monthly IBD/TIPP poll tracks the public's view of the U.S. standing in the world. This dipped again in February. That is still higher than had it had been the previous year, when it was in the 30s. This index peaked in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, reaching 74.9. It jumped again after President Obama won the election in November 2008, hitting 65.3 that month. It reached its nadir in Nov. 2013, in the wake of the debt ceiling crisis and the two-week government shutdown in October.RELATED:Main IBD/TIPP Poll PageIBD/TIPP Economic Optimism IndexIBD/TIPP Election 2016 Tracking PollPast ResultsJanuary 2017December 2016Media ContactTerry Jones

1179,NOV,"Gold futures surged to the highest in more than two months as investors grow wary about the possible impact of President Trump's domestic and international policies.Data on Friday showed U.S. wage growth slowed, reducing the odds of Federal Reserve rate increases this year and sending bullion to the biggest weekly gain since June. Uncertainty about Trump's fiscal-stimulus policies and his administration's spats with traditional allies helped push hedge funds' bullish bets on gold to the most in almost two months.""There's still more uncertainty in the administration's policies,"" Phil Streible, a senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago, said in a phone interview. ""The long gold position is the good trade to have on. We should see $1,250 soon.""Gold futures for April delivery advanced 0.9% to settle at $1,232.10 an ounce at 1:45 p.m. on the Comex in New York, the highest close since Nov. 10.Bullion has risen 7% this year as investors seek a haven amid Trump's recent public disagreements with countries including Germany, Japan, Mexico and China. Traders are cautious that Trump's policies -- aimed at paring regulation, cutting taxes and keeping jobs within the U.S. borders -- may not move forward as quickly as anticipated.Uncertainty about economic policy and the pace of rate increases ""may help spur purchases of the metal as a short-term safe haven by central banks and investors,"" Eily Ong, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a research note.Holdings in SPDR Gold Shares, the largest exchange traded fund backed by bullion, rose for three straight days through Friday, the longest stretch of gains since October.The net-long position, or wagers on a rally, in gold gained 21% to 72,067 futures and options for the week ended Jan. 31, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released three days later.

Jerry Brown supports, is expected to provide more than $50 billion to fund road fixes and highway projects over 10 years.Dow Jones industrial average component Caterpillar (CAT) initially appeared on the way to a four-session win streak, but reversed to close down 0.3% while the Dow index ended essentially flat.Shares of Granite Construction (GVA), a heavy construction firm based in Wastonville, Calif., that also produces construction materials, jumped 8.7% on the news out of the Golden State. Goldman Sachs gave Granite a buy rating and 61 price target on Friday.IBD'S TAKE: If President Trump and Congress add a big federal infrastructure funding package on top of state initiatives, ""that creates an inflection point for pricing,"" Granite Construction CEO James Roberts said in February.Denver-based Summit Materials (SUM), another supplier of cement, concrete and asphalt, rose 2.5% and is nearing the top of a five-month trading range after basically moving sideways since Nov. 9.Besides the new funding from California, there are other big non-Trump catalysts for the heavy construction industry.Last November, voters approved $200 billion worth of public transit ballot measures passed by voters in 25 states, with the biggest projects in Los Angeles County and Washington state.RELATED:Caterpillar Lifts Dow With Goldman Push; Trump Readies Infrastructure BillTrumpCare Is Dead Again And Stocks Don't MindWill Heavy Construction's Rebound Receive A Trump Infrastructure Boost?

1185,NOV,"The U.S. military's late Thursday airstrikes on Syria lit up defense stocks including Raytheon (RTN), which makes the Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from the Mediterranean Sea.Each Tomahawk cruise missile costs over $1.5 million and the weapon was first used in the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq. Raytheon also makes the Patriot ground-based air defense system.Raytheon surged 3% before paring its gain by half, but closed above its 50-day moving average and a 152.68 flat-base buy point. That put the stock back in buy range.Among other aerospace/defense stocks, Lockheed Martin (LMT) also reclaimed a buy point as it finished 1.2% higher to just above the 270 entry. Lockheed makes the Paveway II Plus laser guided bomb. Northrop Grumman (NOC) added 0.9%, but hit resistance at its 50-day line as it builds a handle on a cup base with a 249.53 entry.Dow component Boeing (BA), which makes joint direct attack munitions kits that turn dumb bombs into smart weapons, edged 0.8% higher as it shapes a flat base with a 185.81 buy point. Of the four aerospace/defense stocks, Boeing has the highest Composite Rating of 89.The U.S. military has favored smart precision weapons that reduce the number of civilian casualties and unintended targets in the fight against the Islamic State.Aerospace was ranked No. 12 among IBD's 33 sectors ahead of Friday's bump. The sector has risen more than 5% since the start of the year. The aerospace/defense industry group, up 0.7% Friday, soared 19% from the Nov. 8 presidential election to its March 1 peak. It's still up about 14%.IBD'S TAKE: Defense stocks have been rallying since President Trump's election as he pushes for a $54 billion increase in military spending.President Trump said the missile strikes were in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack by President Bashar Assad's forces that killed at least 70 people earlier in the week.While the strikes were the first direct targeting of Assad's forces by Washington, the U.S. dropped over 12,000 bombs targeting the Islamic State and other militants in Syria last year, according to a Council on Foreign Relations report citing Defense Department data.RELATED: Lockheed Stock Hits Buy Point After Trump Reverses This Obama Move

1187,NOV,"If gold stocks are doing well, then investor doubts must be creeping in over all of those things that seemed like sure bets to tarnish gold's future after Donald Trump's election: corporate tax cuts, a big fiscal stimulus, and faster U.S. and global growth.On Monday, shares of Newmont Mining (NEM) rose 3.2% to finish at 37.94 on the stock market today, their highest close since the election. Newmont has bounced 23% from its post-election low as gold prices have now erased more than two-thirds of their losses, with prices for the precious metal rising 0.9% to $1,232.10 an ounce on Monday, the highest close since Nov. 10.The SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD) rose 1.35% to 117.70, while the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were all modestly lower.What's amazing about gold's comeback is that it's happened even as the Dow finally crested 20,000 and was managing to hold that level Monday afternoon. Investors clearly haven't thrown in the towel on the President Trump reflation trade that initially killed gold stocks, but they may be hedging their bets somewhat. A potentially volatile period for European politics also is providing more reason to worry about downside risk.IBD'S TAKE: President Trump's agenda faces a large degree of uncertainty. If the WTO found the border tax backed by House Republicans — and increasingly by the White House — to be illegal, the GOP would face three difficult choices that could throw the ruling party into crisis.""The recent difficulty congressional Republicans have had in moving forward on Obamacare repeal does not bode well for reaching a quick agreement on tax reform or infrastructure funding, and reinforces our view that a fiscal boost, if it happens, is mostly a 2018 story,"" Goldman Sachs economist Alec Phillips wrote late last week.Goldman cut the odds to just 20% that Congress will pass a border tax adjustment, which would tax imports but not exports, as part of corporate tax reform. The controversial proposal is under attack from big importers like Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT), while big exporters like Boeing (BA) and General Electric (GE) rally in support.Here's the real concern for investors, says Brian Gardner, Washington analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: The border tax ""is the linchpin for the GOP plan, and without it, the tax reform effort could collapse.""The postelection rally was based on expectations that Trump would push hard on the pro-growth aspects of his agenda and de-emphasize other key campaign themes about restricting trade and immigration, Goldman says. But now Goldman sees increasing odds that tax cuts will get bogged down in the legislative process as the populist aspects of Trump's agenda come  to the fore.Rising populism may have been the primary driver of gold prices on Monday, as investors weighed a more uncertain future for the eurozone.In France, a financial scandal threatened to sink the candidacy of center-right front-runner Francois Fillon, suddenly boosting the chances of Marine Le Pen, who wants to break from the euro.Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's re-election contest suddenly looks like it could be a dogfight. Reflecting greater uncertainty about the future of the euro, government bond yields in France and Italy jumped to the highest levels since mid-2015.Gold prices ended last week on a positive note after the Labor Department reported unexpectedly soft wage gains to start the year, while the Federal Reserved signaled that it was in no rush to hike rates as it awaits evidence that a surge in economic confidence after Trump's election actually translates into a pickup in growth.RELATED:Strong Job Growth, Sad Wage Gains For U.S. In JanuaryWhy Trump Immigration Order May Weigh On Stocks

1189,NOV,"If there was an ETF for President Trump's trade and economic policies, this one might be it.First Trust RBA American Industrial Renaissance ETF (AIRR) is a portfolio of manufacturing and industrial companies based in the U.S. As such, it is a handy vehicle to invest in America's factories and infrastructure.Those themes play right into the president's ambitions to revitalize U.S. manufacturing through protective trade policies and for massive spending on highways, bridges and other public infrastructure.A lightly traded fund for much of its nearly three-year existence, the American Industrial Renaissance ETF saw trading pick up sharply after the Nov. 8 election. Its average daily volume was only about 10,000 shares before the election. After, average volume swelled more than 10-fold.The ETF's 45 holdings include Oshkosh (OSK), the maker of military vehicles, firetruck manufacturer Federal Signal (FSS), heavy construction company MasTec (MTZ) and big rig brand Navistar (NAV). Rail equipment, electrical products and construction engineering are some other industries in the exchange traded fund.The ETF, which was launched in 2014, tries to capture the American industrial renaissance, a trend that finds many companies bringing their manufacturing back from overseas, says Ryan Issakainen, senior vice president and ETF strategist for First Trust, in Wheaton, Ill.To ensure an American focus, companies with foreign sales greater than 25% are excluded. About 10% of the fund is invested in banks that operate in states considered to be traditional manufacturing hubs, such as the Rust Belt. As such, they are the financing arm of industry.Those stocks have had a renaissance of their own since the election, as a combination of rising yields and likelihood of reduced regulations sent buyers swarming into banking shares.The ETF is forming a base with a potential buy point at 25.38. Shares are finding support at the 50-day moving average, which bodes well for a possible move to new highs. The ETF has been consolidating since mid-December. Before that, it surged as much as 29% from the close on Election Day.American Industrial Renaissance's 43% advance in 2016 made it its best year ever. A 15.4% jump made the fourth quarter the fund's best ever also. Total returns fell 9.45% in 2015 and since its inception in March 2014 they are up about 6.5%.The ""RBA"" of the ETF's name comes from Richard Bernstein Advisors, the firm that created the index on which American Industrial Renaissance is based. The 45 components are small- and midcap companies. There's not much difference in how each component is weighted. The biggest, Wabash National (WNC), has 3.4% and the smallest (all of them banks) have 0.5%.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

1190,NOV,"There was always something fishy about the outbreak of ""spontaneous"" protests at airports around the country in the immediate wake of President Trump's executive order pausing visas and refugees from terror-prone countries.Not that you'd suspect anything from the way they were covered. Nearly every story published over that weekend stated without equivocation that the protests were an unplanned and visceral reaction to Trump's executive order. Examples:""Spontaneous Protests Hit Airports Across America Following Trump's Executive Order""""Protest Grows 'Out of Nowhere' at Kennedy Airport""""The senseless cruelty of the executive order has led to spontaneous protests at many of America's major airports.""""Word of the spontaneous demonstration was spread across social media.""But these protests weren't spontaneous at all. They were, in fact, the result of months of careful planning by hard-core left-wing activist groups.""News reports and TV broadcasts about the week's protests described the events as 'spontaneous protests' mounted in response to the Trump administration's travel and immigration executive order,"" author Asawin Suebsaeng writes at the liberal leaning Daily Beast. ""But to Make the Road New York, and the groups like it across the country, there was nothing 'spontaneous' about it.""Suebsaeng notes that ""professional organizers had been waiting and planning for this type of mass, direct action — ready-made to go viral on social media — even since, well Nov. 9."" These professional organizers, he says have been ""anticipating and mapping out their battle plans for Trump's orders on deportations, bans, and detention.""The executive director of the Arab American Action Network told Suebsaeng that ""we had been laying the groundwork for this for a long, long time.""Since Trump had made clear that he planned — on day one, in fact — to issue a temporary ban on visas and refugees from terror prone countries, all these groups had to do was wait until he made good on that pledge to spring into action.What's amazing isn't the planning or the execution of these protests, but the fact that the media acted as though it was all happening without any planning or coordination at all.This was important because making the protests appear spontaneous gave them a sense of urgency and legitimacy they otherwise wouldn't have had.As the Huffington Post put it: ""These powerful images show Americans everywhere rallying against the president's immigration crackdown.""Did these news outlets know that the airport protests had been carefully planned? Or that stories they were getting about disarray and families torn apart were being fed to them by activist groups?After all, the organizations involved in planning the ""spontaneous"" protests all seemed eager to share their successes with the Daily Beast, including about how they were in ""constant contact with … lawyers' associations, lawmakers, reporters … .""The fact that the mainstream press either ignorantly fell for — or were active participants in — what amounts to anti-Trump agitprop calls into question much of the rest of the coverage about these events. How much of what was being reported as fact was actually made up or wildly exaggerated by professional activists?We learned earlier this week, for example, that a widely reported story about a 75-year old mother who died in Iraq after being barred from re-entering the U.S. was a complete lie made up by Iraq-born Mike Hager, who now lives in Michigan.An in-house ad on The New York Times' homepage says: ""The truth is hard to find."" That's true.

1191,NOV," The market sell-off showed little signs of applying the brakes in the dying minutes of Tuesday's session. Banking, biotech and select metals firms including steel production and metal ores led the decline.With minutes left in the session, the Nasdaq composite accelerated its drop in the final hour of trading, falling 1.8% as large and megacap techs retreated. It's clearly going to be the Nasdaq's biggest single-session drop since the Nov. 8 U.S. elections.The S&P 500 was down nearly 1%. The Dow Jones industrial average provided no relief as it too fell more than 0.9%. Volume expanded sharply vs. Monday, meaning that it is likely to be a true distribution day, or session of intense professional selling.A spate of four or five such distribution days is enough to end a bull market, or at the minimum trigger a mild correction in the range of 5% to 10%.Small caps took bigger hits as the Russell 2000 fell more than 2.6% and dipped back into slightly negative ground for the year. In 2016, the popular small-cap equity index rallied 19.5%. Major Wall Street banks sold off on growing concern about what impact Britain's future exit from the eurozone will have on London's status as a major banking center.Goldman Sachs (GS), which announced that it will move hundreds of employees out of the United Kingdom capital in preparation for the changes, dropped 8.32 points, or more than 3%, and slumped sharply below its 50-day moving average. Volume was running about 26% above average levels.The Wall Street bank, which has thrived by recent movement in U.S. Treasury bonds, is triggering its first major sell signal since breaking out of a long first-stage base with a 172.52 buy point in late October. The gain reached as high as 48%, big enough to have justified taking profits on the way up.One could decide to sell at least half a position bought at the proper entry, then see if the Dow Jones industrials component can rebound back to its 50-day line. For now, shares are trading less than 9% below the 255.15 high.Fellow money-center banks — Bank of Montreal (BMO) and Royal Bank of Canada (RY), as well as Morgan Stanley (MS) — are also down between 0.5% and 4% and showing weak action near their respective 50-day lines. Superregional lender SVB Financial (SIVB) took out its 50-day moving average for the first time since its early October breakout from a large bottoming-style base. Shares in the Santa Clara, Calif., firm slumped more than 6% to 175.84 in more than double average trade. At its 198.83 peak, SVB rose as much as 76% from the 112.93 handle entry.Also in IBD's superregional bank industry group, Dallas-based Comerica (CMA) and SunTrust Banks (STI) of Atlanta dropped more than 5% in heavy turnover and triggered the 50-day line sell rule.Phoenix-based Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL), a top-rated company in IBD's West/Southwest bank group, got slammed with a 7% drop to 47.05, also sinking below its 50-day line in volume running nearly four times usual levels.The stock also triggered the golden rule of selling by falling more than 7% below a recent new flat base entry at 50.82.IBD 50 stocks were not immune to the blanket-like sell-off.China's top internet video game firm NetEase (NTES) slid nearly 4% to 282.59. Yet for now, the stock is holding above its fast-rising 50-day moving average and keeping the air pocket created by an earnings-inspired Feb. 16 big gap up in price. The stock is also still extended more than 5% past a 257.78 cup-with-handle entry point.Cognex (CGNX) and Veeva Systems (VEEV) both fell more than 2% in heavy trading. The former has already gained more than 50% since clearing a 53.55 flat-base entry, while the latter pulled back near a 48.05 flat-base buy point. Yet Veeva has also risen significantly since it broke out of a first-stage bottoming base pattern at 28.05 in May 2016.Keeping gains by selling at least half the position after the rally has exceeded 20% to 25% is a smart portfolio management technique for your growth stocks.On the upside, Wynn Resorts (WYNN) is staging an eighth straight up-day, rising 1% to 112.93. That pushed the gaming resort operator's advance to 8% past a 104.49 buy point, in a choppy cup-with-handle base — so shares are extended. Wynn has large operations in Macau, the island territory of China where casino gambling is legalized. Wall Street sees full-year profit rising 27% to $4.29 a share in 2017, then up another 16% to $4.99 in 2018.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Should You Sell These 7 Dow-30 Stocks?When To Sell A Stock: Take Profits When 2 Or More Key Rules Get TriggeredWhen To Sell A Stock II: Use The 50-Day Moving Average As A Guide

1192,NOV,"Janet Yellen's soothing words on the pace of U.S. interest rate hikes were a day late for hedge funds losing faith in the metal.Money managers cut their bullish bets on bullion by the most since 2015 in the week ended March 14. The next day, Federal Reserve Chair Yellen reiterated that monetary policy will remain accommodative for ""some time,"" easing market fears that there might be more than three rate hikes this year. Her words sparked the biggest gold rally since November.Gold, which climbed through the first two months of the year, had foundered in March as the prospect of higher borrowing costs curbed the appeal of non-interest-bearing assets. Yellen's remarks came as the Bank of Japan maintains its unprecedented monetary easing program and the Bank of England holds its benchmark rate at a record low, helping to keep yields on trillions of dollars worth of debt below zero.""The fact that we still have stimulative measures, the fact that we still have negative rates out there — that generates uncertainty in people's minds,"" said George Milling-Stanley, the head of gold strategy at State Street Global Advisors, which oversees $2.47 trillion. ""There's still an awful lot of things out there that are supportive of gold in the short- to long-term.""The funds reduced their gold net-long position, or the difference between bets on a price increase and wagers on a decline, by 47% to 49,835 futures and options contracts in the week ended March 14, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released three days later. That was the biggest decline since December 2015.As traders awaited the Fed meeting, gold futures in New York dropped in the first part of last week. Yellen's statement on March 15 then reversed those losses, sending the metal up 2.5% to $1,230.20 an ounce at the close on March 17, the biggest two-day gain since Nov. 2. Prices rose 0.2% on Monday to $1,233.20 at 12:20 p.m. on the Comex in New York.Yields on more than $8 trillion in government and corporate debt in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index of investment-grade bonds have fallen below zero, meaning they're certain to lose money if held to maturity. While the Fed funds rate rose by a quarter point to 0.75% to 1% last week, that upper-band of the range is still well below the average of 5.1% over the past four decades.The negative yields give an advantage to gold, which some investors consider a store of value and a hedge against inflation.There are other tailwinds supporting bullion. Standard Chartered analyst Suki Cooper said political uncertainties from the French elections to the U.K.'s formal exit from the European Union will bolster haven demand. Price dips toward $1,200 are ""attractive entry levels,"" she said in a report March 16. A pickup in seasonal demand from India also limits the downside risk in the near-term, Cooper said.Gold imports by India, which competes with China for the role of world's biggest consumer, jumped 175% to 96.4 metric tons in February from a year earlier, according to a person familiar with provisional data from the finance ministry who asked not to be identified as the data aren't public. Jewelers boosted stockpiles before the festival and wedding period that starts next month.The precious metal's rebound has also been driven in part by risks to global growth, the lack of clarity on U.S. tax reform and ""persistent doubts"" about the U.S. infrastructure plan by President Donald Trump, Morgan Stanley analysts including Tom Price wrote in a note March 13. Still, they said they remain ""long-term bears because of stable global growth, and ""pro-active inflation management.""Investors also may be underestimating how eventual monetary tightening could hurt the appeal of precious metals, said Chad Morganlander, a money manager at Stifel, Nicolaus in Florham Park, N.J., where he helps oversee more than $200 billion. Fed policymakers have penciled in two more quarter-point rate increases this year and three in 2018.""The broader trend is still negative"" for gold, said Rob Haworth, a Seattle-based senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, which oversees $138 billion. ""It's going to be hard to sustain the gains with economic growth still pretty solid, the Fed looking to raise rates and some prospect for fiscal policy support before year end.""

1193,NOV,"The major indexes nursed tiny declines in late trading Monday, but a look at the market internals suggests that many stocks need to catch their breath after last week's sharp rebound.Within both the Nasdaq and the NYSE, declining stocks outweighed gainers by around a 3-2 ratio. However, more stocks were poking past old 52-week and all-time highs than new lows.The Nasdaq composite, up nearly 0.7% last week, edged less than 0.2% lower. The S&P 500 was off nearly 0.3%. But the Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average were just fractionally lower.The Russell 2000, up an impressive 1.9% last week, fell 0.5% with minutes left in the session.Despite the dull action, at least 10 of IBD's 197 industry groups posted gains of 0.5% or more, including retail and wholesale jewelry, gold mining, construction and mining machinery, biotech, paper and containers.Topping the heap were the fabless semiconductor firms, up 1.4% as a group. The 38-member industry group is actually lagging the key benchmarks with a 5.5% gain since Jan. 1. However, it has no fewer than 21 names with a Relative Price Strength Rating of 80 or higher, 14 of which trade at least 10 a share.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) surged more than 6% to 14.38, benefiting from a price target hike from analysts at Jefferies and Susquehanna. Volume is likely to finish more than 20% above its 50-day average turnover of 70.4 million shares.The company is earning praise for the recent launch of the Ryzen 7 CPU processor, which may gain some market share from arch rival Intel (INTC).Advanced Micro, a turnaround play, has rallied more than 103% since it broke out of a cup-with-handle pattern at 7.63 on Nov. 16. While that breakout price is below the ideal minimum level of 10 a share, Advanced Micro had found bullish support near the 50-day moving average while sculpting the base. Also at the time, as seen in a daily chart, Advanced Micro was trading on average more than $300 million in dollar volume, posing no liquidity problems at all for the individual investor.Plus, Advanced Micro offered a second chance to buy shares as it fell during the first three weeks of 2017 but got rock-solid support at the 50-day line near 10.Other fabless semiconductor names worth watching: Silicon Laboratories (SLAB): The small-cap mixed signal chip designer, up 0.3% to 73.50, recently tested its 69.05 flat-base entry. A flat base, one of the most important chart patterns that great stocks form before breaking out to new highs, must be a minimum five weeks long. The decline within the base cannot exceed 15% from the highest price on the left side of the base.Silicon Lab's Q1 profit is seen rising 18% to 60 cents a share.Marvell Technology (MRVL): The midcap play in chips for telecom equipment and data networking gear edged up to 16.17, up 7% past a 15.09 flat-base entry.Broadcom (AVGO): The global semiconductor giant has a big presence in smartphones, telecom equipment, data storage and automotive markets. The big-cap firm is extended now, up 23% past a 179.52 flat-base entry.Broadcom, formed by the merger with Singapore-based Avago Technologies, gets a maximum 99 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. Earnings have vaulted from a Great Recession low of 64 cents a share in FY 2009 (ended in October) to $11.75 a share in FY 2016. In the current fiscal year ending in October, Wall Street sees Broadcom's profit rising 26% to $14.85 a share. MaxLinear (MXL): The small-cap firm specializing in integrated circuits for broadband cable set-top boxes is forming a new flat base-like structure with a 27.60 entry.MaxLinear faces some very tough year-over-year comps. Q1 profit is seen dropping 37% to 31 cents a share after a 390% surge in the year-ago quarter. The company acquired wireless infrastructure and related assets from Microsemi and Broadcom in April and May last year.Cavium (CAVM): The networking and telecom gear chip firm is extended from a 66.22 buy point in a long, deep cup with handle.Semtech (SMTC): Finding nice support along its 10-week moving average. The analog and mixed-signal IC designer has risen 21% past a 28.30 entry in a long bottoming base pattern. On the downside, department store chains were among the hardest hit in the stock market today.Macy's (M), which joined IBD Leaderboard as a short-sale idea on March 6, fell more than 3% to 29.51 and is on track to post its lowest close in more than six weeks. The stock gave a short-sale signal when it crossed back below its falling 50-day moving average near 32 on March 3.Macy's trades on average 9.6 million shares each day and has an 8 RS Rating on a scale of 1 (worst) to 99 (best). Earnings per share have fallen 8%, 9%, 29%, 16%, 70% and 3% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters.RELATED:Stock Market Today I: Should You Sell These 7 Dow Industrials Names?Stock Market Today II: Will More Companies Emerge From Bottoming Base Patterns?How To Invest: Tracking The Top 40 Industry Groups Helps Uncover WinnersHow To Invest: Read The Big Picture Each Day To Know The General Trend

1196,NOV,"Each month, the IBD/TIPP poll, a collaboration between Investor's Business Daily and TechnoMetrica, produces an exclusive Presidential Leadership Index. This index combines results from several questions in the monthly IBD/TIPP poll to gauge how well the president is viewed when it comes to leading the country, both domestically and internationally.The index includes questions on presidential approval, favorability measures on the president's handling of domestic and foreign policy issues, as well as whether the president is providing strong or weak leadership.In addition, IBD/TIPP each month asks questions focused on the public's outlook overall. These questions include satisfaction with the direction of the country, a forecast about people's quality of life, and an index of the U.S. standing in the world.IBD/TIPP also produces the Economic Optimism Index at the beginning of each month.See the schedule of upcoming IBD/TIPP poll releases.The IBD/TIPP Presidential Leadership Index edged down in January, reflecting the public's final view of President Obama before he leaves office. The Presidential Leadership Index dates back to January 2001, when it stood at 64.6 for the newly inaugurated President Bush.The Leadership Index jumped to 71 in President Obama's first full month in office, but was never anywhere near that level for the rest of his two terms. In his last year in office, it averaged 51.President Obama's approval rating dropped a point in January to 57. This is still higher than his overall average, which was around 50 for his eight years in office. Since IBD/TIPP started polling on presidential approval, the highest it ever got since January 2001 was 88.7 under President Bush. The lowest was 27.8, also for President Bush.The public's satisfaction with the direction of the country increased again in January to 41, despite the fact that Democrats have turned sharply negative on this question since Donald Trump won the election. The average for Obama's presidency is a dismal 36.9. The index has been trending steadily downward since the early 2000s.This index took a big jump in January, climbing nearly 7 points to 59.6. The average under President Obama was 53.7. Unlike other measures, this has been relatively steady for the past 16 years. It peaked at 63.1 in January 2004. It's lowest level was 43.5 in June 2008.Another measure included in the monthly IBD/TIPP poll tracks the public's view of the U.S. standing in the world. This dipped slightly in January to 48.2. That is still higher than had it had been the previous year, when it was in the 30s. This index peaked in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, reaching 74.9. It jumped again after President Obama won the election in November 2008, hitting 65.3 that month. It reached its nadir in Nov. 2013, in the wake of the debt ceiling crisis and the two-week government shutdown in October.RELATED:Main IBD/TIPP Poll PageIBD/TIPP Economic Optimism IndexIBD/TIPP Election 2016 Tracking PollPast ResultsDecember 2016 Media ContactTerry Jones

1201,NOV,"Oil fell from a one-month high Thursday amid signs that OPEC will have to make further cuts to fully comply with last year's historic production deal.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut output by 840,000 barrels a day last month, according to a Bloomberg survey. Nigeria, Libya and Iran, which are exempt from the curbs, boosted production by a combined 270,000 barrels. Prices climbed earlier after President Donald Trump said that Iran has been ""put on notice"" for testing ballistic missiles. U.S. crude supplies rose to the highest level since August last week, government data show.Oil has fluctuated above $50 a barrel since 11 nations including Russia last month joined with OPEC to trim supply. While Middle Eastern producers from Saudi Arabia to Iraq have implemented cuts and Russia says it's ahead of schedule with its own reduction, wary investors are also considering signs that U.S. drillers are taking advantage of higher prices to stage a comeback.""We're trying to asses a lot of moving parts,"" Tim Evans, an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York, said by phone. ""We're trying to figure out just how good compliance has been with OPEC's production numbers. We need to pay attention to more than the overall production number.""West Texas Intermediate for March delivery declined 34 cents, or 0.6%, to settle at $53.54 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures touched $54.34, the highest intraday price since Jan. 3. Total volume traded was about 15% below the 100-day average.Brent for April settlement slipped 24 cents to $56.56 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark closed at a $2.39 premium to April WTI.OPEC pumped 32.3 million barrels a day in January, the Bloomberg survey of analysts, oil companies and ship-tracking data showed. The 10 members of the group that pledged to make cuts implemented 83% of those reductions on average, but their efforts were offset by gains from Iran, Nigeria and Libya.Accounting for the members who raised output and the suspension of Indonesia, OPEC's total output remains 550,000 barrels a day above the target set out in the Nov. 30 deal. That means the group as a whole is only about 60% of the way toward the production level it deems necessary to eliminate a global oversupply and boost prices.""Bloomberg data shows that OPEC needs to make additional cuts,"" Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, said by telephone.U.S. crude stockpiles rose for a fourth week to 494.8 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday. Inventories of gasoline and distillate fuel also expanded last week.

1204,NOV,"After failing in its attempt to delegitimize and defeat Donald Trump through persistently negative coverage of the candidate throughout the recent campaign, the establishment news media might have been expected to acknowledge its failures and make some effort toward restoring objectivity to journalism.However, the American public, which has lost confidence in the news media due to its antagonistic approach to President Trump and his supporters, has little hope that the media will cover the Trump presidency in a fair and objective way, according to the findings of a recent Investor's Business Daily/TIPP Poll.For much of our nation's history, the press earned the trust of the American people with a tradition of objective reporting aimed at providing the public with the facts. During the American Revolution, newspapers were instrumental in both keeping colonists engaged in the effort and inspiring many to join the fight.Nearly 200 years later, the Washington Post's coverage of the Watergate scandal also demonstrated how American journalism, when dedicated to the pursuit of the truth, can shake up the power structures and create change.However, the media elite's relentlessly negative and antagonist coverage of Trump, both before and after the election, has damaged trust in the news media, giving rise to a significant credibility gap between the establishment news media and the American people.The public's growing distrust of the establishment news media has been captured by a number of recent polls.According to an IBD/TIPP Poll conducted in December, more than half of Americans (55%) report they have less trust in the news media as a result of its coverage of the 2016 election. While Republicans hold the highest share of Americans (71%) who are losing faith in the news media, a majority of independents (56%) also say that they trust the media less in the wake of the recent election.In addition, a Media Research Center/YouGov Poll conducted between Nov. 9 and 10 found that nearly 7 in 10 voters (69%) do not feel that the news media are honest and truthful. Further, according to a Gallup Poll conducted in September, only 32% of respondents report having a great deal or fair amount of trust in the media's ability ""to report the news fully, accurately and fairly,"" the lowest level in the poll's history of gauging confidence in the media.The American people's waning confidence in the news media is largely due to its overwhelmingly negative coverage of Donald Trump throughout the presidential campaign. While enclosed in their bubble of cosmopolitan elitism, the media ran story after story that promoted the narrative that Trump was a racist demagogue bent on destroying American democracy. In doing so, the media sought to cast Donald Trump as unfit for the presidency, and to discourage his supporters from voting.The establishment media's credibility was further marred by most pundits' and pollsters' pre-election prognostications of a stinging defeat for Trump. Pointing to numerous polls that gave Hillary Clinton a comfortable lead, many journalists and media pundits called the race for the Democrat days before the election.As one example, Washington Post columnist George F. Will echoed many of his media peers as he predicted a landslide victory for Clinton, in an article titled, ""Donald Trump may find a place in history — by losing just that badly.""Further, nearly all the election models published by media organizations had Hillary Clinton as the odds-on favorite to win the presidency. Heading into Election Day, the New York Times' The Upshot put the Democrat's chance of winning at 85%, while giving Trump a mere 15% chance to prevail. The Huffington Post's forecast was even more favorable to Clinton, assigning her a 98% chance of becoming president, and predicting a landslide 323 electoral-vote victory for the Democrat.Thus, as Election Day showed, the media elite's attempts to sway the election by painting Trump as a dangerous and unhinged candidate were not only unsuccessful, but also self-defeating. By the end of the campaign, most Americans perceived the media's anti-Trump bias.For instance, an Associated Press-GfK Poll released at the end of October 2016 revealed that 56% of likely voters believed the media are biased against Trump, with a mere 5% saying that they were biased in his favor. Further, nearly 9 in 10 Trump supporters (87%) felt that the media were biased against their candidate.Americans' awareness of the establishment media's opposition to Trump was also uncovered in an IBD/TIPP Poll in September. According to the poll, the share of registered voters who perceived the media's coverage of Donald Trump as being ""too tough"" (33%) was twice what it was for Hillary Clinton (16%).Accordingly, in opposing Donald Trump through a constant barrage of negative news stories, the news media unwittingly set itself against a large segment of the population that felt Trump gave a voice to their discontent. During a campaign that witnessed a surge in populist sentiment, many of Trump's supporters, particularly working class Americans, perceived that their values were being derided by the media elite. They rallied behind the candidate who also faced the media's disdain — and who was successfully fighting back.This was explained brilliantly by Fox News media reporter Howard Kurtz during an appearance on America's Newsroom the day after the election: ""A lot of the people who support him (Trump) or are inclined to support him despise the media, see us, collectively part of the establishment, and he was fighting against us. He was fighting for them.""Thus, in electing Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States, the American people have dealt the establishment media — which strongly opposed Trump throughout the campaign and expected him to lose handily — a striking repudiation, putting its credibility on life support.Despite being handed what amounts to a vote of no confidence from American voters, the news media do not appear to be ready to return to objectivity any time soon. In fact, the media's coverage of Trump has only become more negative and hostile since Election Day, as Democratic-leaning pundits and journalists attempt to delegitimize the Trump presidency.The news media have devoted much coverage to reports of Russia's alleged hacking into the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign in order to promote the narrative that Trump was illegitimately elected. Although there is no credible evidence to suggest that Russian interference had swayed the outcome of the election, the media has used the story to insinuate that Trump may have been elected with help from the foreign power.Hence, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, in a piece published on Dec. 12, claimed that the 2016 presidential election was a ""tainted election,"" which Trump won ""only thanks to foreign intervention and grotesquely inappropriate, partisan behavior on the part of domestic law enforcement.""Various television news programs also used reports of alleged Russian election meddling to cast doubt on the legitimacy of a Trump presidency.For instance, on the Dec. 11 installment of ""Face the Nation,"" host John Dickerson and Slate correspondent Jamelle Bouie discussed ""new"" information gathered by the intelligence community which, says Dickerson, indicated that Russian interference was ""targeted to help Donald Trump.""During the segment, Bouie explained how this ""news"" could call into question the legitimacy of the recent election: ""If it is true, if we have further verification of this, then what it suggests potentially is that the election was in some sense illegitimate.""Further, appearing on ""Good Morning America"" last month, ABC Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl related to anchor George Stephanopoulos how it was unlikely that Trump would retaliate against Russia for alleged hacking activity since it ""arguably helped him get elected president.""Some in the media went beyond insinuation, unabashedly declaring that Vladimir Putin and Russia were directly responsible for the election of Donald Trump.On MSNBC's ""Hardball"" at the end of December, Jason Johnson, politics editor for the Root, referred to the election as an ""amazing coup"" by Putin, who ""took over the United States and got himself a Manchurian candidate.""Not to be outdone, Keith Olbermann, host of the webshow ""The Resistance"" for GQ.com, has referred to Trump as a ""puppet of Putin"" and lamented that, as a result of Russian interference in the recent election, ""we are no longer a democracy, we are no longer a free people, we are the victims of a bloodless coup.""It is not surprising, therefore, that some have even considered the possibility of holding another presidential election, a ""redo"" of sorts, over alleged Russian interference. For instance, in an appearance on ""CNN Newsroom"" the day after the Washington Post published its story on the CIA's assessment of Russian meddling, Robert Baer, an intelligence and security analyst for CNN, stated that, if Russia interfered in the election, ""I don't see any other way than to vote again.""The media elite's eagerness to delegitimize the Trump presidency was most evident when CNN and BuzzFeed reported on a suspect intelligence report that claims Russia holds compromising information on Trump which could be used for blackmail. Buzzfeed's publication of the unverified dossier, which contained salacious allegations against Trump, was roundly criticized, even by some in the establishment media, such as the Atlantic and Vox.In a recent interview on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Bob Woodward of Watergate fame referred to the dossier as a ""garbage document"" that should never have been published.However, Trump may actually benefit from this blatant attempt by the media to undermine his presidency. CNN and Buzzfeed's reporting on the unsubstantiated document, which contains bizarre allegations that are obviously fictitious, gave credence to Trump's claims of media bias. It also demonstrates why the media have lost so much credibility in the eyes of the American people.Besides attempting to delegitimize the Trump presidency, the media elite have also tried to cast doubt on Trump's fitness to serve, both morally and mentally. For example, a number of media pundits and columnists have claimed that racism played a significant role in Trump's victory, and have stoked fears that his presidency would resemble an authoritarian regime.Soon after Trump won, CNN's Van Jones declared on air that the election ""was a white-lash against a changing country, it was a white-lash against a black president.""In a Dec. 7 article for the New York Times, columnist Andrew Rosenthal also suggested that Trump ran a racist campaign, claiming that it offered ""a platform to white supremacists."" He chastised Trump supporters who, wittingly or not, voted for ""a candidate who espoused racism and xenophobia and told lie after lie without remorse.""Some in the media portrayed Trump as an authoritarian, even before he officially took office. On ""Meet the Press"" in late December, MSNBC correspondent Joy Reid expressed concern that, by electing Trump, America could ""slip casually into authoritarianism,"" as his approach to government already contains, in her words, ""some real elements of authoritarianism.""Daily Beast contributor Dean Obeidallah echoed these fears, but with more specificity. On the Dec. 9 edition of CNN's ""New Day,"" Obeidallah accused Trump of creating a cabinet that amounted to a ""dream team of anti-Muslim hate.""Some in the media elite have even questioned the state of Trump's mental health. In an article titled ""Is Donald Trump Mentally Ill? 3 Professors Of Psychiatry Ask President Obama To Conduct 'A Full Medical And Neuropsychiatric Evaluation,' "" Richard Greene of the Huffington Post claimed that Trump satisfies the criteria of a ""narcissistic personality disorder,"" and thus represents a ""serious danger to the country and the world.""Questioning a president's moral and mental fitness could be dismissed as partisan attacks or as talking points aimed at boosting support. However, as the Washington Post's Richard Cohen demonstrates in his Jan. 9 piece, ""How to Remove Trump From Office,"" some may be questioning Trump's fitness to have him impeached. Cohen writes that Trump should be subject to ""impeachment by the House and conviction by the Senate,"" using the 25th Amendment, which he says provides a way to remove a president from office if he or she is ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.""As grounds for this, Cohen cites Trump's alleged bullying, lying and demagoguery: ""Donald Trump is a one-man basket of deplorables. He is a braggart and a liar. He is a bully and a demagogue. He is an ignoramus and a deadbeat, a chiseler and either a sincere racist or an insincere one, and his love for himself is matched only by my loathing of him. He is about to be president of the United States. A constitutional coup may be in the offing.""However, as was the case before the election, Americans recognize the news media's anti-Trump frenzy and have little hope the media elite will cover Trump's presidency in an objective way. In our latest IBD/TIPP Poll, nearly half of respondents (45%) believe that the news media are rooting for President Trump's failure, compared with 10% who say that the media want him to succeed. Meanwhile, only 38% of Americans report that the media are indifferent to Trump's success or failure.It is not surprising, therefore, that the public is highly skeptical that the media will fairly cover Trump. According to our poll, 49% of Americans feel that the news media will be ""too tough"" in their coverage, while just 24% say the coverage will be fair and balanced. Digging deeper, nearly 9 in 10 Republicans (85%) and close to half of independents (48%) expect the media's coverage of President Trump to be ""too tough.""Thus, if the establishment media maintains its negative coverage of Trump, in which nearly every move he makes is subjected to excessive outrage from pundits and columnists, they risk widening their credibility gap with the American people, and will continue to lose to a president who knows how to take on the media and win.The media's antagonistic coverage of Trump insults the intelligence of Americans, who are beginning to tune out.

1205,NOV,"Exchange traded funds tracking major indexes made little to no headway Thursday as investors digested reports of a ratcheting-up in geopolitical tensions.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) edged up 0.1% on the stock market today, led higher by the defensively oriented real estate, utilities and consumer staples sectors.Investors turned cautious amid news that President Trump recently butted heads with the leaders of Mexico and Australia as he follows through on his tough campaign talk on immigration.Gold prices advanced to their best level in nearly three months, a day after the Federal Reserve stood pat on interest rates. The dollar slumped against major world currencies in early trade, before paring losses.Policymakers on Wednesday reiterated their view of an improving U.S. economy, but offered no clues about the exact timing of the next rate hike.That was positive for gold, which tends to come under pressure from rising interest rates. Gold, a safe-haven asset, bears no yield and struggles to compete with yield-bearing rival assets when rates rise.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) popped as much as 1.9% in early trading to hit its best level since mid-November before easing to a 0.6% gain.VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) and VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) advanced more than 2% each, while Global X Silver Miners (SIL) added 1.4%.The SDPR gold ETF sits 11% below its July high of 131.15. It slumped hard in the stock market euphoria that followed the Nov. 8 election, but has rallied 5.1% year to date.""After traders and investors had a chance to mull over the FOMC statement from the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday afternoon, most are deeming the report as slightly dovish on U.S. monetary policy,"" Jim Wyckoff, a Kitco senior technical analyst, wrote early Thursday. ""That's bullish for the raw commodity sector, including the precious metals.""Uncertainty regarding the new U.S. president and his administration has driven up haven demand for gold, he added.IBD'S TAKE: As the Trump agenda emerges, read IBD Leaderboard and The Big Picture every day to see how market leaders are performing and to assess whether the stock market has more room to run.Here's a look at the performance of major exchange traded funds across key asset classes on the stock market today.The Relative Price Strength (RS) Rating measures a stock's price performance over the last 12 months vs. all stocks and ETFs, on a scale of 1 to a best-possible 99.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), +0.1%, RS 52PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), -0.1%, RS 61SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), 0%, RS 59IShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH), +0.1%, RS 64IShares Russell 2000 (IWM), -0.3%, RS 71IShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), +0.1%, RS 41Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), +0.3%, RS 49SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), +0.6%, RS 17United States Oil (USO), +0.3%, RS 62IShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG), +0.1%, RS 20PowerShares DB U.S.$ Bullish (UUP), +0.2%, RS 36IPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (VXX), +0.5%, RS 1

"
1207,NOV,"The stock market behaved generally fine Thursday, one day after a rousing post-Fed rally that saw the major indexes climb between 0.5% and 1%. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.2% at 20,906, following a 0.5% advance Wednesday after the Federal Reserve hiked short-term interest rates by a quarter-point.The Nasdaq composite, beaming from a 0.7% rebound, was off just 0.1% with less than an hour to go in Thursday's trading session. The S&P 500 edged nearly 0.3% lower; the Russell 2000, Wednesday's big winner with a 1.5% splash higher, added 0.1%.Notice on a daily chart how the Russell 2000 also hoisted itself back above the 50-day moving average, a positive sign for a market uptrend that got triggered by a Day Three follow-through on June 30 last year.IBD's TAKE: To monitor these extremely critical junctures in the market, please read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to learn the concept of follow-throughs at market bottoms and heavy distribution at market tops.Meanwhile, big and megacap stocks, as viewed from the prism of the 30-member Dow Jones industrial average, continue to perform well and underscore the argument for favoring equities over bonds.While long-dated U.S. Treasury bonds in fact rose in price on Wednesday, following strong hints from the U.S. central bank that it desires to raise interest rates cautiously, rather than aggressively, the plain fact remains: The 2.51% yield on the 10-year bond still is inferior to the earnings yield of greater than 5% for S&P 500 companies.The earnings yield compares the current level of the S&P 500 with Wall Street's expectations for earnings over the next 12 months.In the Dow, companies such as Goldman Sachs (GS), Boeing (BA), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), DuPont (DD), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Visa (V) and Microsoft (MSFT) are showing relative strength in the market. That is, all seven of these firms hold decent IBD Relative Price Strength ratings that range from 69 (Microsoft) to 87 (Goldman).An 87 RS Rating means that Goldman is outperforming 87% of all companies in IBD's database over the past 12 months.(Please see the RS Rating of any stock by using IBD's premier time-saving tool, Stock Checkup).From a chart perspective, Goldman has been acting fabulously since it broke out past a 172.52 buy point within a long bottoming-base structure back in the fourth quarter of 2016.Notice how the expert in fixed income and commodities trading, and money center bank for large corporations, has found nice support during tests of the 50-day moving average. At its recent peak of 255.15, Goldman has risen as much as 47%.Wall Street sees Goldman's revenue slipping 12% in 2017 to $33.22 billion; however, earnings are seen rising 17% to $19.14 a share, following a disppointing 11% drop in 2016. And the Street also sees 2018 profit rising 13% to $21.63 a share.Boeing (89 Composite Rating at Stock Checkup; 93 Earnings Per Share Rating; FY 2017 EPS estimate +28%) also poses as a top-flight Trump-bump play, rising long before President Trump's unveiling on Wednesday of a budget that emphasizes the rebuilding of the U.S. military.Boeing shares are down just fractionally and not far off an all-time high of 185.71, up 33% past an aircraft carrier-sized saucer-base buy point of 139.55.UnitedHealth, Cisco and Microsoft have also performed well since their recent breakouts.UnitedHealth, the managed health care insurance giant, spent just three days below the 50-day moving average during a brief hiccup of a decline from Feb. 17 to 21. Shares, down roughly 0.6% to 170.87, are up 20% past a 141.88 early buy point within a 13-week flat base.That flat base formed from July 20 to Oct. 17 of last year. One could have waited for the stock to move more than 10 cents past the base's left-side high of 144.48.On Nov. 9, notice on a daily chart how UnitedHealth tested shareholders' resolve with a wild session, falling as much as 4.7% to a session low of 136.22. Yet, that price did not trigger the golden rule of selling.Visa is up nearly 10% since clearing an 82.59 entry in a shallow saucer-with-handle base Jan. 24. Notice how the volume on that breakout day was watery thin, 21% below its 50-day average volume. The stock didn't make much headway, and soon tested that 82.59 buy point.Yet no sell signal was triggered. After a breakout, you only sell when the stock falls 7% to 8% below the proper entry in a good base.However, demand exploded for shares after the global consumer spending play gapped up 4.6% on Feb. 3, a day after Visa reported a 25% jump in fiscal Q1 adjusted profit, nearly matching the prior quarter's EPS gain of 26%. Q1 revenue surged 25% to $4.46 billion, the highest in more than four years.RELATED:How To Trade Snap: Why This New Stock Could Test Its IPO PriceStock Market Today: Why Are Homebuilders Leading The Market Upside?Stock Market Today: Should You Sell These 7 Stocks In The Dow Industrials?How To Invest: Why The Bottoming Base Pattern Matters For Investors TodayHow To Invest: Timeless Tips Of Stock Wisdom From a Wall Street Great

1210,NOV,"Veterinary tech company Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) is expected to report ""another good quarter"" early Thursday, Canaccord analyst Mark Massaro said Wednesday, as Idexx stock loitered in a buy zone for the 11th straight week.At the closing bell on the stock market today, Idexx shares ended trading up 0.4% to 122.80. Shares have lingered in a buy zone since Nov. 21 after hitting a 117.94 entry point out of a flat base formation.For Q4, the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects Idexx to report $435.8 million in sales and 51 cents diluted earnings per share, up a respective 9% and 6.3% vs. the year-earlier quarter.Massaro expects Idexx's 2017 guidance to be relatively unchanged from Q3, when Idexx saw $1.91 billion to $1.935 billion in sales and adjusted EPS of $2.77-$2.93. On a year-over-year basis, those figures would be up 20% and 35%, respectively, at the midpoints of guidance.The company provides laboratory diagnostics and related services for veterinarians.IBD'S TAKE: Companies with highly technical equipment, like Idexx, were on a roll early last year.

1211,NOV,"Oil rose to the highest close in more than three weeks Wednesday as the dollar retreated after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and as evidence mounts that OPEC and its partners are making promised output cuts.Futures advanced 2% in New York. Gains accelerated after the central bank's announcement sent the U.S. currency lower. Russia reduced oil output by 117,000 barrels a day last month, putting it ahead of schedule to fulfill its agreement with OPEC, Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Wednesday. The market shrugged off a government report showing that U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles climbed last week.Oil gained almost 15% the last two months of 2016 as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed on Nov. 30 to reduce supply, with 11 other nations including Russia joining the deal less than two weeks later. While Middle East producers implement the cuts, U.S. drillers targeting crude have increased the nation's rig count to the highest level since November 2015.""Any time the dollar comes under pressure, oil is going to rise,"" Thomas Finlon, director of Energy Analytics Group in Wellington, Fla., said by phone. ""We would have been up anyway because it looks like OPEC and non-OPEC compliance is quite good. It also helps that nobody is blatantly cheating yet.""West Texas intermediate crude for March delivery rose $1.07 to settle at $53.88 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It's the highest close since Jan. 6.Brent for April settlement climbed $1.22 to $56.80 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was also the highest close since Jan. 6. The global benchmark ended the session at a $2.31 premium to April WTI.Iraq, OPEC's second-largest producer, cut output by 180,000 barrels a day in January, according to SOMO, the state oil marketing company.""OPEC appears to be coming through with the cuts,"" Joe Bozoyan, an equity portfolio manager who helps oversee $5 billion in energy and utility shares at John Hancock in Boston, said by phone. ""We should start to see the market rebalance by the middle of the year.""U.S. crude supplies rose 6.47 million barrels to 494.8 million in the week ended Jan. 27, the highest since August, according to the Energy Information Administration. That was more than double the 3 million barrels predicted by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg before the report. Stockpiles at Cushing, Okla., the biggest U.S. storage hub and the delivery point for WTI, fell 1.25 million barrels.""We're looking beyond the weekly data and looking at OPEC compliance,"" Brian Kessens — a managing director and portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors in Leawood, Kan., who helps manage $16.3 billion in energy assets — said by phone. ""All signs are pointing to strong compliance by OPEC and its partners.""Refineries operated at 88.2% of capacity, the lowest since November. U.S. refineries usually start seasonal maintenance programs at this time of year, so that they are up and running before gasoline demand peaks in the summer.""I'm not too concerned about inventories at this time of year because refiners are performing seasonal maintenance,"" Bozoyan said.Gasoline stockpiles rose 3.87 million barrels to 257.1 million, the highest since February 2016. Inventories of distillate fuel, a category that includes diesel and heating oil, increased 1.57 million barrels to 170.7 million, the highest since October 2010.

1212,NOV,"If the Trump administration plans to target Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) on antitrust grounds, the Federal Trade Commission is the agency for investors to watch.President Trump has named Maureen Ohlhausen acting chairman of the FTC. She's a Republican member of the agency. Democratic Chairwoman Edith Ramirez, who has resigned, leaves the FTC on Feb. 10.Josh Wright, a former FTC commissioner, is also said to be in the running to replace Ramirez as chair, though he's also under consideration for a top Department of Justice post. Also said to be on Trump's FTC list is Sean Reyes, the attorney general of Utah.The FTC in 2013 ended a Google probe after the internet search giant agreed to voluntary changes to its business practices. The European Commission, though, is continuing an antitrust investigation.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix, Amazon, Dave & Buster's and Broadcom are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.If the European Commission takes action vs. Google in 2017, it would give president Trump an opening to restart a Google probe.Utah AG Reyes joined other state attorneys in 2016 in asking the FTC to consider reopening its antitrust probe of Google.Both commissioner Ohlhausen and Wright, on the other hand, ""have made statements that would seem encouraging for Google should either become FTC chair,"" said Paul Gallant, a Cowen & Co. analyst, in a research report Wednesday.Google stock fell 0.6% to 815.24 on the stock market today. Google stock now has fallen the past five trading days, going back to Jan. 26. Google stock has undercut its breakout at a buy point of 824.40 first touched on Jan. 6. Google stock traded down for six consecutive sessions following President Trump's Nov. 8 win, but it's up a fraction overall since then.Google has been aiming to improve relations with Republicans since Trump's election, the New York Times reported on Jan. 27. The article said Trump's advisors ""have debated"" whether Google deserves more antitrust scrutiny.Trump and tech industry leaders, meanwhile, clashed over new immigration policies.""Google is still viewed as a Democratic company in a Republican town, and (Alphabet Executive Chairman) Eric Schmidt's campaign efforts for Hillary Clinton may make Google more of a target,"" noted Gallant in the report.Aside from the FTC, the Federal Communications Commission may be another worry for Google. Trump has named Republican Ajit Pai as its new chairman. While a Republican-led FCC is expected to erase utility-type ""Title II"" regulation of the internet, another possibility is that Pai shifts net-neutrality enforcement to include companies like Google and Facebook (FB) as well as broadband service providers like AT&T (T) and Comcast (CMCSA).Europe's regulators, meanwhile, have charged Google with unfairly promoting its own services over rivals in shopping-search results and have been looking into its online advertising business. European antitrust regulators are also probing whether Google has abused its dominant market-share position with the Android mobile operating system.RELATED:Trump-Tech Honeymoon Over As Alphabet, Netflix Invited To Join Travel-Ban Suit

1213,NOV,"The closely watched FANG stocks (Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL)) all notched gains for January, although the big-cap tech stocks all fell a fraction again on Tuesday amid market anxiety over tumult in the Trump administration, and some tested buy points.Apple (AAPL), the other tech industry bellwether often lumped in with the FANGs, also rose for the month. Apple reports earnings after the market close Tuesday amid modest expectations. Apple stock slipped 0.28% in the stock market today to 121.29.January's gains offset a sell-off in the FANG stocks that followed Donald Trump's surprise win in November's election, as during his campaign Trump had championed non-tech industries such as coal while criticizing Apple and techs in general for doing so much manufacturing overseas.IBD'S TAKE:  Netflix — along with Dave & Busters, Glaukos and Broadcom — are among stocks on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks through their post-breakout action, up to where they start topping. The leaders are constantly monitored.Institutional investors rotated into infrastructure, banking and other sectors upon Trump's win, but the tech industry also could benefit from some of Trump's pledges, such as easing corporate taxes and regulations.This week, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Netflix top executives (and employees) have been among the biggest corporate critics of Trump's new immigration and travel restriction policies, vowing to continue to fight and resist the rules.Tech stocks sold off hard in January, 2015 but rebounded. Apple stock rose 10% in 2016, Amazon 11%, Facebook 10%, Netflix 8.3% and Alphabet almost 2%.Alphabet stock fell 0.44% to 820.19 on Tuesday, and it has undercut its breakout at a buy point of 824.40 first touched on Jan. 6.Alphabet stock, though, rose 3.5% in January and is up 1% since the close on Nov. 8, the date of the presidential election.Alphabet reported fourth-quarter results late Thursday, with the Mountain View, Calif.-based company missing views on earnings per share but topping expectations on revenue.Facebook stock fell 0.5% to 130.32 on Tuesday, but shares remain in a buy zone from their breakout last week at a 129.37.Facebook stock rose 13% in January and is up 4.5% since Nov. 8The social networking giant is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings after the market close Wednesday.Amazon stock fell 0.83% on Tuesday to 823.48, and near an 821.75 buy point the stock first touched on Jan. 24.Amazon gained 10% in January and 4.5% since the election.Seattle-based Amazon is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday after the market close.Netflix stock slipped 0.36% on Tuesday to 140.71, still extended from its last buy point at 129.40, out of a cup-with-handle base, first touched on Jan. 4.Netflix has climbed 13% in January and almost the same since Nov. 8.The web video streamer's stock is off its all-time high of 143.46, reached on Jan. 19 after it reported better-than-expected Q4 earnings.Apple broke out of a cup-with-handle base on Jan. 9, clearing a buy point at 118.12. Shares have inched their way higher.Analysts expect Apple to report a 2% revenue rise, ending three quarters of decline. They expect EPS to fall year over year for a fourth straight quarter, but only 2%, which would mark its best showing in a year.RELATED:What To Look For When Facebook Reports Q4 EarningsAmazon's Stellar Holiday Season Will Offset Continued Heavy Spending5 Key Takeaways From Netflix's Terrific Q4 Earnings ReportApple Seen Returning To Sales Growth In December Quarter

1215,NOV,"Oil prices on Tuesday surrendered gains since a November OPEC deal to curb output, worsening the slide in a flagship crude oil commodity exchange traded product and sending it to a fresh multimonth low.United States Oil (USO) dropped more than 2% to as low as 10.06 soon after the opening bell on the stock market today. The ETP has fallen steadily for six days through Monday.It now sits 18% below the June high of 12.45 as it fast approaches the Nov. 29 interim bottom of 9.97.An OPEC-led deal on Nov. 30 sparked an oil rally in December but the oil cartel warned on Tuesday that the supply glut continues to intensify despite efforts to cut production and prop up prices. Shale activity in the U.S. has offset the positives that came out of the OPEC deal, John Love, president and CEO of USCF, which runs United States Oil, told IBD recently.U.S. light sweet crude or West Texas Intermediate, tracked by United States Oil, fell 1.04 to 47.36 at 10:02 a.m. ET.Traders seized the opportunity to profit from the deepening rout in oil prices using exchange traded funds.Direxion Daily S&P Oil & Gas Exp. & Prod.

1217,NOV,"Stocks remained lower in afternoon trading Tuesday, although the main indexes came off session lows and were attempting to rebound.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell less than 0.5%. A midday bounce faded, but indexes were making a new bid to recover lost ground. The Dow Jones industrial average was off 0.2%.Selling was more intense in small caps and transportation shares. The Russell 2000 slid 0.9% while the Dow transports skidded 1.2%. Much of the weakness in the sector rested on airlines. Airlines were broadly weaker after a snowstorm hitting the Northeast forced the cancellation of thousands of flights.Notably in the group, Southwest Airlines (LUV) fell below its 50-day moving average in active turnover and is now 10% off its 52-week high.The energy sector dragged the market the most. Drilling, oil machinery, oil field service and exploration stocks were in the bottom of the  day's performance table. The losses extended to oil majors such as Chevron (CVX), which was off 1.5%.The price of U.S.-produced crude fell more than 2% to $47.38 a barrel, touching the lowest level since Nov. 15. Saudi Arabia said it raised its crude output last month. That raised fresh doubts about OPEC's efforts to limit output, and follows news that the Saudis warned oil producers they shouldn't assume that output cuts will be extended.Retail and consumer stocks were performing much better than the general market. Department stores, discount chains, apparel manufacturers and shoe makes were in Tuesday's top 10 industry groups. Wal-Mart (WMT) rallied 1.5% to 71 and climbed back above its 200-day moving average for the first time in more than a week. But scanning through those groups, there were few stocks making big strides, and many remain in depressed charts. Indeed, this is not exactly an area of emerging leadership.Willdan Group (WLDN) gave back 4% but remained extended from the 32.01 buy point it cleared Friday, following the company 260% surge in EPS.The industrial consulting firm is thinly traded, but has been a leading stock since a breakout in August. It now has top Relative Price Strength and Accumulation/Distribution ratings. The company gave a presentation at an investor conference Monday. Finisar (FNSR) slid nearly 4% and broke below the long-term 200-day moving average, an important yet relatively late sell signal.The fiber optics company had already triggered a sell signal Friday, when the stock plunged below the 50-day line in huge volume on disappointing earnings despite a 136% surge in profit, and a weak outlook.RELATED:Oil Falls Again As Saudis Report Output Hike After Warning U.S. Shale FirmsDelta, American, United Drop As Storm Forces Cancellations

1218,NOV,"Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 early Tuesday indicated a largely flat open. The big-cap Nasdaq 100 closed Monday just below all-time levels, helped by recent gains by tech titans Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).On Monday, the Nasdaq composite edged up 0.2%, its fourth straight slim gain. The Nasdaq 100 set a record close, less than four points below an intraday best. The S&P 500 rose less than a point while the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.1%.The Dow has been hurt by crude oil prices falling 10% over six straight sessions. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) have been the worst and third-worst Dow components so far in 2017. Chevron ended Monday at its worst close since Nov. 29.IBD'S TAKE: Here are three top stocks near a buy zone showing bullish action heading into the Fed's meeting.Meanwhile, Apple is the best-performing Dow component, up 20% so far in 2017. Apple rose about 0.1% on Monday to 139.20, less than 1% below its 140.15 all-time high.Facebook did hit an all-time high, gaining 0.6% to 139.58. Facebook shares have climbed steadily since Snap (SNAP) filed for its IPO on Feb. 2, continuing to ascend as the Snapchat operator priced and had its volatile debut.Amazon climbed 0.25% to 854.59 on Monday. Amazon is less than 1% below its all-time high.Netflix popped 1.9% to 143.52 on Monday, as it has consolidated for the past month since hitting a record 145.95 on Feb. 13.Google parent Alphabet rose 0.4% to 864.58, a new closing high. Alphabet rose to 867.13 intraday, a new all-time best and just above a 867.10 buy point in a short flat base following another flat base.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei was fractionally lower Tuesday intraday while China's Shanghai composite and Hong Kong's Hang Seng edged higher.The Federal Reserve begins a two-day policy meeting Tuesday, with markets expecting a quarter-point hike on Wednesday afternoon.

1219,NOV,"Momentum ETFs do well when there is sustained leadership in the stock market. When they struggle to catch a clear trend, these exchange traded funds can turn into laggards.So far in this young year through Jan. 31, iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor (MTUM) has a 3.2% gain vs. 1.8% for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY). But in 2016, as sectors swung into and out of favor in a rather dramatic fashion, MTUM gained 5% vs. an approximate 12% jump for the S&P 500.In fact, momentum strategies were among the poorest-performing diversified equity exchange traded funds last year. But they could be poised for a comeback.Like value and size, the momentum factor has been shown to historically offer attractive returns over a full market cycle. Unlike those factors, momentum is harnessed by just a handful of exchange traded funds.Here is a closer look at three popular momentum-based ETFs as they make or trade near 52-week highs:This $1.92 billion ETF also favors stocks with low volatility of returns, and it rebalances every six months.MTUM tends to hold a relatively small basket of large- and midcap stocks. Portfolio components that are making big price moves include Nvidia (NVDA), Sprint (S) and Micron Technology (MU).The biggest stocks in the portfolio include Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT).The ETF is overweight the economically sensitive technology sector, at a 39% portfolio weighting.A low 0.15% expense ratio gives the iShares momentum ETF a cost edge over its rivals.Since its April 2013 inception, MTUM has gained 54% vs. 47% for SPY over the same period.The relative strength analysis is conducted twice monthly.This $2.64 billion ETF currently invests its assets across the technology, utilities, industrials and energy sectors.Its holdings are well positioned going forward, said Ryan Issakainen, ETF strategist at First Trust.""It makes sense to be in cyclical sectors like industrials"" in the new political regime, Issakainen told IBD in a phone call. And while the utilities sector is defensively oriented, it ""brings balance"" to the FV portfolio, he added.FV is up 3% year to date but posted a 0.5% loss in 2016. It was hurt last year by its big stakes in health care and biotech — sectors whose underperformance ""frankly had to do with politics"" in an election year, Issakainen said.He takes issue with the notion of momentum strategies being like ""the guest who shows up late to the party and stays too late.""""What that criticism misses is that a momentum strategy is never going to get you in at the bottom and out at the top,"" Issakainen said. ""But it very effectively identifies longer-term trends.""In other words, investors won't capture all of the upside in a trend, nor all of the downside. But they will pick up the heart of the move.Apple (AAPL) is the No. 1 holding, having found its way into the portfolio after a decent rally in the second half of 2016.PDP has added 2% year to date following a lackluster 2.4% gain for all of last year.It was hurt by rapid transitions in sector leadership throughout 2016 — holding a big stake in health care as commodities and materials surged early in the year and getting caught out by the sharp rally in financials and cyclicals after the Nov. 8 election, said Nick Kalivas, a senior equity product strategist at PowerShares.""Momentum needs some time to catch up,"" he added. ""It benefits when there is good dispersion in returns among the winners and losers, and it needs that trend to stay in place.""This $1.36 billion ETF is now betting big on cyclical and economically sensitive sectors. It is overweight financial services and industrials, at a combined 42% portfolio weighting.Factors themselves have a bit of a cyclical nature and the momentum factor seems ripe for a rebound after a period of poor performance, in Kalivas' view.The ETF structure may be ideally suited to offer exposure to the momentum factor. Momentum strategies tend to involve high portfolio turnover and produce short-term capital gains. But the in-kind mechanism of ETFs shelters investors, from a tax perspective, Kalivas said.And for many investors, a momentum strategy within an ETF wrapper streamlines the process of monitoring and trading stocks.Both the PowerShares and First Trust momentum ETFs are collaborations with the firm Dorsey Wright & Associates, whose specialty is technical analysis based on relative price strength.RELATED:Dorsey Wright Exec: Our Momentum ETFs 'Let Winners Run'

1221,NOV,"Large-cap stocks paced equities lower Tuesday, but the U.S. market still looks poised for a positive finish in January. While the Dow Jones industrial average slid more than 0.6% and fell further below the highly touted 20,000 milestone, the small-cap-oriented Russell 2000 gave up little ground in the early going and was fractionally higher.The Russell 2000, which galloped more than 19% higher in 2016, is now down just a tad since Jan. 1. But the 30-member Dow industrials still stood about 0.2% higher, while the Nasdaq composite leads the way so far in 2017 with its 3.9% gain.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, edged 0.6% lower to 120.85 and remained in buy range past a new 118.12 entry in a 12-week cup-with-handle base, just ahead of its quarterly results due after the market close.As a megacap stock that has morphed into a ""growth and income"" play, Apple has not shown extraordinary power, yet it's also acted fine since surpassing the proper handle buy point on Jan. 6 and 7.Wall Street on consensus expects the iPhone maker's earnings to fall 2% to $3.22 a share. That would extend a three-quarter streak of falling profits (-18%, -23% and -15% in the prior three quarters). But some of the 37 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters do forecast a year-over-year gain, with the highest estimate currently at $3.77 a share, which would spell a 17% increase.Watch to see what the total shares outstanding will be at the end of the December quarter. Corporate buybacks, or the lack of employee stock options issuance, can help reduce share count significantly enough to bump up earnings per share.At the end of fiscal fourth quarter on Sept. 24, 2016, Apple had 5.39 billion diluted shares outstanding. On a 12-month basis, diluted shares dropped to 5.5 billion shares vs. 5.79 billion shares on Sept. 26, 2015.The Nasdaq composite was down less than 0.1% with about half an hour to go in the stock market today, mirroring Monday's action in which it bounced off intraday lows. The Nasdaq 100 dropped nearly 0.3%, while the S&P 500 lost around 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: During a confirmed uptrend, the leading big, mid- and small-cap equities will break out of well-formed bases. Learn how to capture shares in these stocks at the most opportune time by mastering historically proven chart patterns such as the cup-with-handle base.Returning to Apple, the megacap with a $646 billion market capitalization had initially broken out of a cup with handle at 110.33 on Sept. 14 as the stock lifted out of a long, deep, bottoming-base pattern. The stock rallied 7.5%, then pulled back to test its 200-day moving average. The Nov. 14 bounce off that long-term support line gave a bullish sign that Apple still has institutional support.Through last week, Apple has risen as much as 36% off the 89.47 low within its deep saucerlike pattern.Revenue is seen rising 2% to $77.4 billion in the December-ended first quarter, then accelerating to a 6.7% gain to $53.9 billion vs. year-ago levels in fiscal Q2. Strong growth in service-related revenue and increased market share against beleaguered South Korean rival Samsung may help boost the top line in FY 2017.Not all big-cap techs are having a rosy start.Qualcomm (QCOM), which faces a lawsuit from Apple alleging unfair pricing of its wireless chip technology, continues to drop after it plunged more than 12% to 54.88 on Jan. 23, slashing through its 200-day moving average in heavy trading.The stock fell an additional 0.4% to 53.38 on Tuesday, suggesting that it will take quite a bit of time before the San Diego-based wireless play forms a new base and sets up for a potential new price run.In contrast, Nvidia (NVDA) is showing remarkable resilience as shares eased 0.7% to 109.30. For the time being, the star tech stock of 2016 has not corrected long enough to form a proper base. A cup must stretch a minimum six weeks in time. Plus, the 17% correction from head to toe is too deep as a potential flat-base pattern. Fellow chip design and data networking play Cavium Networks (CAVM) is acting well too, rising nearly 0.4% to 66.38 as it tries to clear a 66.22 buy point on a long cup with handle.HealthEquity (HQY), which joined IBD Leaderboard on Jan. 9 and later joined the Leaderboard Cut List, made a round trip of mild gains since it cleared a 45.10 flat-base buy point. The health savings account pioneer was off just 4 cents at 46.04, and its uptrend remains intact.Notice how HealthEquity continues to trade above its fast-rising 50-day moving average. The Utah-based firm retook that 50-day line in big volume following President Trump's Nov. 8 election win.Going into February, a look at IBD's stock research tables shows that the banking, chip, electronics, machinery, auto and transport sectors are commanding the upside for now. Investors who focus on these sectors have a higher likelihood of making money in stocks.But make sure to deploy cash in the leading names at proper buy points, not the laggards. The poorly rated companies may stay that way unless a real change in fundamentals occurs.RELATED:How To Trade Stocks: Which Techs Are Not Failing Post-Breakout?How To Trade: What To Look For In Apple's Quarterly ResultsHow To Trade: When Did Nvidia Show Signs A Correction Is Near?How To Invest: Does Apple's New Grandiose Headquarters The End Of Its Mighty Run?How To Invest: Start February Right And Take These Tips From Gerald Loeb, A Wall Street Master

1222,NOV,"Video game giant Electronic Arts (EA), fresh from a stock breakout Friday, reported holiday-quarter results after the close Tuesday that beat the company's guidance on the top and bottom lines, after video game retailer GameStop (GME) this month reported miserable holiday sales.Game makers like EA and rival Activision (ATVI), which reports its holiday-quarter results after the close Feb. 9, benefit from the shift to more users downloading games, which carries fatter profit margins and let's them sell in-game extras.Major games released by EA late last year include ""Battlefield 1"" and ""Titanfall 2."" Market tracker NPD last week released a video game industry report for the period from Nov. 27 to Dec. 31 that showed EA with three of the Top 10 sellers, the most of any publisher. ""Battlefield 1"" checked in at No. 3 (Activision's ""Call Of Duty: Infinite Warfare' led), with ""Madden NFL 17"" at No. 4 and ""FIFA 17"" at No. 9. But NPD said dollar sales of console games fell 12% from the year-earlier period, with sales of PC games slumping 13%.In its earnings release Tuesday, EA said ""FIFA 17"" was the top-selling console game of 2016.Wall Street fiscal Q3 estimates: Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS ex items of $2.30 for the quarter ended Dec. 31, up 26% from the year-earlier period. Adjusted sales are expected to rise 14% to $2.05 billion.Q3 results: The company posted flat GAAP EPS, compared with a 14-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter and beating its guidance of a 17-cent loss. The company said net revenue rose 7.4% to $1.149 billion, vs. its guidance for $1.125 billion. Because the company moved to GAAP-only financial reporting this quarter, it wasn't immediately clear how its results compared with analyst estimates.Company fiscal Q4 guidance: For the quarter ending March 31, EA expects net revenue of $1.482 billion and EPS of $1.64.Company fiscal Q3 guidance: Three months ago, EA guided to adjusted (non-GAAP) revenue of $2.04 billion, which missed the $2.08 billion analysts at the time were expecting.Wall Street fiscal Q4 estimates: For the current quarter, analysts expect EPS ex items of 81 cents, up 62%, on adjusted revenue of $1.11 billion, up 20%.Fiscal Q2 results: The company posted EPS ex items of 53 cents, down 18% but 10 cents better than Wall Street's consensus. Adjusted sales rose 10% to $1.098 billion, topping views of $1.085 billion.Stock: Electronic Arts stock was down 2% in after-hours trading Tuesday, following its earnings release. Shares fell 0.49% to 83.43 in Tuesday's regular session. Shares broke out of a cup-with-handle base at a buy point of 82.72 on Friday, and so the stock remains in a buy zone. EA stock touched its all-time high of 86.07 on Oct. 4.RELATED:Activision Added To Wedbush 'Best Ideas' ListGameStop Had No Fun With Weak Holiday SalesPhysical Games Or Digital Downloads?

1223,NOV,"U.S. Steel (X) reported mixed fourth-quarter earnings and sales late Tuesday but signaled better things to come in 2017. Earlier, rival Nucor (NUE) also topped profit estimates, while reporting its biggest revenue gain since Q3 2014, but that failed to impress investors.U.S. Steel lost 61 cents per share, but excluding unfavorable adjustments of 88 cents, the company earned 27 cents. Earnings estimates were for 1 cent per share, an improvement on its 23-cent loss a year ago. Revenue, expected to rise 3.1% to $2.651 billion, came in at $2.650 billion.Management forecast earnings of $3.08 per share in 2017, assuming market conditions remain as they are. But the company expects conditions to improve, suggesting there could be upside. It's not clear if U.S. Steel's 2017 EPS outlook is comparable to analyst estimates of $1.86.""While we will benefit from improved market conditions, they continue to be volatile and we must remain focused on improving the things that we can control.""U.S. Steel shares were volatile in after-hours trading, jumping 5% then settling back to down fractionally. Shares slipped 0.9% to 32.71 in regular trading on the stock market today, continuing a modest downtrend since spiking to a two-year high in early December.Most steel stocks were lower. Nucor closed down 3.3% to 58.09, falling intraday to levels not seen since the stock broke out on Nov. 9, the day after the election. AK Steel (AKS), which sold off last week after reporting results and guidance, slipped 0.1%, while Steel Dynamics (STLD) sank 3.8%. Specialty steel firm Allegheny Technologies (ATI), which surged 31% on Jan. 24 on its own results, bucked the trend, rising 1.2%.Nucor reported earnings of 50 cents — or 43 cents after accounting changes, by Thomson Reuters calculations. The Wall Street consensus estimate was for 34 cents. Revenue rose 14.5% to $3.96 billion.Nucor management offered vague guidance, saying that things are improving, though perhaps not as fast as investors were hoping. Wall Street expects Q1 earnings of 82 cents per share on revenue, nearly double Q4 profit.Here's what Nucor said: ""Earnings in the first quarter of 2017 are expected to increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. We believe full year 2017 profitability could significantly exceed the level achieved for 2016. Prices began to increase during the fourth quarter for our steel mills segment and we expect that trend to continue into the first quarter of 2017.""IBD'S TAKE: Faltering steel stocks suggest the Trump rally may be taking a breather, but the president's much-anticipated policies could still fall into place. Stay ready by always reading IBD Leaderboard. That's where IBD's best market writers are tracking the leading stocks, including infrastructure plays like copper miner Freeport McMoRan and Martin Marietta Materials, to spot buying opportunities for readers and sell signals to take profits.Nucor and U.S. Steel have been two leaders of President Trump's postelection rally. Domestic steel producers stand to benefit from Trump's policies in three main ways: An infrastructure push could rev up demand; corporate tax cuts would deliver greater after-tax earnings; and punitive tariffs against Chinese steel imports could firm up pricing.After both stocks hit multiyear highs on Dec. 8, they pulled back and, at least until Nucor broke through support on Tuesday, have mostly moved sideways as investors await for clearer signs that Trump will be able to deliver tax cuts and a major infrastructure package. The stocks closed below their 30-day averages on Monday, a technical signal that upside momentum has waned.Until there's greater clarity and optimism that much-anticipated policies will come to fruition, incoming results may drive stock performance.RELATED:Trump Triple play Stocks Nucor, U.S. Steel Earnings On TapAK, Allegheny Earnings Top, Steel Dynamics Meets; Steel Stocks Bend Both WaysSteel Stocks Erase Wednesday's Trump Trade Gains; Citi Says Upside Priced InNucor's Q4 Warning Bends Steel Stocks, But They Don't Break

1224,NOV,"Three popular ""Trump trades"" — exchange traded funds tracking defense and aerospace stock indexes — continue to present a buying opportunity as investors await more details about the president's proposed $54 billion hike in military spending.IShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense (ITA), PowerShares Aerospace & Defense (PPA) and SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense (XAR) were modestly higher on the stock market today.The iShares ETF, the largest in this group, remains within a 5% buy zone after climbing above its 146.86 buy point the week of Feb. 10.Its SPDR and PowerShares peers are similarly positioned as Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), United Technologies (UTX) and General Dynamics (GD) look to trace key moves on their charts.All three ETFs saw a sharp spike in trading activity following the Nov. 8 presidential election, then consolidated gains before staging fresh breakouts from flat bases in February.  They have faltered with the broad market in recent sessions, but Trump's budget outline, expected on Thursday, could see them make another run up.The ETFs have advanced roughly 15% since Trump's win amid swelling optimism over his proposals to boost the nation's military might.They made 52-week highs March 2 but now sit below their 10-day lines on potential profit-taking.The iShares ETF has seen positive net inflow every month since July, with more than $470 million pouring in over January and February.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) struggled for gains in afternoon trade Monday as investors girded for a key Fed rate decision later this week as well as a new phase in the U.K.'s Brexit battle.This bellwether ETF saw its first weekly decline in seven weeks Friday as oil prices and the energy sector sold off hard.IBD'S TAKE: As the Trump and Fed agendas emerge, read IBD Leaderboard and The Big Picture every day to assess whether the stock market has more room to run.RELATED:What Is Going On In The ETF Market?

1225,NOV,"U.S. stock indexes ended Monday's session little changed, as volume fell off in the run-up to the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting.The Nasdaq crept 0.2% higher while the S&P 500 was flat. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.1%. The small cap Russell 2000 outperformed with a 0.4% gain. Volume was down on both major exchanges, according to preliminary data.Blue chips were mostly off. Intel (INTC) fell 2% despite announcing it would acquire Mobileye (MBLY) in a $15 billion deal. Mobileye's stock jumped 28% on the news.On the upside in the Dow, Home Depot (HD) was among leaders with an incremental gain — 0.4% in soft volume.As the Fed's meeting approaches, individual investors should be aware of four factors that could determine the market's next thrust or next dive.No. 1: A rate hike from the Federal Reserve is widely expected. Chances are a rate hike is already baked into stock prices. The swing factor will be what the Fed says or hints at in relation to further rate hikes this year. The Fed officials have signaled that there will be three rate hikes in 2017 — two more after Wednesday's presumed increase. The Street will be parsing the language to get a sense of what comes next.No. 2: A marketwide pullback to digest gains since early November is still possible. The Nasdaq, for example, gained 17% from its low Nov. 4 to its high March 1. So far the current pullback, if it is fair to call it a pullback, has reached only 1.7% on the Nasdaq. The Nasdaq hasn't suffered a significant pullback since bottoming about 13 months agoNo. 3: A change in sector leadership would have consequences. Chips and bank stocks have been the leaders of the current uptrend. But while chips are in the No. 1 spot, banks fell to No. 4 of 33 sectors going into Monday's session. It's possible that banks could recover the No. 1 or No. 2 perch they held for months. But if something else rotates into the leadership, that could create some turbulence.No. 4: Optimism matters. Before Tuesday's open, the National Federation of Independent Business will release its February optimism gauge for small businesses. Since small business accounts for most job creation, this sentiment index is important. The Street's consensus number is 105, down from January's 105.9 reading. The range of estimates runs from 102.5 to 106.8. January's reading followed December's biggest month-over-month increase in the survey's history.West Texas intermediate crude oil was nearly unchanged at $48.46.RELATED:Why Oil Prices Could Face More Pressure Next MonthWhy Intel's Mobileye Deal Could Be 'Defensive' Driving

1226,NOV,"With its top components near 52-week highs, the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD) is showing stalwart leadership among exchange traded funds.The success of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Micron Technology (MU), ON Semiconductor (ON) and other chip stocks has made the ETF one to own since July, when it started moving to new highs. It rose 26% last year, most of that coming in the second half, and is up about 6% so far in 2017.Diversified chip company Broadcom (AVGO) and MaxLinear (MXL), which specializes in broadband and network equipment, are other top components that have shouldered the ETF's gains.It's hard to find a dog in the portfolio, but Nvidia (NVDA) and Inphi (IPHI) are showing some decay after falling below the 50-day moving average.A few stocks have been much bigger drags. Solar-energy stocks SunPower (SPWR) and First Solar (FSLR) are down more than 70% and 50% respectively from 52-week highs.SPDR Semiconductor holds about 40 stocks from an index of U.S.-based chip companies selected mainly for the large size of their revenues. The average market capitalization is more than $18 billion, making it mainly a large-cap fund.The ETF is near new highs, but is finding support in a mild pullback to the 50-day moving average. It's the second time that SPDR Semiconductor has pulled back to the 50-day line since a breakout Nov. 17, which leaves shares in a secondary buy area. The fund is thinly traded, with average daily volume of just 112,000 shares. But that's not much of an impediment for an ETF that invests in highly liquid and well-capitalized stocks.(VanEck Vectors Semiconductors (SMH) and iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX), the two other chip ETFs on IBD's screen, have not touched the 50-day line and are extended from buy areas.)While the traditional sources of chip growth such as PCs and tablets are slumping, newer areas of growth have emerged in auto electronics, the Internet of Things, data centers and video games. And don't forget the smartphone market, another important segment.Canaccord Genuity raised the target price on AMD, the fund's largest holding, to 17 from 14 and maintained a buy rating Thursday. Analysts noted confidence in AMD's re-emergence as a competitive second source of chips to Intel (INTC) and a recovery in graphics chips in some markets.The semiconductor industry would benefit more than others from a cut in the repatriation tax to 10% from 35% as President Trump has proposed. ""The Semiconductor sector has a global supply chain and is very capital intensive, investing heavily on research and development,"" S&P Global Market Intelligence said in a report last month. The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

1227,NOV,"OPEC and its partners have seen the post-agreement oil rally evaporate as the U.S. inventory glut becomes impossible to ignore.West Texas Intermediate closed at the lowest since Nov. 29, the day before OPEC approved the first supply cuts in eight years. Crude supplies rose 8.2 million to the highest level in weekly government data since 1982. Harold Hamm, the U.S. shale oil billionaire, warned on Wednesday that the industry could ""kill"" the market if it embarks on another spending binge. The market swoon stoked the second-highest WTI options trading volume ever.Oil had fluctuated above $50 a barrel since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other countries started trimming supply for six months starting Jan. 1 to reduce a global glut. While U.S. shale output has rebounded, larger-than-expected cuts elsewhere and signs of growing demand suggest stockpiles will eventually decline, according to Goldman Sachs Group.""People are nervous about the global supply-demand balance,"" Adam Sieminski, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and former head of the Energy Information Administration, said by telephone. ""Shale is coming back with $50 oil and there's uncertainty about whether OPEC and its partners are going to roll over the production agreement.""West Texas Intermediate for April delivery dropped $1, or 2%, to close at $49.28 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 85% above the 100-day average. The contract has tumbled 7.6% in four days.Brent for May settlement slipped 92 cents to $52.19 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was the lowest close since Nov. 30.

Producers will meet in Vienna in May to decide on the next steps. But he insisted the kingdom wouldn't act alone.""I think there will be a rollover of the agreement, but I don't think the Saudis are going to rollover to Russia, Iran and Iraq,"" Sieminski said. ""We will have to see compliance from them.""OPEC members exceeded their pledged output reduction last month, Kuwaiti Oil Minister Issam Almarzooq told state-run news agency KUNA. Compliance by non-OPEC countries is at about 50%, he said.U.S. crude production increased for a third week to 9.09 million barrels a day, the EIA said Wednesday. The nation's output is projected to surge to a record 9.73 million barrels a day next year, according to the EIA's monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook on Tuesday.""The market was very hopeful about what OPEC was doing and that we were going to see inventories decline as a result,"" Jacques Rousseau, a managing director of the Washington-based research firm ClearView Energy Partners, said by telephone. ""The numbers from the EIA were pretty brutal.""

1228,NOV,"As U.S. oil prices fell to their lowest close since November, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) said it would sell the majority of its Canadian oil sands acreage and Dow Jones industrial average component Exxon Mobil (XOM) bought offshore natural gas assets in Africa.Shell agreed to sell its Canadian oil sands interests to Canadian Natural and reduce its share in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project to 10% from 60%.Shell's sale was worth $8.5 billion as it looks to offload $30 billion in assets after its BG Group acquisition to reduce debt. Shell is also buying 50% of Marathon Oil (MRO) unit Marathon Oil Canada Corp. for about $1.25 billion.Shell shares, down much of the session, closed up 0.6% to 51.34 on the stock market today. Marathon, which also announced asset buys in the Permian shale area, climbed 8.1% to 16.07.The Dow's Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips (COP) have sold their oil sands assets in recent years as companies move away from the expensive and carbon heavy projects with oil prices far below boom-era levels.U.S. crude prices closed down 2% to $49.28 a barrel, undercutting $50 for the first time in 2017 with its lowest settlement since Nov. 29.

1229,NOV,"The largest oil commodity exchange traded product fell to a multimonth low Thursday and has now given up virtually all its gains since OPEC led a deal to curb output in late November.United States Oil (USO) dropped 1.1% on the stock market today, extending a sharp 5.3% loss the previous session.The commodity fund tracks the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) or light sweet crude oil, which settled under $50 a barrel — a support level — Thursday .A bearish mood has returned to the oil markets on an official report showing record stockpiles, as well as reports of growing production and growing rig counts in the U.S.The oil ETF is now down more than 10% year to date, a sharp reversal from a 7% jump in December following a deal among major global producers to curb production and prop up oil prices.""What's held price up is faith and apparent follow-through by OPEC on their agreement to cut production,"" said John Love of USCF, which runs USO ETF. Love made note of the rising tension ""between these two factors"" — OPEC cutbacks after the Nov. 30 deal and U.S. shale players, who have been encouraged by higher oil prices to bring rigs and supply back online.He added: ""It seems the market has finally decided that the shale response outweighs positives from OPEC. Long term, shale won't be able to supply the world and respond all on its own to changes in demand, but for the time being (its actions are) tempering expectations"" for an oil recovery.Following this week's slide, the USO ETF sits 15% below its June high of 12.45 but is up 37% from an all-time low of 7.67 in its decade-plus history, which came more than a year ago.Energy stock ETF were mixed Thursday.Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) clawed back the morning's losses to finish with a 0.7% gain. However, PowerShares S&P SmallCap Energy (PSCE) and SPDR S&P Oil and Gas Equipment and Services (XES) closed sharply lower.Year to date, XLE is the worst performer among Select SPDRs investing in S&P 500 stocks. The ETF is down nearly 7% through March 9 vs. a 10% jump for its health care sibling.IBD'S TAKE: Collapsing oil prices have renewed attention on the OPEC deal, specifically its continuation after June. This is what Saudi Arabia wants to see before extending the output cut.What Is Going On In The ETF Market?

1231,NOV,"The stock market pared a small part of its losses Monday as indexes headed for their worst declines of the year so far.Small caps led with a 1.5% tumble in the Russell 2000, basically putting the index back where it was a week ago.The Nasdaq slid 1.1%, undoing much of last week's gains. Some high-tech companies that rely on many foreign workers cited concerns about new requirements to enter the U.S. under new rules imposed by President Trump.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.9%. The S&P seems to have hit some resistance at 2300 after making three straight highs near that level last week.Volume was running moderately higher compared with the same time Friday. Losers beat winners by 4-to-1 on the Nasdaq and by more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE.Alphabet (GOOGL) was off more than 2% and trading close to its 824.40 entry. The stock was one of the most actively traded Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Excessive complacency often foreshadows market tops. The CBOE Volatility Index surged Monday after the VIX fear gauge hit its lowest level since mid-2014 on Friday.Another heavily traded stock was Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH), which plunged 8% in more than five times its average volume. The civil engineering, technology and management consultant reported adjusted quarterly profit of 38 cents a share, 2 cents below analysts' consensus estimate. The stock had been forming a flat base, but Monday's sell-off roiled the pattern.Financials were broadly lower. Zions Bancorp (ZION) and Sterling Bancorp (STL), both members of the IBD 50, were trying to climb after touching potential support at the 50-day moving average.Retail was the day's best-performing sector as Wal-Mart (WMT) climbed nearly 1%. The Dow Jones industrials component tries to end a six-week slide.Energy, metals and some cyclical stocks were lagging the most.Oil stocks came under pressure after the price of U.S. crude fell nearly 1% to $52.66 a barrel. On the Dow, Chevron (CVX) was off nearly 2% after touching the lowest price since Nov. 29.

1234,NOV,"In a world where convenience is key and time is valuable, GrubHub (GRUB) has made a name for itself in food delivery.""I-want-it-now"" millennials are pushing more services online, and GrubHub boasts not only the largest online food ordering platform in the U.S., but also considerable name recognition and a first-mover advantage.The Chicago-based firm also is expected to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the highly anticipated corporate tax reform set to be enacted by President Donald Trump, as it conducts nearly all its business in the U.S. GrubHub is currently swallowing a tax rate of approximately 40%.Credit Suisse analyst Paul Bieber calls GrubHub a ""favorite Trump trade,"" saying in a Jan. 10 note that a lower rate would ""significantly increase GrubHub's (earnings) potential."" He estimates a 5% reduction would drive 10 cents to 12 cents of incremental earnings per share on an annual basis. Bieber has an outperform rating and 48 price target on GrubHub.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley's Brian Nowak upgraded the company to overweight on Jan. 13 with a 44 target price. He echoes that GrubHub ""is among the biggest potential beneficiaries (of tax cuts) in our coverage universe.""GrubHub will issue its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 8. Earnings are projected to rise 32% to 25 cents while revenue increases 37% to $137.3 million. After coming off a low of 35.90 Jan. 10, GrubHub stock rose that day and in 10 out of the last 12 trading days. Shares were down nearly 2% Monday in the wake of Trump's immigration ban fracas, but recovered and were down only fractionally at the close.The stock has gained roughly 20% from its 34.66 low on Nov. 11 amid the prospect of a lower tax burden, and is now about 6% below a 44.68 buy point from a consolidation base. The stock's Relative Strength Rating of 92 puts it among the best stocks when it comes to recent price performance.Looking at the big picture, GrubHub is a turnaround stock. By January 2016, shares had fallen 63% from their April 2015 all-time high. But the stock has since recouped nearly all of those losses, earning it a spot on the IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks.Over the past 18 months, the company has been investing in key markets to deepen its penetration, as well as expanding to new markets where it ""can see rapid growth,"" Chief Executive Matt Maloney said on the company's third-quarter conference call Oct. 26.And looking ahead, ""the majority of our spend and our investments will be in driving efficiency and increasing the network and availability of our drivers in the markets we are already in,"" he said.Along with Seamless, which was acquired in 2013 to drive scale, GrubHub now boasts some 7.7 million active diners in over 1,000 cities ordering from more than 45,000 local restaurants.That list of restaurants keeps growing by leaps and bounds, and accelerates as time passes. In 2015, it added 1,750, while in the first half of 2016 alone it's estimated to have added 2,000 more. Morgan Stanley's Nowak projects that 2,205 were added in the second half of last year.What's unclear is how many outlets GrubHub added after landing a couple of big fish last year. It inked deals with Subway and P.F. Chang's, among other pacts, during the third quarter. Subway has nearly 45,000 restaurants worldwide with nearly 27,000 of those in the United States, while P.F. Chang's has more than 200 restaurants domestically, but it's unclear how many of those outlets GrubHub will be serving.Still, that kind of expansion is helping GrubHub address one of the key reasons for customer churn on its platform. Nowak says his most recent AlphaWise survey data found that 44% of participants named ""limited restaurant selection"" their No. 1 reason for not following through with a transaction on a food delivery platform. That beats out other reasons, like slow delivery, poor food condition and expense.Along with a wider selection, GrubHub has made other improvements to its platform to increase conversion rates, meaning turning an app user to a purchaser. Maloney says that GrubHub is leveraging the data that flows through its platform to personalize its site.""Releasing these features has generated substantially more data on our diner's preferences as well as insight on what drives diner engagement and conversion higher,"" Maloney said on the call.IBD'S TAKE: GrubHub is still a ways from hitting a buy point, but has gained huge strides in recent weeks, up 10 out of the last 12 sessions. The stock is tops in IBD's Internet-Content group and holds a 98 Composite Rating out of a possible 99.GrubHub also launched a full rebrand earlier in 2016, and says that improved marketing has helped contribute to its active diner growth, which hit 19% in the third quarter.""Active diner growth (a sign of GRUB's ability to bring on new users) and gross food sales (GFS) per active diner (measuring GRUB's ability to grow share of stomach) remain the two most important metrics in evaluating the health of GRUB's business,"" Nowak said, adding that he sees ""bullish indicators in both of these, which are likely to lead to higher earnings power and upward revisions.""While GrubHub claims the largest market share among online food delivery platforms — excluding Domino's (DPZ) — the competition is heating up. Not only do you have names like DoorDash, Postmates, Foodler and OrderUp, but Yelp (YELP) has Eat24, Square (SQ) has Caviar, Amazon (AMZN) has Prime Now for restaurants and Uber has UberEats.All vary on their delivery minimums, delivery fees and tip protocols. GrubHub typically has a $10 minimum and $2.99 fee, plus tip, and some restaurants offer GrubHub ordering with self-pickup.But for the delivery option, if you factor in your opportunity cost — that is, the time you save by not having to drive somewhere to get the food, wait to pick it up yourself, then drive back home — the benefit could outweigh the premium paid.It seems America agrees: Credit Suisse's Bieber has compiled data that point to some $245 billion in chain and independent restaurant takeout revenue in 2013, and that number has certainly grown since.Bieber calculates GrubHub's penetration of the independent takeout market hit 4% at the end of 2016. As an underpenetrated market opportunity remains, Maloney said on the conference call the company is definitely in the early innings.""There's a lot of work to do, both in aggregating data and presenting the data and then capturing the output of those actions,"" Maloney said. ""But ... I think that it is going to be hugely valuable for restaurants and then our business in line.""RECENTLY IN NEW AMERICA:Incyte Has Insight Into Market With Potential Blockbuster DrugsCotiviti Poised To Weed Out Massive Wasteful Health SpendingBurlington Rebrands Itself To Show It's More Than Just Coats

1235,NOV,"Frances Hesselbein was an unlikely candidate to lead a revolution at the Girl Scouts.Her only child was a boy of 8 when a church-based troop in Johnstown, Pa., asked her to fill in as the leader for six weeks while they found a replacement for the woman who had left on a mission to India. Finding the work with girls exciting, she stayed on for eight years and in 1970 was recruited to be the executive director of the Girl Scouts of Western Pennsylvania.She began implementing the principles of the father of modern business management, Peter Drucker, and the results caught the attention of the national board, which invited her to be interviewed as a candidate to lead the Girl Scouts of the USA in 1976.""I knew that since its founding in 1912, they'd always brought in some distinguished leader from the outside, but my husband insisted I apply,"" Hesselbein told IBD. ""Figuring I had no chance, I bluntly told them they needed to go through a radical transformation to be relevant. I was shocked when two days later they offered me the job, and for the next 13 years I never had a bad day!""By the time she stepped down, the makeover had turned the Girl Scouts into a growing and vibrant organization. Today, at the start of her own second century, she heads the prestigious Frances Hesselbein Leadership Institute.Born Frances Richards on Nov. 1, 1915, in Johnstown, she had just started at the University of Pittsburgh, hoping to become a playwright, when her father died of malaria contracted while serving the Army overseas. She dropped out to help provide an income for the family. Four years later, at 22, she married John Hesselbein and they worked hard to build a small photography and advertising company.When Hesselbein was asked to lead the troop of 30 10-year-olds, she taught them not only how earn money, but to save and invest it, and took them on field trips to expand their horizons ""during those eight glorious years,"" she said.In 1970, three business leaders she worked with on United Way fundraising urged her to take the job of executive director for the regional Girl Scout council, which was having serious financial difficulties. She agreed to do it only for six months to straighten things out. On her first day, she brought in six copies of Drucker's ""The Effective Executive"" for the staff to read.""There was a magic about Peter's writing,"" she wrote in ""My Life in Leadership."" ""He spoke to us in elegant, spare language that connected and inspired us, and moved us into the future. The vision he held before us embraced us; we made it our own. His philosophy gave us the courage to launch a quiet revolution. … Gone was the cold, austere command-and-control style of the old hierarchy. Alive and passionate were mission, values, people, accountability, and performance.""Four years later, she was asked to helm the much larger regional office in York in Eastern Pennsylvania, and her husband began working for the state council for the arts in nearby Harrisburg.When Hesselbein was made CEO of the national organization, membership had been in decline for eight years and was below 2 million, with 650,000 adult volunteers and staff. She instituted Drucker's ""circular management"" of widely distributed responsibility. The results included:""We focused on our mission, which was to help every girl reach her potential,"" Hesselbein said.By the time she stepped down, membership had climbed to 2.25 million, led by 788,000 adults.Hesselbein had attended a Drucker seminar in 1981 and often turned to him for advice. He told everyone that she was the best leader he had ever met (""she could run any company""). When she stepped down from the Girl Scouts in 1990, he recruited her to head his new Foundation for Nonprofit Management in New York City, which now bears her name.So what is the difference between leadership and management?""Leadership flows from inner character and integrity of ambition, which inspires others to lend themselves to your organization's mission,"" she said. ""Management is the set of skills that can help get things done. Unfortunately, its practice is too often a bag of manipulative tricks to advance someone's own interests, which creates cynicism.""Business can learn from the social sector how to define a mission that mobilizes talents and aspirations, Hesselbein said. Overall, corporations have been improving their leadership in the past decade as they have seen the results — in better morale and connection with communities — when employees volunteer their time. She cites MetLife (MET) and Mutual of America as two outstanding examples. She has done coaching for numerous Fortune 500 clients, including Wal-Mart (WMT), HP (HPQ), Boeing (BA) and IBM (IBM).Hesselbein said women should see themselves as leaders with special experiences who can help a company achieve its goals and play a vital role in society. They could prepare to assume the responsibilities of corporate governance by sharing their talents on the boards of nonprofit organizations.She has donated her archives to the University of Pittsburgh, which now has the Hesselbein Global Academy for Student Leadership & Civic Engagement. Kevin Kearns, a professor of public and nonprofit management at the graduate school of public and international affairs, said, ""Frances shares her key principles and invaluable insights about purpose, values, and ethics with a group of select students in our 18-month leadership development program. She holds an honorary doctorate not only from our university, but 20 others which have recognized her outstanding contribution and regard her as a national treasure.""Hesselbein's ancestors on both sides served in the armed forces and she has been a frequent speaker at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and other military institutions.In 1998 she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, as ""a pioneer for women, volunteerism, diversity and opportunity."" President George H.W. Bush also appointed Hesselbein to two commissions on national and community service.Hesselbein has spread the gospel of good leadership by editing ""Leader to Leader,"" the Institute's free, award-winning quarterly journal, and traveling to 68 countries. She is now also using interactive online dialogues, Skype, YouTube, and Twitter.Asked how she thought the institute might be different in five years, Hesselbein responded, ""There's a hunger for becoming better leaders all over the world, which is very exciting. We will be expanding our collaboration with powerful partners across the globe in all sectors, including free webinars for leaders at every level in poor countries.""Unmentioned by the Energizer Bunny of leadership: any plan to retire.Revitalized the Girl Scouts of America and now heads a prestigious leadership training institute.Overcame: No training or experience in running a national organization.Lesson: Great leaders get their troops excited by inspiring them to contribute to decision-making.""Pursuing a mission without achieving results is dispiriting; achieving results without a mission is meaningless.""""Good leaders make people's strengths effective and their weaknesses irrelevant.""""Communication is not saying something; communication is being heard.""""You should be a living example of what you are preaching.""""Dispirited, unmotivated, unappreciated workers cannot compete in a highly competitive world.""""The leader for today and the future will be focused on how to be — how to develop quality, character, mindset, values and courage.""MORE ABOUT SUCCESSFUL LEADERS:Nina Tassler Used Her Outsider's Insight To Succeed At CBS It's Been All Business For Packers Great, Entrepreneur Willie Davis Leaders Build Credibility On A Foundation of Integrity And Trust

1236,NOV,"Who have been the most successful presidents in the past 80 years? Most successful, that is, in framing issues and advancing their policies, achieving foreign policy success, winning re-election and maintaining high job approval.My nominees are Franklin Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan. They had in common many things: winning smiles, confident optimism, a seeming sympathy with ordinary Americans. Together they won eight presidential nominations and eight general elections.There were personal connections among the three. Reagan was, and remained all his life, an enthusiastic fan of Roosevelt's. He had fond memories of looking out from his radio station office watching Roosevelt and his motorcade driving through the streets of Des Moines, Iowa.Roosevelt, having observed Eisenhower in multiple high-level conferences, chose him to command the Normandy invasion and Allied troops on their way toward Berlin.And as Gene Kopelson has revealed in his book, ""Reagan's 1968 Dress Rehearsal,"" Eisenhower, in his post-presidential years, had several serious meetings with Reagan and may have regarded him as a worthy successor.Each of these presidents experienced a painful career pause — Roosevelt recuperating from polio, Eisenhower promotionless between world wars, Reagan as his movie career tapered off — and emerged, without any real friends, to win the highest office. None seems to have trusted anyone with full access to his intentions and strategies. Each was a smiling sphinx, his full purposes mysterious even to his closest associates and wife.Roosevelt deployed his politically talented wife, Eleanor, on occasion but often ignored her; it doesn't seem as if Eisenhower consulted Mamie on policy; Reagan adored Nancy, but it doesn't seem as if he confronted her with policies she might have opposed.Roosevelt was particularly devious and often, in the opinion of his admiring biographer Conrad Black, duplicitous and cruel. He typically gave appointees contradictory missions and waited to see how they turned out. He seldom fired people, letting them, including his first two vice presidents, fade out of favor instead.He confided his strategy to win an unprecedented third term to no one, except perhaps Harry Hopkins, whom he also trusted to advance surreptitious aid to Churchill's Britain and Stalin's Soviet Union. But in time, Hopkins fell ill and out of the loop.Eisenhower was content to be portrayed as being the frontman for the likes of John Foster Dulles and Richard Nixon. But as Fred Greenstein, after reading the administration's orderly paperwork, revealed in 1982 in ""The Hidden-Hand Presidency,"" it was Ike who was coldbloodedly calling the shots.John F. Kennedy had come to a similar conclusion years earlier, calling Eisenhower a cold man without any real friends. That conclusion was reinforced by columnist Murray Kempton in his 1967 Esquire article ""The Underestimation of Dwight D. Eisenhower.""Reagan, so preternaturally cheerful that he joked to surgeons after being shot and losing half his blood, remained a mystery to everyone around him. His official biographer, Edmund Morris, granted full access, left mystified and wrote a half-fictional memoir. It seems as if no one fully grasped one of Reagan's major goals until Paul Lettow, relying on untouched documents in the Reagan Library, wrote his 2005 book, ""Ronald Reagan and His Quest to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.""Is it necessary to add, switching to the present, that Donald Trump is nothing like this kind of president? To be sure, he has acted on shrewd insights, notably that he could shed college-educated voters in many states without losing any electoral votes while adding to the Republican column non-college-educated whites in others, gaining him 100. Few observers grasped that this was even possible until the evening of Nov. 8.But with Twitter at the ready, Trump too often confides in the world things that Roosevelt, Eisenhower and Reagan would have told no one else. We know his mood at 6:23 a.m., his reactions to hosts and guests on ""Fox & Friends,"" his miffedness with his attorney general.Will his diplomacy-by-tweet effort to get China to restrain North Korea be as successful as Eisenhower's moves, still unknown 64 years later, to accomplish something similar? Will his admonishments of Jeff Sessions be as successful as Roosevelt's and Reagan's quiet manipulation of errant subordinates? One suspects the answers are no.Roosevelt, Eisenhower and Reagan were strong and self-assured enough to practice self-discipline and self-restraint. Trump seems to relish shedding them. That doesn't seem likely to make him the fourth president on my list.

1237,NOV,"Here's one of the biggest problems with President Trump taking credit for the Dow Jones industrial average's rise close to 22,000, as he did on Tuesday.X""Stock Market could hit all-time high (again) 22,000 today. Was 18,000 only 6 months ago on Election Day. Mainstream media seldom mentions!"" Trump tweeted.While there's no question that Trump has presided over a great period for the stock market, many of the so-called Trump stocks that were supposed to thrive on his watch have been laggards, such as Vulcan Materials (VMC), U.S. Steel (X) and Goldman Sachs (GS).At the same time, what might be called non-Trump stocks, have done pretty nicely. If there was any group for which Trump's election looked like a setback, it was the solar power industry. Yet IBD's Energy-Solar industry group ranks No. 1 among 197 industry groups based on stock performance. Since Trump announced his plan to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, stocks like First Solar (FSLR) and SunPower (SPWR) have been surging. (SunPower crashed 19% Wednesday on weak revenue guidance. First Solar, which reported strong results last week, dipped 2% but held onto most of its recent gains.)IBD'S TAKE: The No. 1 ranked insurer in IBD's Medical-Managed Care group isn't Dow stalwart UnitedHealth Group, which exited most ObamaCare markets early in 2017, but an insurer whose prospects are closely tied to the fate of the Affordable Care Act. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see which insurer is setting the pace, based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance.The latest Trump stock to divee was Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), a supplier of concrete, asphalt and other building materials that stood to benefit from Trump's trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. On Tuesday, Martin Marietta came up 10 cents shy of earnings estimates and shares tumbled 6.4%, closing below where they finished on Nov. 9.Vulcan Materials, the nation's largest supplier of construction aggregates, fell 3.2% on Tuesday to close below its Election Day, Nov. 8 level. Vulcan Materials did rebound 3.3% on the stock market today despite reporting its own weak earnings.Infrastructure plans have been on the back burner while Trump prioritized the seemingly failed effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare.The steel sector was supposed to soar on Trump steel tariffs that looked like a sure bet, but no longer look so certain after pushback from foreign trading partners. Trump told the Wall Street Journal last week that action to curtail steel imports may wait until after tax reform and infrastructure. U.S. Steel briefly surged on positive earnings news last week, but was quickly undercut by the disappointment over tariffs. U.S. Steel and Nucor (NUE) both closed lower on Tuesday than they did on Nov. 9.Bank stocks were supposed to be another triple-threat group under Trump, poised to gain from regulatory relief, tax cuts and rising interest rates prompted in part by Trump's big fiscal plans. Here the record is somewhat better. Regulators did sign off on bigger capital return plans for big banks that passed their stress tests. But Wall Street has been scaling back expectations for corporate-tax cuts and the Federal Reserve has tabled its rate-hiking plans as inflation pressures fail to materialize. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) shares surged in the weeks after Trump's election, but they've been Dow laggards since the start of 2017, with Goldman down 5% and JPMorgan up 8%, compared to the Dow's 11% gain and the Nasdaq's 18%.Many banks have reported weak trading revenue in early 2017, but Goldman reported a stunning 40% plunge in fixed income, commodity and currency trading revenue in the second quarter.While bank stocks have been mostly range-bound in recent months, Morgan Stanley (MS) has cleared a buy point and Bank of America (BAC) is near a buy zone above 25.21. But even those two bank leaders have slightly lagged the general market over the past four months.The expectations were that Trump would fuel growth and the Fed would be more proactive about raising interest rates, but with doubts creeping higher about the scope and timing of any fiscal fuel, some economists have marked down their growth expectations. The International Monetary Fund said last week that it now expects GDP growth of 2.1% this year and next, down from prior forecasts of 2.3% growth this year and 2.5% in 2018.RELATED:The Fed Just Gave A Green Light To Wall StreetSolar Stocks Shine As South Miami Passes Groundbreaking LawWhy There's No Trump Bump For Infrastructure StocksCheck Out These 4 Energy Plays Near Buy Zones

1241,NOV,"Boil water, unwrap tea bag — and dunk.That's the custom for many of us cretins who didn't even know there was an art to making tea, which is just about everyone. Slightly more considerate ""brewers"" might plop the teapot on top of the cup to keep the mixture hot as bag and water intertwined. How long should we soak the tea bag in there? Does it matter?Allen Han, a member of the original team that designed the Microsoft (MSFT) Xbox video game console, says it does matter, and he hopes to change that mentality with a little help from technology. These days, Han is chief executive of a Mountain View, Calif.-based company he founded called Teforia, makers of what they hope will be the definitive high-tech tea brewer. It shows how a wide range of teas, from China and Japan all the way to the U.S., are properly brewed.""It's the first tea brewer that actually shows the infusion process,"" Han told Investor's Business Daily. ""We wanted to make sure the process is really intriguing and make people want to learn more about tea.""IBD's TAKE: While it may be years before Teforia and other innovative new companies offer publicly traded shares, which recent new issues are staging breakouts and fueling solid profits for investors? See the IPO Leaders screen and the IBD 50 for the next generation of potential big stock market champions.The 13-inch-tall countertop device, with a high-gloss white color and sleek design, looks like what might happen if a Mr. Coffee and an Apple (AAPL) iPhone could produce offspring. It has a built-in water tank with a carrying handle and filter in the back, plus a double-walled globe-shaped infuser where loose tea leaves are inserted, and a carafe below to capture the precisely brewed refreshment in the front.Here's where the tech comes in: Teforia exclusively sells Keurig-like pods with the loose-leaf tea inside. A paper-thin radio frequency identification, or RFID, chip is embedded in each pod, and a sensor on top of the brewer reads it. The packaging of the pods, which are recyclable, is designed to help the teas keep their aroma.That chip sends specific commands to the machine on how long to infuse the tea, how hot the water should be, and whether or not to agitate the tea leaves with a stream of air bubbles within the infuser. The Teforia brewer acts as a temporary database of sorts, as it retains the information on the chip for 16 hours.The pod is then opened, the loose-leaf tea inside is poured into the infuser, and within seconds you're sampling tea the way it was meant to be brewed, Teforia says.The carafe produces roughly two 6-ounce cups of tea. If you're worried about high costs, tests of various tea types show you can produce three to four carafes of consistent-quality tea using the same leaves. Most of the pods sell for $1 to $3.50 each, with some rare teas going for as much as $6.50.Teforia is sold online for roughly $399 as well as in specialty kitchen goods stores including Williams Sonoma (WSM). It holds 1 gigabyte of RAM memory, features Wi-Fi connectivity for smartphone app-based setup, and uses a dual-core CPU and a 32-bit Quark microcontroller, both made by Intel (INTC).The inspiration for Han may have come from his Taiwanese grandparents, who lived next to large tea farms north of Taipei. It also helps that Han holds more than 30 U.S. and international patents and has also worked for both RealNetworks (RNWK) and the Taiwanese smartphone manufacturing giant HTC.Han's business goal is straightforward: profitability within five years. An initial public offering is possible, but it may take some time.""We are a (venture capital)-backed company so our path would be IPO or (merger) at later stages of the company,"" he said.Han says it took 10 years for the Nespresso high-end expresso maker to go into the black. He is confident that millennials, one of the fastest-growing generations for tea consumption in the U.S. over the past five years, will help in a big way.""Millennials are a really good target for us,"" Han said. ""They are information driven, and almost every day you see online articles talking about the benefits of tea.""Total tea sales in America grew 4.3% in 2016 to an estimated $12 billion, according to the Tea Association of the U.S.A. trade group. The International Tea Committee reports that the U.S. remains the world's third largest tea importer, after Russia and Pakistan.The potential market for in-home and office beverage makers is also growing. Keurig, also part of JAB, achieved annual revenue of $4.5 billion in fiscal 2015 before its acquisition in March 2016 by JAB. The Israel-based maker of home soda machines, SodaStream (SODA), notched sales of $476 million in 2016, up 15%, as earnings more than doubled to $2.07 a share.SodaStream, which broke out of a nine-week flat-base pattern on Wednesday at 57.78, went public on Nov. 3, 2010. It has a market value of $1.3 billion.RELATED:How To Trade Stocks And Win: Learn The Basics Of A Cup With HandleHow To Trade Stocks And Win II: What Is The Flat Base?How Are Beverage Stocks Faring In The Market?

1244,NOV,"Ulta Beauty's (ULTA) estimate-beating results and double-digit same-store sales make it a retail outlier amid a landscape beset with weak traffic and comparable sales declines. But can it keep up this pace?When the specialty beauty retailer reports late Thursday, Wall Street expects 26% profit growth to $2.13 a share on 21.5% revenue gains to $1.54 billion.Shares fell 2.1% to 269.92 in the stock market today, moving back below a 274.09 buy point and testing its 50-day moving average for the first time in three months. The stock has been rising just above or below the entry area for the past several weeks.Other retailers — including Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and Target (TGT) — have disappointed investors. Amazon.com (AMZN) looms ever larger as the reason for many retail woes.But the off-price, home improvement and specialty beauty sectors frequently get call-outs for eluding Amazon's tentacles.And one indicator of Ulta's holiday-quarter performance may come from rival Sephora, whose parent company LVMH reported results in late January.""We're optimistic on the opportunity for sustained growth at ULTA, as LVMH reported further (double-digit) growth in revenue and profit at Sephora, driven by market share gains in all regions,"" wrote Cowen analyst Oliver Chen in late January, adding that strong shopper demand for specialty beauty products ""bodes well for Ulta.""In fact, he appears to prefer it over Sephora, which only carries high-end ""prestige"" brands. Ulta carries mass brands such as Revlon (REV), Maybelline and NYX in addition to upscale products from the likes of Urban Decay Cosmetics and Nars.""While we acknowledge ULTA and Sephora overlap on some brands, we continue to like ULTA's exposure to a wider demographic with a broad spectrum of brands from mass to prestige.""IBD'S TAKE: What's holding back Amazon and other e-commerce pure plays from eating into Sephora and Ulta's market share? There are several reasons why Amazon has been powerless against beauty stores. But even strong reports don't always provide Ulta shares with an immediate post-earnings boost. Its last two quarterly disclosures have been accompanied by declines before shares picked up steam again.E.l.f. Beauty (ELF) reports Q4 results Wednesday after the closing bell.

1245,NOV,"In the family tree of bullish chart patterns, the double-bottom base is a key member. If this one had a cousin, it would be the ""shakeout + 3 points.""Why learn this pattern?It might not occur as often as the double bottom, but it carries many of the same elements of price-and-volume action. (See the recent Investor's Corner column for a full explanation of the double-bottom base.) So, by searching for this pattern, you're also training your eyes for the double bottom.Another reason? Shakeout + 3, a concept discussed by legendary trader Jesse Livermore in his book ""How to Trade in Stocks,"" can yield an earlier entry point than a double bottom.Keep in mind, though, that because the buy point is often found deep within the base, the stock can still swing sharply as it moves up in price and approaches the high in the base. It's perhaps easier to be shaken out of the stock, even with an 8% stop-loss sell rule in place.Shakeout + 3 is not discussed in William O'Neil's investing classic ""How to Make Money in Stocks,"" but it's been featured in a few examples at IBD's advanced workshops and complimentary trading summits.Like the double bottom, the shakeout + 3 features two sharp sell-offs, and the second drop undercuts the first low.This shakeout pushes the supply of readily available shares from the hands of the weak into the hands of the strong. Then the stock immediately turns and rushes higher, often within just a week or two. When the stock returns to the price of the first low, say $30, add three points. That's your entry point.A three-point rally in a $30 stock is a 10% gain. In other words, there must be genuine demand. A stock priced at $100 a share might need a 10- or 15-point gain to reflect the same strength of demand.In January 2010, China's fast-growing economy hotel chain, Home Inns, reversed from a two-year high of 41.70 (1), then tobogganed down 14.81 points, or 36%, in just four weeks' time.From that point in early February, the stock worked its way to the top of an unusual-looking base.In June, Home Inns formed a narrow handle (2), then rallied three weeks in a row while motoring past a 39.73 buy point.But in early July, the stock dipped as low as 36.63, forcing holders to exit with an 8% loss.The NYSE composite and S&P 500 followed through on July 7. Meanwhile, Home Inns fashioned a rare five-week square box pattern with a 42.94 buy point. This time, the breakout worked (3).Was there an earlier buy point? Yes. In the week ended March 19, Home Inns hit a low of 30.22 (4), then rallied through the end of April. During the May Flash Crash, Home Inns nose-dived as much as 18%, undercutting the 30.22 low in heavy volume.But the next week, the stock rebounded 16% in even faster trade (5). That week, shares also triggered the shakeout + 3 rule, rising past 33.22.Pullbacks in the following weeks never came close to forcing holders to cut losses at 7% or 8%.Home Inns closed the week ended May 14 at 36.19, still 13% below the high in the base of 41.70. At the beginning of the week, it marked a 99 Composite Rating, 99 EPS, 84 RS and A for SMR. By the end of that week, its Accumulation Rating improved from C+ to an A-.Over the next five months, Home Inns rallied 63% to a high of 54.25 on Oct. 15, 2010, before going into a deep dive. On Nov. 4, Home Inns fell 8% and undercut its 50-day moving average near 48.74 in the heaviest volume on a down day in price since the May breakout, a clear sell signal.Home Inns is not an isolated example.In October 1990, Cisco Systems (CSCO) flashed a shakeout + 3 breakout at a price of 25 en route to a 140% rally and new highs in just four months. Qualcomm (QCOM) also rolled past a shakeout + 3 buy point in October 1998 before breaking out and making giant strides in 1999.(Editor's Note: This column originally ran in the Nov. 8, 2010, edition of IBD.

"
1247,NOV,"Scandal: President Trump's tweet-storm over the weekend has once again stirred a very big pot, essentially charging that former President Obama oversaw a wiretapping operation against Trump and his campaign aides before he took office.It is a serious charge made on a frivolous venue, but based on what we know of Obama's past presidential behavior, it deserves to be fully investigated.Let us admit right up front: An angry tweet is not the same as a detailed charge or legal challenge. On that basis, many in the Democratic Party have ridiculed Trump's allegations, as if they were beneath consideration.But they aren't.In fact, the charges we've heard at least pass the smell test when it comes to Obama. The media and Democrats have been beside themselves with anger, noting that Trump's tweet contained no substantiation of his charges or evidence. True enough. Hard to get that into 140 words.What's bothersome, however, is that the Democrats since last summer have been pushing a narrative that the Trump campaign had dangerous and perhaps illegal contacts with Russian officials, and that Russian officials meddled in our election and influenced it.The fact is, there is no evidence of any kind that the Trump campaign coordinated, strategized or in any way politically colluded with Russia and its leader Vladimir Putin. Or that Russians, who evidence shows did meddle in the campaign, had any decisive impact at all.Yet, despite the lack of evidence, the false Russian allegations have remained a mainstay of mainstream media coverage of Trump for over six months, and hardly a day goes by that Democratic Party leaders don't mention it.The hypocrisy is stunning. The Democrats and their allies in the mostly leftwing Big Media have made a serious charge against Trump and his campaign that it can't back up, but continues to investigate.Meanwhile, we know for a fact that President Obama repeatedly went on intelligence fishing expeditions of questionable legality, while encouraging a lawless, anything-goes environment among his own Cabinet.He swept up the telephone records of dozens of AP reporters, spied on Fox reporter James Rosen, allowed his IRS to go after conservative groups, openly and repeatedly lied about knowing about Hillary Clinton's illegal use of an unsecured home-brew email server while secretary of state, tolerated outright perjury by administration officials over the Benghazi fiasco, and did nothing about lies made under oath by Attorneys General Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch about, respectively, the disastrous Fast and Furious program and Lynch's questionable private conversations with former President Clinton while Hillary Clinton was under investigation.And this is only a partial list.Simply put, Obama's time in office was marked by repeated violations of the law, but he suffered no consequences. The gutless media for the most part politely looked away, even though its members were some of the victims.Now here's Trump's Saturday morning tweet that started the brouhaha: ""Is it legal for a sitting President to be 'wire tapping' a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!""So Trump makes a charge based on previous media reports, and now the media imply he's a madman, unhinged, a loose cannon, a danger.Let's start with what's been reported.The Justice Department last summer began looking into charges of collusive ties between the Trump campaign and the Russians. The FBI began looking into it, too.Also last summer, at least one request was made under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  (FISA) to wiretap Trump aides' phones, and possibly Trump himself, but was rejected by the court. No, this didn't come from Trump, but from reports last year in Slate, Mother Jones and the web site Heat Street. And those reports were largely ignored.What's important is that request was rejected. The FISA court almost always grants the government's request in such cases, especially if a case can be made that there's a threat from a hostile foreign government involved. From FISA's start in 1979 to 2013, the special court set up under FISA received 35,529 requests for electronic surveillance, and rejected only 12. That's how rare it is.Then, citing ""two separate sources with links to the counter-intelligence community,"" former British Member of Parliament Louise Mensch reported just one day before the Nov. 8 election at Heat Street that the FBI ""sought, and was granted, a FISA court warrant in October, giving counter-intelligence permission to examine the activities of 'U.S. persons' in Donald Trump's campaign with ties to Russia.""The response?FBI Director James Comey immediately called on the Justice Department to disavow Trump's claims. But that raises a logical question: How could he know the claims were wrong?Meanwhile, Obama's handlers and media defenders have all said he had nothing to do with it.""Neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen,"" said Kevin Lewis, a spokesman for Obama, in a typical defense.Sounds definitive, except, as Andrew C. McCarthy points out, presidents don't ""order"" anything. The Justice Department makes a request for surveillance under FISA. In this case, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch's Justice Department could have sought a broad approval to surveil Trump and Obama could have deniability.What's most irksome is that the mainstream media have thrown a complete blanket over a very plausible account because it tarnishes their hero, former President Barack Obama.In an example of high-level media Gaslighting, they've even started to suggest Trump and his followers are insane, while totally rejecting stories that were largely reported by left-wing media.Whenever there's even a whiff of scandal for a Republican, it automatically earns the honorary suffix of ""-Gate,"" as in Watergate. It's immediately followed by a call for an ""immediate investigation.""Fair is fair. It's time for an investigation into former President Obama's activities of the last year with regards to the Trump campaign.What did Obama know, and when did he know it? Was there an order to wiretap Trump's phones, and if so, with whom did it originate? And was this an attempt to use the nation's intelligence apparatus to conduct domestic politics, a crime?America deserves answers. America deserves the truth. Investigate Obamagate.RELATED:Is Obama Orchestrating Attacks On Jeff Sessions To Destroy Trump's Presidency?The Clinton Foundation Is Dead — But The Case Against Hillary Clinton Isn'tSorry, Bush Is Wrong — The Media Aren't Doing Their JobAfter Ignoring Obama Scandals For 8 Years, Reporters Are Now Making Them Up About Trump

1249,NOV,"Purchases of new U.S. homes fell in December to a 10-month low, suggesting the postelection jump in mortgage rates pushed out potential buyers. But shares of homebuilders rallied Thursday morning as Pulte Group (PHM) was the latest to report strong quarterly earnings.Single-family house sales dropped 10.4%, the most in almost two years, to a 536,000 annualized pace, Commerce Department data showed Thursday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for 588,000.The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage reached 4.32% at the end of December, the highest since April 2014, according to Freddie Mac figures. That was up from 3.54% just before the Nov. 8 election. It was 4.09% in the week ended Jan. 19.Optimism about President Trump's plans to spur economic growth through tax cuts and looser regulation triggered a rise in Treasury yields and a corresponding increase in mortgage rates. The Federal Reserve is also projected to raise its benchmark interest rate several times this year.The supply of homes for sale increased to 5.8 months, the highest since September 2015, from 5 months in November. There were 259,000 new houses on the market at the end of December, the most since 2009.However, Pulte Group, which mainly sells single-family homes, earned 67 cents excluding various items, up 18% and beating views for 59 cents. Revenue climbed 21% to $2.42 billion. The average price of homes sold increased to $391,000 from $353,000 a year earlier, while the number of homes sold rose to 6,197 from 5,662.Unit backlog increased 10% to 7,422 homes, with the value of the backlog climbing 20% to $2.9 billion.Pulte Group shares rose 5.3% to 21.52 on the stock market today. NVR Corp. (NVR), which leapt 10.6% Wednesday on its own earnings report, added 0.7%. D.R.

Beazer Homes (BZH) advanced 2.4% to 14.57, as it moves toward a 15.90 potential entry.The new-home sales report reported that the median sales price of a new house increased 7.9% from December 2015 to $322,500.New-home sales, which account for about 10% of the residential market, are tabulated when contracts are signed. That makes them a timelier barometer than transactions on existing homes.Sales of previously-owned homes declined in December while closing the strongest year since 2006, National Association of Realtors data showed Tuesday. Contract closings, which reflect signings made a month or two earlier, fell 2.8% to a 5.49 million annual rate, as inventory declined to the lowest since 1999.

1256,NOV,"Few abbreviations in the investment trade are as intoxicating as IPO — initial public offering. The challenge is this: When is the right time to buy a new issue? After all, it can be highly tempting to jump quickly into a new stock.As with any stock, you must wait for a proper base to form in order to spot a buy point that offers potential for big gains and lower risk. Focus on those with excellent growth in earnings and sales as well as solid industry group strength.In some cases, a stock with outstanding credentials will take off after trading for only a few weeks. But in most cases, patience is key.Fledgling stocks have no trading history. This limits an investor's ability to gauge whether shares are fairly priced.In some cases, shares seem to be drastically underpriced — especially during a weak market — so that they will shoot higher at the start of trading. Consider SouFun Holdings, a Chinese real estate marketer that went public Sept. 17, 2010, at 42.50 a share. It opened its first day of trade in the 60s and closed at 73.50. SouFun, now known as Fang Holdings (SFUN), had a rough ride over the next few years.IPOs came back in fashion in 2010 after a slump, with nearly 120 new stocks hitting U.S. markets through November that year. Also at that time, a surprising 60% of those had traded above their IPO prices. Jinko Solar (JKS) and China New Borun (BORN) are two that have turned in explosive advances. Use the IPO AfterMarket feature, found at the top of the New America page in IBD Weekly, to track significant moves by new issues. IPOs can also tell a riveting story. Recent offerings have revealed new or developing areas in technology, energy, fashion, travel and dining.But the charming tales and potential for outsize returns also carry above-average risks. As stocks such as China New Borun and Fang have shown, new issues can post sobering falls.JA Solar (JASO) rose 41% in the three weeks after its IPO in February 2007. But the stock at that point held subpar ratings for its earnings performance and other factors.Investors were better off waiting. This meant risking being locked out of a fast advance right at the start. But a great IPO will eventually offer a solid entry point. This reduces risk, and it's smart to wait until fundamentals improve.JA Solar wasted no time in laying out a welcome mat. The solar cell maker dipped into its first consolidation the week ended March 2 (1). Shares unwound 23% as they shaped a six-week-long cup.During that base, the company reported first-quarter earnings of 6 cents a share, sharply above year-earlier levels. Revenue took a 10-fold leap to more than $43 million.The news, on April 12, sent the stock charging through the base's 21.20 buy point in very heavy trade (2). The Big Picture's Market Pulse table at the time noted that stocks were in a ""confirmed rally,"" but cautious investors may have wanted to see better fundamentals.The next day, April 13, IBD upgraded JA Solar's EPS Rating to a 75 and its Composite Rating to an 80, alongside solid Relative Price Strength and industry group strength ratings. The stock opened the day less than 3% above the base's buy point — a good time to jump in. Shares rocketed higher and held a 36% gain through April 25.JA Solar then turned down, forming a narrow, seven-week double-bottom base (3). As the base formed, the fundamentals strengthened even further. Shares passed the base's 28.19 buy point in soft trade on June 15 (4). Volume kicked in several days later, and shares rose 56% over the next four weeks. JA Solar formed another base and broke out in September to big gains again.(Editor's Note: This column originally ran in the Nov. 9, 2010, edition of IBD.)RELATED:Finding Great IPO Stocks Today: Check IPO LeadersHow To Invest: When To Buy A New Issue Such As Snapchat Owner SnapThe Best Time To Buy Stocks?

1257,NOV,"Oil closed at the lowest level in more than three weeks on Thursday as record U.S. crude inventories were seen jeopardizing OPEC's efforts to drain a global surplus.Futures declined 2.3% in New York and settled below technical support. U.S. stockpiles expanded to 520.2 million barrels, the most in weekly government data going back to 1982.Saudi Arabia continued to lead OPEC's efforts to cut production, helping the group get closer to a goal set out in a historic accord last year. Output fell to 32.17 million barrels a day in February, a 65,000 barrel-a-day drop from January, the first month of the agreement.As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 11 other nations trim supply in an effort to end a glut, U.S. producers are ramping up and potentially offsetting the curbs. That has subdued price swings, sending the Chicago Board Options Exchange Crude Oil Volatility Index on Wednesday to the lowest since October 2014. It could be a week or two before enough seasonal maintenance at refineries is finished to start seeing steady processing gains, Citigroup said.""There's record storage in the U.S., which can't be ignored,"" Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, said by phone. ""Prices are stuck in a range and drifting quickly to the bottom end of it.""West Texas intermediate for April delivery dropped $1.22 to $52.61 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures traded between $51.22 and $54.94 in February, the tightest range since August 2003. Total volume traded was about 20% above the 100-day average.Technical factors are also weighing on prices. WTI settled below the 50-day moving average for the first time since Nov. 29, the day before OPEC agreed to the first supply cut since 2008.""This is a bearish signal,"" Kyle Cooper, director of research with IAF Advisors in Houston, said by phone. ""If you are a bull you have to be ultraconcerned that this will lead to sustained selling.""Brent for May settlement fell $1.28, or 2.3%, to $55.08 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude closed at a $2.01 premium to May WTI.U.S. crude stockpiles rose 1.5 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday. They've increased by more than 41 million barrels since the start of the year. Supplies at Cushing, Okla., the delivery point for WTI, gained 495,000 barrels to 63.5 million last week. Crude production rose to 9.03 million barrels a day, the highest since March 2016.Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, cut pricing for April oil sales to the U.S. and Northwest Europe and trimmed most grades for buyers in Asia and the Mediterranean. State-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Saudi Aramco, cut its official pricing for Arab Light crude to Asia by 30 cents, to 15 cents a barrel below the regional benchmark, it said in an emailed statement.""When you lower price on anything your mission is to sell more of it,"" Yawger said. ""You are looking to capture market share at the expense of profit.""Crude prices also retreated because of the falling gasoline crack spread, a measure of profit margins from refining crude into the fuel, according Olivier Jakob, managing director at consultants Petromatrix in Zug, Switzerland.April gasoline futures dropped 2.1% to $1.6433 a gallon on the Nymex. The crack spread slipped as much as 6.5% to $15.561.

1259,NOV,"U.S. crude inventories rose by 2.84 million barrels in the week ended Jan. 20 while U.S. production hit a 9-month high, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday, as oil traders debate whether rising U.S. shale activity will offset promised OPEC production cuts.The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, had reported a 2.9 million barrel increase in crude stockpiles late Tuesday. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting a 2.8 million barrel increase.Gasoline inventories, which have risen sharply in recent weeks, climbed 6.8 million barrels. Gasoline demand fell to its lowest level since February 2014.U.S. production rose by 15,000 barrels to 8.961 million barrels per day, the highest since mid-April.Meanwhile, Kuwait said cuts by OPEC and other big producers should bring the market in balance in early 2017, Bloomberg reported.Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam Al-Marzouk said some countries have not yet made the full output reduction agreed to late last year, but all producers are ""highly committed"" to the deal.U.S. crude futures fell 43 cents to $52.75 a barrel. Brent crude fell 36 cents to $55.08.Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 0.3% to 85.34 on the stock market today.

Chevron has been trading sideways for the past six weeks.BP (BP) climbed 0.3% to 37.03. BP broke above a 37.38 buy point at the end of last year but started retreating a few days into 2017. BP found support somewhat above their 50-day line, with the old point still valid.IBD'S TAKE: Exxon Mobil last week announced a deal to significantly expand its footprint in the Permian basin, as M&A and drilling activity heat up in that lucrative shale area.As for Permian-focused shale players, Parsley Energy (PE) closed down 0.4% while Diamondback Energy (FANG) advanced 1.3%. Both Parsley and Diamondback are in flat bases finding support at their 50-day lines.Halliburton (HAL) rose 1.4% to its best level sine October 2014.

1260,NOV,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) CEO Alex Gorsky ""underwhelmed"" investors Tuesday after a meeting with President Trump reportedly fixated on tax and regulatory policies rather than drug pricing, Goldman Sachs analyst Jami Rubin said Wednesday.Gorsky was among a dozen business leaders Trump met with on his first full day in the White House, says Business Insider. Among them were Tesla Motors (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Ford Motor (F) CEO Mark Fields and Lockheed Martin (LMT) CEO Marillyn Hewson.But Trump didn't focus on drug pricing, Gorsky told analysts on the company's Q4 earnings conference call. Trump has called out Big Pharma in recent weeks, saying they're ""getting away with murder"" by raising prices. Some studies have shown pharmaceuticals raise their product prices by 10% annually, on average.Monday's meeting had a different tenor, Gorsky said. ""It really focused more on overall economic growth and, as we mentioned earlier, one of the things around tax, regulatory and other policies, and that those are really the major drivers of the conversation,"" he said on the call.IBD'S TAKE: Johnson & Johnson had seven drugs approved from 2012-16. How do other drugmakers and biotechs stack up? Read more at IBD Industry Themes.In a research note, Rubin says the commentary did little to ""quell investor nervousness"" on the issue. Drug and biotech stocks are largely down since Trump's pledge late last year to curb spiraling drug prices. Johnson & Johnson stock has lost 7% since Nov. 9.Although he sees not much upside in 2017 for Big Pharma, Rubin predicts a series of megamergers and smaller acquisitions. Johnson & Johnson is currently working to acquire European biotech Actelion. At one time, Sanofi (SNY) was reportedly interested in buying Actelion, but didn't issue a formal bid.On Tuesday, J&J executives wouldn't comment on the exclusive talks with Actelion. But comments on the call suggest J&J will pursue deals in 2017, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro wrote in his research report.""While our expectation of a deal announcement in conjunction with earnings did not materialize,"" said Novarro, ""management's comments on the call suggest that Johnson & Johnson will remain active on the M&A front in 2017.""He kept his outperform rating on J&J stock, but lowered his price target to 128 from 133.On the stock market today, Johnson & Johnson stock rose 0.9% to 112.80, after falling 1.9% on Tuesday.RELATED:J&J Hep C Sales Dip To 'Virtually Zero,' Mirroring Gilead; 2017 Views LagGilead, Merck, Alexion 2017 Views Hazy; Biogen May Surge: AnalystJohnson & Johnson In Exclusive Talks To Acquire Actelion After Sanofi Fray

1264,NOV,"Oil slid in New York as the market searches for more evidence that OPEC's cuts are working.Futures declined 1.1%, snapping last week's 5.2% gain. OPEC's implementation of output cuts slipped to 92% in June, from 110% in May, according to a person familiar with the matter. Doubts on the effectiveness of the group's deal to reduce output remain, even as U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles drop. The Energy Information Administration sees crude output at major U.S. shale plays reaching 5.58 million barrels a day in August, an all-time high.""It seems like we've kind of found a new value range around $45,"" and the market is hunting for its next real driver, Gene McGillian, market research manager at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn., said by phone. Recent declines in U.S. supplies suggested that OPEC's cuts might be working, ""but we need more evidence of that to really boost prices. There's a little skepticism developing that these draws in U.S. crude inventories are related more toward a pickup in seasonal demand,"" he said.Prices in New York have languished below $50 a barrel on concerns that elevated global supplies will offset output curbs by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies. Citigroup Inc. cut its oil-price forecasts for this year and next as OPEC members Nigeria and Libya restore previously halted supplies and American output climbs. U.S. shale drillers added two oil rigs last week for a second week of renewed growth after drillers snapped a 23-week stretch of increases at the end of June.West Texas intermediate crude for August delivery fell 52 cents to settle at $46.02 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 4% above the 100-day average. Prices gained $2.31 to $46.54 a barrel last week.Brent for September settlement declined 49 cents to end the session at $48.42 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Prices climbed 4.7% last week. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $2.19 to September WTI. Total volume traded was about 32% below the 100-day average.The 11 OPEC members bound by the Nov. 30 output agreement pumped 29.89 million barrels a day in June, up from 29.69 million in May, according to a person familiar with the matter, citing the group's secondary sources data, revised to include all figures from all parties.An Energy Information Administration report last week showed that U.S. crude supplies declined 7.56 million barrels in the week ended July 7, the biggest drop since September. Gasoline inventories fell 1.65 million barrels. Crude inventories decreased 1.5 million barrels in the week ended July 14, according to a forecast compiled by Bloomberg.China, the world's second-largest economy, expanded by 6.9% in the second quarter from a year earlier, compared with the 6.8% median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.""The Chinese economic data is pretty good, but not great,"" Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Mass., said by phone. ""We are in the summer doldrums. There hasn't been any real strong political news or strong fundamentals to drive us either way.""
"
1265,NOV,"Overreach. Donald Trump seems to have an uncanny knack for prompting overreach by his opponents and critics. This often hurts him and the country. But it has the potential to hurt those doing the overreach as well.Start with Trump's speech in Warsaw last week. ""As the Polish experience reminds us,"" he said after recounting in vivid detail how Poland rebounded from decades of horrors, ""the defense of the West ultimately rests not only on means but also on the will of its people to prevail. The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive.""Vitriolic criticism was quick to come from the left. ""A statement of racial and religious paranoia,"" wrote the Atlantic's Peter Beinart. ""The West is a racial and religious term,"" he explained. An ""alt-right"" speech, said the New Republic's Jeet Heer, ""meant to conjure blood-and-soil nationalism.""But Trump's text included praise of Poland's and Western civilizations' resistance to Nazi and Communist totalitarianism, empowering women, striving for excellence, valuing the dignity of human life, debating and challenging ""everything."" Presumably, Trump's critics embrace each of these products of Western civilization.Nonetheless they sneer at Trump's pledge to oppose ""another oppressive ideology — one that seeks to export terrorism and extremism all around the globe."" But that threat of Islamic terrorism is real.Trump was speaking for those, like Britain's Douglas Murray in his book ""The Strange Death of Europe,"" who fear that European leaders' welcome of millions of unvetted Muslim ""refugees"" threatens to degrade and perhaps destroy the liberal achievements of the West. That is not racism, but prudence.To maintain the opposite, to advocate entirely open borders, is not only problematic politically, but also as public policy. In the weeks since Trump spoke, Western eminences not considered illiberal have questioned the wisdom of allowing unlimited immigration to the West by peoples in African countries whose populations, according to United Nations projections, are set to zoom far above European levels.Bill Gates, whose philanthropy has contributed to that growth, called for turning back boats of would-be migrants in the Mediterranean and said the influx to Germany is unsustainable. European Parliament President Antonio Tajani predicted an exodus ""of biblical proportions"" if migration is not limited now. French President Emanuel Macron said that Africa's ""civilizational"" problems — ""failed states,"" ""violent fundamentalism,"" ""Islamic terrorism"" — make unlimited migration undesirable.To call these statements ""racism"" or ""dog whistles"" to ""white nationalists"" is nonsense.This week's lead story about Donald Trump Jr.'s June 2016 meeting with a Russian apparatchik revived the meme of Russian ""collusion"" and provoked similar overreach. This meeting, which included campaign manager Paul Manafort and son-in-law Jared Kushner, seems to have been a waste of everyone's time, and it's easy to argue that it was ill-advised.But Democratic politicians and bloggers, who haven't given up on dreams of somehow ousting Trump from office and who are eager as always to delegitimize his presidency, have gone further.Some have argued that attendance at the meeting violates a federal criminal statute prohibiting foreigners from giving ""money or other thing of value"" to a federal or state campaign.That's obviously a stretch. People involved in campaigns get information every day from foreign sources — starting with the Daily Mail website — which could conceivably help their cause. Common sense tells us this is not criminal behavior.Senator Tim Kaine, who until the evening of last Nov. 8 had reason to believe he would soon be vice president, goes further. ""We're now beyond obstruction of justice in terms of what's being investigated. This is moving into perjury, false statements and even potentially treason,"" he said this week.This overeagerness to find a smoking gun ignores the fact that the Constitution's standard for impeachment and removal from office is not the criminal code but ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" — breaches of the public trust serious enough that two-thirds of senators feel justified in overriding the results of a presidential election.That standard was not met in 1999, when most Republicans believed Bill Clinton's lies under oath — clearly a criminal offense — justified removal, but most Democrats believed his misbehavior was irrelevant to his official conduct.There's no bipartisan consensus now that Trump should go. And there's obvious political peril, as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has recognized, in Democrats' campaigning not just for a check on the president — the usual off-year opposition theme — but for a futile 1999-style impeachment trial. Overreach is not usually good politics.

1267,NOV,"Small-cap stock ETFs crushed their large-cap siblings in the postelection rally last year on hopes that President Trump would unleash the forces of growth pent-up in America. This year, they are crushing hopes.The small-cap iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) jumped 14% from Nov. 8 through December end, but has slipped 0.1% year to date. Its large-cap sibling, iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV), rose 5.5% over both periods.That sharp reversal of fortune for small caps was in the spotlight at the fourth annual FTSE Russell Small Cap Summit.""Our viewpoint is one of caution going forward,"" given small-cap valuations, earnings and the outlook for fiscal stimulus, said Steven DeSanctis, the SMID (Small And Midcap) strategist at Jefferies & Co.DeSanctis has been described by CBNC as ""one of the longest-running and most widely followed small-cap strategists on Wall Street."" He spoke to IBD on the heels of the summit.A comeback for small caps — companies with less than $2 billion in market capitalization, such as IBD 50 stock Nutrisystem (NTRI) — may depend on how these top trends play out, in his view and in the view of other investing experts at the FTSE Russell summit:Russell Rhoads, director of education at CBOE Options Institute, says that the index shows that investors perceive the risk for the U.S. small-cap market to be low and ""could indicate the beginning of a rotation back into small caps.""That raises concern for Rhoads given ""a market driven by sentiment and headlines."" An unanticipated event could shake the markets and smaller stocks tend to underperform when there is a pickup in risk, DeSanctis said.""I'm shocked we haven't seen a real elevation of volatility,"" he added.That is a level last seen around the time of the dot-com bubble in 2000, said Tom Goodwin, senior index research director at FTSE Russell.But he urges investors to keep P/Es in perspective, citing research that shows they explain about a third of the movement on share prices on a 10-year horizon and are even less predictive of future returns in the shorter term.""Valuations are elevated and a watch point,"" he said, ""but I wouldn't want to make too much of it.""The market's expectation of accelerating GDP growth was part of the reason why small caps ran way ahead of large caps late last year. But recently GDP estimates have moderated and the yield curve has flattened, which troubles small-cap experts.DeSanctis said: ""Smaller stocks offer the best returns over time. However in the near term, they should lag."" It may serve ETF investors well to temper expectations.But expectations for big defense spending, big infrastructure spending and big tax cuts are starting to slip. With the market pricing in reforms, the stock market rally could be in trouble if Trump fails to deliver, with small caps especially hard hit.DeSanctis is watching whether the promised economic stimulus will happen this year or become a 2018 issue.""This will really hurt those stocks that need to borrow and have debt on their balance sheets,"" DeSanctis said. ""Small-cap companies need to borrow to grow and, thus, this will hurt them specifically.""Monetary policy tightening will ring especially sweet in the ears of small-cap investors.According to FTSE Russell's Goodwin, U.S. small-cap stocks tend to perform positively over longer time frames during extended rate-tightening periods.RELATED:What Is Going On In The ETF Market?

1268,NOV,"XStocks tiptoed to modest gains in lighter trade on Thursday amid investors' multiple concerns that range from talks between President Trump and China's Xi Jinping, news that the Federal Reserve is getting ready to deleverage its monster balance sheet of debt, and the ongoing nuclear threat from North Korea.The Dow Jones industrial average edged up about 15 points, less than 0.1%, to 20,662. The Nasdaq composite outperformed, rising nearly 0.3%. The S&P 500 rose 0.2%.Small caps outperformed by a mile. The Russell 2000 gained 0.9%, helped in part by a rebound among smaller banks after the Federal Reserve signaled that it's getting more committed to a tighter monetary policy and lightening the debt load on its balance sheet later this year.These future monetary actions are likely to keep interest rates on an upward path, which could boost profit margins for many lenders. In March, the U.S. central bank pushed the fed funds rate up by 25 basis points to a target range of 0.75%-1%.Currently, the top 20 industry groups are dominated by the computer technology, finance, building and medical sectors. Just one hails from the defensive utility sector, gas distributors.Among these top-ranking groups, steel, superregional banks, mortgage services, scientific and measuring equipment, education, and integrated computer systems enjoyed the biggest gains, up 1% or more.While the financial media and talking heads have sounded plenty of worries about the risk of a serious trade war that would hurt the global economy, IBD's screens are seeing continued fine action by a number of stocks that are showing good relative strength and may see robust or increasing demand for their products going forward.Celgene (CELG) draws the majority of its revenue, $11.2 billion in 2016, from North America and Europe.

1270,NOV,"Exchange traded funds tracking the S&P 500 eked out gains Tuesday, while their small-cap peers surrendered early gains to finish lower. Investors remained on edge ahead of Thursday's meeting between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart.Last week, Trump tweeted that the meeting with President Xi Jinping ""will be a very difficult one in that we can no longer have massive trade deficits"" — reviving fears about the fallout from his protectionist agenda both globally and domestically.IShares Russell 2000 (IWM) reversed lower on the stock market today to extend heavy losses in the previous session.The small-cap ETF is back below a flattening 50-day moving average, which reflects short-term weakness.The companies in the IWM portfolio generate most of their revenue from the U.S. and are more levered to the health of the domestic economy. They rallied strongly after the Nov. 8 election but have wilted this year, as doubts have grown about Trump's ability to deliver on his pro-growth vision of tax reform and infrastructure spending.Investors fled small-cap funds in the first quarter, with IWM seeing $1.41 billion in outflow, the most among U.S.-listed equity ETFs, according to a Bloomberg report.IWM is up 1.2% year to date through April 3 vs. a 5.7% gain for the large-cap SPDR S&P 500 (SPY).Among stocks in the small-cap fund's portfolio that have outperformed this year is Nutrisystem (NTRI).The maker of weight loss products and services — and IBD 50 stock — has jumped more than 50% so far this year and popped 2.2% Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: As the Trump agenda emerges, read IBD Leaderboard and The Big Picture every day to assess whether the stock market has more room to run.RELATED:What Is Going On In The ETF Market?

1271,NOV,"Cisco Systems' (CSCO) push into the security market could be one reason for woes at Palo Alto Networks (PANW), whose stock plunged Wednesday after the company late Tuesday reported fiscal second-quarter revenue, billings and guidance all below street expectations.Palo Alto Networks stock tumbled more than 24% to 115.21 on the stock market today, hitting an eight-month low and echoing a severe drop on Nov. 22  that came after fiscal Q1 revenue and billings missed expectations. While Palo Alto management attributed the Q2 miss to sales execution issues and a pause in spending ahead of the new product launch, analysts say increased competition from Cisco could also be a factor.For its second quarter ended Jan. 28, Cisco said security revenue rose 14% to $528 million. Palo Alto late Tuesday said fiscal second-quarter revenue rose 26% to $422.6 million, missing consensus estimates of $429.6 million.""Management cited execution issues as opposed to competitive challenges,"" Baird analyst Jayson Noland said in a report to clients. ""However, Cisco has improved its security portfolio meaningfully (and) we have heard of competition getting more intense with Cisco.""Baird, JPMorgan, William Blair and Wunderlich on Wednesday downgraded Palo Alto stock, while Piper Jaffray, RBC Capital, BMO Capital Markets and Citigroup lowered their price targets on the company.IBD'S TAKE: Cisco stock has climbed about 13% in 2017 and appears slightly extended from a 31.99 buy point.

1273,NOV,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average has had quite the turn in the spotlight of late, breaching the 20,000 level for the first time in its 120-year history and then stringing 12 straight record closes for its longest winning streak in decades.This hot streak for the blue chip index, and the exchange traded funds that track it, came as investors cheered President Donald Trump's proposals to deregulate industries, cut taxes and boost infrastructure spending.Relative to the S&P 500, the Dow has far more exposure to industrials, financials and consumer discretionary — economically sensitive sectors that could disproportionately benefit from the Trump vision — and zero exposure to defensively oriented utilities and real estate, points out Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA Research.On Wednesday, following Trump's well-received maiden speech to Congress, SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) soared to a fresh all-time high powered by big jumps for Apple (AAPL), Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).""The optimism following the (Trump) speech, as well as increased confidence that the Fed is going to raise rates sooner, is driving more cyclical stocks and sectors,"" said Rosenbluth. The Dow ETF, he added, ""has experienced a renaissance in the past few months.""Interest ticked up as the elite components of the Dow outperformed the S&P 500 after Trump's election win.From Nov. 8 through Tuesday's close, the SPDR Dow ETF jumped 9.1% vs. a 5.9% gain for SDPR S&P 500 (SPY). Of note, some top-performing stocks over the past three months, such as Boeing (BA) and Goldman Sachs, have a far bigger presence in the price-weighted Dow than in the cap-weighted S&P 500.DIA saw net inflow of more than $1 billion per month in November, December and January, following four months of net outflow. ""Diamonds"" was the No. 1 ETF in terms of flow of money in the week ended Feb. 9, attracting $1.1 billion. But over February as a whole, DIA leaked $826 million, including $2.03 billion on Feb. 15, reportedly the biggest one-day outflow in its nearly 20-year history.Rosenbluth describes the ETF as ideal for investors looking for a more economically sensitive slant to their large-cap exposure under the new regime.But, he cautioned, its concentrated 30-stock portfolio won't give them the same degree of diversification as S&P 500 funds.Those ETF investors who believe the Dow rally could continue have several ways to participate in the trend. These include:The portfolio is broadly representative of the stock market, but price-weighting makes for some idiosyncratic stock positions and sector bets. Higher priced stocks get a bigger portfolio stake, which means Goldman Sachs, trading at around 250, currently has the top spot in the portfolio, at an 8.2% weighting vs. 0.5% in the S&P 500. Industrial giant 3M (MMM), trading near 190, is No. 2.Morningstar analyst Alex Bryan calls price weighting ""a relic from the 19th century"" that lacks a sound economic basis.At the same time, he believes Dow stocks boast a more competitive edge — or ""wide economic moats,"" in his words — than S&P 500 companies.DIA is up 5.7% year to date and has produced an average annual 7.4% gain over the past 15 years, in line with the S&P 500 over both periods.The ETF has a 0.17% expense ratio vs. 0.10% for SPY. DIA trades roughly 3.5 million shares a day on average.This approach ""tends to weed out few if any stocks, highlighting the need for conviction in the Dow's names in the first place,"" according to ETF.com. However, Guggenheim says its dividend-focused approach ""should be of interest to investors as reinvested dividends historically have been a significant source of the DJIA's total return.""The top two holdings are Boeing, with a yield of 3.2%, and Chevron (CVX), yielding 3.8%.DJD debuted in December 2015 and charges 0.30% of assets in expenses. It yields 2.46% vs. 2.17% for DIA.Rosenbluth believes this relatively new product merits the additional scrutiny required of smaller, less liquid ETFs.Leveraged ETFs generally are short-term tactical tools, traded for a single day. Over longer periods, and in the hands of an inexperienced investor, the leverage can significantly erode returns.DDM has $334.7 million in assets and trades with high volume and tight spreads. Its 0.95% expense ratio makes it expensive to hold over long periods.The ETF spiked 3% in massive volume on the stock market today, with its relative strength line bolting to new highs.Sibling ProShares Short Dow30 (DOG), an inverse strategy, offers positive returns when the benchmark declines. It allows ETF investors to make a bearish bet on the Dow.RELATED:The 'Trump ETFs' Spotlighted As 6 Best Investment Ideas For 2017

1274,NOV,"Some investors are naturally patient. Others prefer fast-developing situations. A three-weeks-tight pattern, a square-box base or a flat base favors the quick-acting investor.When a stock takes only a handful of weeks to sketch a valid buy point, you must be ready to buy. An initial public offering that shapes its first IPO base also requires quick recognition.The saucer base, however, requires a different skill set. The saucer must be at least seven weeks long, but it often will consolidate far longer — sometimes as long as one or two years. Unlike a deep cup, this pattern is shallow in depth. But the correction can still be as deep as nearly 30%.To the impatient investor, the saucer might look more like a stock in a coma than a healthy opportunity.Yet you don't want your temperament to shape your investing. If you let personal inclinations dictate strategy, then you're shrinking your opportunities right from the start.It's better to be flexible. When circumstances call for patience, resist the impulse to act. When the situation demands quick recognition and immediate action, then act.In order to spot the saucer, you must look at the chart action over a longer period. If you look only at recent action or only at daily charts, you might never see the saucer.The saucer base has some unique associations.A long saucer takes a much longer time to shake out weak holders than a shorter, deeper base does. A 12-week cup, for example, corrects more quickly. When the stock climbs the right side of a cup, approaching its high, the last of the weak holders sell. They fear another sharp downtrend. The weak holders' selling sketches the handle.The saucer can form a handle too. But time, not price, is often another irritant driving weak holders out of a saucer base. Sideways action can also make potential investors drop the stock from their watch list.A stock in a saucer base also might have a weaker ratings profile than a stock with a faster-developing base. The Relative Price Strength Rating might be lower than you'd expect. Some of the longer saucer bases might also feature stocks not normally associated with fast growth.Then, too, the market itself might be in more of a sideways pattern, fostering saucers with good relative strength. That's what happened in 1980-82.The S&P 500 peaked in late November 1980 after the election of Ronald Reagan. Then the S&P began drifting down. From Nov. 28, 1980, to Aug. 9, 1982, the S&P 500's steady slouch carved off 29%.Meanwhile, General Electric (GE) edged up 4% in the same period.The stock began to form a saucer base in May 1981 (1) — just one month after Jack Welch was named CEO. Welch would prove to be a dynamic leader, driving GE's stock up as much as 4,250% during his 20-year reign. (The S&P 500 rose 750% during the same period.)A year after GE started its saucer base, it began to etch a handle (2). The decline was less than 10%, vs. a 27% drop within the saucer. In late June, the Relative Strength line hit a new high (3).When the RS line hits a new high before a breakout, this is a bullish sign.General Electric broke out on July 12, 1982, in 81% greater daily volume. After briefly dipping below its 66.48 buy point during a monthlong pullback, GE picked up steam.In 7-1/2 months, it posted a 67% gain.This breakout preceded the August '82 launch of a strong bull market. GE had outperformed during the market downtrend, and it continued to outperform during the market uptrend.(Editor's note: This column originally was published in the Nov. 3, 2010, edition of IBD.)RELATED:Know This Chart Pattern I: Why The Double Bottom Base Produces Big ProfitsKnow This Chart Pattern II: Why The Cup With Handle Is Worth Its Weight In GoldKnow This Chart Pattern III: Why Flat Bases And Square Boxes Show Similar Tightness

The stock market plunged on the news but pared losses.The S&P 500 was down 0.2% and holding above its important 50-day moving average. The Dow Jones industrial average was off a fraction, while the Nasdaq composite climbed less than 0.1%.The composite was holding near its 50-day line, but the Nasdaq 100 remained slightly below its own 50-day line.The small-cap Russell 2000 was up 0.2%.

Shares are aiming to get back above the 50-day moving average and the stock is forming a flat base with a 166.97 buy point. So far, though, the bulk of the base has developed below the 50-day line, which makes for a weaker pattern.

"
1276,NOV,"Russia Scandal: No wonder former FBI Director James Comey refused to press charges last summer against Hillary Clinton for her egregious security breaches: It turns out, he may have been guilty of the same thing.As the inside-the-beltway political publication The Hill reported, more than half of the memos FBI Director James Comey wrote after having spoken to President Trump about the Russia investigation contained classified information. The Hill cites as its sources ""officials familiar with the documents.""Not surprisingly, perhaps, Trump on Monday morning tweeted out an angry response: ""James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media. That is so illegal!""He may be onto something there.All told, Comey wrote seven memos based on nine meetings with Trump. In testimony to Congress, he asserted that he had made sure the memos in question didn't have classified material. But a subsequent investigation found markings on four of the memos indicating secret information, the kind that is not allowed to be routinely released to the public.Comey has long maintained that the memos were his personal property, but virtually no legal authority agrees with that. Nor does the FBI, for that matter. The memos were created on government time and related directly to his work, so they were the property of government.In short, it sounds like a game of cover-your-hindquarters he's been playing. Because Comey later let outsiders see those memos, and made sure they were leaked to the Trump-hating press, in this case the New York Times, so any protestations of innocence on his part sound more than a little weak.Let's be very clear here: What Comey did is against FBI rules, and it's a violation of federal secrecy laws, on a par with the violation that Hillary Clinton committed when she decided to run the Secretary of State's office from a private, home-brew email server that was clearly illegal.The agreement signed by all FBI employees says that ""all information acquired by me in connection with my official duties with the FBI and all official material to which I have access remain the property of the United States of America.""It goes on to add that agents ""will not reveal, by any means, any information or material from or related to FBI files or any other information acquired by virtue of my official employment to any unauthorized recipient without prior official written authorization by the FBI.""Hillary signed a similar agreement at the State Department. Yet, she routinely put classified information onto public servers, where it could be grabbed by unscrupulous actors, such as the Chinese and the Russians.How does that compare to Comey, who asked a lawyer-friend at Columbia University, Prof. Daniel Richman, to leak his memos containing classified information to the news media?The goal of the handoff was to generate stories so that a special prosecutor would be named to investigate Russian meddling in the U.S. election and, more to the point, Democratic rumors that Trump had colluded with the Russians to beat Hillary.In short, Comey appears to have delivered classified information to the New York Times and other media for the sole political purpose of bringing down President Trump.Comey's actions help explain a lot of things that people have puzzled over since last year. During last summer's campaign and the growing scandal over Hillary's cavalier treatment of U.S. secrets on her email server, Comey came to her rescue.Yes, he said in July, Clinton's actions were ""extremely careless."" But stung by the criticism he received from the left, he later in the month said that Clinton's violations didn't rise to the level of a prosecutable crime.On Oct. 28, he revealed that more emails had been found on an unsecured laptop belonging to former Rep. Anthony Wiener, estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. On Nov. 6, just two days before the election, Comey announced Clinton wouldn't be prosecuted. Case closed.Comey's later actions suggest, if anything, he learned from Hillary's chutzpah. You can flout U.S. law, and as long as you have friends and political clout, get away with it — even use your illegality as a bludgeon against your political foes.Moreover, a June piece by Fox News noted at least 14 stories written by the New York Times going back to Jan. 10 containing ""confidential information related to Trump and the FBI, mostly sourced anonymously from senior officials in the FBI and DOJ."" Comey, it seems, has been working overtime to sabotage Trump.This calls into serious question the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel to look into the rumors of election meddling by Russia. Comey and Mueller are close friends.At minimum, Mueller must recuse himself on the Trump matters now before him. His friendship with Comey makes impartiality impossible, and it's a clear conflict.More importantly, Comey got Hillary off the hook last year from what appeared to be a slam-dunk prosecution. And please remember, no one thought at the time that Trump had any chance at all of beating Hillary.Now, we find out Comey played a double game with the public and the newly elected president. A case of a deep-state operative, Comey, trying to sabotage Washington-outsider Trump? Or just someone with a fast-and-loose idea about following the law?RELATED:Why Trump Was Dead Right To Tell Comey: 'You're Fired'Are Democrats' Claims About Trump Colluding With Russians Collapsing?No, Trump's Top-Secret Whispering To Russians Isn't Fake News — But It Is A Fake IssueClinton Email Scandal Explained

"
1278,NOV,"A day after the Nasdaq rebounded forcefully but in weaker turnover, the tech-heavy composite got smacked by institutional-quality selling Thursday with an hour to go in a dismal market session. However, some last-hour bargain hunting took a little sting out of the broad decline.X The Nasdaq, a 1.4% gainer Wednesday, had dropped more than 2% in afternoon trading and undercut its 50-day moving average for the first time since April 18. Yet the tech-weighted composite shaved that loss to 1.4% by day's end, closing a hair below the key support level.In a strong bull market, the major indexes hold above their 50-day moving averages, which in turn run above their slower-moving 200-day moving averages.Fiber optic telecom gear, semiconductor, chip equipment, enterprise software, e-commerce and Chinese internet companies led the decline, as did gold mining, automaker and homebuilder stocks. All of these groups fell 2% or more.The Nasdaq 100 dropped 1.7%. At the session low of 5599, the gauge of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the all-electronic exchange dipped 5.1% off its June 9 peak of 5897.That's large enough of a decline to justify IBD's decision Tuesday to downgrade the current market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" after the Nasdaq suffered its fifth distribution day in recent weeks.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average lost around 0.7% to 0.8% as volume picked up on both main exchanges vs. the same time Wednesday. The 500 scored a nice bounce off its 50-day line.With one trading day remaining in the first half of 2017, the large-cap S&P 500 sports a year-to-date gain of 8.1%, vs. gains of 2.2% for the S&P SmallCap 600, which dropped less than 0.6% in the stock market today.An uptrend under pressure doesn't necessarily mean a full-blown correction is guaranteed, but the prospects are certainly higher. A pullback would in fact be healthy for U.S. equities, given the strong gains since the Nov. 8 U.S. elections.The last time the Nasdaq 100 dropped 5% or more was during a nine-day selling streak from Oct. 25 to Nov. 4, just ahead of the elections. The index slumped below its 50-day moving average, yet kept well above its critical long-term 200-day moving average.Within the IBD 50, Lam Research (LRCX) signaled it's time to take at least some profits as shares dived further beneath the 50-day moving average.The chip equipment expert slid more than 6% to 141.23 and is now 15% below its all-time peak of 167.05.But other leaders in the IBD 50 continue to hold up pretty well.Arista Networks (ANET), Nvidia (NVDA) and Veeva Systems (VEEV), representing innovation and leadership in the computer networking, graphic processors and medical software markets, continue to trade on the north side of their 50-day lines.Apple (AAPL) slumped as much as 2.5% to as low as 142.28, then whittled the loss by day's end to 1.5% at 143.68. Apple is 8% off its all-time peak of 156.65; volume grew just 8% above its 50-day average.Steeper declines would justify those shareholders who recently bought shares to sell them, in order to protect those gains made since the iPhone maker's Jan. 6-9 breakout from a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12. Apple is also barely above a 3-weeks-tight follow-on entry that was highlighted in IBD Leaderboard.However, holders with a large profit cushion can afford the luxury of watching for the potential development of a new base, which would mean that Apple would again attract strong buying to the point of getting shares back to a high enough price level in which to break out again to new highs.Despite some ongoing analyst concerns about the Cupertino, Calif., firm's ability to make good on a pledge to double its services revenue by 2020, Apple continues to be good at lowballing its forecasts and overdelivering. Keep in mind that the Street is expecting another quarter of low double-digit earnings gains for the June-ended fiscal third quarter, up 11%.Apple's profit had slumped 18%, 23% and 15% vs. year-ago quarters during Q2, Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2016, ended in September that year, but then rebounded 2% in Q1 (December) and 11% in Q2 (March 2017).In other financial markets, government bond selling continued and the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note rose again to 2.27%, the highest since May 23. Higher interest rates allow lenders, especially those with a low cost of attaining deposits, to expand their profit margins.Therefore, as seen in today's New High List, banks and other large insurers gained ground.However, homebuilders got smacked with losses, and IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial industry group slumped hard, down nearly 3.8%.MDC Holdings (MDC) reversed just a day after its breakout past a five-week flat base at 36.09, falling more than 3% to 35.34 in above-average turnover. The Denver-based builder, however, is still in a handsome uptrend since clearing a longer cup-type base at 26.37 in November last year. The stock is also still on the north side of its fast-rising 50-day moving average, a sign of strength.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, MDC boasts excellent SmartSelect ratings, including a 98 Composite, 91 EPS and 93 RS.RELATED:When Did The Nasdaq Score Its 5th Distribution Day?Know This Sell Rule: The Biggest Single-Session Point Decline Since The BreakoutWhere Is The Market Headed?

For the April quarter, the company guided to EPS ex items of 54 cents-56 cents on sales of $406 million-$416 million. "" ... We were disappointed that we came in below top-line expectations due to some execution challenges, which we are moving quickly to address,"" company CEO Mark McLaughlin said in the earnings release.Prior Quarter: Shares of Palo Alto Networks plunged Nov. 22 after revenue and billings missed expectations. Palo Alto Networks blamed its disappointing fiscal Q1 results on large deals that did not close in the quarter. The slipped deals, though, could boost fiscal Q2 results, some analysts say. The company reported EPS ex items of 55 cents, up 62%, on sales of $398.1 million, up 34%. It said it added more than 1,500 new customers, for a total of more than 35,500 customers.Stock: Palo Alto Network stock was down 13% in after-hours trading Tuesday, following its earnings release. Shares fell 1.3% to 151.90 in the regular session. Shares had formed a cup-with-handle chart pattern and are trading above their 50-day moving average, with a technical buy point of 157.75. One key for the stock is Palo Alto's outlook on corporate security spending, as IT departments shift to cloud computing infrastructure. After a slew of high-profile data breaches in 2013-14, many companies rushed to upgrade firewalls that sit between private networks and the internet. But spending slowed in 2016.RELATED:Proofpoint At Buy Point, Palo Alto Near One After Good RSA ReviewsCisco, Palo Alto, Symantec Gear Up For Cloud Cybersecurity ShiftGrowth-Needy Cisco Aiming To Be Top Dog In Security Vs.

1280,NOV,"President Trump urged Americans to abandon conflict and help him remake the fabric of the country in his first address to Congress, a moment he hopes will turn the page on his administration's chaotic beginning and bring clarity to his policy agenda.""What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit,"" Trump said. ""Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead. All the nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.""His speech outlined an agenda that begins with strong national defense, including a ruthless pursuit of Islamic State and aggressive enforcement of immigration laws. He exhorted lawmakers to act swiftly on repealing Obamacare, passing a tax overhaul and a $1 trillion infrastructure investment program, and slashing the regulatory state.Trump arrived at the lectern in the House of Representatives with a heavy burden: to explain his plans to skeptics, including a growing number of fellow Republicans. His address comes six weeks into a term marked by record highs in the U.S. stock market but also mass protests against his presidency, court battles over a proposed travel ban, and a controversial habit of policy making via Twitter.Trump faced a choice in his speech to either echo his inaugural address and stoke his nationalist and conservative base, or to reach toward the political center and explore compromise with his opponents.""I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength,"" Trump said, according to prepared remarks released by the White House. ""From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears.""U.S. stock futures held gains as Trump spoke, with futures on the S&P 500 Index rising 0.3% after the underlying index fell 0.3% from a record on Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: For a deeper look at how investors will react to Trump's speech, check out this special late-night Stock Market Today column.U.S. stocks have led a global rally in riskier assets since Trump's election, though gains have also come amid strengthening fundamentals from corporate profits to economic data. Almost $3 trillion has been added to the value of U.S. stocks since Nov. 8, as the S&P 500 Index has surged 11% to a record and the Dow Jones Industrial Average just capped a 12th day of closing at an all-time high, matching its longest-ever streak set in 1987.Foreign currency markets have lost some of their enthusiasm for the Trump trade, with the U.S. dollar lower by more than 3% since Jan. 3 after surging 6.5% following the election, according to the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index.Trump said that since his election Ford Motor (F), Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU), General Motors (GM), Sprint (S), Softbank (SFTBY), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Intel (INTC), Wal-Mart (WMT) ""and many others"" had announced billions of dollars in investments and ""tens of thousands of new American jobs.""""The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record,"" he said.Hours before his speech, Trump signaled to network television anchors in a private meeting at the White House that he's open to legislation that would overhaul the nation's immigration laws. That set off speculation the president might be poised to make an about-face and support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. A senior administration official said the president has not changed his core positions on the issue.""By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone,"" Trump said in the prepared remarks.""By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone,"" Trump said in the prepared remarks.He adopted a somewhat more nuanced approach to distinguishing peaceful Muslims from terrorists. Islamic State, he said, had ""slaughtered Muslims and Christians,"" and the U.S. would work with allies, ""including our friends and allies in the Muslim world,"" to extinguish the threat.Trump drew a standing ovation from Republicans in the chamber when he again described a U.S. fight against ""radical Islamic terrorism,"" using language former President Obama resisted as inflammatory.Trump said that even as he was speaking his immigration crackdown was ""removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak.""The president made a stab at encouraging optimism and unity, ideals at odds with much of his governance. Many of his first acts have proved divisive, especially executive orders to enhance immigration enforcement and ban U.S. entry to travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, as well as a decision to revoke an Obama-era directive intended to protect transgender children from bullying at schools.""The time for small thinking is over,"" Trump said in the prepared remarks. ""The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts. The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls. And the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action.""In a signal of where Trump stands on immigration, among the guests invited to sit with First Lady Melania Trump were Jessica Davis and Susan Oliver, widows of California law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty by an undocumented immigrant, and Jamiel Shaw Sr., whose son was shot by a gang member in the country illegally, according to the White House. Maureen McCarthy Scalia, the widow of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, also was invited ahead of Senate hearings next month on Trump's nominee to fill the Scalia vacancy, federal appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch.Democratic women in the House chamber wore white in a show of protest and solidarity. Several Democrats invited undocumented immigrants as their guests. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who called Trump a ""faker"" during his campaign, planned to skip the address.The Trump Cabinet member who didn't attend the speech in the event of catastrophe — the so-called designated survivor — was Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin.Congressional Republicans were looking for any endorsement by Trump of a border-adjusted tax, a roughly $1 trillion revenue-raiser that sits at the heart of House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to slash corporate and individual tax rates. The plan is struggling for support, and proponents are eager for a boost from Trump, who has so far sent mixed signals on the proposal.""My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone,"" Trump said in the prepared remarks, which didn't specifically mention the border-adjusted tax. ""At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.""Under the House GOP border-adjustment plan, the current corporate income tax would be replaced with a 20% levy on imports and domestic sales, while exempting exports. The measure has stirred sharp divisions among businesses: Retailers, automakers and oil refiners that rely on imported goods and materials oppose it, while export-heavy manufacturers support it. Critics argue that the plan would raise prices for consumers, while proponents say that, in theory, international currency-exchange rates will adjust to prevent raising consumer prices or favoring exporters.Trump implored Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, a centerpiece of his campaign.""Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America,"" he said in prepared remarks. ""The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.""But the effort has stalled, with Republicans divided on a policy to replace the law known as Obamacare and facing protests from voters in their home districts. Trump described the law as ""collapsing"" and said that ""action is not a choice.""""Democrats and Republicans,"" Trump said, should ""work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.""Trump has previously proposed spending as much as $1 trillion on U.S. roads, bridges, sea ports, airports and other public works, and his advisers have suggested that the program would rely on private-sector funding. The president renewed the commitment but provided no new details in Tuesday's address.""To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States —  financed through both public and private capital —  creating millions of new jobs,"" he said in the prepared remarks.RELATED:

1281,NOV,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock rose to a nine-year high on Monday amid enthusiasm for the company's next-generation processor line called Ryzen. Meanwhile, shares of memory chipmaker Micron Technology (MU) rose after the company got a price-target increase from investment bank Baird.Shares of compute and graphics chipmaker AMD rose 7.7% to 15.20 on the stock market today. In intraday trading, the stock climbed as high as 15.35. AMD stock has been on a run since breaking out of a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 7.63 on Nov. 17.Rival graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) saw its stock rise 2.9% to 104.41 during the regular session Monday. It hit a record high of 120.92 on Feb. 7 and has more than tripled in the past 12 months.Last Wednesday, Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD released details of its Ryzen chip for high-performance desktop and gaming PCs. AMD will launch the chip on March 2 at prices well below what Intel (INTC) charges for similarly configured chips.IBD'S TAKE: AMD stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 86, meaning it has outperformed 86% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.

1283,NOV,"Reviews by analysts on the fourth-quarter earnings report from Splunk (SPLK) pushed aside a view that its weaker-than-expected Q1 outlook was a cause for concern.Big Data services provider Splunk reported Q4 earnings after the close Thursday that handily beat the consensus estimate on the top and bottom lines. But its Q1 revenue estimate of $231 million to $233 million was below the $241.4 million that analysts had modeled.Splunk stock fell 3.2% to 62.80 in the stock market today. Splunk came public in April 2012, with shares priced at 17. Its stock hit a four-year low of 29.85 last February, but has risen 110% since then. On Wednesday, shares briefly cleared a 65.85 buy point, hitting a 15-month high, but closed below  the entry area.IBD'S TAKE: Splunk has an IBD Composite Rating of 77, meaning it has outperformed 77% of stocks in the past six months on a variety of metrics. There are plenty of places on Investors.com to research top stocks, such as IBD's Tech Leaders. You can, for example, find out about four of tech's earnings leaders.Splunk's software helps tech managers monitor and analyze the vast volumes of data that companies and other enterprises are fast accumulating in the digital age — a field called Big Data. Splunk software uses the data to provide businesses with operational intelligence for security and information technology.Some analysts looked beyond the Q1 guidance with a view that Wall Street either got it wrong or that Splunk intentionally guided low, as they have done in the past. On Nov. 20, when Splunk provided Q3 earnings, it guided Q4 revenue in the range of $286 to $288 million, but came in at $306.5 million, up 39% year over year.Mathew Hedberg, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, says Wall Street may have ""mis-modeled"" Q1 seasonality trends, and says company guidance was intentionally conservative. He maintained an overweight rating and 70 price target on Splunk stock.""We've seen the stock sell off on previously strong quarters, so our view is this represents another opportunity to buy a disruptive asset at a slight discount given upside to estimates from here seems likely,"" Hedberg wrote.Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White maintained a buy rating on Splunk and raised his price target to 93 from 90.""Given Splunk's rapid revenue growth and prime position in the machine data market, we believe the stock has the potential for meaningful catch up in 2017,"" White wrote. He also said the company's relatively small size, low market penetration, smooth cloud transition and the strong secular trend around Big Data can keep it growing.BMO Capital Markets analyst Keith Bachman, in a research note, said that on just about every metric ""Splunk reported a very strong quarter, with reported billings of $432 million exceeding our estimate of $420 million.""While Q1 guidance disappointed, he wrote, ""We believe Splunk is leaving upside potential. We would encourage investors to be buyers on any weakness, as we think such weakness will be short lived. We retain our outperform rating and $71 price target.""RELATED:Acacia, HPE Guide Low; Nordstrom Mixed; MercadoLibre Beats

1284,NOV,"Contrary to what many expect in times of reflationary policies, interest rates in the bond markets have remained relatively flat so far this year, while bond ETFs saw record inflow after an already record-breaking 2016.Fixed-income ETFs witnessed over $13 billion in net inflow in January, on top of the over $90 billion that came in during 2016, according to State Street Global Advisors and Bloomberg Finance. Areas that benefited the most were corporate bond, inflation-protected and bank loan funds, racking in $4.6 billion, $1 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.""What we saw in January has continued this month: That's really been a heightened allocation into the corporate space,"" said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research. ""A lot of it has to do with we're still in a low-yielding environment, we still have over $9 trillion of negative-yielding debt and yields on the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond index are around 40% below their 20-year average.""In the credit space, investment-grade allocations were favored over high yield, though the latter saw a third consecutive month of positive flow as investors kept looking for yield. That said, broad high-yield spreads have tightened significantly since last year, going from levels of 800 basis points over similarly dated Treasuries a year ago to less than 400 basis points now, noted Bartolini. That is a level 24% lower than their 20-year median.A good alternative in this type of environment to high yield are bank loans, points out Bartolini: ""They're more senior in the capital structure and are able to mitigate some of the spread-widening effects."" When spreads widen, typically high-yield prices fall, damaging total return. In addition, bank loans float with Libor, which may provide investors with additional protection when rates start to rise.An ETF that provides exposure to bank loans is $1.4 billion SPDR Blackstone/GSO Senior Loan ETF (SRLN). The fund has taken in $250 million in inflow year to date alone. It invests 79% of its assets in bank loans and the remaining portion in high-yield bonds. It carries a yield of about 4% and has an expense ratio of 0.7%. It's up 0.4% so far this year vs. 0.4% for Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond index.Another trend, ETF investors have also been rotating into short-term and out of longer-term bond ETFs over the past six months.  Ultrashort and short-term funds saw inflow of over $2 billion in January and nearly $5 billion in the past six months. Meanwhile, intermediate-term bond funds coughed up $1.7 billion in the past six months, while long-term ones disgorged $2.7 billion.""When we're thinking about how to allocate in this type of challenging bond environment, it's to really favor the floating-over-fixed argument,"" said Bartolini. The $857 million SPDR Bloomberg Barclays Investment Grade Floating Rate ETF (FLRN) saw $120 million in inflow this year and is up 0.04% so far this year. He believes it is a good instrument for investors who seek to trim duration exposure since the underlying notes have a quarterly reset period. The fund yields 1.06% and charges 0.15% in fees.The $4.7 billion iShares Floating Rate Bond (FLOT) is another option. The ETF invests about 75% in floating-rate notes, yields 1% and charges a 0.2% fee. It's up 0.28% this year.Treasury inflation-protected securities funds also have been gaining momentum. The $22.4 billion iShares TIPS Bond (TIP) is the largest in its category and gained 1.05% this year as investors looked for ways to protect their money against a potential rise in inflation. The ETF yields 1.5% and charges a 0.2% fee.However, ""The portfolio currently has a duration of 7.8 years, which is longer than the category average of 6.1 years, making the fund more sensitive to interest-rate changes,"" writes Morningstar analyst Phillip Yoo in a research note. As a result, while the fund protects against inflation, its price will suffer when rates climb.""So if yields move up for a reason other than inflation, you still lose money,"" points out Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager with Sit Fixed Income Advisors. The fund's price has declined since hitting 115.83 on Nov. 7. But it has outperformed Treasuries thanks to its yield.That's why Doty recommends hedging out duration to isolate the benefit of inflation protection. One way to do that would be to create an 80%-20% allocation to TIP and a fund that shorts Treasuries, such as Sit Rising Rate ETF (RISE), thereby stripping out duration risk.""RISE is very focused on the two- and five-year Treasury yields because those are the yields that move the most when the Fed makes a change in their policy,"" said Doty.RISE is down 0.72% this year and charges 1.05% in fees.RELATED: Bond Funds Plow Through Trump Inauguration, First Days

1285,NOV,"After several tough years following the financial crisis of 2008, shares of regional business bank Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) have emerged and now are reaching all-time highs.The Phoenix-based bank holding company went public in June 2005 at 22 a share, and climbed as high as 39.10 in July 2006. But like other financials, it was hit hard by the international banking crisis that started with the collapse of the subprime home mortgage market.Western Alliance operated in most of the hardest-hit U.S. markets, including Nevada, Arizona and California.""They joke that the only place they missed was Florida. So it was a recipe for disaster,"" Sandler O'Neill analyst Brad Milsaps told IBD.In late 2010, Western Alliance moved its headquarters to Phoenix from Las Vegas, the latter of which went from being one of the fastest-growing markets in the country to ground zero for the financial crisis. After the crisis, Western Alliance shifted from a traditional retail banking business model to one focused on commercial lending, with an emphasis on several niche markets.Western Alliance offers specialized services targeting business niches such as the hospitality, technology, life sciences and renewable energy industries.""They've developed lending niches that lots of other banks don't have and have found ways to deliver faster, more tailored products to their clients and can charge a little bit higher rate,"" Milsaps said. ""So they've been able to drive margins that are much better than the overall banking industry.""The company hires experts in the various industry segments it pursues so it can be more helpful to its clients.""They don't want to go compete for the plain-vanilla commercial real estate loan where you have 10 other banks in town and it comes down to what's the rate on the loan,"" Milsaps said.Milsaps rates the stock as buy with a price target of 59.Shares of Western Alliance bottomed out at 2.99 in November 2009 before beginning their recovery. The stock topped its previous high by a penny in November 2015, but that rally petered out.The stock was down 1.2% Friday in afternoon trades to 51.60, but still relatively close to its all-time intraday high of 53.70, reached on Tuesday.The stock finally broke into new high territory again on Nov. 9, a day after the election of Donald Trump as president. Bank stocks have been riding high since the election of Trump, a politician seen as friendly to the finance sector.Still, Western Alliance outperforms its peers on average in a bunch of key banking metrics, including net interest income margin, return on average assets and return on average equity.Western Alliance is the top-ranked stock out of a total of 68 in IBD's West and Southwest Banks industry group. The group is ranked No. 2 out of 197, with the top-rated group being superregional banks.Of the companies in IBD's West and Southwest Banks industry group, Western Alliance is ranked No. 9 for earnings-per-share growth on both a current and annual basis.Western Alliance Bank has more than $17 billion in assets. It operates through subsidiaries mainly in Nevada, Arizona and California.Acquisitions of banking businesses have helped it expand. In April, it purchased GE Capital U.S. Holdings' domestic hotel finance loan portfolio for $1.28 billion. In 2015, Western Alliance bought San Jose, Calif.-based Bridge Bank, which gave it a stronger footprint in northern California.Western Alliance has its eye out for other M&A possibilities but is being picky, Milsaps said.""For them to do a deal it has to be pretty special,"" he said. ""It has to be not only accretive to earnings but get them in some kind of niche business that will propel the franchise into the future.""It would have to find something that doesn't dilute its high return on equity and high return on assets, Milsaps said. On a geographic basis, the biggest hole in its footprint is Los Angeles, he said.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Western Alliance started to rally in early November, breaking through the 40 level. Shares touched the 50 level before settling into a seven-week flat base with a buy point of 50.82 on Feb. 13. It's now staying consistently above 50. Look here for a Stock Checkup on the banking concern.Western Alliance Bank operates full-service banking divisions: Alliance Bank of Arizona, Bank of Nevada, Bridge Bank, First Independent Bank and Torrey Pines Bank.On Jan. 27, Western Alliance said fourth-quarter earnings rose 23% year over year to 70 cents a share excluding items, 3 cents better than estimates. Net interest margin, a key metric for banks, was 4.57%, up slightly from 4.55% in the third quarter but down from 4.67% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Total loans rose 16% year over year to $13.21 billion. Total deposits increased 17% to $14.55 billion.""We are budgeting a 12% organic growth for loans and deposits for this year,"" Western Alliance CEO Robert Sarver said on a recent conference call with analysts. ""So we have pretty good pipelines, and we'll continue to be able to have good positive operating leverage in 2017 on an organic basis.""The bank is in a good position to be defensive if the economy were to change, with strong capital and liquidity, he said. It also will be opportunistic this year in terms of evaluating loan and bank acquisitions, Sarver said.Jefferies analyst Casey Haire raised his forecast for Western Alliance's earnings per share in 2017 and 2018 following the Q4 report. He said the improved earnings forecast is based on a stronger net interest income forecast and a lower tax rate — 28% now vs. 29% previously.He rates Western Alliance as buy with a price target of 53.Macquarie Research analyst John Moran said Western Alliance's 2017 outlook pointed to ""best-in-class returns."" The bank also continues to build differentiated, specialized lending niches, he said in a Jan. 27 note. He rates Western Alliance stock as outperform with a price target of 57.Piper Jaffray analyst Brett Rabatin reiterated his overweight rating on Western Alliance in a Feb. 21 report and increased his price target to 60 from 55. Western Alliance ""remains a focus name in our coverage universe,"" he said.

1290,NOV,"Wearable fitness device maker Fitbit (FIT) late Wednesday reported worse-than-expected December-quarter results, even though it preannounced a dismal holiday shopping season on Jan. 30. It also guided analysts lower for the current quarter.Fitbit stock was flat in after-hours trading on the stock market today, but this was after falling 2.7% to 5.88 in the regular session. Shares have traded under 10 since Nov. 3, after the company gave disappointing guidance and posted disappointed Q3 results.Results: Fitbit lost 56 cents a share excluding items in the fourth quarter, swinging from a year-earlier profit of 35 cents a share. Sales fell 19% to $574 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Fitbit to lose 50 cents a share ex items on sales of $576 million. Fitbit's results were within the lowered guidance range the San Francisco-based company provided last month, but missed Wall Street's consensus estimates.Q1 Guidance: For the current quarter, Fitbit expects to lose 19 cents a share ex items on sales of $280 million, at the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street was modeling Fitbit to lose 15 cents a share on sales of $307 million.Full-Year Guidance: For 2017, Fitbit is targeting an adjusted loss of 33 cents a share on sales of $1.6 billion.

1292,NOV,"Oil dropped on forecasts for another expansion in U.S. crude stockpiles while attention shifted to whether OPEC will extend production cuts.April futures fell 1.4% in New York. U.S. supplies probably rose by 3.25 million barrels last week, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg before an Energy Information Administration report Thursday. The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute will release its inventory data on Wednesday. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries must prolong the curbs beyond six months in order to have a significant impact on bloated global stockpiles, said Patrick Pouyanne, CEO of Total.A surge in U.S. crude stockpiles to the highest level in more than three decades has kept oil futures in a tight range above $50 a barrel this year, offsetting supply cuts by OPEC and 11 other nations. It's too early to say whether the production agreement could be extended beyond its initial six-month term, OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said.""The fundamentals actually do matter sometimes,"" Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, said by telephone. ""We're expecting the API and EIA to report another supply build. The focus is returning to the reality that fundamentally we're oversupplied.""West Texas Intermediate for April delivery dropped 74 cents to close at $53.59 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 18% below the 100-day average. The March contract expired Tuesday after advancing 1.2% to $54.06.Brent for April settlement fell 82 cents, or 1.5%, to $55.84 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude closed at a $2.25 premium to WTI.""We're stuck in a range,"" Gene McGillian, manager of market research for Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn., said by telephone. ""There's a massive overhang in supply, which just doesn't justify WTI at over $55.""The pace of the decline in global oil stockpiles, which OPEC wants to see fall back in line with the five-year average, will determine the group's next move, Barkindo said. Representatives of member countries are meeting in Vienna on Wednesday to discuss compliance with their Nov. 30 supply accord.""If they want really to have an impact on the market, which means to have the inventories going down because inventories are quite high, it will have to be extended beyond May,"" Pouyanne said Tuesday in a Bloomberg television interview in New York. ""I'm convinced that they will do it.""The CEO of the French oil and natural gas company said he's ""not fully convinced"" that tough times for the industry are over. Factors including rising U.S. shale oil production and increasing output from Libya may continue to have a negative impact on prices, Pouyanne said.""If OPEC wants to get oil trading in a $60-to-$70 band they will have to continue with the quota, extending it for another six months,"" Cavan Yie, senior equity analyst at Manulife Asset Management in Toronto, said by telephone.

1293,NOV,"Tesla (TSLA) reported mixed fourth-quarter results after the market close Wednesday, missing on the bottom line but beating on revenue. Shares rose after hours as the electric car maker said the Model 3 remains on track.Tesla reported revenue of $2.28 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $2.2 billion and up 88% year over year, but down from the previous quarter's growth of 145%. Tesla reported a per-share loss minus items of 69 cents while analysts expected a 42-cent loss. Tesla lost $2.02 a share in the year-earlier quarter.Still, Tesla stock was up 2.4% in after-hours trading Wednesday, following the earnings release. Tesla fell 1.4% to 273.51 in the regular session on the stock market today.The results included a portion of its SolarCity's operations, from the close of its acquisition for the solar energy firm on Nov. 21 to the quarter's end on Dec. 31.Tesla said its Model 3 program is on track to start limited vehicle production in July and to steadily ramp production to exceed 5,000 vehicles per week at some point in the fourth quarter and 10,000 vehicles per week at some point in 2018.Tesla predicts it will deliver 47,000 to 50,000 Model S and Model X cars in the first half of this year. That is growth of 61% to 71% compared with the year-earlier period.Last year, Tesla fell short of its goal to deliver 80,000 to 90,000 vehicles, instead delivering 76,300.During Q4, Tesla said it made $522 million in capital expenditures for Model 3 manufacturing capacity, to help develop its Gigafactory battery production plant in Nevada and to expand its customer support operations.""Our capital expenditures came in below plan as we continue to negotiate more favorable payment terms with our capital equipment suppliers, pushing some payments closer to the start of Model 3 production and some payments beyond the start of production,"" said the Tesla shareholder letter signed by CEO Elon Musk and CFO Jason Wheeler.Tesla expects $2 billion to $2.5 billion in capital expenditures ahead of the start of Model 3 production, ""while also investing in battery cell, pack and energy storage production at Gigafactory 1,"" the executives wrote.The original Gigafactory is now operational, but far from completed. Tesla  calls its New York solar plant Gigafactory 2. Tesla said it aims to find the locations for two, perhaps three more future Gigafactories in 2017.A solar roof, which could be integrated with Tesla's storage and charging products, is still on track for a second-half launch. The company also pledged to double the number of Supercharger locations in North America this year.The $40,000-or-so-base-price Model 3 will be Tesla's third, and lowest-cost, car model on the market.Tesla CFO Jason Wheeler is stepping down, with Deepak Ahuja returning to the company.UBS last week reiterated a sell rating on Tesla stock, saying it saw no fundamental reason for the stock's big gains since late November, at a time of increased risk from its SolarCity acquisition and Model 3 production goals.In January, Tesla said production problems caused it to miss Q4 and year-end estimates on car deliveries. Tesla said it delivered about 22,200 vehicles in Q4, short of plans for 25,000. Of the vehicles shipped, 12,700 were the Model S and 9,500 were its newer Model X SUV. The company said it produced 24,882 vehicles in Q4, but it only counts a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and all the paperwork is completed.Mobileye (MBLY), a developer of driver assistance technology, reported Q4 earnings before the market open Wednesday that beat Wall Street views.Mobileye said Q4 revenue grew 46% vs. a year earlier to $104.6 million, vs. analyst consensus for $96.4 million. Earnings per share minus items rose 47% to 22 cents, beating views for 20 cents, as polled by Thomson Reuters. Mobileye's core products are chip and software technology that provides image processing and analysis used in cars with camera-based systems for assisted driving.Mobileye stock Wednesday rose 2.8% to 47.42, touching a five-month high.RELATED:Tesla, Alphabet, Automakers Get Guidelines On Self-Driving VehiclesWill Tesla Get Run Over By China, GM, Ford, BMW In Electric Vehicles?

1294,NOV,"Good things, they say, come in small packages. That can be true for chart patterns, too. One example: the square-box base. As the shortest possible base within IBD's collection of winning patterns, it can form in as few as four weeks and lasts no more than seven weeks.For chart readers, square boxes seem to happen in the wink of an eye.Aruba Networks cleared a square box on Aug. 27, 2010. Latin American brewery giant AmBev (ABEV) (also known as Companhia de Bebidas das Americas) topped one the week ended Sept. 3, 2010. Ebix (EBIX) cleared a square box that formed within a larger base in the week ended Sept. 24. All have since gained 20% or more.Like a flat base, a square box corrects no more than 15% from top to bottom. Volume tends to dry up through the correction and surges at the breakout. The buy point is the highest intraday price within the pattern, plus a dime.The flat base must last a minimum five weeks, but can be much longer than a square box. Unlike the rounded bottom seen in a cup or in two down legs in a double bottom, the flat base's shape looks like its name implies — flat, sideways movement.The square box is the newest base in the CAN SLIM arsenal. It was introduced in the fourth edition of ""How to Make Money In Stocks,"" written and published in 2009 by IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil. ""I've noted this pattern over recent years,"" O'Neil wrote, ""but finally we've studied, measured and classified it.""As with all bases, you typically start your count of weeks for a square box during the first down week. That means the first week to log a Friday close that's below the prior Friday's close. A good example is Southwest U.S. oil producer Concho Resources (CXO).  Concho broke out of a cup-with-handle base in the week ended Aug. 7, 2009 (1). It quickly eased into a shallow correction the next week. It dipped 12%, and briefly touched its 10-week moving average during the fourth week of its pullback. A square box — as well as a base-on-base pattern — was born.Concho rose off its 10-week line in weak trade for three days. Heavy trading then boosted it above the base's 35.37 buy point (2) as the stock gained 11% for the week. This was a telltale sign of institutional buying. At the time, Concho marked an 88 Composite Rating and a 78 for Relative Price Strength.It pulled back to its 10-week moving average twice as it climbed 24% over the next two months. Then Concho slipped into what would become a second square-box base in November (3).Notice in this square box how the lows from week to week were close in price — 40.24 in the week ended Nov. 20, 2009, then 40.33, 40.19 and 40.35. In the week ended Dec. 18, Concho jumped 9% and cleared its new buy point of 44.08, or 10 cents above the highest price within the box (4). The stock also leapt to an all-time high.Volume that week was weak, however (5). Perhaps this explains why the stock soon formed a seven-week cup-with-handle from January to February of this year (6).Because a square box or flat base is a base pattern, it is included in a stock's base count. Look for a 20% gain from a prior base's buy point before counting it as a separate base, though. A square box can also form as part of a base-on-base pattern, which counts as a single base.(Editor's Note: This column originally published in the Oct. 28, 2010, edition of IBD.

1295,NOV,"After the price of oil more than doubled over the past year, SPDR Oil & Gas Equipment & Services ETF (XES) this month touched the highest levels since July 2015 and is forming a base.The fund is working on a base-on-base pattern with a potential buy point at 24.68. Shares have slipped below the 50-day moving average in the past couple of weeks, and continued work below that level would indicate weakness. But for now, at least, there's no serious flaw in the pattern.The exchange traded fund owns companies that provide the muscle to produce oil and gas. That comes from drilling specialists, builders of offshore platforms and geological analysts, plus providers of tubing, pumps and other elements of the vast network that goes into getting oil into barrels.Even now that crude oil has recovered some, the earnings outlook remains soft. The energy sector's fourth-quarter earnings are so far the weakest of any S&P sector, down 13.6% from the year-ago period.""Despite West Texas intermediate oil prices remaining steadily above $50 per barrel since the start of the year, earnings results from some of the majors have not been very strong,""  Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research, noted in a report Thursday. ""That being said, the growth decline is an improvement from the 67.5% decline in Q3 and the 86.1% decline in Q2.""But most energy stocks tend to follow the price of oil more closely than profits. The ETF's performance has shown a close correlation to oil prices for at least the past three years. On that front, the price of oil has stalled since June, and forecasts are uncertain. For example, Wells Fargo Investment Institute is skeptical. ""We don't see where the fuel is going to come from to push oil prices higher,"" wrote John LaForge, head of real asset strategy.The ETF, however, has traded better than oil in the past few months, snapping to new highs from Nov. 30 to mid-December, when it began its current consolidation.  On Nov. 30, OPEC finalized an agreement to curb oil output.The ETF's best-performing components include Fairmount Santrol (FMSA) and U.S. Silica (LSCA), two providers of the special sand used in oil wells. They've been in strong price uptrends since a low in January 2016.Patterson-Uti Energy (PTEN) has scaled higher from its 2016 breakouts and is trying another breakout now. RPC (RES) also has made good on last year's breakouts, rising about 16% from each of the three. But a move above a 22.38 buy point on Jan. 25 is sputtering.Ensco (ESV), Noble (NE) and Weatherford (WFT) are some holdings that haven't participated much in the energy's rebound. Most of the ETF's stocks bottomed around the same time crude prices bottomed, on Feb. 11, 2016.SPDR Oil & Gas Equipment & Services surged more than 27% in 2016. But like many commodity-related ETFs, it's had some huge moves, including a 59% plunge from May 2015 to January 2016.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

Impinj had been forming a faulty pattern, in which a handle was too low in the base.Granite Construction (GVA) slid 3% to the lowest level since Nov. 8 but trimmed a much larger loss.

1299,NOV,"Now that President Trump has ordered a delay of the Labor Department's controversial new fiduciary rule, which industry groups potentially stand to gain the most?The rule, which is slated to take effect April 10, requires financial advisors and brokers to recommend investments in the best interests of clients instead of those merely suitable. That would force advisors and brokers to put clients' interest ahead of their own profit.Financial firms have been deeply concerned about the potential effects of the new rule since it was approved last year. They fear it will hike advisory costs, making it less affordable for lower-income clients. That's why the delay has sharply boosted major banks and investment brokers.As of Thursday, 10 financial-related industry groups made the top 20 of the 197 groups tracked by IBD. Life insurance, investment bankers and brokers, and money center banks have seen big recent gains.The life insurance group includes highly rated stocks such as Primerica (PRI), which bears a 98 Composite Rating but is extended from a 73.15 flat-base buy point. The Duluth, Ga.-based insurer is a Leaderboard member. Lincoln National (LNC), with a 91 Composite, is near the top of its buy range from a 69.69 flat-base entry. New issue Athene Holdings (ATH) (95) is extended from a 48.82 buy point of a flat base. Shares have rallied nearly 30% from a 40 offering price at the Dec. 9 debut.The investment bank group includes asset managers such as Raymond James Financial (RJF), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Piper Jaffray (PJC). Raymond James is trading near all-time highs as shares ride the 50-day moving average higher. The St. Petersburg, Fla.-based company shares the top Composite Rating, 99, in the 30-stock group.The money center banks group, which includes Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS),  jumped 3% Feb. 3 on the news of the delay. The group remains near highs, following a 24% rally from its close on Nov. 8, election day, to its Jan. 13 peak.All the above stocks (except Athene) have posted 28% or better gains since Trump was elected Nov. 8, amid views that he would loosen regulation in the financial market.IBD'S TAKE: Primerica and Lincoln National are among financial and insurance stocks enjoying a ""Trump Bump."" Find out who some others are in this recent Sector Leaders article.Morgan Stanley owns the top Composite, 98, in the group. Shares are far extended from a 32.47 cup-with-handle buy point first cleared in October. The stock triggered the 20% to 25% profit-taking rule in November and has been making new highs. Bank of America's 95 Composite is second best in the group. Shares of the Charlotte, N.C.-based banking giant have bounced off the 50-day line after consolidating sideways the past two months. They tripped the profit-taking rule in late November.Goldman Sachs (also 95), which entered the profit-taking zone in mid-November, also has found support at its 50-day moving average. It's now extended from a bounce off the line near 232.Proponents of Trump's delay action include the Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund industry's trade organization. ""ICI supports a delay in implementation of the current DOL fiduciary rule,"" ICI President and CEO Paul Schott Stevens said in a statement. ""The Administration should use this time to address flaws in the rule and pursue a harmonized standard across the retail and retirement marketplace, coordinating with the Securities and Exchange Commission to ensure investors' best interests are paramount.""The Financial Planning Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, issued a statement saying it ""strongly opposes"" Trump's delay: ""By issuing this memorandum, the President is directing the Department of Labor to produce an outcome that will likely lead to either a complete gutting of this thoroughly vetted consumer protection or lead to its outright demise. Either one is a bad outcome for American retirement savers.""RELATED:Trump Orders Delay Of Labor Department Fiduciary RuleJPMorgan, Charles Schwab, Goldman Jump On Trump's Regulatory Rollback

Other Chinese internet stocks also rose, including Momo (MOMO), Tencent (TCEHY) and Weibo (WB).U.S. shares of NetEase soared 14.1% to a 298.73 on the stock market today.But the stock's action raised caution flags. NetEase is now well-extended from a classic buy point after breaking out of a fourth-stage base. (Later-stage patterns tend to be riskier.)

Here's an explanation why.The consensus on Shopify is revenue of $121.6 million, up 73% year over year but the fourth quarter in a row of revenue deceleration.Analysts expect a per-share loss minus items of 2 cents, vs. a 1-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter.Canada-based Shopify provides a cloud-based software-as-a-service e-commerce platform that businesses use to build websites and sell goods online and across multiple sales channels, including mobile and social media, and brick-and-mortar stores.Last month, Rosenblatt Securities reiterated a buy rating on Shopify, citing stronger-than-expected growth in online shopping during the holiday sales season.Among the reasons for owning Shopify, says Rosenblatt analyst Kirk Adams, are its differentiated e-commerce platform, its strong financial controls and its ability to integrate and partner with major players, especially Amazon and Facebook (FB).Ten of 11 analysts covering Shopify have a bullish rating on the company, according to research firm TipRanks.Shopify reported third-quarter earnings on Nov. 2 that topped Wall Street estimates, as revenue surged 88% to $99.6 million, but it's been unable to break into the black, minus items.Shopify counts about 325,000 businesses as customers worldwide, with brands such as Tesla (TSLA) and General Electric (GE).RELATED:Shopify Gets Buy Rating As It Targets 'Vast And Underserved' Market

1306,NOV,"Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter earnings and sales growth that fell short of what analysts had expected.

1309,NOV,"President Donald Trump's decision to revive TransCanada's (TRP) Keystone XL pipeline may herald a new era of pipeline abundance for Canadian oil producers after years of bottlenecks, while lowering the discount on the region's crude.The U.S. president signed documents to advance the project Tuesday, more than a year after his predecessor, Barack Obama, rejected it on grounds it would contribute to climate change. The decision follows the Canadian government's approval in November of Kinder Morgan's (KMI) Trans Mountain line to the Pacific and Enbridge's (ENB) expansion of Line 3 to the U.S. Midwest.The three lines would add 1.8 million barrels a day of crude export capacity, enough to handle Western Canada's growing oil production for 20 years, according to National Energy Board projections.That would add more than $4 billion a year to Western Canada's economy by making the region's crude more valuable relative to other grades, Tim Pickering, founder and chief investment officer of Auspice Capital Advisors Ltd. in Calgary, said in a phone interview. Because of the lack of capacity, refiners haven't paid as much for Canadian crude.""Too much capacity is not a big concern for the Canadian marketplace and producers right now,"" Pickering said. ""It gives us room down the road to increase production.""Canadian oil producers such as Suncor Energy (SU), Cenovus Energy (CVE) and Imperial Oil (IMO) have sold their heavy crude at discounts to West Texas Intermediate futures of as much as $40 a barrel in recent years amid constraints in pipeline space. Western Canadian Select's discount to West Texas Intermediate crude averaged about $14 a barrel over the past year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That may shrink to $5 to $7 a barrel should all three lines get built, Pickering said.More pipelines from Canada would also ""generate greater competition for crudes of comparable quality such as those imported from Mexico or Venezuela,"" Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity-markets strategy at BNP Paribas in London, said in an instant message.The administration moved to expedite approval and construction of the Keystone XL pipeline as well as the Dakota Access line through North Dakota. Trump said he wanted to renegotiate terms to get a better deal for the U.S., including more U.S.-made materials in the lines.The 830,000-barrel-a-day Keystone XL has been blocked since it was first proposed in 2008. TransCanada said in a statement it will reapply for the project.The approval of Keystone XL and other lines ""will mean better netbacks to producers,"" Tim McMillan, chief executive officer of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said in a phone interview Tuesday. ""It's really just a more efficient system for our economy.""Kinder Morgan's TransMountain line and Enbridge's Line 3 are scheduled for completion by the end of the decade, both companies have said. TransCanada also plans to build the Energy East line from Alberta to the Atlantic Coast.The pipelines may be more than the industry needs, according to Wood Mackenzie.""While we forecast continued growth in Canadian oil production; there might be too much pipe if Trans Mountain Expansion and Line 3 Replacement (approved in Nov 2016) and Keystone XL all start up by 2020,"" according to a note Tuesday from analyst Afolabi Ogunnaike. ""At best we would expect TransCanada to build Keystone XL or Energy East but not both.""Trans Mountain, which still faces at least two legal challenges, has the added advantage of opening up access to Asian markets for Canadian crude. Canada now sells nearly all its oil to the U.S.""Our view has been first of all that we need to diversify our markets, we can't rely on one market and one market only,"" Alberta Premier Rachel Notley told reporters in Edmonton on Tuesday.TransCanada has declined to comment on the timing of construction. In a best-case scenario, work could start this year, Dennis McConaghy, former executive vice president of corporate development at the company and a current shareholder, said by phone.

1311,NOV,"Alibaba Group (BABA) posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings before the market open Tuesday, sending the shares up in premarket action as China's e-commerce leader raised its guidance.Alibaba reported revenue of $7.67 billion, up 54% year over year in local currency and above the Wall Street consensus estimate of $7.33 billion. It reported earnings per share minus items of $1.30, beating the consensus of $1.13, for its fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31.Alibaba stock finished 3.1% higher at 101.43 in the stock market today and touched a more than two-month high.IBD'S TAKE: Investors have been anxiously awaiting a sign that Alibaba stock is ready to turn around after consolidating for the past four months, a correction that saw the stock fall more than 20% from its peak reached back in September.""With three quarters of the year coming in ahead of expectations, we are adjusting up our 2017 fiscal year revenue guidance from 48% to 53% year-over-year growth,"" said Maggie Wu, Alibaba CFO, in the earnings release.Results included revenue from Alibaba Nov. 11 ""Global Shopping Festival,"" also known as Singles Day. For that day alone, Alibaba said it processed $17.4 billion in transactions, of which 82% was generated through mobile devices.Among its various businesses, revenue from its cloud computing unit rose 115% to $254 million. Paying customers for cloud computing grew to 765,000, an increase of about 114,000 from last quarter. Revenue from digital media and entertainment rose 273% to $585 million.Alibaba ended December with 493 million monthly mobile active users, up from 450 million in the September quarter.""We are driving the age of 'New Retail,' which leverages big data and innovation to provide a seamless online and offline experience for nearly half a billion mobile monthly active users,"" said Alibaba Group CEO Daniel Zhang in the earnings release.Alibaba has been pursuing international markets and expects 40% of revenue will come from outside China in the next 10 years.

"
1312,NOV,"in the realm of smart chart reading, handles commonly latch on to cup bases. They can also be found on double bottoms or saucer bases. Either way, they offer investors a prime buy point within a well-formed base.Why do handles matter? They visually represent the last transfer of shares from long-suffering holders eager to exit a stock to the sturdier hands of professionals with conviction. A handle marks the final mild shakeout before a stock prepares an outstanding breakout, a run of new highs, and the potential for dedicated growth investors to increase their wealth.But before deciding to buy a stock that is breaking out, make sure you spend enough time to recognize the good handles from the bad ones.Please use this handy-dandy check list to help you spot the flaws and avoid potential stock-market traps.The upward-wedging handle. A handle is simply a mild quantified pullback. It should drift lower along the price lows of the handle, setting up the next potential leg up. The lows in a wedging handle, however, angle upward — a flaw because it doesn't show a shakeout of the last remaining weak holders. Wedging handles tend to form on third- or fourth-stage bases.The short handle. Handles need to be at least five days in length. Anything less is too short. Some take weeks or longer to form. Blood donation handling systems firm Haemonetics (HAE) cleared a 61.17 buy point from a four-day handle on Feb. 2, 2009. But after a big breakout day, the stock quickly fizzled.The low handle. A handle should form in the upper half of the stock's base. It's also generally best if it begins forming no more than 15% off the high of the pattern.Use the midpoint test. This simple calculation is performed to see if the handle has formed in the upper half. First, add the high and low of the base, then divide by 2. That gives you the midpoint of the base. Then calculate the midpoint of the handle. The latter should be greater than the first. The formation of a low handle tells you the stock hasn't been strong enough to recover the bulk of its prior losses.The deep handle. Generally, a handle should correct no more than 8% to 12% during a normal up cycle in the market. When stocks are nearing the bottom of a bear-market-type decline, handles can correct 20% to 30% and the breakout can still be OK — so as long as the market soon stages a follow-through signal and the stock is top-notch in fundamentals, technical strength, and institutional sponsorship. In essence, such a stock should have all the characteristics of a true CAN SLIM growth name.Ctrip.com International (CTRP) cleared a 63.10 buy point from a deep handle on May 1, 2008. The stock's handle corrected 23% while the market was in a confirmed rally. Ctrip imploded after gaining 12%.High volume in handle. It's best to see a handle formed mostly in below-average volume. Yes, you can allow a day or two of heavy volume within the handle; such a shakeout in fact can be healthy. Yet overall the pullback should show only a few remaining uncommitted investors quietly taking money off the table, not institutions dumping stock.Back in January 1991, software giant Microsoft (MSFT) bolted out from a cup-with-handle base. The stock's handle was four weeks in length. All weeks occurred in very low volume, suggesting that professionals were holding on to their shares.Microsoft more than doubled in 12 months and went on to become one of the greatest stocks in the 1990s.It's possible for a stock to show more than one flaw within its handle. Even if the company has proved itself a winner, keep in mind that the current base gives the most important clues to whether or not a future breakout will have a good chance of success.Trina Solar (TSL) debuted on the NYSE at 9.30 on Dec. 19, 2006, and surged above 18 by late February the next year. The company makes photovoltaic cells for solar power equipment.Solar stocks have proved to be volatile, and Trina was no exception. After hitting a peak of 68.90 in April 2007, shares corrected 44% in less than eight weeks.Buyers rolled in, and the stock quickly formed a cup without handle. In July, Trina hit a new high, but quickly dropped hard again (1), coming within 4 cents of the low of the prior base.By late October, it had formed a cup-with-handle base with a 64.60 buy point. But this pattern was flawed too. Why?The stock's handle was 26% deep (2) and formed in some heavy volume (3) — two critical flaws.Before its breakout, Trina had solid IBD Ratings: Composite 97, Earnings Per Share 82, Relative Strength 96 and Accumulation/Distribution B-.But when the stock cleared the handle Nov. 6, its rally failed two days later.Trina fell 50% by Nov. 21 (4) as the broader market weakened fast.(Editor's Note: This column originally ran in the Aug. 20, 2010, edition of IBD.

1314,NOV,"Fiber-optics company Finisar (FNSR) saw its shares tumble Monday to a nearly three-month low after an analyst said big China customer Hauwei had prohibited the company from selling a certain product to the company, a major global provider of networking gear.""We believe Finisar's 100G CFP2 has been disqualified to supply to Huawei in January due to a module's firmware issue resulting in incompatibility,"" Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang wrote in a research note Monday. The C form-factor pluggable transceiver helps send data at very high, 100-gigabit speeds.Zhang said the setback for Finisar is a short-term opportunity for rivals Oclaro (OCLR) and Lumentum Holdings (LITE).""In our view, the disqualification is a serious penalty to the supplier, and even if Finisar fixes firmware issue, it will take a least one quarter or longer to requalify for Huawei,"" Zhang wrote.IBD'S TAKE: The fiber optics group isn't hot at the moment, but what groups are? Check out the IBD Industry Snapshot for deep dives on some hot markets.Finisar didn't respond to an email seeking comment.Finisar stock, which on Friday had been closing in on its 50-day moving average support line for the first time in nearly a month, fell 4.3% to 28.72 in the stock market today, earlier falling as much as 9.3% to 27.22, its lowest price since Nov. 1.But Lumentum stock also fell, down 2.1%, and Oclaro stock fell 0.64%.William Blair analyst Dmitry Netis, in a research note Monday, said that, if accurate, the impact would be minor.

""It's going to be a supply and demand market and we will work with those customers that want to work for us.""His prediction of a service price hike above 10% follows a recent Barclays survey that found that more than half of U.S. exploration and production companies see an increase of up to 10% this year.On Friday, competitor Schlumberger (SLB) said the company needs ""significantly higher pricing before we get into a sustainable operating environment"" and that it was in ""active pricing conversations with customers.""Halliburton shares closed down 2.9% at 54.80 on the stock market today. Schlumberger shares fell 2.6% to 84.27, ending just above their 50-day line. Baker Hughes (BHI) shares dipped 0.9%. Baker Hughes will announce quarterly results Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: The IEA lifted its forecast for U.S. oil production next year sharply higher, due in part to its assessment that shale productivity has improved by ""leaps and bounds.""Halliburton's Q4 earnings plunged 87.1% to 4 cents per share, but that beat analysts expectations by 2 cents. Revenue fell to $4.02 billion, below views for $4.09 billion. North American revenue grew 9% sequentially to $1.8 billion. International revenue rose 2% sequentially to $2.2 billion.Edward Jones analyst Rob Desai had said he was expecting Halliburton to benefit more from its exposure to North America in Q4.""Despite the positive sentiment surrounding the North American land market, it is important to remember that our world is still a tale of two cycles,"" Lesar said in the earnings release. ""The North America market appears to have rounded the corner, but the international downward cycle is still playing out.""Halliburton also said that North American revenue would grow in line with rig count this year.

1318,NOV,"Half of the 18 components of IBD's ETF Sector Rotation index are financials, which gives you an idea just how strong the sector has been performing.One of the new faces in that batch is iShares U.S. Financial Services (IYG), a fund with a more-diversified profile than the various banking ETFs in the index, but one that still draws most of its strength from banks.Nearly 60% of the fund is in big banks such as Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) plus many small regional players. But the fund expands its scope with more than 30% of holdings in financial services firms such as NYSE operator Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and BlackRock (BLK), which happens to be the parent of the iShares family of ETFs.About 10% of the portfolio is categorized as software, where credit card companies Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) are found.The fund differs from its larger cousin, the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF), in a couple of significant ways. Financial Select Sector has about two-thirds as many holdings and they're generally bigger stocks. The average market cap for Financial Select Sector is $89.6 billion, compared with $69.5 billion for iShares U.S. Financial, according to Morningstar.A great many of the 110 stocks in the iShares fund are near the 10-week moving average, including most of the largest holdings. Similarly, iShares U.S. Financial Services is testing support as it pulls back to the 10-week moving average. A rebound from its current level would create a buy area for the ETF.The outlook for the financial sector is improving, as the first round of earnings has been mostly favorable. But uncertainly over tax proposals rattled bank stocks the past week.Financial are reporting the second-highest earnings growth of all 11 S&P sectors, 16.2% as of a week ago, according to a report from FactSet Research. Insurance companies are expected to have the highest earnings growth at 45%, followed by Capital Markets at 29%.""At the company level, AIG (AIG), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America are the largest contributors to earnings growth for this sector,"" FactSet noted.But financial stocks have been following a couple of other important trends. First, bond yields have been climbing as the Federal Reserve weans the U.S. economy off an easy monetary policy. Second, Republicans in Congress have a chance to unwind or eliminate regulations that have dampened bank profits. In fact, the Nov. 8 election sparked a rally in the fund that resulted in a 13.7% surge in November, its best month since April 2009.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

1319,NOV,"In March 2015, Hillary Clinton publicly admitted that she used a private email server to handle all her official emails while Secretary of State. A little more than a year later, the FBI recommended against pursuing charges against Clinton.In between those two events, the scandal raised serious questions about why Clinton set up the private system in the first place, whether she knowingly sent or received classified material on her unsecured email system, whether she harmed national security, and whether she turned over all her work emails.As the scandal unfolded, it became clear that Clinton had been misleading or dishonest about a number of claims she made to defend herself. She hadn't turned over all her work emails; she had sent and received highly classified documents; she never had approval from the State Department's IT experts for her set up.Even FBI director James Comey harshly criticized Clinton, saying she and her staff had been ""extremely careless"" in the handling of highly sensitive information and that it was ""possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal e-mail account.""The scandal continues to raise serious questions about Clinton's honesty and trustworthiness, since she was caught making several false claims as the scandal unfolded, and about her judgment.On Oct. 28, Comey dropped a bombshell by saying that, due to newly discovered emails, the FBI was revisiting the investigation he had said was closed back in July. Then just a week later on Nov. 6, Comey said his early decision stands, and the FBI will not recommend prosecution.The roller coaster news has had a marked shift in Hillary Clinton's standing in recent election polls, including the IBD/TIPP tracking poll.IBD has closely followed this scandal with numerous pieces on the editorial and commentary pages to track developments, provide insights, and help readers gain a better understanding of the nature and significance of this scandal amid a flurry of partisan barrages.RELATED:IBD/TIPP Presidential Election Tracking Poll: Latest ResultsClinton Foundation ScandalElection 2016 Coverage And CommentaryRead More IBD Editorials And Commentary

But there was nothing nostalgic or sentimental about Obama's last acts. Two of them were simply shocking.Perhaps we should have known. At the 2015 White House correspondents dinner, he joked about whether he had a bucket list: ""Well, I have something that rhymes with bucket list.""Turns out, he wasn't kidding. Commuting the sentence of Chelsea Manning, one of the great traitors of our time, is finger-in-the-eye willfulness. Obama took 28 years off the sentence of a soldier who stole and then released through WikiLeaks almost half a million military reports plus another quarter-million State Department documents.The cables were embarrassing; the military secrets were almost certainly deadly. They jeopardized the lives not just of American soldiers on two active fronts — Iraq and Afghanistan — but of locals who were, at great peril, secretly aiding and abetting us. After Manning's documents release, the Taliban ""went on a killing spree"" (according to intelligence sources quoted by Fox News) of those who fit the description of individuals working with the United States.Moreover, we will be involved in many shadowy conflicts throughout the world. Locals will have to choose between us or our enemies. Would you choose a side that is so forgiving of a leaker who betrays her country — and you?Even the word ""leaker"" is misleading. Leak makes it sound like a piece of information a whistleblower gives Woodward and Bernstein to expose misdeeds in high office. This was nothing of the sort. It was the indiscriminate dumping of a mountain of national security secrets certain to bring harm to American troops, allies and interests.Obama considered Manning's 35-year sentence excessive. On the contrary. It was lenient. Manning could have been — and in previous ages, might well have been — hanged for such treason. Now Manning walks after seven years.What makes this commutation so spectacularly in-your-face is its hypocrisy. Here is a president who spent weeks banging the drums over the harm inflicted by WikiLeaks with its release of stolen materials and emails during the election campaign. He demanded a report immediately. He imposed sanctions on Russia. He preened about the sanctity of the American political process.Over what? What exactly was released? A campaign chairman's private emails and Democratic National Committee chatter, i.e., campaign gossip, backbiting, indiscretions and cynicism. The usual stuff, embarrassing but not dangerous. No national security secrets, no classified material, no exposure of anyone to harm, just to ridicule and opprobrium.The other last-minute Obama bombshell occurred four weeks earlier when, for the first time in nearly a half-century, the United States abandoned Israel on a crucial Security Council resolution, allowing the passage of a condemnation that will plague both Israel and its citizens for years to come. After eight years of reassurance, Obama seized the chance — free of political accountability for himself and his potential Democratic successor — to do permanent damage to Israel. (The U.S. has no power to reverse the Security Council resolution.)Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. who went on to be a great Democratic senator, once argued passionately that in the anti-American,  anti-democratic swamp of the U.N., America should act unwaveringly in opposition and never give in to the jackals. Obama joined the jackals.Why? To curry favor with the international left? After all, Obama leaves office as a relatively young man of 55. His next chapter could very well be as a leader on the international stage, perhaps at the U.N. (secretary-general?) or some transnational (ostensibly) human rights organization. What better demonstration of bona fides than a gratuitous attack on Israel? Or the about-face on Manning and WikiLeaks? Or the freeing of a still unrepentant Puerto Rican terrorist, Oscar Lopez Rivera, also pulled off with three days remaining in his presidency.A more likely explanation, however, is that these are acts not of calculation but of authenticity. This is Obama being Obama. He leaves office as he came in: a man of the left, but possessing the intelligence and discipline to suppress his more radical instincts. As of Nov. 9, 2016, suppression was no longer necessary.We've just gotten a glimpse of his real self. From now on, we shall see much more of it.

1323,NOV,"""Wait and see"" is the mantra of ETF investors as Donald Trump assumes the reins of the highest office in the land. Will his ambitious campaign proposals translate to policy or get lost in translation?""The U.S. equity markets have enjoyed a classic 'buy the rumor' rally,"" built around Trump's promises, said David Haviland of Beaumont Capital, an expert at investing in exchange traded funds. ""The question is, what will be the news that causes the sell?""Haviland is one of two money managers who spoke to IBD recently about their stock market outlook as well as their best ETF investment ideas for the year ahead. For the moment, Haviland is making some bullish bets.One of Haviland's picks, O'Shares FTSE U.S. Quality Dividend (OUSA) holds stocks that could rocket if Trump delivers fiscal stimulus as promised and allows U.S. companies to bring home their offshore cash.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2017Henry Ma of Julex Capital, another investing pro, expects two postelection rotation trades — from bonds to equities and from high yield to growth — to continue. His ETF picks, too, reflect an overall optimism.Still, both Haviland and Ma have eyes wide open to downside risks. Like many other investors, they straddle hope and caution as the White House welcomes its newest resident.Here they are in their own words:David Haviland is managing partner and portfolio manager at Beaumont Capital Management, a Needham, Mass.-based asset manager offering ETF-based growth strategies with defensive capabilities since 2009; assets under management and advisement: $3.7 billion as of September 2016.After the Nov. 8 election, the U.S. equity markets have enjoyed a classic ""buy the rumor"" rally. The rally has focused on the promises made during the election and the prospects for beneficial change.Specifically, some of the key topics include a $1 trillion, 10-year Federal stimulus package to improve infrastructure, the reworking of the federal corporate tax system to make our tax code more competitive, the renegotiation of several trade agreements that currently induce the exportation of jobs, and the likelihood of large amounts of repatriation of U.S. multinational foreign profits.All of these items should serve to stimulate growth and reflation here in the U.S. The question is, what will be the news that causes the sell? Investors tend to buy the rumor and sell the news.Here are four ETFs that should do well in 2017. These ETFs are currently owned or could be purchased at any time within BCM strategies.In a low-interest-rate environment, the baby boomers need income from their portfolio to live off of. O'Shares has distilled the universe of large-cap equities down to a portfolio of 151 companies across all sectors that should provide better long-term, risk-adjusted returns.Examples of these portfolio companies with superior balance sheets include Apple (AAPL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Microsoft (MSFT), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Procter & Gamble (PG). (Editor's note: OUSA has a 2.32% 12-month yield.)To be included, at least 50% of a company's sales and revenue must come from the internet. The ETF also uses a more limited screening process for liquidity and size. The top holdings include the ""FANG"" stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and (Google parent) Alphabet (GOOGL).Over one-third of humanity currently lives without clean water. The infrastructure required for this most important resource will be massive here in the U.S. as well as across the globe in both developed and emerging markets.The ETF should benefit from Trump's infrastructure build here in the U.S. We do not currently own this ETF but we have in the past, and it could make its way back into the portfolio in 2017.Top positions in the fund include Danaher (DHR), London-based Wolseley, Switzerland-based Geberit and France-based Veolia Environmental, which illustrates the global reach.(Editor's note: While the ETF has relatively low average trading volume, a large asset manager like BCM can access the underlying liquidity of the stocks in the index through the create/redeem process.)In a rising-rate environment, Treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) tend to perform better than regular bonds given their yield plus inflation construct — the principal rises with inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, while the yield is fixed.This ETF also uses a short duration, currently 2.4 years, as added protection against rising rates. It yields 0.89%.Henry Ma is president and chief investment officer at Julex Capital Management, an SEC-registered quantitative investment management firm based in Boston. The firm's tactical unconstrained investment solutions aim to limit downside risks while maximizing upside potential; total client assets as of September 2016: $358 million.As we enter 2017, we may be witnessing major shifts of economic policies, which could have significant impacts on financial markets. The new year is likely to see a continuing rise of protectionism, which is evidenced notably in the Brexit referendum and the U.S. presidential election.This trend could undermine global growth, but there will be winners and losers. The export-dependent sectors have the most to lose.After eight years of monetary stimulus, policymakers among the developed countries have realized that loose monetary policies are no longer effective and fiscal policies are needed to spur economic growth. In the U.S., President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to reduce taxes and spend $1 trillion on infrastructure.These potential fiscal expansion programs have improved growth prospects, fueling higher inflation expectations, pushing bond yields upward, and causing losses for bond holders. We will see more rotation from bonds to equities in this reflationary environment. Within the equity markets, the yield-seeking trade has run its course as investors rotate from high-yielding sectors to growth sectors. We expect these two rotation trades to continue, and recommend three ETFs that could outperform in 2017.The Fed is likely to raise interest rates to 1.25%-1.50% at the end of 2017. This higher rate will certainly boost the profit margin for financial stocks. The potential appeal or revision of financial regulations such as Dodd-Frank by the Trump administration will also help improve their profitability and earnings growth.As we expect the U.S. economy to grow above 3% in 2017, the tech sector will benefit from increasing demand and higher revenue growth. The valuation is still attractive as the sector is traded at a slightly lower forward PE ratio than the S&P 500 index.Potentially protectionist trade policies and fiscal expansion programs will generate more domestic demand for small companies' products. The trailing PE ratio of IWM is 21.4, which is close to the PE ratio of the S&P 500 Index (20.4). Better growth prospects will provide small-cap stocks with more upside potential.(Editor's note: These ETFs are currently owned/were recently owned by Julex Capital strategies and could be purchased at any time within their client portfolios.)RELATED:High Yield Strategy Uses 10 ETFs To Deliver All-Weather Income With Low Risks6 Best ETFs For When You're Both Bullish And Cautious About The Markets

1326,NOV,"American Century All-Cap Growth Fund (TWGTX) is enjoying an uptick in performance so far this year relative to its large-cap growth rivals. The outperformance stems from recent gains by the type of stocks it has long favored: U.S. stocks with sustainable accelerating growth. Two of the places it's finding those are in internet leaders and electronic payment platforms. The surge has $1 billion All-Cap Growth pointing back in the direction of its long-term outperformance.So far in this young year, the fund is up 3.31%, going into Thursday. That tops 66% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., all of which averaged a 3.04% gain as the S&P 500 rose 1.56%. The fund topped 49% of its direct rivals over the past year. It beat 90% of its peer group over the past 10 years.During the fund's year-to-date romp, best performing investments included such top holdings as social media giant Facebook (FB), with a good 90 Composite Rating from IBD, which is up 11% this year. The social network has entered the enterprise software market with a business collaboration suite called Workplace. Workplace is a challenge to a lot of intraoffice email. It looks almost identical to Facebook itself. But it gives businesses the ability to guide conversations back to work topics.Trading near 128, Facebook is building the right side of a cup base with a 133.60 buy point.Alphabet (GOOGL), the No. 1 holding as of Nov. 30, jumped 4.6% this year. Trading around 829, Alphabet is within the buy range of its 824.40 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. EPS grew 16%, 20% and 23% the past three quarters.Earnings growth is expected to toggle between 17% this year to 19% next year and back down to 17% the year after, according to Thomson Reuters.And credit-and-debit card titan MasterCard (MA), No. 5 in the portfolio, is up 5.2% this year. Sporting a nice 82 Comp Rating — a 99 Comp Rating is the highest possible — its EPS growth has gone from a 12% decline to a 13% and 19% gain in the three most recent quarters. It benefits from rising use of mobile digital payments.While the fund's prospectus allows managers David Hollond, Michael Orndorff and Marcus Scott to invest in companies of all sizes, about 75% of shareholder money was in large caps as of Sept. 30, according to Morningstar. Information technology was the fund's largest sector as of Dec. 31, with a 31% weighting. Consumer discretionary was next with a 21% weighting.In addition to Facebook and Alphabet, tech-oriented holdings included Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) among top holdings as of Nov. 30. Broadcom (AVGO) and Applied Materials (AMAT) were two additional tech names.Broadcom is on IBD's Leaderboard. The company makes analog and digital semiconductor systems for wireless communications and other applications. IBD's Patrick Seitz recently detailed why at least six investment banks have increased their price targets for the stock. One key reason is Broadcom's three quarters in a row of accelerating sales and earnings growth. The bulk of gains stem from Broadcom's merger with Avago, which closed in February.Applied Materials is in the IBD 50.IBD'S TAKE: Applied Materials is No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group. To see how the company's growth metrics — like its top-notch 99 IBD Composite Rating and three quarters of accelerating EPS growth — stack up against its rivals, visit IBD Stock Checkup.Among other holdings, veterinary services provider VCA (WOOF) is up 32% and sports a very strong 94 Composite Rating from IBD. Its shares got a boost from news this month that candy maker Mars plans to acquire VCA.Biotech Incyte (INCY) is another top performer, up 15%, with a 94 Comp Rating.Incyte broke out earlier this month. It opened Thursday still within a buy range, trading just shy of 5% above its 110.05 buy point. Earnings per share grew at a triple-digit pace in five of the past six quarters. In the sixth frame, EPS growth declined.Its products in development treat pancreatic cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. In a report on Wednesday, JMP Securities reiterated its outperform rating on Incyte and said it has a 130.00 price target on the stock. The biopharmaceutical is trading around 115.RELATED:Hot Mutual Fund Manager Dissects Leading Holdings Like Facebook, AlphabetHot Stocks That Made Craig Hodges 2016's Top Mutual Fund Manager

1327,NOV,"The Dow Jones industrial average and other key indexes strove to cut early losses on Thursday as the nation remained embroiled in controversy over incoming President-elect Donald Trump and Congress engaged in a deep-fry questioning of Treasury secretary pick Steve Mnuchin.Meanwhile, select large-cap techs brushed off worries over the future of Capitol Hill and the White House as institutional trading desks deployed more capital in names such as Nvidia (NVDA), one of the market stars of 2016 that this week tested support at its 10-week moving average near 99.72, setting off a technical buy signal.Nvidia shares rallied nearly 3% to 105.99, with volume initially running sharply above average pace. But by mid-afternoon, Thursday's pace fell around 25% below average. Nvidia's 50-day average turnover is 19.5 million shares.This is the second time that Nvidia tested the key 10-week line following a late-September breakout past a 63.60 flat-base entry.However, as noted in a past Stock Market Today column, the graphics processors expert staged climax-run-like action at the end of December, meaning that a significant price correction was due.Indeed, that has happened, with the stock falling nearly 18% below its 119.93 all-time high. And yet the stock has been showing much restraint in its current decline, a good sign for long-term holders who have a healthy profit cushion in the stock.The 30-stock Dow industrials index was off nearly 0.4% with less than 45 minutes remaining in Thursday's session. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite nursed losses of 0.2% to 0.5%.But the Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial firms in that all-electronic exchange, was virtually flat.Small caps lost their edge following the Russell 2000's solid gain of 0.5% on Wednesday. The Russell caved 0.8% Thursday. With less than an hour to go until the market close, volume is still running higher vs. the same time Wednesday on the Nasdaq and mildly lower on the NYSE.U.S. government long bonds tanked, sending the 10-year Treasury yield up as high as 2.48%. That's still well below its mid-December peak of 2.60%.Returning to Nvidia, one could argue that the stock has already made two pullbacks to the 10-week moving average after its late-September breakout. The first occurred just four weeks into the new rally following that breakout, in the week ended Oct. 14. The second test of that 10-week line took place over a roughly two-week span that began in the week ended Nov. 4.However, in that Oct. 14 week, while the 10-week line in fact was a touch higher than the 63.60 entry, it also could be seen more as an initial pullback to the proper buy point. Such tests can happen in as many as four out of 10 big stock market winners, as IBD research has shown.Regardless, anyone who wishes to add shares to an existing position in Nvidia should take great care in 1) adding only a small amount, which abides by the law of pyramiding into a stock (i.e., adding smaller amounts of shares as a stock rises in price, thus keeping the average cost per share low); and 2) be ready to cut losses very quickly in that newly bought position.Elsewhere in the stock market today, 3M (MMM) is trading just a few points below a potential saucer-with-handle breakout price of 180.16. The shallow chart pattern began forming after the stock peaked near 182 in July last year.Analysts see the Dow component's Q4 earnings up 4% to $1.87 a share.3M is also trading nicely above its 50-day moving average, exactly what you want to see before a potential breakout occurs. The stock's RS Rating improved to 53 from 49 on a scale of 1 to 99, and is in a range typically seen in stocks forming long bases.Apple (AAPL) lifted off early-morning lows to trade nearly flat at 119.81, still in buy range from a breakout past a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point. The 5% permissible buy zone extends up to 124.02. Those who follow CAN SLIM investing rules should in general not chase a stock that breaks out and then moves more than 5% past the proper buy point.On Sept. 14, the iPhone giant cleared a 110.33 buy point in an earlier cup with handle that emerged out of a long bottoming base pattern., then rallied nearly 8% before pulling back, testing support at the pivotal 200-day moving average, and forming its latest new cup pattern.While Apple is not moving with the same gusto as it's done during past huge breakouts over the prior 12 years, the stock's ratings are gradually improving. Apple's 61 RS Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 is up from as low as 52 seven weeks ago, and its up/down volume ratio of 1.4 signifies heavy volume on up days in price relative to down sessions over the past 50 trading days. Focus on those stocks with an up/down ratio of 1.0 or higher. (IBD Stock Checkup, a premium research tool available at Investors.com, shows this ratio for all companies in IBD's database.)Mobileye (MBLY) continues to form its base as shares in the automobile self-driving and assisted-driving tech firm gained 3.7% to 43.59 and is holding nicely above its 50-day moving average.Mobileye showed solid gains following a long, deep cup-with-handle breakout past 48.88 in June 2015 and rallied as much as 29% in less than two months before forming a new flat base.That next base, however, failed, and the Israeli software and vehicle vision systems firm went into an even deeper price slide, falling more than 63% to a low of 23.57 by the first quarter of 2016. Such action indeed marks Mobileye's shift into a bottoming-base action.It's too early to set a new buy point for the mid-cap tech play for now, but the 93 Composite Rating and rising RS Rating of 64, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, suggest that it's worth a spot on aggressive growth investors' watch lists.Later today, watch for quarterly results from airline industry leader Alaska Air (ALK) (earnings seen falling 7% to $1.36 a share) and Dow 30 name IBM (IBM) (EPS seen up 1% to $4.88, which could snap a six-quarter streak of year-over-year declines).IBM is trying to bottom out after striking a low of 116.90 in February 2016. Big Blue has made minimal progress so far since clearing a 165.05 buy point within an aircraft carrier-size saucer-with-handle base.The handle itself, which formed from August to December last year, is long enough to qualify as a flat base.RELATED:Stock Market Today: When Did Nvidia Signal That A Correction Is Near?How To Invest: The Importance Of Pyramiding, And Other Nuggets Of Trading Wisdom From Gerald LoebHow To Invest: Why The Bottoming Base Pattern Still Matters Today For Growth And Value InvestorsHow To Invest: Still The No. 1 Rule In Stock TradingCan Nvidia's Fundamentals Turn It Into The Next Apple?

1328,NOV,"The semiconductor industry showed strength Wednesday on several fronts, with chip gear maker ASML (ASML) soaring to a record high after an earnings beat, Broadcom (AVGO) also hitting an all-time high while regaining a buy point, Nvidia (NVDA) reversing to the upside and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) finding support at its 50-day line.ASML stock jumped 6.1% to 122.97 on the stock market today, hitting a new high for the first time since May 2015, after the company's Q1 guidance and Q4 results beat Wall Street expectations.The Netherlands-based company posted a 74% year-over-year rise in EPS to $1.29 as sales rose 29% from Q4 2015 to $2 billion. That was its best bottom-line showing in more than four years and its biggest top-line growth since Q2 2014.The company said it received orders for six EUV systems in the quarter, bringing its backlog to 18 EUVs. These multimillion-dollar extreme ultraviolet lithography systems are ASML's newest products, using concentrated light rays to etch circuitry onto silicon.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia, which makes graphics chips for gaming systems, self-driving cars and other end markets, has taken up residence at the top of the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks. Keep tabs of this resource regularly to track winning stocks.In 2016, the company ""turned the corner on the introduction of EUV,"" ASML CEO Peter Wennink said in the earnings release. He called 2016 ""a remarkable years for ASML on many fronts.""The company ""indicated that they are likely to receive further orders (EUV) orders"" this quarter,"" Credit Suisse analysts said in a research note Wednesday, though they maintained a neutral rating and 113 price target on ASML stock. ""We believe the results should be viewed positively by investors due to the strong momentum on EUV orders.""IBD's 34-company Seminconductor Equipment group, which hit a 16-year high Friday, rose 1.3% Wednesday.Broadcom, meanwhile, rose 3.3% to 185.01, regaining the buy zone. Broadcom stock broke out of a flat base at a 179.52 buy point on Dec. 9, and had hit its previous record high on Dec. 21. The stock, which has been a chip leader, rose 22% in 2016. It makes chips for mobile devices and other products, with Apple (AAPL) among notable customers.Graphics chip company Nvidia, another industry leader of late, rose 1.8% to 102.95 Wednesday, breaking a five-day losing streak. The stock has shown signs of hitting a climax high, peaking at 119.93 on Dec. 28. At that point, shares had risen 43% just since Nov. 10. Nvidia has taken up residence at the top of the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks.Nvidia's top rival in graphics chips for gaming systems, AMD, reversed Wednesday to a small gain, finding support at its 50-day moving average, a key support line for any stocks. Closing Wednesday at 9.89, up 0.66%, AMD shares are down 20% since touching a six-year high of 12.42 on Dec. 28. The stock last broke out on Nov. 18 at 7.63, so it had long ago reached a price where investors should have locked in profits.RELATED:ASML Upgraded by Bank Of America, But Goldman Downgrades Applied MaterialsBroadcom, Nvidia Among RBC's Top Picks For 2017

1329,NOV,"The U.S. economy continued to expand modestly from late November through the end of 2016 as a tightening labor market helped lift wages and prices more broadly, a Federal Reserve survey showed.The central bank's Beige Book economic report, based on information collected by regional Fed banks on or before Jan. 9, said firms and industries were optimistic about growth this year. Employment gains were characterized as slight to moderate, with most of the Fed's 12 districts saying they expected the labor market to continue tightening.""District reports cited widespread difficulties in finding workers for skilled positions; several also noted problems recruiting for less-skilled jobs,"" according to the report, released Wednesday in Washington. ""Most districts said wage pressures had increased.""The report underscores the U.S. central bank's views that the economy is healthy enough to continue removing monetary stimulus. Fed officials raised their benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point on Dec. 14, to 0.5%-0.75%. They also increased the number of hikes they anticipate in 2017, to three from two, based on the median projection of 17 members of the Federal Open Market Committee.The Fed's outlook for the economy is clouded, however, by uncertainty surrounding the fiscal policies of the incoming administration. While he promised spending increases and tax cuts in his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump has provided few details since the Nov. 8 election on the concrete policy proposals he intends to bring to Congress.Some Fed districts reported a rebound in confidence after the election, though the Cleveland Fed noted that it's unclear how changes in regulations will affect investments.The Fed also noted that pricing pressure has intensified, with eight districts reporting modest inflation.The Fed's preferred measure of inflation, excluding food and energy, reached 1.6% in the 12 months through November. Average hourly earnings rose 2.9% in December from a year earlier, the biggest jump since 2009, adding to confidence that inflation will continue to edge toward the Fed's 2% target.Labor markets across the country ""were reported to be tight or tightening during the period,"" the report said. ""A couple of districts mentioned layoffs, but even in those districts, as in other regions, most responding firms were said to have added employment, on net.""RELATED:Inflation Highest Since June 2014, Industrial Output Up, Homebuilders Upbeat

U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May confirmed Tuesday that she'll leave the European Union's single market while seeking a new arrangement on the customs union. Donald Trump is just three days away from being sworn in as the next U.S. president.""As the inauguration of Trump draws close, I think people are realizing that potentially this could be a very stormy presidency and gold may well benefit from that,"" said David Govett, an analyst at Marex Spectron Group Ltd. in London.

1332,NOV,"Tech giant IBM (IBM) doesn't appear to be out of the woods yet from a multiyear turnaround effort, judging by estimates for its fourth-quarter earnings slated to be released Thursday after the market close.IBM has been undergoing a major transition that includes shedding multibillion-dollar businesses. In the past several years, Big Blue has sold off computer hardware units, reshuffled its software businesses and realigned its workforce to reduce costs as it focuses on growth areas it calls strategic imperatives: cloud computing, Big Data analytics, security, and social and mobile computing.Since 2010, IBM has invested about $30 billion in these areas. During this transition, IBM has racked up multiple quarters of declines in revenue and earnings.The Wall Street consensus estimate for Q4 looks for IBM to report revenue of $21.64 billion, down 0.01% year over year. IBM has posted revenue declines for 18 of the last 19 quarters. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings per share minus items to rise 1% to $4.88, which would mark its first EPS increase in the past seven quarters.IBD'S TAKE: IBM stock has pulled back from a 52-week high of 169.95 reached on Dec. 13, but which stocks are currently touching one-year highs? Check out IBD'S New Highs list. The companies are ranked by Composite Rating, which is based on key metrics such as earnings and sales growth.IBM says its strategic imperatives generated $31.8 billion in revenue over the previous 12 months and represented 40% of total revenue in Q3. They are expected to reach $40 billion and represent more than 40% of revenue in 2018.Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White has maintained a buy rating on IBM and a price target of 186.IBM stock slipped 0.7% to 166.80 at the close on the stock market today. IBM stock is up 22% this year, after rising 21% in 2016. Shares touched a 17-month high of 169.95 on Dec. 13, and the stock remains in a buy zone after breaking out of a cup-with-handle base at 161.96 on Nov. 21.""Although Wall Street began to warm up to IBM in 2016, we believe the stock is still met with great skepticism and thus we believe there is room for sentiment to improve in 2017 if fundamental trends remain stable,"" White wrote in a research note. ""That said, IBM's stock has struggled around quarterly earnings reports with an average decline of more than 3% the day after earnings over the past 12 quarters (with declines 11 out of 12 times),"" he wrote.IBM beat estimates on the top and bottom lines when it reported Q3 earnings after the market close Oct. 17. The stock fell 2.3% the following day.CFRA Research analyst David Holt on Tuesday raised his price target on IBM stock to 175 from 160 and maintained a hold rating.""We think the current valuation and a healthy dividend (3.4% yield) helps mute downside risk while we wait for further clarity surrounding IBM's outlook in Strategic Imperatives and overall revenue trajectory,"" Holt wrote in a research note.RELATED:IBM Turnaround?

1335,NOV,"Every field has its mainstays. College football has the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Clemson Tigers lately, while opera has ""La Boheme.""In the field of finding leading stocks before they produce a masterpiece of big gains, one mainstay is the cup-with-handle base.If you don't know this chart pattern, then you probably don't know the right time to buy a great stock. And you're missing out on some great buy opportunities.A cup typically begins to take shape during a mild or intermediate decline in the general market.As a cup develops for a growth stock, it's normal for shares to fall 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 times more than the major indexes. The drop from the cup's top to its bottom usually ranges from 12% to 30%.The pattern should have a rounded U-shape rather than a V-shape, says William O'Neil, IBD's founder and chairman, in ""How to Make Money in Stocks."" ""The 'U' area is important because it scares out or wears out the remaining weak holders and takes other speculators' attention away from the stock,"" O'Neil wrote.He also notes that before the pattern starts to form, the stock should have been in a clear prior uptrend of at least 30% in price.The pattern's handle starts to develop after the stock has spent time working on the right side of its cup. The handle area is characterized by a downward price drift, or what's called a ""shakeout,"" rather than upward-drifting action. You want to see volume dry up as the handle forms.You also want the correction in the handle to be no more than 12% to 15%. In a major bear market, the decline might be larger and the handle can still work. And it should take shape in the upper half of the base, ideally with the handle's peak within 15% of the cup's peak.How long should the handle be? At least a week. Overall, the length for the entire cup-with-handle base ranges from at least seven weeks to typically no more than 65 weeks.Highflier Netflix (NFLX) broke out of an excellent cup-with-handle base in 2009. The DVD-rental-by-mail pioneer began to form a cup in April that year, after hitting an all-time high of 50.24 (1).Netflix's three-week handle started to take shape in September 2009. The high in the handle was at 48.20 (2). That's easily within 15% of the 50.24 peak for the cup's left side.Turnover was below average as the handle developed, as you would prefer to see (3).Volume picked up as the stock cleared its handle buy point of 48.30 (4). You get that buy point by adding a dime to the 48.20 peak in the handle.Another positive sign was that trade kicked in even more in the week after the breakout, as the stock reached another new high (5).So when might you have sold this stock? It's reasonable to have bailed out in the week ended Nov. 13, 2009 (6). At that point, Netflix had advanced more than 20% from its 48.30 buy point, and one of IBD's sell strategies is to lock in your profits after a gain of 20%.If you had sold your shares then, you wouldn't have had to sweat as Netflix corrected from mid-November through late January to as low as 48.52.But even with that decline, the stock didn't fall below its 48.30 trigger. Most big winners don't drop below a proper buy point as they make their big advances.Netflix went on to climb as high as 174.40 by Sept. 30, 2010. That's a gain of 261% from its cup-with-handle buy point.(Editor's Note: This column originally ran in the Oct. 26, 2010, edition of IBD.)RELATED:How To Read Charts Like A Pro, Part 1: How To Analyze The Cup With HandleHow To Read Charts Like A Pro, Part 2: Know The Details Of A Good HandleHow To Read Charts Like A Pro, Part 3: Why Paycom's Cup Base Failed The Cup With Handle Base: Don't Dismiss All Deep Cup Patterns

1336,NOV,"Citigroup (C) reported fourth-quarter profit that surpassed analysts' estimates as trading revenue jumped 31%, more than the bank had forecast last month.Net income rose 7.1% to $3.57 billion, or $1.14 a share, from $3.34 billion, or $1.02, a year earlier, the New York-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The average estimate of 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for adjusted earnings of $1.12 a share.Citigroup follows rivals JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) in posting a jump in revenue from helping clients trade in the months surrounding Donald Trump's surprise election win in November. Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat, 56, also has been restructuring the firm and whittling costs as he seeks to improve profitability and return more capital to shareholders.The bank's traders handling bonds, currencies and commodities generated $3.01 billion in the quarter, 36% more than a year earlier, excluding an accounting adjustment from that period. Their fourth-quarter revenue was the highest since before the financial crisis, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and better than the $2.83 billion estimated by analysts.Revenue from equities trading, an area the bank has targeted for an additional $1 billion in annual revenue, rose 15% to $694 million. That was just short of the $708 million estimated by analysts.Combined, trading revenue rose 31% to $3.7 billion. Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach had predicted Dec. 7 that it would rise about 20% in the quarter from a year earlier.Companywide revenue fell 8% to $17 billion, missing analysts' $17.3 billion estimate, as revenue tumbled 79% to $657 million in Citi Holdings, a unit housing operations and assets tagged for disposal. Operating expenses also declined 9%, to $10.1 billion, just below analysts' $10.2 billion estimate.Citi Holdings still eked out an $87 million profit. Gerspach had said last month that he was expecting a ""modest loss"" at that unit. The bank has said it will stop breaking out Citi Holdings' results in financial reports this year after its assets — $54 billion at year-end — shrank to become a relatively small part of the company's total balance sheet.U.S. bank stocks surged in the final weeks of 2016 as investors speculated that Trump's policies will lead to higher interest rates, looser regulation and lower taxes. The KBW Bank Index climbed 20% from the Nov. 8 vote through Tuesday, with Citigroup rising 17%.Trump's victory and the Federal Reserve's December interest-rate hike already have burnished Wall Street earnings by spurring clients to reposition stock and bond portfolios and react to currency swings.Trading, merger advice and securities underwriting helped boost revenue in the institutional clients group by 14% to $8.34 billion. Net income in that division, run by President Jamie Forese, rose 97% to $2.47 billion, helped in part by lower credit costs.Investment-banking revenue was unchanged at $1.13 billion, beating the $1.02 billion average estimate of analysts.Revenue from the consumer banking division, run by Stephen Bird, rose 2% to $8.03 billion. The bank has been spending money to increase revenue, committing to invest $1 billion in Mexico, and expanding the credit-card business. Last year, the bank brought Costco Wholesale (COST) customers on board in what the company has hailed as a key growth initiative.In December, the bank said one of Bird's key lieutenants, Jonathan Larsen, had resigned for personal reasons. Calling Larsen's oversight of retail banking and mortgages a ""critical role,"" the bank said in an internal memo dated Dec. 9 that it had yet to choose a replacement.Citigroup was the last of the six biggest U.S. banks to report results. Earlier Wednesday, Goldman Sachs (GS) said fourth-quarter earnings more than tripled to $2.35 billion as the fixed-income business got a boost from speculation economic growth will accelerate. In previous days, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America (BAC) all said profits rose in the quarter, helped by stronger bond trading. Wells Fargo (WFC) said net income dropped 5.4% as mortgage revenue declined.RELATED:Dow Stock Goldman Sachs Crushes Earnings Estimates On Bond TradingBanks Among Few S&P 500 Beneficiaries As Higher Rates Loom

1337,NOV,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH) beat fourth-quarter earnings forecasts Tuesday, helped by reduced cost pressure from its ObamaCare exchange business.Earnings of $2.11 per share were up 50.7% from a year ago and 4 cents ahead of the consensus. Revenue rose 9.0% to $47.52 billion, topping views of $47.13 billion.The company stood by its financial outlook for 2017: Revenue of $197 billion-$199 billion and adjusted EPS of $9.30-$9.60. Wall Street analysts see revenue of $198.3 billion and EPS of $9.51.Shares eased by 0.7% to 160.66 on the stock market today, despite the positive tone of the earnings and analyst call.UnitedHealth appeared to be caught up in a downdraft triggered by President-elect Donald Trump's weekend comments that clouded the prospects for corporate tax reform. Aetna (AET) was off 1% to 121.04, Anthem (ANTM) lost 1.2% to 146.75, Cigna (CI) dropped 1.1% to 144.77, while Humana (HUM) shares managed a 0.6% gain to 204.04.While other insurers' shares have been volatile amid ObamaCare woes and the antitrust outlook, UnitedHealth has been a standout stock, driven by its fast-growing Optum health services unit. UnitedHealth, whose shares vaulted above a buy point on Nov. 10 on the way to a 13% postelection rise, had been carving out a tight, constructive consolidation base before Tuesday's volatile session.Optum unit revenue growth temporarily slowed in Q4 due a 4.8% decline in revenues at the OptumRx pharmacy benefit management services unit. That decline reflected a loss of business that had been anticipated when UnitedHealth bought Catamaran.As the first big health insurer to report, UnitedHealth said its medical costs as a share of premium revenue fell 1.9 percentage points to 80.8% in Q4, helped by ""reduced individual market pressure.""While exchange losses were basically in line with expectations in Q4, the real improvement came vs. a year ago when UnitedHealth had recognized a premium deficiency reserve due to its ailing exchange business.UnitedHealth remains in a handful of ObamaCare exchange markets in 2017, but management said it has virtually no earnings exposure to the exchanges this year.The company added 2.2 million insured members in 2016, including 585,000 Medicaid beneficiaries. It expects its expects its Medicare membership to grow by 1 million in 2017.RELATED:UnitedHealth, The Amazon Of Health Care, Isn't Sweating Trump

1342,NOV,"In the same year that Apple (AAPL) opens an edifice to its greatness — a massive new headquarters that looks like a flying saucer — the company faces growing questions about its future and whether it can still surprise and delight customers with exciting new gadgets.Expectations are sky-high that 2017's 10th anniversary iPhone will be something special that unleashes the full potential of the Apple revenue-generating ecosystem.Yet to critics, the iPhone already has peaked. To them, that new HQ might as well be a monument to past accomplishments, funded with billions in profits generated by the iPhone, iPad, iPod and Mac computers, products ushered into the world by Apple's iconic co-founder and CEO, Steve Jobs.In the five years since Jobs died, Apple has introduced only one major new product category — the Apple Watch, which debuted in April 2015. Wall Street analysts consider the product a disappointment so far. Apple has declined to release its smartwatch sales numbers, claiming competitive concerns.For better or worse, Apple today is a smartphone company. It received 63% of its revenue in fiscal 2016 ended Sept. 24 from smartphone sales. Additional revenue comes from the sales of services and accessories connected to its iPhone business.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's research on various aspects of Apple and its stock show a hodgepodge of greens (good), reds (bad) and yellows (so-so). The IBD Stock Checkup gives investors a well-rounded view of how a company is performing. Take a look to see where Apple is going right, and where it's going wrong.But iPhone sales declined last year for the first time ever, during the iPhone 6S cycle. They could fall again this year, during the iPhone 7 cycle. In fiscal 2016, iPhone unit sales declined 8%, while iPhone revenue shrank 12%.Apple has a lot riding on its 11th-generation smartphone due out in fall 2017. The upcoming model, unofficially called the iPhone 8, is the company's 10th-anniversary product and could sport a radical redesign. Analysts predict it will feature a glass sandwich design, borderless OLED display, invisible home button and fast or wireless charging.Bullish Apple analysts say the iPhone 8 could create a ""supercycle"" of upgrade activity after three generations of similar-looking iPhones, and Apple stock rose 10% in 2016. On Jan. 6, the stock touched its first buy point in a while, at 118.12 out of a cup-with-handle base. Apple shares fell 0.19% to 119.02 on the stock market today but remain in a buy zone.But with an expected shortage of OLED displays, Apple is rumored to be coming out with just one model iPhone 8. It likely will round out its smartphone lineup with upgraded ""S"" model versions of its LCD-screen iPhone 7, possibly in three sizes.Apple will face smartphone competition this year from Samsung's new Galaxy S8, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Pixel phone and others.While Apple's unit-sales market share is slipping, the company remains the runaway leader in smartphone profits.""In 2017, Apple will continue to dominate the industry in terms of smartphone profits, but it's hard to see a strong case for big revenue growth,"" Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, told IBD.Moorhead says Apple is working hard to make the iPhone 8 special.""Apple will take some risks with the iPhone 8 to hit an anniversary home run, driving an above-average upgrade cycle,"" Moorhead said. ""I can envision a 25% upgrade lift if Apple does an edge-to-edge display, adds an ultrasonic fingerprint reader, eliminates the home button and offers 1 Gbps,"" that is, wireless data speeds of 1 gigabit per second. The current iPhone 7 supports wireless speeds up to 450 megabits per second.While Apple waits for the debut of its iPhone 8, the Cupertino, Calif.-based company is counting on its fast-growing services business, which includes Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud and other offerings, to tide it over.Apple CEO Tim Cook is bullish on services and the iOS ecosystem to drive incremental sales and profit growth as well as customer loyalty.It needs services growth because in addition to its declining iPhone sales, Apple also saw declining iPad and Mac computer sales last year.The company was roundly criticized for waiting over a year to update its MacBook Pro notebook computer lineup in November. And delays in updating its Mac Pro desktop computers prompted some observers to wonder if Apple was abandoning the product.Ken Mingis, executive editor of Computerworld, predicted last month that Apple will discontinue its Mac Pro desktop in 2017.""Apple hasn't done anything in three years with the Mac Pro. It's the best technology that 2013 can buy,"" Mingis ranted. ""And if it's supposed to be the top-of-the-line Apple product, the fact that they've neglected it for three years tells me a lot.""Cook took the unusual step of reassuring Apple employees in a Dec. 19 memo that new Mac desktops were on the way.""Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops,"" Cook wrote on an employee message board. ""If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: We have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that.""He did not provide specifics on when the new desktops would arrive or whether he was referring to the iMac, the Mac Pro or both.Some on Wall Street are pessimistic about Apple's prospects. In a Nov. 20 research report, Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz predicted that ""Apple is about to embark on a decadelong malaise."" Apple's fortunes are over-reliant on the iPhone, and the company ""lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation (AI, cloud-based services, messaging),"" he said.Among the products Apple has been rumored to be working on in recent years are a self-driving electric car (Project Titan), a best-of-cable internet TV service, and a Siri-based digital-butler appliance to compete with Amazon (AMZN) Echo.Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, expects Apple to put a focus on augmented reality. AR overlays digital information on the real world using smartphones, smartglasses and other devices.""Apple CEO Cook said he believes AR is much more interesting to his company than VR (virtual reality),"" Bajarin told Time magazine. ""I would not be surprised if AR will be a big focus when Apple introduces its next iPhone, likely in the fall of 2017. Expect more non-Apple phones to pack AR as well, likely via Google's Tango tech.""Moorhead, though, doubts that Apple is ready to jump into the emerging AR market yet.""I don't think we'll see any new products for sale (from Apple in 2017) that address growth markets like automotive or augmented reality,"" Moorhead said. ""We may see some discussion of strategy with some product details, but I'm not expecting real products for sale. Apple doesn't beta-test its products on consumers, and automotive and AR just aren't ready.""This year could be a do-or-die year for Apple's ambitions in the autonomous-car market.In October, Bloomberg reported that Apple had scaled back its Project Titan initiative from building its own self-driving electric car to developing autonomous-driving systems that it can supply to automakers.Apple set a deadline of late 2017 to decide whether to move ahead with the project, the news service said.Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry predicted last month that Apple will shutter its car unit in 2017.The biggest near-term news for Apple investors will involve what changes Apple makes to its annual capital-allocation plan in April. Many Wall Street watchers say Apple will raise its cash dividends and share buybacks significantly if President-elect Donald Trump is able to get corporate tax reforms enacted and makes it easier for U.S. companies to repatriate their overseas cash.RELATED:Apple Looking To Bulk Up With Original ContentApple Fades In PC MarketApple Looks To Bulk Up Product Portfolio With AR Smartglasses

1344,NOV,"Applied Optoelectronics' (AAOI) data center business, boosted by customers Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook (FB), is on a roll — a good sign for other suppliers of optical communications technology such as Finisar (FNSR), says Piper Jaffray.Applied Optoelectronics late Wednesday preannounced Q4 adjusted EPS of 77-82 cents, far above its prior target of 46-51 cents and consensus estimates of 50 cents. That would be a 261% year-over-year jump at the midpoint.The company sees revenue of $84.5 million to $84.8 million, up 60% at the midpoint and above the prior outlook of $75 million to $79 million. Analysts modeled $77.51 million.Piper Jaffray hiked its price target on Applied Optoelectronics stock to 35 from 31 after the fiber-optics company preannounced its Q4 results.Internet companies such as Facebook and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google are new customers of optical parts makers, which have mainly sold products to telecom companies. Internet firms are upgrading to 100 gigabit-per-second technology in data centers packed with computer servers.""While we believe results were mainly driven by the company's two largest customers (Amazon and Microsoft), we believe AAOI's newest customer (Facebook) had a positive contribution in the quarter,"" said Troy Jensen, a Piper Jaffray analyst, in his research report.He said AAOI's big quarter also bodes well for Finisar, another fiber player ""significantly leveraged"" in data center communications optics.Applied Optoelectronics shares shot up 32%, above 30, as of late-afternoon trading in the stock market today, blasting to an all-time high. Shares of Applied Optoelectronics rose 36% in 2016, touching a nearly three-year high of 27.28 on Nov. 21.IBD'S TAKE: Gigamon on Wednesday rejoined IBD's Sector Leaders, which highlights the best stocks in IBD's 33 sectors.

1346,NOV,"The shortest honeymoon on record is officially over. Normally, newly elected presidents enjoy a wave of goodwill that allows them to fly high at least through their first 100 days. Donald Trump has not yet been sworn in and the honeymoon has already come and gone.Presidents-elect usually lie low during the interregnum. Trump never lies low. He seized the actual presidency from Barack Obama within weeks of his election — cutting ostentatious deals with U.S. manufacturers to keep jobs at home, challenging 40-year-old China policy, getting into a very public fight with the intelligence agencies.By now he has taken over the presidential stage. It is true that we have only one president at a time, and for over a month it's been Donald Trump.The result is quantifiable. A Quinnipiac poll from Nov. 17-20 — the quiet, hope-and-change phase — showed a decided bump in Trump's popularity and in general national optimism. It didn't last long. In the latest Quinnipiac poll, the numbers have essentially returned to Trump's (historically dismal) pre-election levels.For several reasons. First, the refusal of an unbending left to accept the legitimacy of Trump's victory. It's not just the demonstrators chanting ""not my president."" It is leading Democrats pushing one line after another to delegitimize the election, as in: he lost the popular vote, it's James Comey's fault, the Russians did it.Second, Trump's own instincts and inclinations, a thirst for attention that leads to hyperactivity. His need to dominate every news cycle feeds an almost compulsive tweet habit. It has placed him just about continuously at the center of the national conversation and not always to his benefit.Trump simply can't resist playground pushback. His tweets gave Meryl Streep's Golden Globes screed priceless publicity. His mocking Arnold Schwarzenegger for bad ""Apprentice"" ratings — compared with ""the ratings machine, DJT"" — made Trump look small and Arnold (almost) sympathetic.Nor is this behavior likely to change after the inauguration. It's part of Trump's character. Nothing negative goes unanswered because, for Trump, an unanswered slight has the air of concession or surrender.Finally, it's his chronic indiscipline, his jumping randomly from one subject to another without rhyme, reason or larger strategy. In a week packed with confirmation hearings and Russian hacking allegations, what was he doing meeting with Robert Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist pushing the thoroughly discredited idea that vaccines cause autism?We know from way back during the Republican debates that Trump himself has dabbled in this dubious territory. One could, however, write it off as one of many campaign oddities that would surely fade away. Not so, apparently.This is not good. The idea that vaccines cause autism originally arose in a 1998 paper in the medical journal The Lancet that was later found to be fraudulent and had to be retracted. Indeed, the lead researcher acted so egregiously that he was stripped of his medical license.Kennedy says that Trump asked him to chair a commission about vaccine safety. While denying that, the transition team does say that the commission idea remains open. Either way, the damage is done. The anti-vaccine fanatics seek any validation. This indirect endorsement from Trump is immensely harmful. Vaccination has prevented more childhood suffering and death than any other measure in history. With so many issues pressing, why even go there?The vaccination issue was merely an exclamation point on the scatter-brained randomness of the Trump transition. All of which contributes to the harried, almost wearying feeling that we are already well into the Trump presidency.Compare this to eight years ago and the near euphoria — overblown but nonetheless palpable — at the swearing-in of Barack Obama. Not since JFK had any new president enjoyed such genuine goodwill upon accession to office.And yet it turns out that such auspicious beginnings are not at all predictive.  We could see it this same week. Tuesday night, there stood Obama giving a farewell address that only underscored the failure of a presidency so bathed in optimism at its start. The final speech, amazingly, could have been given, nearly unedited, in 2008. Why it even ended with ""yes we can.""Is there more powerful evidence of the emptiness of the intervening two terms? When your final statement is a reprise of your first, you have unwittingly confessed to being nothing more than a historical parenthesis.RELATED:Trump's Bold Action Plan For A New BeginningObama: Don't Blame Me For Democrats' DemiseWhy Hillary Clinton Lost: An Election Post-MortemSorry, Democrats, But Putin Didn't Steal The Election For Trump

1347,NOV,"Exchange traded funds tracking major stock indexes were lower Thursday as investors parsed through remarks from Donald Trump in his first news conference since being elected president.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) jabbed 0.7% lower on the stock market today in early trading. This ETF, a proxy for the broad U.S. market, has rallied 7% since Nov. 8 through Wednesday.However, its losses in early Thursday trading came after the president-elect offered few clues about his plans for corporate tax reform, fiscal stimulus and deregulation at his keenly awaited media event.Technology and financials led declining S&P 500 sectors in morning trade.Consumer staples and utilities ETFs held up better in early Thursday action, as investors tilted toward  defensively oriented sectors.Beyond equities, safe-haven assets were in demand.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) punched up as much as 1.2% to 114.75 — its highest level in seven weeks — as spot gold surged above $1,200 an ounce after the Trump briefing.IShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (TLT) popped 0.7% to 122.95.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell to 2.321%, its lowest since November, according to news reports.

""Our drug industry has gotten disastrous. They're leaving left and right. They supply our drugs, but they don't make them here, to a large extent.""Trump added: ""And the other thing we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry, because they're getting away with murder.""The iShares biotech ETF dived 3% in massive volume following those remarks and closed in the red for the first time in 2017.

1350,NOV,"Homebuilder KB Home (KBH) reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth quarter earnings after the market close.  Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI), a fiber optic components maker, gave preliminary Q4 results well above its prior guidance.KB Home earned 40 cents a share, down 7% vs. a year earlier but beating views by a penny. Revenue rose 21% to $1.19 billion, topping estimates for $1.15 billion.Orders rose 20% vs. a year earlier while its backlog hit $1.5 billion, the best year-end level since 2006. The average selling price rose 2% vs. a year earlier to $387,400.""With healthy net order activity in the fourth quarter contributing to our highest backlog value level in 10 years, we are entering 2017 with strong momentum,"" said Jeffrey Mezger, KB Home's chairman and CEO.KB Home shares rose 2.7% to 17.05 in after-hours action. Shares closed up 2.1% to 16.60 on the stock market today. In early December, KB Home broke out of a consolidation, hitting its best levels in 18 months. But the shares soon reversed and fell enough to make the 16.86 buy point invalid.Applied Optoelectronics sees Q4 adjusted EPS of 77-82 cents, far above its prior target of 46-51 cents and Wall Street's target for 50 cents. That would be a 261% jump at the midpoint. The company sees revenue of $84.5 million to $84.8 million, up 60% at the midpoint and above the prior outlook of $75 million to $79 million. Analysts expected $77.51 million.Non-GAAP gross margin should be 37.6%-38%, above the prior outlook of 34%-35.5%.Applied Opto shares soared 19.2% to 27.09 in late trading.

1351,NOV,"Credit Suisse lowered its price target on Facebook (FB) stock following a product-by-product recalibration and a closer look at some controversial factors.Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju cut his price target on Facebook to 170 from 165 but maintained an outperform rating on the social networking giant. In a research note, Ju also said Facebook shares are ""mispriced and present favorable risk/reward on the long side,"" with downside risk to about 93 and upside potential to his price target of 165.On Tuesday, Facebook got a price-target increase to 156 from 150 from Cowen & Co., based on a survey of advertisers showing strength in digital advertising and consumer targeting abilities.Facebook stock climbed 1.4% to close at 126.09 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook is one of the four closely watched FANG stocks, along with Amazon, Netflix and Google's parent company, Alphabet. Internet stocks are expected to outperform the broader market in 2017.Ju expects Facebook to solve ""overhangs,"" which include risks to ad revenue growth and concerns about operational expenditures and investments — issues he expects to be resolved in the next 12 months. He also expects Facebook to address these issues when it reports fourth-quarter earnings after the market close Feb. 1.Ju said Facebook should be able to drive long-term revenue growth without a material lift in advertising. Near-term revenue drivers include Instagram and premium video placements. He said Wall Street models underestimate the long-term monetization potential of Messenger, WhatsApp and other products.""As we have alluded to before, we do not believe the Street is giving Facebook shares any credit for potential moves to monetize Messenger so any incremental news in this regard should serve as a positive catalyst,"" Ju wrote.Ju's lowered Facebook price target also followed a review of checks with advertisers and a look at foreign exchange rates.Facebook shares fell 5.5% to 120 after the company posted Q3 earnings on Nov. 2 that topped estimates but came with a cautionary signal that the pace of ads placed on its website would decelerate, as would its revenue growth rate in Q4 and 2017.Facebook, which is slated to post earnings after the close Feb. 1, faces tough Q4 comparisons. Over the past few years, Facebook has averaged about 50% growth in ad revenue, which accounts for about 97% of Facebook's total revenue. Ad revenue ignited to 66% year-over-year growth in Q4 2015. Its Q3 ad revenue rose 59% to $6.8 billion.RELATED:AT&T Joins Facebook, Google, Snapchat In Mobile Video Ad ChaseAlphabet, Facebook Dominate Mobile App Downloads

1352,NOV,"The stock market mounted a late recovery Wednesday, closing with a positive reversal.The Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.5% increase, as Merck (MRK) defied weakness in the health care sector, rising 3%.The Nasdaq, down as much as 0.5%, closed 0.2% higher. The S&P 500 climbed 0.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 added 0.1%. Volume rose across the board, early figures showed.Indexes were erratic as Wall Street reacted to President-elect Donald Trump's first press conference since he was elected Nov. 8. Stocks swung as Trump blasted drug companies and the cost of the Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 fighter jet. He gave few details on his plans to spend massively on highways, bridges, airports and other infrastructure.But indexes worked their way back throughout the afternoon, in what can be termed a bullish price reversal.Biotech, generic drug and other medical stocks were down the most Wednesday after Trump took aim at drug prices for the second time since he was elected. Pharmaceutical and related groups fell roughly 2% to 5%. The iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) fell 3%. Medical stocks such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Myriad Genetics (MYGN) fell in unusually high volume.But the energy sector led as U.S. crude oil futures climbed 2.8% to $52.25 a barrel.  Mining and metals also came out on top of the day's performance table.Earnings season is just warming up, and Thursday's announcements will include Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Delta's results are especially noteworthy because airline stocks have rebounded this week, thanks to a spate of favorable metrics from individual airlines.Thursday's economic reports include the weekly jobless claims and import-export prices, both due at 8:30 a.m. ET.  Of perhaps more importance to the market will be speeches given by several Federal Reserve officials, including Chairwoman Janet Yellen. She speaks after the market close, at 7 p.m. ET at a town hall meeting with educators in Washington, D.C.RELATED:Trump Says Drugmakers 'Getting Away With Murder', Cites F-35, Ford, FiatTrump Vows Fighter-Jet Competition, 'Big Things' On Lockheed F-35 U.S. Crude Stockpiles, Production Soar, But Prices Rise As OPEC Cuts

The price target on Expedia stock rose to 145 from 133, but TripAdvisor's PT was lowered to 51 from 65.In his research note Wednesday, Bieber pointed out that ""despite intense competition and increasing sector maturity, the global travel market remains very fragmented, with Priceline only commanding approximately 10% of room night share.""He expects Priceline to notch 20%-plus gains in room-night sales in 2017. He also expects Priceline to benefit from Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google's expanded text-ad format.

Expedia completed that acquisition, its biggest, in December 2015.""We think Expedia's focus will return to driving higher conversion rates on Expedia.com, which we think will help support mid-to-high teens room night growth in 2017,"" Bieber wrote.TripAdvisor, though, faces continued strong competition from Priceline's Booking.com ""review ecosystem,"" Bieber said. Its shift to more sales via mobile users is another near-term headwind, the analyst said, though he also said ""we are positive on TRIP's leadership position at the top of the marketing funnel for travel. ...

This ETF, a proxy for the broad U.S. market, sits just below its December high of 228.34.Biotech ETFs turned sharply lower in the afternoon session after the incoming president slammed the drug industry in his first news conference since the Nov. 8 election result.""We have to get our drug industry coming back,"" Trump said at the media event.

1356,NOV,"Gold is splitting the investment community down the middle.Take the flows into and out of exchange traded funds. Money has been draining out of SPDR Gold Shares, the world's largest gold-backed ETF used by big institutional investors, each week since Nov. 11. But iShares Gold Trust, a smaller rival favored by individuals investing lesser amounts for themselves, has seen back-to-back weekly inflows.Large mutual, pension and hedge funds are chasing better returns in rallying U.S. stock markets thanks to the promise of President-elect Donald Trump's pro-growth policies. Retail investors including iShares Gold holders are returning to gold amid renewed concern that Trump protectionism will restrict global trade and growth. Those concerns were shared by more than two-thirds of traders surveyed by Bloomberg News last month, who forecast prices will gain this year as political uncertainties drive demand for haven assets, including bullion.Gold futures rose as much as 0.5% before settling little changed Tuesday at $1,185.50 an ounce on the Comex in New York. Prices have risen 5.4% since hitting a 10-month low on Dec. 15. People familiar with China's plans said last week the nation is prepared to retaliate should Trump take punitive measures against Chinese goods and trigger a trade war between the two biggest economies.Last week, investors pulled $307.1 million from SPDR Gold, while iShares attracted $80.8 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.""It looks like the hot money is showing a real negative sentiment towards gold and it's expressing that in GLD,"" Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, said, referring to SPDR Gold by its exchange ticker. ""Retail investors and advisors seem to be continuing their allocation to gold through these other vehicles,"" including iShares Gold, he said.Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers last week said investors are far too sanguine about the risks of Trump's policies, which analysts at Eurasia Group said could contribute to a level of global instability not seen since World War II. Summers also said Trump's plans for deregulation were setting the stage for the next financial crisis.Gold may rally to $1,300 at the end of 2017, according to the median of the 26 estimates by analysts and traders surveyed by Bloomberg News last year from Singapore to New York.While the uncertainties are sending retail investors and overseas buyers to the gold market, institutional investors are unloading their bullion in favor of higher returns in U.S. equities, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average hovers near 20,000. Last week, $15 billion poured into equity ETFs, as $106 million was withdrawn from funds backed by precious metals, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Equities have rallied since Trump's election to the presidency amid expectations of accelerating economic growth.Even hedge funds and other large speculators who are required to report holdings to the U.S. government have been paring their bullish bets on gold since the middle of November.Their net-long positions slid for an eighth straight week to 34,560 contracts in gold futures and options in the week ended Jan. 3, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released three days later. That's the smallest in almost a year.""This is a shift from institutional investors that were using gold earlier in 2016, rotating out,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, a director of ETF research at independent research firm CFRA in New York. IShares Gold ""is perhaps longer-term money that moved in and is more likely to stay a little bit longer,"" he said.Since Nov. 8, the day of the election, U.S. equities in general have seen $70 billion in inflows, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs sent out warnings last week, citing the potential for a reversal in the stock-market rally.Bram Kaplan, an equity-derivatives strategist at JPMorgan, said ""now is a good time"" to buy hedges on U.S. stocks, including a so-called ""dual-digital"" option linked to gold and the S&P 500 index.""We've been getting more buyers and bargain hunters in the gold market ever since December,"" George Gero, a New York-based managing director at RBC Wealth Management, said in a phone interview. ""Most of that has been coming from overseas. The U.S. has not had an interest in gold because the fund managers have been running into the stock market.""

1362,NOV,"Dialysis providers Fresenius Medical Care, American Renal Associates and DaVita all fell Monday after saying they were subpoenaed in the U.S. over premium-assistance programs that support dialysis patients on private insurance plans that can be more lucrative for providers.The U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts is investigating connections to the American Kidney Fund, which manages a patient-assistance program for the private plans, German-based Fresenius (FMS) said Monday.Beverly, Mass.-based American Renal (ARA) also said its subpoena is in connection with the American Kidney Fund, while DaVita (DVA), headquartered in Denver, said it's been subpoenaed regarding ""charitable premium assistance.""Fresenius fell as much as 7.3%, the most since June 24, and its U.S.-traded shares ended the day down 6.7% to 39.70. The shares had gained 5% in the 12 months before Monday, including reinvested dividends, compared with a 17% increase in the benchmark DAX Index.American Renal's shares plunged as much as 8.5%, the biggest intraday drop since Nov. 21, and traded down 5.4% at the close to 21.80. DaVita finished the regular session down 3.7% to 63.38.Dialysis patients and providers including Fresenius and DaVita have sued to challenge new regulations that tighten rules governing patient aid for private plans, due to take effect Jan. 13.American Renal stands to lose the most profit due to the new restrictions, and Fresenius will be affected the least, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis. All three companies said they're cooperating with the investigation.Between 700 and 2,000 Fresenius patients with end-stage renal disease in the U.S. currently use the plans. By subsidizing premiums, which patients would otherwise have to pay themselves, the patient aid steers people into more expensive private coverage, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services argued.Private insurance pays dialysis providers like Fresenius $100,000 to $200,000 more per patient each year than would Medicare and Medicaid, which have worked to reduce costs in recent years, according to CMS.Separately, DaVita on Monday said it signed a six-year supply agreement with Amgen (AMGN) for anemia drugs used to treat dialysis patients. The deal replaces a 2011 pact that was due to expire next year.

And Intel announced that it had bought a 15% stake in Here, a developer of digital mapping technology for self-driving cars, deepening its ties to German automakers as well as to auto tech firm Mobileye (MBLY).IBD'S TAKE: Alphabet stock has climbed slightly above a 824.40 buy point from a handle in its recent consolidation. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.""The increased pace of self-driving car announcements suggests that the competition between auto OEMs to launch self-driving cars is heating up,"" Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis said in a research note Monday, upping his price target on Nvidia stock to 125 from 110.Alphabet stock edged up 0.24% in the stock market today to 827.18, in a buy zone after breaking out at 824.40 on Friday.Nvidia stock rose 4.1% Monday to 107.28, after touching a record high of 119.93 on Dec. 28, which at that point represented a nearly 80% run-up just since Nov. 10.Google says its new sensor system  that features LIDAR (light detection and ranging) technology that measures distances and visualizes shapes in 3D.""Today we can imagine our self-driving technology being applied in a variety of ways: personal transportation, ride hailing, logistics, last-mile solutions for public transport, just to name a few,"" Waymo CEO John Krafcik said Sunday at the auto show in Detroit, according to a Bloomberg report.Google says it has lowered the cost of the sensor system to about $7,500 from $75,000.Japanese automaker Honda said it would incorporate Waymo's technology into some of its vehicles.In July, Mobileye announced an agreement with Intel and BMW to develop autonomous-driving technology for commercial launch in 2021.RELATED:Intel Grabs Stake In Here, German-Led Self-Driving-Car ConsortiumNvidia Price-Target Hiked On 2018 Auto Sales Outlook

1365,NOV,"LAS VEGAS — The ginormous consumer electronics show CES 2017 ended its four-day run on Sunday with some companies emerging as clear winners of the tech carnival and others looking like they missed the boat.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) made a big splash with its alliances to bring self-driving cars to market. Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) impressed with its Snapdragon 835 system-on-chip for running next-generation smartphones, augmented-reality headsets and other mobile devices.Amazon.com (AMZN) dominated the show as numerous companies announced the integration of Amazon's Alexa voice-based virtual assistant software into their devices. Alphabet (GOOGL) saw its Google Assistant software integrated into a number of devices as well.But Apple (AAPL) — with its stock now in a buy zone — and Microsoft (MSFT) appeared to be also-rans in adoption of their technologies for voice user interfaces and home control.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia stock shot up nearly 80% from Nov. 10 through Dec. 28, when it touched its record high. Shares rose 4% on the stock market today and still ranks No. 1 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang kicked off CES with a rousing opening-night keynote speech that detailed his company's efforts to lead in the race to build self-driving cars. At the show, Nvidia announced partnerships with auto parts suppliers ZF and Bosch and automakers Audi and Mercedes-Benz.Qualcomm showed off its first 10-nanometer-node processor, the Snapdragon 835, at the show. Also, in a keynote speech, Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf touted his company's role in bringing superfast 5G wireless technology to the masses.Meanwhile, voice command-and-control technology was the talk of CES 2017. And Amazon led the way with Alexa, the technology that powers its Echo smart speakers.Voice-based user interfaces allow for hands-free control of devices. Consumers can use spoken commands to control TVs, streaming music players, thermostats, lighting and other things. With gadgets like Echo, users can ask questions and do web searches by asking questions aloud and getting spoken responses.At CES 2017, consumer electronics products using Alexa included smart speakers from Lenovo and Monster, refrigerators from LG Electronics, washers and dryers from Whirlpool (WHR), lamps from General Electric (GE), and robotic vacuum cleaners from Samsung, to name just a few.Apple and Microsoft were left in the dust in terms of broadening the use of their voice-based virtual assistants, based on third-party products shown at CES. While Amazon, Google and Microsoft had some level of official participation in CES, Apple was a no-show, as usual. It didn't exhibit, have a private meeting room or participate in panel discussions at the show.Several news articles noted that Apple's lack of a presence at CES was particularly damaging for the company if it wants to create an ecosystem around its Siri voice assistant or HomeKit smart home software.Still, Apple stock rose 0.92% to 119 in the stock market today, in a buy zone from a buy point of 118.12 first touched on Friday, and trading at a 13-month high. Microsoft stock fell 0.32%, while Nvidia stock rose 4.1%.RELATED:Nvidia Leads Broad Chip Sector Gains, Gets CES BounceCES 2017: News From The World's Largest Consumer Tech Show

1366,NOV,"Amazon (AMZN) was the fastest-growing recipient of utility patents granted to U.S.-based companies in 2016, followed by Intel (INTC), Ford (F) and Microsoft (MSFT).But as has been the case for 25 years, IBM (IBM) had the most utility patents granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, with a record 8,088, up 10% from 2015, according to according to IFI Claims Patent Services, which compiles an annual patent list.Following IBM with most U.S. patents granted, in order, were Samsung, Canon, Qualcomm (QCOM) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL). Most patents fit into the utility category, which encompasses the mechanical, electrical and chemical fields. Utility patents protect the way inventions are used and work.Amazon has received plenty of headlines for its voice-activated Echo device. At the CES trade show in Las Vegas last week, numerous companies announced that they are using the Echo digital assistant from Amazon, with Alexa voice-response technology. Amazon has taken an early lead with its Echo device, ahead of rivals such as Alphabet's Google Assistant, Microsoft's Cortana and Apple's (AAPL) Siri, in what is shaping up as the next big computing platform.According to IFI, 2016 saw a record 304,126 utility patent grants, up 2% from 2015. U.S. firms accounted for the most, 41%, followed by Japan at 28% and South Korea at 15%.IBD'S TAKE: Many companies not based in the U.S. are traded on U.S. exchanges and have major operations here.

Amazon led with 46% growth, with 1,662 patents granted.Intel was No. 2, and overall it moved up to No. 6 from No. 9, with 2,784 patents granted. Chipmaker Intel is investing heavily in chips for self-driving cars.Ford moved up to No. 19 from No. 24, with 1,524 patents. Microsoft climbed two spots to No. 8.Alphabet grabbed the spotlight at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit on Sunday by announcing that its self-driving-car unit has developed new, low-cost sensor technology.Patents are valuable for several reasons. They can be used to keep potential competitors out of a market or from providing matching product features. They can also be licensed or sold for substantial gains. More than half the profit Qualcomm shows each quarter comes from licensing its broad portfolio of wireless technology patents.Big gainers outside the U.S. were Nokia (NOK), up 74%, South Korea's Hyundai, up 38%, and China's Huawei, up 50%.Amazon stock edged up a small fraction to 796.86 in the stock market today, above its 50-day line for a third day and looking at a buy point of 847.31.

1368,NOV,"Millennials are the most entrepreneurial generation since their great-grandparents, but they have faced huge roadblocks to success due to the oppressive overregulation and taxation created by President Obama.These regulations and taxes have stunted millennials as they entered the workforce, where there has been little opportunity to utilize their expensive college degrees.Only around 14% of millennials say the country is headed in the right direction, according a recent Harvard IOP survey.Under Obama, millennials have seen the cost of education rise uncontrollably (thus causing a student-loan debt crisis); health care premiums and deductibles skyrocket; unemployment remain in double digits; and their bars, clubs, concert halls and colleges become the top targets of terrorists.According to the National Federation of Independent Business' Small Business Optimism Index, ""Small-business optimism remained flat leading up to Election Day and then rocketed higher as business owners expected much better conditions under new leadership in Washington.""The report, which is one of the oldest and most respected, found ""Job creation plans increased from a net 9% through Nov. 8 to a net 23% after the election. Expected higher sales rose 16 points, from a net 4% to a net 20%. Expected better business conditions, the biggest mover in the survey, rose from a net -6% to a net 38%, a massive 44-point spike.""Millennials now make up a majority of the U.S. workforce, around 34%, and their optimism is quite high after reports show many companies are moving back to the U.S. and opening up thousands of positions in middle management where their college degrees will be useful.The continued influx of millennials into the workforce will be a great boost to the economy. Until recently a majority of millennials were either un- or underemployed, causing a student-loan debt crisis, ObamaCare's death spiral and a sluggish U.S. economy.Jobs for millennials mean they can finally afford their hefty student-loan debt payments, health care premiums, and important life goals they have put off, such as marriage, buying a house and saving for retirement.For millennials, the Trump presidency could not have come at a better time.This generation that numbers around 90 million is hitting its stride when it comes to many factors that drive the growth of the U.S. economy. Just as the baby boomer generation created a thriving economy in the 1980s due to the policies of the Reagan administration, so will millennials due to policies that will come out of the Trump administration.Millennials' success is a vital part of the economy and will determine how successful Trump's presidency will ultimately be, especially since the millennial generation is 20% bigger than the boomer generation.Millennials combined with the very pro-business, lower-taxes, less-regulation Trump administration will likely unleash a massive boom in the U.S. economy as millennials hit their prime earning years.Merrill Lynch estimates that as millennials move into their late twenties and early thirties their consumption will increase 62%, leading to a large demand for goods and services, which leads to more jobs. Donald Trump has repeatedly stated that his economic plan will lead to around 3.5% growth and 25 million new jobs, which he is already starting to make good on.As the Trump presidency begins and is successful in creating a positive environment for the economy, job growth, safety from terror, and a successful health care bill, many millennials will begin to realize everything they were told about Donald Trump was a lie from the left.Millennials will see that the hysteria about the rights of women, minorities and the LGBT community were orchestrated to control them, not protect them.Millennials were cheated out of ""Hope and Change"" by President Obama, but in the Donald Trump presidency they will finally see what real leadership and real-life understanding of the economy can do for the prosperity of the American people.La Mastra, a dentist, is an author who frequently writes on the issues facing millennials.

1369,NOV,"The Obama administration has cut mortgage-insurance premiums charged under a government program that's popular with first-time homebuyers with little money for a down payment, a move that may ease the burden of rising interest rates.The annual fees the Federal Housing Administration charges to guarantee the mortgages that it backs are being cut by a quarter of a percentage point, the Department of Housing and Urban Development said in a statement on Monday. With the reduction, the annual cost for most borrowers will be 0.60% of the loan balance.The change — which could be reversed after President-elect Donald Trump takes office — may hurt bond investors, as it speeds up repayment on some securities. Private insurers that compete with the FHA also could suffer. Shares of insurers MGIC Investment (MTG), Radian Group (RDN) and Essent Group (ESNT) all fell after the announcement. Radian was off close to 5%, while MGIC dropped nearly 4% and Essent lost almost 3%.The reduction, which lowers the cost of a home for those who use the FHA, is charged to mortgage borrowers. HUD on Monday said the fee cut would save new FHA-insured homeowners an average of $500 this year. The cut would take effect on Jan. 27.The Obama administration's decision may cause tension with some Republicans who say a fee cut could put taxpayers at risk by reducing the amount of money the agency collects to buffer against mortgage defaults. The FHA is part of HUD, whose secretary sets the fees.The decision will put the spotlight on Ben Carson, nominated as HUD secretary under Trump. Carson declined to comment on whether he would reverse the decision, according to a spokeswoman.HUD Secretary Julian Castro said on a call with reporters that he had no reason to believe the cut would be altered by the Trump administration. Trump's transition team received notification of the premium cut shortly before its public announcement, he said.""It's time the FHA passed along some modest savings to working families,"" Castro said.Mark Calabria, director of financial regulation studies for the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, described the cut in an email as a ""bad idea, and irresponsible for an administration on its way out the door.""The FHA doesn't make mortgages. It sells insurance, paid by borrowers, on loans protecting investors in case of default. The program allows borrowers to get a mortgage with a down payment of as little as 3.5% and a credit score of as low as 580, on a scale of 300 to 850. That makes it one of the most forgiving mortgage programs and popular among first-time homebuyers.Some in the real estate industry have been calling for another fee cut and heralded Monday's move.""Dropping mortgage insurance premiums today will mean a whole lot more responsible borrowers are suddenly eligible to purchase a home through FHA,"" William Brown, president of the National Association of Realtors, said in a statement.The FHA last cut premiums two years ago. That cut, which came as rates dropped and lowered the annual fee for most borrowers to 0.85% from 1.35%, led to a wave of refinances.The cut announced Monday will likely have less of an impact, in part because mortgage rates have risen sharply since Trump's election. The effective FHA mortgage rate at the end of last year was about 4.32%, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, compared to 3.71% for the week ended Nov. 4.Some of the cut's impact could also be washed out if investors in Ginnie Mae-backed mortgage bonds, which include loans insured by the FHA, drive rates up after the cut.The FHA required a $1.7 billion taxpayer infusion after the financial crisis, and just in 2015 met its statutory minimum capital requirements for the first time since then.There is precedent for a change in mortgage fees shortly before a change in leadership.In 2013, Edward DeMarco, then acting director of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's regulator, announced that he would direct the mortgage-finance companies to increase fees. Incoming director Mel Watt soon after said he would put a stop to the fee changes.

1376,NOV,"Despite a dizzying recent climb, the end of Intel (INTC) royalties within a couple months and the fact that it's already one of the most expensive chip stocks, Needham on Friday hiked its price target on Nvidia (NVDA) stock, impressed with the company's announcements at CES.UBS analyst Stephen Chin likewise was bullish, and he also hiked his price target.Needham analysts Rajvindra Gill and Robert Mertens raised their target to 120 from 100. Chin also raised his target to 120, from 95.Nvidia stock touched at an all-time high of 119.93 on Dec. 28, at which point it had soared 79% just since Nov. 10 and showed some classic topping action. Nvidia stock rose 1.3% to 103.10 in the stock market today.In his Wednesday keynote at the big consumer electronics show in Las Vegas, Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang set out the company's route toward leading the race to build self-driving cars, saying the firm's expertise in making graphics processors for gaming PCs gives it the proper background to produce high-performance chips necessary to run autonomous vehicles.He also introduced a number of partnerships and also the Nvidia Drive PX2 AI car computer, a low-power chip set that will act as the brains of self-driving cars. Partners include Ford (F) and Here, the digital mapping German-automaker-led company.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia has sort of set up shop atop the IBD 50 ranking of top-performing stocks, but there are plenty of stocks worth tracking in this key list.But Nvidia has other growth markets, Needham pointed out in its research report, including its longtime key market of gaming but also data centers, virtual reality and augmented reality, also growth markets.In terms of the ADAS, or advanced driver assistance systems, market overall, though, Needham sees revenue skyrocketing to more than $8 billion in five years from $2 billion now. It says Nvidia's total addressable market in ADAS is near $6 billion, and estimates it will capture 20% to 30% of that very competitive market.""We believe NVDA can generate a base case $3.10 of earnings power in FY18 and we have formulated a bull case scenario of $3.70-4.00 (and $5-6 earnings power by 2018/19 through ADAS),"" the Needham analysts wrote.For its fiscal 2017 ending Jan. 31, Nvidia is expected to end with EPS ex items of $2.45, up from non-GAAP EPS of $1.67 in fiscal 2016.Gill and Mertens note, though, that ""our $120 price target implies a 39x P/E off of our FY18 Non-GAAP EPS of $3.10, making NVDA one of the most expensive semiconductor companies across our universe, with a premium of 75% vs. the median semiconductor stock.""In his research note Friday, UBS analyst Chin said that after Nvidia's presentations at CES ""we came away confident that Nvidia will be one of the fastest-growing semis companies this year.""RELATED:Nvidia CEO Details Bold Plans For Self-Driving CarsNvidia Price-Target Hiked On Auto Outlook

1378,NOV,"After awakening from a slumber of more than twelve months, the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) has rallied to the highest levels in nearly nine years.The exchange traded fund became a good vehicle to capture the rally in banks, insurers and other financials that started in October and gained huge momentum after the Nov. 8 U.S. elections.On the day after the votes were cast, the ETF broke out of a base past a 20.11 buy point and soared as much as 19%.  Although investors now are late to that party, there is a new opportunity to buy shares. The chart shows a three-weeks-tight pattern has formed with a buy point at 23.97. Tight consolidations following a price surge are viewed as positive behavior.The election results —  which created an unexpected opportunity to roll back regulations in the industry — caused the best quarterly performance in Financial Select Sector in nearly five years. The ETF climbed 21% in the fourth quarter, the best quarter since Q1 of 2012, when it surged 21.9%.In December, the Federal Reserve increased the fed funds rate for only the second time since the subprime crisis, and suggested three more hikes would occur this year. That's moved interest-rate spreads in the banks' favor.The finance rally of November and December was so broad and powerful, it almost didn't matter what stocks the fund owned. About 45% of holdings are in banks, with the rest in insurance (about 19%), diversified financial services and other areas.Financial Select Sector's portfolio is about 40% concentrated in five major institutions: JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citigroup and Berkshire Hathaway, the investment firm led by Warren Buffett. All those had superb postelection rallies. The surge helped Wells Fargo, embroiled in a scandal over unauthorized customer accounts, come off a nearly three year low to end 2016 with a modest gain.It's mainly a big-cap ETF: On a weighted average, the 65 components have a market capitalization of $155.6 billion. With an average daily dollar volume of more than $2 billion, it's the most widely traded financial sector ETF.The fund is one that works better if investors have good timing skills. Its annualized 10-year performance based on net asset value is -0.43%. That period included a collapse during the 2008 financial crisis.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

For another, he noted, global economies continue to shuffle forward at a ""muted"" pace.Stock market investors, he said, likely will see below-average annual returns over the next decade – to the tune of 2 or 3 percentage points in underperformance.As for the asset management industry itself, investors will continue to favor low-cost investing vehicles and services, pressuring industry players that don't adapt.This last trend is one that Vanguard has played well. The Malvern, Pa.-based company, which pioneered the first index mutual fund in the 1970s and has claimed a big piece of the ETF business, saw an inflow of $253.5 billion in mutual fund and ETF assets in 2016 through Nov. 30, according to Morningstar Inc. That was more than three times larger than the No. 2 fund family's. And it exceeded inflow for the next 20 fund families combined.Vanguard had more than $3.3 trillion in long-term mutual funds and ETFs as of Nov. 30. That was nearly triple the next-largest fund family's asset count. Its U.S. stock funds' average expense ratio is 0.18%, a mere fragment of the industry average of 1.24%.McNabb, 59, spoke with IBD by phone from his office outside Philadelphia about what investors can expect in the year ahead and beyond.IBD: What were Vanguard's biggest accomplishments in 2016?McNabb: I'd say a few things. First, up and down the fund lineup, active and index funds, performance was very strong on a relative basis. And we had good absolute returns because the markets were pretty good. Our clients made money. That's always great for us.Second, we were able to deliver a lot of new capabilities. Some of those were new tools to encourage plan participants to save money. We use behavioral finance tools. If a person is saving in a certain way, and we know what his objectives are, we can give him a nudge to save more or think about it.In our advisor channel, a lot of new things were web oriented, providing a lot more thought-provoking (education) pieces around globalization and the importance of being diversified.Also, we continued to build out our personal advisor service.IBD: That's Vanguard's robo-advisor service?McNabb: We don't refer to it as robo-advice. We use the same technology, but combine it with a personal touch. We offer access to certified financial planners, and technology driving portfolio decisions.The uptake has been pretty fantastic. We had more than $50 billion in client AUM (assets under management) in the program, from a start just 18 months ago.Click Here To See All Articles In The Best Mutual Funds Performance ReportAnd, overall, we wouldn't be Vanguard if we hadn't reduced expense ratios on a lot of funds.IBD: What's planned for 2017?McNabb: In many ways, more of the same in the sense that we keep using technology to enhance our capabilities for education, transactions and so on. We're putting a lot of money into our mobile presence. But we have to do that. Clients expect it.Click Here To See A List Of New Buys Of Top Mutual FundsIn the U.S. we won't have more than one or two new funds if any. But we'll continue to offer new funds to non-U.S. clients. We're building out globally in markets that include the U.K., Australia, Canada and Hong Kong.IBD: What are the biggest obstacles for 2017?McNabb: One thing we're watching is geopolitical uncertainty, which is high from our perspective. A new presidential administration is coming in after a very contentious election, one of the most contentious in the last 50 years.Uncertainty is also created by how Brexit plays out, other serious elections in other developed markets, where China is going economically. And the recent horrific events in Germany underscore the political risks out there.IBD: What about economic risks?McNabb: Global growth continues to be muted. We also believe the next decade's investment returns will be somewhat lower than the historical norms. Equities' annual returns have averaged about 10% over the past 80 years. Our central scenario sees equities coming in at two to three (percentage points) below that long-term average.IBD: Vanguard has certainly been a key beneficiary of the industrywide tsunami of inflow to passive investments. Does that trend threaten the survival of any mutual fund families?McNabb: There's definitely a secular trend there. High-cost investment management is not going to survive. That's a stark statement, but there it is.Investors are waking up to the fact that one thing they can control in their portfolio is cost, and that it has been a reasonably good predictor of performance. Especially in a low-return environment, it makes its own point more starkly.IBD: Is the threat to survival of active management, or just to high-cost shops?McNabb: Nearly one-third of our assets are actively managed. That would be over $1 trillion. So it's not that we don't believe we can add value. Our funds are low cost, and our managers are skilled. I don't think some fund families will disappear, but you will see pressure on them to pivot in what they offer and their pricing.IBD: So no threat to anyone's survival?McNabb: Certainly if you're a high-cost firm and not willing to think about your cost structure, there is a good chance they will disappear.IBD: As an asset manager, what other trends are you seeing?McNabb: There continues to be a search for enhanced return. People are looking at a lot of other asset classes. But there is no free lunch.IBD: So a lot of the talk about alternative investments is hot air?McNabb: In the next decade, if equity returns are less than they have been, it will not be easy to find other types of assets that have extraordinary returns that will make up for that.One of the problems is that not many other things are as good as at diversifying a portfolio as bonds are. If a big, sophisticated institution like XYZ is putting 50% of its money into nontraditional asset classes, should I do the same thing? For 99.9% of individual investors, trying to go into those assets is usually not good.IBD: Why not? What's dangerous about alts?McNabb: It's not that they're dangerous. It's the expectations. Take private equity. Most individual investors don't have access to that. Who says it will return twice what public equities do? Historically, that's not the case. If public market returns are lower than they've been historically, there's no reason to think private equity won't be lower too.Second, there is a lot of money chasing some of these (alternative assets). That's driving prices up, which makes returns lower. Big institutions like Calpers are going through a serious review of their returns assumptions. They're asking if they should lower their assumptions for these asset classes. That reflects what I'm saying.IBD: As a result of the elections, do you see regulatory constraints in your industry easing?McNabb: One of the big questions is the future of the fiduciary world. There's been a lot of debate about the Department of Labor's new fiduciary rule. I don't have a sense of where that rule ranks in the new administration's view of regulatory issues to tackle. I would presume it is not that high, given some rhetoric about other things that should be priorities. But the industry is certainly watching.A second area is the Dodd-Frank law (the 2010 law that increased federal regulation of the financial services industry, especially large banks). The industry would like to see changes to the Volker rule, which might improve bond liquidity.What you've seen since (the enactment of) the Volker rule is a dramatic reduction in dealer inventory. Many large banks were dealers in fixed income. Volker reduced the scope of those activities. The bond market still operates reasonably well, but people would like to see things go back to where there is greater dealer inventory.IBD: What should long-term investors do differently in 2017 than they did in 2016?McNabb: You're about to hear me say that boring is good. I wouldn't change what people are doing. Investors should have a set of goals about what they're trying to achieve. They should have a portfolio that is highly diversified and reflects those goals. Investors should keep their costs low. And investors should not let themselves be affected by short-term noise.IBD: So you're not advising anyone to shift from this sector or that geography to some other areas of the market?McNabb: Equities have had a nice run. Investors should check their asset allocations and, especially because of that nice run, they should rebalance once or twice a year. Make sure your asset allocation still reflects your risk tolerance and your goals. A lot of people do that at the beginning of the year, and why not?Second, anyone with a retirement plan should look at his or her savings rate. If we're right about returns going down, the one way you can control how you counter that is to up your savings rate for the next 10 years.Third, ignore short-term noise. With the political uncertainty, Brexit, contentious elections, things going on in some Western democracies, the temptation to act on that is great. But our experience is: Don't. Short-term timing and trading (with mutual funds) around issues does not work. It's important to tune out the noise and stick with your long-term investment plan.IBD'S TAKE: McNabb is Vanguard's third chief executive since its founding in 1975 by John Bogle. McNabb, who joined Vanguard in 1986, succeeded Jack Brennan as CEO in 2008. He became chairman in 2010. Before being named CEO, he led each Vanguard division that directly served clients.RELATED:Click Here To See A List Of Latest Sells Of Top Mutual FundsSee Interviews With Other Influential Executives In 2016Mutual Funds: Why Shareholders Still Love ThemJohn Bogle: Vanguard Founder Discusses How To Invest

1380,NOV,"LAS VEGAS — Cruise line operator Carnival (CCL) soon will demonstrate what's possible with wireless mobile identification technologies using the closed environments of its ocean cruise ships.On Thursday, during the first official day of the annual CES consumer technology trade show, Carnival CEO Arnold Donald announced that his vacation company will deploy wireless technology and associated interactive display screens on its more than 100 ships to personalize the cruise experience for passengers. Company shares moved back into the buy zone on Thursday as well.Each passenger will receive a small medallion that they can wear on a wristband or necklace. The medallion uses Bluetooth and near-field communications (NFC) wireless technology to open stateroom doors, make payments and be quickly identified by restaurant staff and other crew members.Carnival CEO Donald was seen as an odd choice for the CES opening-day keynote slot, but the applications it plans to roll out for its customers mirror what many other consumer-facing companies are working to provide.IBD'S TAKE: What stocks are rising or falling fast at any given time? IBD's Stocks on the Move provides timely information on heavy institutional buying or selling.Carnival said it will go live with its medallion service, called Ocean (One Cruise Experience Access Network), on its Regal Princess ship on Nov. 13. It will be followed by Royal Princess and Caribbean Princess in early 2018. Carnival plans to roll out the service across its entire Princess Cruises fleet over several years.""We are innovating for a better customer experience,"" Donald said. He said the Ocean Medallion service ""will redefine travel as we know it.""Cruise ship passengers will only need their medallion wristband or necklace on board. It acts as their ID, credit card and access pass. They can use it to interact with ship displays for personalized information and recommendations.The quarter-sized, 1.8-ounce disc has no on-off button and needs no charging. On board Carnival cruise ships, the medallions interact with a network of sensors and computing devices.The medallions are sent to cruise passengers ahead of their trips so they can customize their preferences on them.Carnival stock rose 1.7% to 53.71 on the stock market today, hitting a nearly one-year high. Shares were back in a buy zone from a 53.40 buy point first touched on Nov. 29, out of a cup base.

1381,NOV,"U.S.-traded Chinese internet giants rose Thursday as China has taken measures to prop up its Yuan currency and its services sector showed gains, while the rise in the U.S. dollar, which hit 14-year highs late in 2016, has slowed this week.Gaming portal NetEase (NTES) led the way among Chinese internet leaders, rising 4.8% in the stock market today to 229.21 and hitting its 50-day moving average support line for the first time since Nov. 10.E-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA), meanwhile, jumped 4.3% Thursday to 94.37, retaking its 50-day line for the first time in two months.IBD'S TAKE: Many top-rated stocks traded on U.S. stock markets aren't U.S.-based companies. That's why IBD's Global Leaders is another important source for stock investors looking for winners.Alibaba's top e-commerce rival, JD.com (JD), rose 1.7% to 26.30, closer to its buy point of 29.33.China search leader Baidu (BIDU) rose 3.2% to a two-month high of 177.47, hurdling its 200-day moving average for the first time in two months.The other China leader, Tencent (TCEHY), rose 2.2% in the U.S., where it's traded over the counter. It, too, surpassed its 50-day line, in its case for the first time since late October.As reported by CNBC, China's offshore Yuan was surging vs. the U.S. dollar as China has taken some measures to halt its slide.CNBC and Reuters reported Thursday that China's services sector growth notched a 17-month high last month.RELATED:China Marches Ahead With Stock Market ReformChina Search Engine War Escalates, Tencent-Backed Firm Plans IPOBaidu's iQiyi.com, An Alibaba Rival, Mulls IPO

1382,NOV,"Examples abound about how internet, media and telecom companies are accelerating their push into mobile video:Why the rush?As more consumers watch video on mobile phones, the U.S. advertising market hit a milestone in 2016: Digital ad spending surpassed TV ad spending for the first time, projected market tracker eMarketer.Desktop PC display and search ads are still the biggest categories of digital spending. But mobile ad spending has emerged as the main driver of digital revenue, jumping 45% to $46 billion in 2016, forecasts eMarketer.By 2019, mobile ad spending is expected to represent one-third of total media ad spending in the U.S., mainly driven by video ads.Oft-called the third screen after broadcast TV and PCs, mobile ranking must be adjusted, says Roger Entner, founder of Recon Analytics.""Mobile is eating the internet,"" said Entner, coining a phrase similar to venture capitalist Marc Andreessen's ""Why Software Is Eating the World"" essay five years ago.""Seventy percent of mobile traffic is video,"" Entner added. ""The mobile device is turning into the first screen to entertain and inform yourself. It was the third screen, now it's becoming the first screen, overtaking television and the desktop.""John Legere, CEO of T-Mobile US (TMUS), has a mantra of his own: ""All content is going to the internet, and the internet is going mobile.""T-Mobile in 2016 shook up the wireless market with free video streaming for many popular apps.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix's success adding subscribers outside the U.S. is just one reason it makes the IBD Leaderboard, a listing of top stocks poised to possibly bring the biggest gains. See what other companies make the current list.So how does a stock investor play the mobile video trend? Let's imagine a word association game. What companies come to mind first for ""mobile video""?Probably not Apple (AAPL) — yet. Probably not Netflix (NFLX), for that matter.Apple's huge base of iPhone users represent a lot of mobile screens, but Apple apparently has shelved plans for its own web TV service, unable to forge a deal with broadcasters. Apple, though, reportedly has lowered the amount it charges to sell video services through its widely used App Store, which should increase the movies and TV shows offered to iPhone users from other parties. Apple reportedly cut its fee to 15% from 30% of monthly subscription billings.Netflix, the top provider of subscription video-on-demand services, doesn't sell advertising. Netflix has invested in long-form, original content rather than shorter video clips. Netflix in early 2016 accounted for only 3.7% of mobile data traffic but 35% of fixed-line broadband traffic, said a report from networking gear maker Sandvine. Its study doesn't measure Wi-Fi network usage, where Netflix traffic might be high.AT&T and Verizon Communications (VZ) make a match for mobile video investing plays. Verizon acquired AOL for $4.4 billion in 2016 and has agreed to buy Yahoo (YHOO). Verizon aims to build a digital ad platform rivaling those of Google and Facebook.And in late 2015, Verizon launched its G090 mobile video service, which targets millennials. The free, ad-supported Go90 service offers a mix of original web TV series, live sports, concert streaming and more. While Go90 has been off to a rocky start (Verizon has not disclosed any operating metrics), the telecom firm has brought in new executives to reboot content and build a bigger audience for ads.AT&T , meanwhile, in late November launched its DirecTV Now video streaming service, which starts at $35 per month. The linchpin to AT&T's mobile video strategy is allowing its wireless subscribers to stream DirecTV Now without eating into their monthly data caps.Entner says AT&T will pressure other new entrants in live TV streaming — such as Hulu, Amazon and Google's YouTube — to develop ""mobile-first"" strategies. Hulu is a joint venture of 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Walt Disney (DIS), and Comcast.AT&T in late October agreed to buy Time Warner for $85.4 billion. Its assets include HBO, sports-oriented Turner Broadcasting, and a stake in Hulu.The Time Warner deal is designed to ""get the most content to the most people at the lowest prices, delivered on any screen, particularly mobile,"" AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson told analysts.If AT&T's DirecTV Now succeeds, it could pressure Comcast and Charter Communications (CHTR) to acquire a wireless firm, perhaps T-Mobile, some analysts speculate.The conundrum for AT&T and traditional media companies pushing into mobile video is that the younger age groups advertisers covet tend to watch shorter pieces, not long-form content. User-generated and social-media-shared content is still the biggest part of mobile video consumption. And live streaming via Facebook, YouTube and Twitter's (TWTR) Periscope compete for millennial attention against streaming pay-TV services such as CBS (CBS) All Access, which recently disclosed it has 1.2 million subscribers.On Facebook's Q3 earnings call Nov. 2, CEO Mark Zuckerberg trumpeted plans to become a ""video-first"" company. Zuckerberg says that within five years most of what people consume online will be video. Analysts speculate Facebook could develop a stand-alone app that competes directly with YouTube.Then, there's the Facebook-Instagram rival Snapchat, which has some 400 million users. Snapchat claims that it has some 10 billion daily video views. It limits videos to 10 seconds in length. Snapchat also offers its ""Discover"" portal of short-clip web videos. Owner Snap has filed for a confidential IPO and is expected to debut on the stock market early in 2017.While Google and Facebook dominate digital advertising, one question is whether another top digital publisher will emerge, such as Snapchat or Verizon, William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri wrote in a recent research report.As for the question near the top of this story: Asked what comes to his mind first when he hears the term ""mobile video,"" Entner quickly replied ""YouTube.""""Mobile video is still dominated by YouTube,"" he said. ""There is tremendous innovation. People you've never heard of start their own video channel and suddenly have more followers than people who watch episodes of 'The Big Bang Theory.'""RELATED:Alphabet, Facebook Dominate Mobile App Downloads

1386,NOV,"Call it the Trump premium.Borrowing costs jumped in the wake of Donald Trump's unexpected U.S. presidential election victory in November, inducing Latin American governments and companies to postpone at least $10 billion in international-bond deals. Now that volatility has started to cool, as most of these issuers eye a return to market in the first quarter of 2017, the worry is that so many deals competing against one another will further drive up yields.""Now that Treasuries seem to have stabilized in new levels, I believe we are going to have a very active January,"" said Baruc Saez, co-head for international fixed income at Banco Itau, the corporate and investment-banking unit for Itau Unibanco Holding. ""In this new environment, investors' and issuers' mindset and financing strategies are adjusting to reflect asset re-pricing.""U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, the benchmark for everything from U.S. mortgages to dollar bonds in developing nations, surged from around 1.80% to 2.60% after the U.S. election on expectations increased government spending would spur economic growth. With the U.S. central bank signaling accelerated policy tightening next year to counter inflationary pressures, yields have dipped but are still trading near two-year highs.Latin American credit spreads also rose after Trump's election. Brazil's five-year credit-default-swap spreads rose 22% to 321.76 basis points on Nov. 14, Argentina's CDS spread added 23% to 464.11 basis points on Dec. 1, while Mexico's jumped 33% to 193.01 basis points in Nov. 18.Latin American governments and corporations issued a total of $133.6 billion in international bonds in 2016, a 65.2% increase over 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In 2017, the region will face $75 billion in bonds maturities, the data show. Baruc estimates about $80 billion in issuance this year from the region.One of the first companies to put bond sales on hold was Barranquilla, Colombia-based Tecnoglass, which provided windows for the Trump Towers resort in Florida and Panama City's Trump Tower. Its  expected sale of as much as $225 million in November was suspended. Aeropuertos Argentina 2000, Argentina's largest airport operator, also postponed a bond sale, as did the Argentine provinces of Entre Rios, Tierra del Fuego and La Rioja.The government of Argentina had also considered rolling over in 2016 a $7 billion bond maturing in April, but delayed the transaction to probably the beginning of this year, said four people familiar with the matter.

1389,NOV,"Stocks closed with solid gains in the first day of trading in 2017, below early highs but rebounding from a midday sell-off.Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) failed to join the rally as shares got dumped hard again, falling to as low as 99.38, good for a two-week low and more than 17% below its all-time peak of 119.93 during a sell-off spanning just four sessions.The stock bounced a bit off Tuesday's session lows and to end at 102.01, down 4.4%. Nvidia broke out at 33.16 in mid-March from a solid cup with handle base and advanced as much as 262%. Apple (AAPL) also lost ground intraday, but closed fractionally higher at 116.06. A handle is now forming with a 118.12 buy point.For now, the iPhone giant has rallied superbly since bouncing off a test of the 200-day moving average on Nov. 14, forming a base-on-base pattern in the process. Apple had cleared a 110.33 cup with handle within a deep, long bottoming base on Sept. 14, then rallied 7.5% before stumbling.The Nasdaq composite, which rose 7.5% in 2016, rallied nearly 0.9% Tuesday. The S&P 500, boosted by gold mining, wireless telecom, solar, foreign telecom service, toy, metal ores and oil drilling shares, held a 0.8% advance.The Dow Jones industrials and the Russell 2000 both lagged with gains of 0.6% and 0.5%. The former rallied 13.4% in 2016, the latter jumped 19.5%.Returning to Nvidia, it's typical to see a high-quality stock form the left side of a new base over a period of at least three to six weeks, or even much longer. But when a stock has made a supersized gain in the manner that Nvidia did in 2016, the initial correction can certainly last much longer.If the specialist in video graphics processors were to hold the 100 level, then the possibility of a shallow cup or double-bottom base would be high. However, it's too early to predict what the stock will do, and thus no individual investor should be tempted to catch the proverbial falling knife.Remember, a good cup base can feature a decline of as much as 33%. In some rare cases, as noted in an earlier Stock Market Today column, following an extraordinary price run, the next base can involve a correction in the area of 40% to even 50% below the all-time high. When such a drop occurs, a stock generally needs months, if not years, to bottom out, build the right side of the base, and then set up a potential new breakout.Don't expect Nvidia's RS Rating to change soon, given that it's based on 12-month relative price performance within IBD's entire database of thousands of U.S. stocks.Wall Street has recently bumped up Nvidia's profit projections. According to Thomson Reuters, the Santa Clara, Calif., firm now is expected to grow fiscal 2017 earnings by 45% to $2.42 a share and fiscal 2018 earnings by 12% to $2.70. The fiscal year ends in January.Due to its success in entering new markets such as artificial intelligence, data center, virtual reality and autonomous vehicles, Nvidia has seen excellent acceleration in top-line growth.

1390,NOV,"Ever since the U.S. presidential election, Ed Dahlberg has pretty much had a smile on his face.Dahlberg brokers the sale of private jets, and already he's seeing interest pick up and used-aircraft prices starting to firm up. The sale of a single-engine turboprop aircraft that he recently handled went for about 5% more than anticipated.""My phone is ringing off the hook"" from people interested in buying used jets, said Dahlberg, president of Emerald Aviation Inc. in Manassas, Va. ""Just the business climate feels like it's getting better.""The era of Donald Trump, a man long associated with conspicuous consumption, figures to be good to a whole range of luxury-goods industries. But perhaps nowhere is that excitement greater than in the private-aircraft business.Not only is Trump, whose personal Boeing 757 became an iconic campaign image, seen as someone who'll be an advocate for the industry but he replaces a president who so often criticized private-air travel that he turned it into a taboo symbol of inequality and helped prolong a sales slump of almost a decade.""You'll see more people not being gun shy or embarrassed or apologetic for operating a corporate jet,"" said Steve Varsano, founder of broker The Jet Business.Demand for private jets is far from the heady days of more than 1,000 deliveries in 2007 and 2008, before the recession hit. In 2016, manufacturers were set to ship 655 jets, according to a JPMorgan Chase estimate, lower than 689 in both 2014 and 2015 after an oil boom that had boosted sales among drillers went bust. Used jet prices have tumbled 12% since November 2015, the bank said.It's far too early to see any sales pickup, of course, and the industry buzz of a comeback is just that at the moment. But investors are encouraged. Shares of private jet manufacturers have soared on Trump's victory. Since Nov. 9, Textron (TXT) gained 19%, General Dynamics (GD) rose 12% and Bombardier Inc. jumped 22%. Aircraft sales amount to about 30% of their revenue.""The Trump win looks positive for (business) jet demand given the postelection stock surge, economic stimulus from an expected lower tax rate and less regulation, and shift away from Obama's anti-(business) jet rhetoric,"" Cai Von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., wrote in a report earlier this month.Alain Bellemare, chief executive officer of Canadian plane maker Bombardier, said in an interview that in Trump he sees ""somebody understanding the value of business aircraft and what it creates.""""Anybody who is pro-business, pro-growth, who will foster investment in infrastructure — it's all good for our business,"" he said. ""So I hear the tone now and I'm optimistic.""Most of the manufacturing jobs to produce corporate jets are in North America, Bellemare said. That fits in with Trump's theme of keeping factory workers in the U.S. Both Bombardier and Textron's Cessna unit make aircraft in Wichita, Kan. Gulfstream, the corporate jet unit of General Dynamics, has its factories in Savannah, Ga. Even Brazilian jet producer Embraer (ERJ) manufactures planes in Melbourne, Fla.Trade groups have long argued that private aircraft are business tools that help executives save time and make multicity visits they otherwise couldn't with commercial flights. For security, some companies mandate their top officers fly on the corporate plane.That message was lost when auto executives flew to Washington in their private planes to request bailout money in November 2008, sparking a backlash as the economy careened into recession. A call from a Treasury Department official in 2009 persuaded Citigroup (C), which was getting U.S. government rescue funds, to drop plans to take delivery of a $50 million Falcon 7X aircraft manufactured by Dassault Aviation (DASTY).In a 2011 press conference, Obama called out private jet owners six times to bash a tax break that allows corporate planes to be depreciated over five years instead of seven years for commercial airliners. The National Business Aviation Association sent the president a letter expressing ""disappointment with the way you mischaracterized and disparaged business aviation.""But that was then, as broker Dahlberg sees it.""I've noticed that while there's still a huge amount of inventory, people just don't keep dropping the price every week,"" he said. ""You can really feel the floor in the market right now.""

1391,NOV,"Exchange traded funds that track the largely forgotten coal industry and the metals sector were the big winners of 2016 in IBD's ETF Sector Rotation index. Banking and semiconductor ETFs also finished with sizable gains.VanEck Vectors Coal (KOL) has been declining from a Nov. 9 peak. Despite that, the fund had a performance most ETF managers would envy. VanEck Coal about doubled in 2016, registering its best year since 2009, when it surged 143%.In large part the ETF tracked its biggest holding, Teck Resources (TECK). The Canadian mining company's U.S.-traded shares are more than 20% off their November peak, but are ending up more than 400% for 2016.On Nov. 22, Teck Resources raised its forecast for steelmaking coal for Q4. Coal remains a major source of fuel for energy producers in many countries. In China, the world's largest producer and consumer of coal-fired electrical power, coal-power generation capacity will grow as much as 19% over the next five years, reports say.SPDR S&P Metals & Mining (XME) more than doubled in 2016, thanks to a concentration in steel stocks. Nearly half the fund is concentrated in steel companies, including five of the portfolio's largest holdings. IBD's steel producers industry group more than doubled in 2016, making up for a weak year in mining.President-elect Donald Trump plans to boost spending on infrastructure projects, which favors steel companies. Trump also campaigned in support of protective trade tariffs, and steel mills could benefit from that.Banking stocks owed most of their fine 2016 performance to the final two months of the year. In that period, especially after the Nov. 8 election, banking stocks soared. Trump's surprise victory sparked hopes that banking regulations will be curbed. Favorable trends in interest rates also fanned banking shares, especially those of smaller banks.SPDR S&P Regional Bank (KRE), SPDR S&P Bank (KBE) and iShares U.S. Regional Banks (IAT) are closing the year with gains of about 30% each. But in all three cases, the bulk of the gains came after the election. The three ETFs are holding most of their postelection gains. That bodes well, although there's no clear secondary entry on the charts so far.Chip stocks had a better 2016 than many other technology groups, and three ETFs in the IBD Sector Rotation screen climbed about 30% to 40%.SPDR S&P Semiconductor (XSD) made a record high this week, and is ending 2016 about 30% higher. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) rose about 35% for the year. IShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX), which tracks the 30 stocks in the Philadelphia semiconductor index, caps 2016 nearly 40% higher.All three ETFs enriched themselves with Nvidia (NVDA), one of the year's hottest stocks. But Nvidia is now showing signs of a climax top. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) was another benefactor of iShares PHLX and SPDR S&P Semiconductor.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

1392,NOV,"Year in Review: We keep reading in the mainstream press how terrible 2016 was. We beg to differ. This year was a good one for many reasons. And next year will almost certainly be better.Given the headlines, you'd think the country had suffered another Great Depression, or worse. A small sampling:""Is 2016 the Worst Year in History?""""Everything That Was Terrible About 2016""""A Brief Timeline of Very Bad Years, From 2016 to 65,000,000 B.C.""""The Best of 2016: Looking for Silver Linings in a Terrible Year""""The Worst Year Ever, Until Next Year""These dour assessments are based almost entirely on the fact that the media's chosen candidate lost to a blunt-spoken reality show billionaire who promised to undo most of President Obama's legacy.In fact, up until Nov. 8, these same news outlets were chastising anyone who dared to say that all was not well in the country.The Washington Post, which is now asking whether 2016 was ""the worst year ever,"" was berating Trump before the election for his ""doom and gloom"" depiction of the economy, telling readers his message ""risks clashing with their personal experience, because life has improved for many Americans in recent years.""The Post, like every other liberal mainstream news outlet, was wrong about the public's sentiment, and wrong about the state of the economy —  a fact we'd pointed out in this space on countless occasions over the years.But then Donald Trump won the election, and the mainstream press suddenly decided that 2016 was the Dark Ages — even as several indicators sharply improved.The Dow, which had been flat for two years, took off after the election, gaining nearly 11% between early November and the end of the year.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index surged after the election to hit a 10-year high.The Consumer Confidence Index has shot up 15% since the election, driven largely by improvements in its Expectations Index, which hit a 13-year high.The National Federation of Independent Business says its Small Business Optimism Index jumped in December.Economists started raising their forecasts for growth next year.What all these have in common is hope — hope that Trump's pro-growth policies will boost GDP, create new opportunities, and improve the lives of long-struggling working class families.In other words, the election of Trump, which has put the pundit class in a downward-spiraling funk, has made the rest of the country more upbeat than it's been in years.There was much more to celebrate this year.The only dark cloud in all this has been President Obama's petulant response to the election outcome, and his decision to take his vengeance out on the American people with a flurry of last-minute regulations and foreign policy misadventures that serve no purpose other than to hobble his successor.But Obama will soon be out of the White House, and the new year promises to be even better than 2016.RELATED:IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index

1393,NOV,"It was a quiet week for investors, with corporate news scarce and trading volumes light. Stocks continued to hover at all-time highs, though hot chip stock Nvidia (NVDA) suffered a nasty reversal. Holiday sales may have been better than expected, but did most of the gains flow to Amazon (AMZN)?The Dow Jones industrials made another run at 20,000, but fell 0.8% for the week, its first weekly loss in eight. The Nasdaq set a fresh record high on Tuesday, but reversed to end the week down 1.5%. The S&P 500 retreated 1.1%. The Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 are all near best-ever levels. all of 2016, the Nasdaq gained 7.5%, the S&P 500 9.5% and the Dow 13.4%. Graphics chipmaker Nvidia finally took a breather, while bank stocks pulled back along with Treasury yields. Amazon found resistance at its 50-day line, while Tesla Motors (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) tested key support areas as well.Shares of the top-rated chipmaker fell 6.9% on Wednesday, with the biggest point decline and volume of Nvidia's run, a clear sell signal after a 10-day, 29% surge within a powerful advance. Short-seller Citron Research said Nvidia's stock could fall to 90. Citron said competition from AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) would likely pinch gross margins. Shares rallied somewhat Thursday as Goldman Sachs sees a big upside for Nvidia, whose chips are integral to PC gaming, AI and automotive markets. Goldman and noted that Nvidia CEO's will give the keynote address at next week's CES 2017 electronics show. But the stock fell again on Friday, though its weekly loss was only about 3%.AMD also pulled back on Nvidia's woes, closing the week down 3%.Mobileye (MBLY), which will be at CES showcasing its driver-assistance systems, will team with digital mapping company Here, owned by a group of German automakers, to develop a precise global map. Mobileye already has a deal to develop a self-driving car with BMW (BMWYY) and Intel. Mobileye rose nearly 10% for the week, rising above its 50-day line for the first time since Sept. 9.Tesla Motors announced Tuesday that it will produce solar cells at a New York plant with Panasonic, a key partner in battery production. Tesla shares jumped above its 200-day line on Tuesday amid that news, but erased those gains to close just below that key level Friday.RELATED:Nvidia Stock Volatile After Big Drop, Upbeat ReportNvidia Flashes Key Sell Signal Amid Citron Tweet, Possible Climax RunAI, Virtual Assistants, Augmented Reality Vie For Next Big Thing At CESMobileye Clinches Deal With German Automakers For Digital MappingRetail sales excluding autos and gasoline rose 4% from Nov. 1-Dec. 24, according to MasterCard's SpendingPulse, one of the reports indicating better-than-expected holiday spending. But several surveys suggested that traffic at malls and brick-and-mortar stores fell sharply, though they may gotten a late boost from Christmas Eve and Dec. 26 coming on a three-day weekend. Online sales rose sharply yet again, with Amazon likely grabbing a huge share of the e-commerce growth. Amazon itself said that its top-selling products were its own, including the Amazon Echo Dot. Amazon shares topped its 50-day line on Wednesday, but failed to close above that level.Apple (AAPL) had a decent, but not a blowout holiday season, as iPhone lovers await the next-generation smartphone, unofficially the Apple iPhone 8, in late 2017. But new Apple activations far outstripped Samsung wireless devices as well as Alphabet's new Google Pixel handsets.Apple shares fell modestly for the week on a Friday report that iPhone production is being cut. Still, the stock is close to a potential buy point, consolidating in a base.RELATED:The Top Selling Products On Amazon Over Holidays Came From ...

1394,NOV,"As an income investor, can you find promising stocks for the new year by surveying what worked well in 2016? Yes, and there are several reasons why.Many of last year's strong winners have emerged from early-stage bases, so they may have further potential to rise. Also, these stocks continue to exhibit the type of steady earnings that enable future cash payouts to continue for years to come.The prospect of future hikes in the quarterly dividends among these leaders also looks promising.The biggest winners that appeared in IBD's The Income Investor column included an oil and gas pipeline play that rose 133% for the year (Oneok (OKE)), a truck maker that rolled ahead 55% (Cummins (CMI)), a paper products titan that gained 41% (International Paper (IP)), and a railroad that chugged 40% higher (CSX (CSX)).Two of these companies hailed from the transport sector, and for good reason. The Dow Jones transportation average rose nearly 21% for the year, a real sign of overall confidence in the current economy.But other top-performing income stocks hailed from a fairly wide range of industries as the stock market showed broad gains amid a choppy year.Many of the 34 companies featured in this column that rose 20% or more in 2016 saw big climbs in the third and fourth quarters, sparked in part by Donald Trump's upset win over Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The businessman's pledge to boost manufacturing, coal and infrastructure rebuilding inside America's borders helped unleash a strong rally in market sectors that had lagged earlier in the year.Banking stocks affirmed this fury of sudden buying, and perhaps some short-covering too, as a stream of positive economic data on jobs, industrial output, spending and personal income helped convince the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December for only the second time in 12 months.The fed funds rate rose to a target range of 0.5%-0.75%, and the prospects of three additional hikes in 2017 are currently bright.Higher interest rates — so long as they do not damage the current level of U.S. spending, building, construction and lending — bode well for the banks that rely heavily on the spread between the rates they pay for deposits and the rates they charge for loans.No wonder, then, that Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) (annualized yield of about 2%), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) (3.6% yield) and Toronto Dominion (TD) (3.3%) made the top of the winners list with year-to-date gains of 26% to 35% each.Other financial services firms also prospered. Consider Principal Financial Group (PFG), featured on Sept. 16. The insurance and retirement services firm began the year with a thud along with the market, falling more than 26% in less than five weeks to a year-to-date low of 33.09, but then mustered a steady rebound.By the end of the third quarter, the stock moved into positive ground on the back of a solid 6% gain in second-quarter earnings to $1.15 a share. That snapped a five-quarter streak of profit declines. In Q3, Principal affirmed that the profit turnaround wasn't a fluke as earnings jumped 8% despite a 13% drop in the top line.Some heavy machinery, diversified operations and other types of industrial firms also excelled. They included Johnson Controls (JCI), Ingersoll-Rand (IR) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW).Johnson's 2.4% yield is just mildly better than the S&P 500's 2.0% payout. However, shareholders apparently liked how the expert in electronic security systems, valves, pipes and fire-protection products improved its profitability. Pretax margin improved to 11.1% in fiscal 2016 (ended in September), rebounding sharply from 7.7% in fiscal 2015.Johnson's 3-year Earnings Stability Factor of 4 is excellent on a scale of zero (highly stable profits) to 99 (wild). IBD research has found that profit stability is a hallmark of a company's ability to pay or even increase its cash payouts to shareholders.Ingersoll-Rand and Illinois Tool also boast low three-year Earnings Stability Factor ratings of 2 and 4, respectively.Notice how on a weekly chart, all three of these industrial giants broke long-term downtrends in February, then went on to build and break out of what IBD calls bottoming base chart patterns.A rally out of these refreshed first-stage bases is bullish for income investors who hope to buy a stock that may be emerging out of a slump, pays a decent dividend and has the potential to deliver toasty capital gains.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewInvesting In 2017: The Case For A Trump Era Secular Bull RunInvesting In 2017: The Presidencies Since The 1980s And Which Industry Groups Shined BrightestInvesting In 2017: The Bottoming Base, A Valuable Chart Pattern For Income Investors TooInvesting In 2017: The Bottoming Base, Part II; Why Apple Formed One In 2009Investing With Success: Learn From Gerald Loeb, A Wall Street GreatThe Income Investor: Why South Korea Fined Dividend Leader Qualcomm

1395,NOV,"Talk about hot! Imagine if quarterback Tom Brady were as good at playing defense as he is at leading the New England Patriots offense. That would be impressive, right? Well, that two-way talent is what fund manager Craig Hodges displayed in 2016.Hodges is a quarterback of the $15.9 million Hodges Pure Contrarian Fund (HDPCX), whose 71% gain through Dec. 29 outperformed all other U.S. diversified stock funds regardless of size. Contrarian is a small-cap value strategy. At the same time, he's also lead signal-caller for the $411.5 million Hodges Fund (HDPMX), whose 40.47% gain made it 2016's third-best performing growth fund.Value. And growth. Two very different strategies. And outperformers both.Hodges Fund, the larger of the two portfolios, has been driven by leaders like Southwest Airlines (LUV), which climbed 16% in 2016 and has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 92; construction and industrial leasor United Rentals (URI), which jumped 46% for the year and also sports a 92 Comp Rating; and construction materials maker Eagle Materials (EXP), up 63% in 2016 and boasting a 90 Comp Rating.IBD's TAKE: Hodges Fund co-manager Eric Marshall recently told IBD why he and Craig Hodges like stocks such as Horizon Pharma, Facebook and Texas Pacific Land Trust.Hodges is also CEO and chief investment officer of Hodges Capital Management and the son of Donald Hodges, founder of Hodges Capital's parent company. Craig Hodges, 53 years old, talked with IBD about his investment approach from his office in Dallas.IBD: What should investors do with their portfolios in 2017?Hodges: We're optimistic about some niches in retail, some selected companies. J.C. Penney (JCP) is one. Some low-hanging fruit. The old (company management) regime almost wrecked the company. The new regime is turning the company around, making it profitable.We don't like retail as a whole, but we like some selected names like Duluth Holdings (DLTH) and G-III Apparel (GIII), which have significant upside.And there are some names in consumer discretionary. Adidas (ADDYY) has taken market share from Under Armour (UAA) and Nike (NKE). There are some names we feel good about.IBD: Which existing holdings got a boost from the Trump election?Hodges: We owned a good position in U.S. Concrete (USCR) as well as Eagle Materials and U.S. Steel (X). Those could benefit if the new administration acts on its interest in investing in infrastructure.We already had quite a bit of exposure to energy, and we added to some like Diamondback Energy (FANG), RSP Permian (RSPP) and Matador Resources (MTDR). Those are our three favorite Permian Basin plays. Hillary Clinton was viewed as anti-fracking, so a lot of those stocks went up. Long term, we think those companies are as well situated as any we know in energy.Volaris Avia (VLRS), a Mexican airline, dropped from about 20 to about 14 or 15. It was on concerns that trade with Mexico would be affected. But we think that fear is political rhetoric. In fact, we think trade with Mexico will be a big part of what (the U.S. does).IBD: Have you bought any stocks that looked poised to benefit from the Trump election?Hodges: Yes, one is Forterra (FRTA). They're in the water infrastructure industry. They provide cast cement piping, precast products for a wide range of water-related infrastructure, even drainage. If you build a road or bridge, drainage is essential. And they have a good management team. They had an IPO right before the election. That was not a good time for an IPO, so we got it at a favorable time.About Nov. 11 (as its share price climbed) we started buying a larger stake. We bought quite a bit in the 17-18 range. It ran up above 20, pulled back, then we added to it. Now it's trading near a 52-week high (around 22).We bought some (Mexico-based) Cemex (CX) ADRs. Thirty percent of their business is in the U.S. They got hit hard by the election results. We think the stock has a good chance to go back to where it was before the election.IBD: Am I right in thinking that Contrarian and Hodges funds are about as different as funds can be?Hodges: Contrarian is just that. It buys the most out-of-favor, unloved name we can come across. About 80% of its stocks would never cross over into Hodges Fund.IBD: Freeport McMoRan (FCX) posted eight straight quarters of EPS slowdown before finally notching a gain. Why do you still like this mining company?Hodges: Our assessment is that they will survive. They're doing things necessary to survive. They're selling off Gulf oil properties, getting their balance sheet squared away, fixing their short-term ills. Our cost is under 6 per share. (It's trading around 13.50). They're not out of the woods, but their asset sales will get them out of the woods.IBD: Facebook (FB) said last month that its advertising-revenue growth rate would slow, which hurt its share price. Do you still like the stock?Hodges: We think it's the ultimate social media company. They're the ones that continue to gain market share. They're diversified. They own Instagram. They're the ones hurting Twitter (TWTR). They're rock solid in my mind.For us, it's a way to participate in what's going on in social media without paying a crazy multiple. It's not inexpensive, but relative to their number of users and how fast it's growing, it's inexpensive.The stock hasn't done much for a quarter and a half. Maybe people who bought it in the 130s are selling and taking losses. But the stock will do well next year.IBD: Southwest Airlines posted a 1% decline in earnings per share growth in the third quarter and it expects a revenue decline in Q4. Do you still like the airline?Hodges: The days of wild fluctuations in earnings for airlines are gone. The competitive landscape is more friendly. They've gone from eight main carriers to three, and Southwest is the fourth.There are barriers to entry. It's expensive to buy the fuel-efficient planes that you need to compete. Meanwhile, Southwest is paying down debt. You've seen a decrease in airlines' earnings estimates, but most are up 30% to 40% (in share prices) for the year. All are buying back their stock. I imagine Delta (DAL) (which Hodges Fund also owns) will continue to raise its dividend. Others might pay more, once they pay back debt. Southwest is buying back a lot.IBD: Match Group (MTCH) aims to help people get an education and get a spouse. It's somewhat new to Hodges Fund. What's your thesis?Hodges: They are like the Facebook of online dating. They own several different dating sites. Their biggest is Match.com, but they also own OKCupid, PlentyOfFish and BlackPeopleMeet. They have 45 dating brands. In the education space, they own PrincetonReview.com.They make money from advertising and membership fees. They don't have a great growth rate, but they own such a good(-size) part of the business that it creates a barrier to entry.IBD: United States Steel's earnings per share grew 61% and 157% the past two quarters after slowing for five quarters in a row. What's the driver?Hodges: The main thing is, people don't understand how hard it is to get into the business, even after there have been so many bankruptcies and so much consolidation. And China has been dumping steel into the U.S. for years. Now there's a president who not only will refine trade agreements but push to get a level playing field for companies like U.S. Steel.There just isn't a lot of (U.S.) competition, but U.S. Steel has tremendous earnings power. Shares trade in the mid-30s. Shares traded near 200 in 2008 on $17 per share in earnings. They're not going near that. But this company could earn $4 to $5 a share in two to three years. On that, the stock could trade back into the 60s or 70s. With a more robust economy, you could see some real multiple expansion.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewTop-Notch Investor's Bets On Likely Trump-Era Stock LeadersFranklin DynaTech's Matthew Moberg Wins With Stocks Of InnovatorsWarren Buffett Liked Airlines So Much That He Bought Several

1397,NOV,"Oil fell for the first time in nine sessions in New York after a government report showed U.S. crude stockpiles increased for a second week.Crude stockpiles rose 614,000 barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration. A 1.5 million barrel decline was forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, and a 4.2 million barrel increase was reported Wednesday by the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute.Gasoline and diesel futures climbed to the highest in more than a year after stockpiles fell. Refiners along the Gulf Coast try to reduce crude inventories in December to lower their tax bills.""The fact that crude oil supplies were able to build as refineries operated at high levels and at a time of year when tax concerns usually lower supplies is bearish,"" John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy, said by telephone.Oil has traded near or above $50 a barrel since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed Nov. 30 to cut output for the first time in eight years. Non-OPEC producers including Russia will also trim supply. Iraq is committed to reducing output by as much as 210,000 barrels a day from January, Oil Minister Jabbar al-Luaibi said in an interview with Kuwait's state-run news agency Kuna.West Texas Intermediate for February delivery dropped 29 cents, or 0.5%, to settle at $53.77 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract gained 16 cents to $54.06 on Wednesday, the highest close in almost 18 months. Total volume traded was about 36% below the 100-day average at 2:55 p.m. Prices are up 45% this year.Brent for February settlement slipped 8 cents to expire at $56.14 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Prices are up 51% this year. The global benchmark crude ended the session at a $2.37 premium to WTI. The more-active March contract declined 11 cents to $56.85.Nationwide inventories increased to 486.1 million in the week ended Dec. 23, and are at the highest seasonal level since the EIA began tracking weekly data in 1982. Crude stockpiles at Cushing, Okla., the delivery point for WTI, rose by 172,000 barrels to 66.4 million, the EIA said.""The Brent-WTI spread is near $2.50, which is very wide,"" Thomas Finlon, director of Energy Analytics Group in Wellington, Fla., said by telephone. ""This shows that there's too much crude at Cushing.""Gasoline supplies slipped 1.59 million barrels last week, while stockpiles of distillate fuel, which includes diesel and heating oil, fell 1.88 million. Overall fuel demand dropped 5.8% to 20.2 million barrels a day last week.""The product draws are bullish, but the weak demand numbers are a challenge,"" Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Mass., said by telephone.Gasoline futures for January delivery climbed 0.4% to $1.682 a gallon, the highest close since August 2015. The February gasoline crack spread, a rough measure of the profit from refining crude into the fuel, climbed as much as 6.3% to to $17.033 a barrel.Diesel for February delivery rose 0.3% to $1.7037, the highest settlement since July 2015.

1398,NOV,"The major indexes drifted mostly lower in early afternoon trading Thursday on the penultimate trading session of the year.Turnover in Nvidia (NVDA) shares, however, remained intense as the stock barreled sharply lower for a second straight session. As of 1:08 p.m. ET, more than 29 million shares exchanged hands, already well above its 50-day average of 15.3 million.Despite a report of bullish comments from a Goldman Sachs analyst, the leading tech stock of 2016 had slumped more than 6% to a session low of 102.80, but shares have fought back to cut the loss to less than 0.5% at 108.88.Still, the rebound does not erase the fact that Wednesday's action triggered several IBD classic sell signals, including a heavy-volume reversal following a new high, as well as the largest single-day point loss since Nvidia broke out of a second-stage cup with handle at 33.16 in mid-March.The last time the high-growth stock fell at least 2% or more for two straight sessions came on Feb. 5 and 8. Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, continued to show constructive action with minor losses on both Wednesday and so far on Thursday. Shares were off about 0.1% to 116.64 on Thursday, less than a 2% gain away from surpassing a potential new base-on-base buy point at 118.79.Apple had broken out of a cup with handle, lodged within a long bottoming base pattern, at 110.33 on Sept. 14, rallied 7.5%, then dipped back below both that buy point and the 50-day line before recovering. The pullback resulted in a new base-on-base pattern, which can be a powerful springboard for leading stocks aiming to break out to new highs.The Nasdaq composite frittered small early gains and slipped 0.2% while the Nasdaq-100 lost nearly 0.3%. But the NYSE composite, which is less influenced by big tech companies, held on to a sliver of a gain. The index is up 9% year to date, vs. an 8.3% advance by the Nasdaq composite.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials were both off 0.1%. Volume was running lower on both exchanges vs. the same time Wednesday.Going back to Nvidia, as noted in an earlier Stock Market Today column, it would not be at all surprising for the big-cap leader to test its 50-day moving average, which has continued to climb and is now around 87.A drop from the latest all-time high, near 120, to 87 would be 27% — perfectly normal for a true market leader that's ready to stage its next significant correction.In the prior cup with handle base that formed from December 2015 to March of this year, Nvidia went from 33.94 to 24.75, a 27.1% correction. Nvidia went on to finish the handle portion, enabling a 33.16 entry, or 10 cents above the handle's high of 33.06.Most excellent cup with handles, double bottoms, and saucer patterns usually show a drop of 20% to 30%, sometimes slightly more, from head to toe.Larger declines would put more pressure on the stock to make a big rebound just to place the stock in a good position for a potential breakout.For instance, if a stock falls from 100 to 50, a 50% decline, that stock has to rally 100% — a tough job for any stock — just to get back to that old high.Nvidia's 200-day moving average, a long-term technical line, is shy of 60. A drop all the way down to that level is not impossible, but would indicate an unusually heavy preponderance of selling by the big guns in the market — namely mutual funds, hedge funds, pension plans and banks.Nvidia's slide has impacted a few other chip industry peers. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which like Nvidia has made outstanding gains since the Nov. 8 elections, dropped more than 2% to 11.28 before shaving the losses to less than 1%.The CPU expert for various computing devices bolted out of a low-priced cup with deep handle at 7.63 in heavy volume Nov. 16. Since then, shares have rallied as much as 62%, sending it miles above its rising 50-day moving average.Wall Street expects Advanced Micro to lose 15 cents a share this year, but then turn a profit of a nickel a share in 2017.Elsewhere in the stock market today, innovative discount retailer Five Below (FIVE) is rebounding sharply yet still swimming below its 50- and 200-day lines. The stock, up 1.5% to 38.90, suffered a 16% slide over a nearly three-week stretch, putting a wrecking ball to work on the right side of a potential new base.In general, brick-and-mortar retailers have faced intense competition from online-only rivals. Yet Five Below, which has been rapidly expanding into the Midwest and South, has posted earnings-per-share gains of 33%, 26%, 50%, 38% and 25% vs. year-ago levels in the past five quarters.Revenue has risen 23%, 24%, 25%, 21% and 18% over the same period. Watch to see if its Retail-Discount & Variety industry group improves from its currently lowly standing.RELATED:Stock Market Today: When Did Nvidia Show Signs That A Correction Is Near?The Bottoming Base, Part I: Why It Helps Investors ProfitThe Bottoming Base, Part II: How Apple Formed One In 2009Leaders & Success: Learn From The Trading Wisdom Of Wall Street Great And Author Gerald LoebInvestor's Corner: Recent Presidencies And the Best Performing Industries In The Stock Market

1399,NOV,"Mobileye (MBLY) will partner with digital mapping company Here, owned by a consortium of German automakers, to develop a precise global map that can be used for hands-free driving and location services, posing a threat to Google Maps owner Alphabet (GOOGL).The three owners of Here are BMW (BMWYY), Mercedes-Benz and Audi, which together acquired the mapping business from Nokia (NOK) in August 2015 for $3 billion. Volkswagen (VLKAY) is the parent company of Audi.Nokia spent years of research and development on Here, in addition to building the business via a series of acquisitions that included the $8.1 billion purchase of Navteq in 2007.Mobileye and Here will connect their respective autonomous driving technologies ""into an enhanced industry-leading offering for automakers,"" their news release said. ""The two companies also intend to explore other potential opportunities where their products and services are complementary to further support automotive companies in advancing their autonomous driving and mobility strategies generally.""IBD'S TAKE: The automakers rank 113th in six-month stock performance out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD. Tesla holds an IBD Composite Rating of just 37, indicating it has underperformed 63% of stocks in the past year. But innovation can be the key to future big-winning stocks. To learn which stocks are leading the market now, check out IBD's Stock Lists.Mobileye stock rose 9.8% to 38.44 in the stock market today, hitting a one-month high and surpassing its 50-day moving average after falling below it on Nov. 11. The stock may be bottoming from a correction that began in August.Mobileye's core product is chip and software technology that provides image processing and analysis used in cars with camera-based systems for assisted driving. It is part of IBD's auto sector, which is No. 14 out of 33 sectors.In July, Mobileye announced an agreement with Intel (INTC) and BMW to provide technology which BMW will use in a fleet of self-driving cars it plans to introduce in 2021. Intel is providing a broad set of technologies, including machine learning and artificial intelligence. Mobileye is providing chips and software.Every major automaker, including Tesla Motors (TSLA), General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) have driverless car programs. The investments are creating new rivalries and business opportunities for both automobile companies and their many tech company partners. Alphabet last week announced that it separated its self-driving car efforts into a new company called Waymo.At the upcoming CES show in Las Vegas on Jan. 5-8, Mobileye and Delphi Automotive (DLPH) plan to showcase their autonomous driving technology. Mobileye hooked up with Delphi in August after parting ways with Tesla, which followed a fatal crash involving a Tesla Model S that was using Autopilot mode.Digital maps are a crucial piece of technology for the development of self-driving vehicles. Digital location services from Here are also used by companies such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Uber and Chinese search-engine leader Baidu (BIDU), providing an alternative to Google.On Tuesday, Here announced that China internet giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), along with Chinese mapping company NavIno and Singapore-based investment firm GIC will jointly acquire a 10% stake in Here. The intent is to expand Here's mapping products and services in China.Last week, Microsoft (MSFT) and Here signed a multiyear agreement, enabling Microsoft to integrate Here data and services into its Bing Maps platform that also powers Cortana.RELATED:CES 2017: News From The World's Largest Consumer Tech ShowTesla, Alphabet, Automakers Get Guidelines On Self-Driving VehiclesMicrosoft Writes Off Entire Value Of Nokia Deal

1400,NOV,"The stock market was narrowly mixed Thursday morning as it sought to bounce from a sharp decline the prior session.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 rose 0.1%. The Nasdaq eased less than 0.1% after erasing a mild gain at the open. The composite reached a record high just past 5500 on Tuesday but has met resistance at that level. The small-cap Russell 2000 led with a 0.3% gain.In the penultimate session of 2016, volume was tracking slightly lower compared with the same time Wednesday. But winners led losers by 7-to-3 across the board.Indexes have the task of rebounding after taking a punch Wednesday that saw the S&P suffer its worst one-day decline since October.Gold stocks led as the price of gold continued a moderate rebound. The SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD) was up 0.4%. Some retail and transportation industry groups also were in the top 10 for the day. Energy, auto and banking stocks were some of the laggards.Nvidia (NVDA) slid more than 4% in heavy volume, continuing a sell-off that started Wednesday. The hot graphics-chip stock has flashed signs of overheating and of being in a climax top. Those included an abnormal run of nearly 30% in just 10 sessions.A couple of automakers were among the stocks down in unusually heavy volume.Tesla Motors (TSLA) fell 2%. The electric-car manufacturer has climbed back above the 200-day moving average this week as it keeps working on a long base. Toyota (TM) was down less than 1% and found support just above the 50-day line. A breakout past a 122.19 buy point Dec. 8 has been floundering, but Toyota has not made a sell signal.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Hawaiian Holdings (HA) was up 1% as one of the few stocks up in heavy trading. The parent of Hawaiian Airlines is extended from a Nov. 22 breakout and is one of several airline stocks trading near 52-week highs.Another is Copa Holdings (CPA), which is forming a flat base. Delta Air Lines (DAL) has retraced a small gain from a breakout past 49.51.RELATED:Retailers Face 2017 'Reckoning,' More 'Sad Malls' As Amazon Keeps BoomingHow To Invest: How To Track The Major Indexes Like A ProStock Market Today: The Signs That Showed A Correction In Nvidia Is NearHow To Invest: Trading Lessons From A Wall Street Legend, Gerald Loeb
"
1401,NOV,"Look up ""sad mall"" or ""dead mall"" online and you're likely to be confronted with images of desolate, shuttered shopping centers that have been left for dead. Overgrown plants crack through abandoned storefronts; crumbled tile litters broken-down escalators. It's a common-enough phenomenon that entire photography projects revolve around the state of the country's retail centers.Is this what 2017 holds for American shoppers?Not quite, but the upcoming year isn't exactly going to be a cakewalk, either. The hundreds of collective store closures (from Macy's (M), Wal-Mart (WMT) and others, combined) and bankruptcies (Sports Authority, Sports Chalet) in 2016 are enough to make even the most devoted shopaholic wonder if the future of commerce is one big Amazon.com (AMZN) screen.""It's going to be a year of transition and a year of reckoning and a year of awakening for retailers,"" said Marshal Cohen, NPD Group's chief industry analyst.Retail sales excluding autos and gasoline rose 4% from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24, according to MasterCard's SpendingPulse. That suggests a stronger-than-expected holiday season, perhaps reflecting more optimistic consumers. But while digital sales continued to boom, with Amazon grabbing an ever-larger e-commerce share, brick-and-mortar locations faced declining traffic. And those trends are likely to intensify into the new year.The big discounts offered at apparel stores this holiday season echoed prior sales-heavy years, particularly 2015's. While retailers generally went into this important shopping period claiming that inventories were lean, stores feel they have no choice in an already cutthroat environment.""Consumers have been trained that if they hold out, they will get a promotion,"" said Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar. ""The other problem is that it's a really overcrowded space with no barriers to entry. A lot of retailers are choosing to compete on price.""IBD'S TAKE: What's holding Amazon back from becoming a major player in beauty? For an in-depth look, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""Retail Metrics President Ken Perkins said that outside of a few busy hours on the weekends, Holiday 2016 was ""somewhat eerily quiet"" at the mall.During store checks, his research firm observed but a ""handful of people"" at Foot Locker (FL), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) brand Hollister, American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) and Macy's. L Brands' (LB) Bath & Body Works ""always seems to have a buzz,"" he said, but even Apple (AAPL) stores seemed less bustling than in years' past.""Each year it feels like that lull is a bit deeper and deeper,"" said Perkins.Some of the lag can be attributed to holiday promotions being pushed up earlier in November, said NPD's Cohen, spreading out the spending. But the perhaps greater problem is the lack of product innovation and uniqueness on shelves, he said.In other words, there's not enough new, fun stuff to buy — for other people or for self-gifting purposes.NPD, which tracks the November-December shopping period week by week, said in its latest report that as of the week ending Dec. 10, dollar sales in the first six weeks of the holiday retail season were lagging the prior-year period by 4%.Brick-and-mortar traffic fell about 10% at stores through Dec. 17, according to Prodco Retail Traffic Index.One saving grace for brick-and-mortar locations: Christmas Eve — also the start of Hanukkah this year — was on a Saturday, while Dec. 26 was also a day off.The issues that faced retailers in 2016 are likely to continue to face them in 2017, without much abatement. Perkins highlighted the ongoing shift to online and mobile spending, a consumer taste for experiences instead of products, high promotional activity and a ""hollowing out"" of the middle class that leaves less disposable income on the table.And, of course, Amazon's insistent gains. On top of Prime shipping and Prime Video, the company's smart-home device, Alexa, can help Prime members place orders.""(Alexa) cuts retailer out of the equation for consumers that are pressed for time,"" he said.Upper-tier malls — the kind that house Tiffanys (TIF) and Louis Vuittons and Shake Shacks (SHAK) — are expected to continue to perform well enough. But the average mall might still see some individual stores close up shop, say experts, unless they go out of their way to attract more foot traffic.""Mid-tier malls are going to need to step up their game"" with restaurants, movie theaters and lifestyle stores, said NPD's Cohen, adding that ""the food court won't be good enough.""Simon Property Group (SPG), a major mall operator, has tumbled 24% over the last five months, sinking Wednesday to the lowest level in nearly 16 months.That young people are doing more mobile shopping and are craving experiences is no surprise. But how retailers respond may foreshadow the brick-and-mortar industry's fate.Wal-Mart (WMT) investments (which include its e-commerce efforts) may weigh on short-term income growth but lead to foreseeable rewards in the future, said Perkins, whose store checks found that Wal-Mart has been ""one of the busier stores"" this season.In 2017, the top-performers list should feature some familiar names, by Perkins' estimate. Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) are ""two of the strongest performers in retail."" He also sees off-price trio TJX (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Burlington (BURL) continuing to do well, as well as Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which is ""obviously a standout player.""Home improvement, off-price and beauty all involve some element of in-store necessity: looking for just the right part, digging through bargain racks and trying on new makeup brands are usually best done in person.Department stores have had a choppy year, though Nordstrom (JWN) frequently gets a shout-out from analysts for being an ""omnichannel"" retailer that knows how to engage its customers across platforms. And unlike Macy's or Kohl's (KSS), which compete ""with Amazon and everyone else on the internet,"" says Morningstar's Weishaar, Nordstrom has differentiated itself by catering to more affluent shoppers with a highly curated selection.""If you go to Amazon and type in 'red dress,' you're going to get literally hundreds of pages of results to sift through that (are) not useful,"" she said. ""If you go to Nordstrom, you're going to get 10 (products in line with) your price points and brands.""Even so, Nordstrom was recently handed a downgrade from JPMorgan after the department store's management team said brick-and-mortar levels hadn't been that bad since 1972.In the future, being omnichannel might not be enough, particularly in a world increasingly populated by Alexa and Google Home devices.Retail ""omnipresence"" is key, said NPD's Cohen.That is, instead of simply giving customers a way to buy products both in-store and online, it would behoove retailers to latch onto shoppers before, during and after the transaction, he said. Educate them and anticipate their needs ahead of potential transactions, allow them different ways to buy, then stay in touch via product reviews or other methods following the purchase.The goal, said Cohen, is ""that the store becomes the epicenter for the entire process.""RELATED:Amazon's Top Selling Holiday Products Came From ...

1403,NOV,"Still shell-shocked from his party's Nov. 8 beating, President Barack Obama said, ""I'm confident that if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could've mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it"" to win a third term.When the upstart New York Jets' Joe Namath of the old American Football League upset the 19-point favorite Baltimore Colts of the National Football League, stunned the-NFL-is-still-superior sports pundits said things like, well, the Colts would have beaten the Jets nine times out of 10. But the Super Bowl isn't the best nine out of 10, is it?Hillary Clinton lost. Obama backed her. He and first lady Michelle Obama campaigned hard for her. Obama even claimed that a Clinton loss would be an insult to his ""legacy."" Clinton still lost.Besides, isn't Obama the same man who told us that ""no one"" was ""more qualified"" than Clinton to serve as president, including him? Never mind — to offer just one example — the first President Bush. George Herbert Walker Bush, when running for reelection against Bill Clinton in 1992, had served four years as president, eight years as vice president, as the head of the Republican National Committee, as head of the CIA, as United States ambassador to the United Nations, as a member the House of Representatives and as a decorated a World War II Naval aviator.Obama, in making the prediction of his hypothetical third-term victory, argues that his policies are working just fine — and the only problem is the irritating inability of voters not to understand this. They are simply not gifted enough to see it, or Clinton was not talented enough to make them. Here Obama clearly implies that he, as a better communicator than she, would've opened the voters' blind eyes and won the election.The Obama-as-better-communicator argument arrogantly ignores the approximately two-thirds of Americans who say we're on the wrong track economically, with a similar number feeling the same way about foreign policy. It ignores the low labor force participation rate, reflected by the abandonment of the jobs market by working-age Americans who are frustrated by the most lackluster recovery since 1949.Take Obamacare. It, maintains Obama, is a wonderful plan, even if it passed with no Republican support and only after an ocean of false promises. These promises included that it would bend the cost curve down; save the average household $2,500; and that if you liked your current plan or doctor, you could keep your plan or doctor.Premiums went up, not down. Copays went up, not down. Same with deductibles. And yes, some of those who face hikes still get offsetting subsidies, but this just pushes the costs onto others. Who knew that providing health care insurance to 20 million by forcing insurance carriers to accept those with preexisting conditions; forcing carriers to allow parents to keep their ""children"" on their policies up to their children's 26th birthday; and regulating how carriers set premiums was going cost money?Obama, a product of two Ivy League schools and the best private school in the state of Hawaii, still does not understand Economics 101, a common phenomenon with someone of his academic pedigree. But how to explain the cluelessness of his fellow non-elite, non-Ivy League educated Democrats? As with Obama, the left sees the world as they want it to be, or the world as it should be — if they can only get the ""obstructionist"" Republicans out of the way. This is a most appealing perspective for a politician who survives by peddling this nonsense.His ""climate change"" measures are also, according to Obama, working splendidly. Sure, the green-tech jobs that Obama promised did not materialize, and most of the government ""investment"" provided little if any return for the taxpayer. A devastating ""60 Minutes"" expose titled ""The Cleantech Crash"" reported that ""the federal government has allocated a total of $150 billion to cleantech — through loans, grants and tax breaks with little to show for it.""Had such a televised piece exposing this outrageous ""cleantech"" boondoggle run in a Republican administration, the media would've cried for congressional investigations of the program's waste, fraud and abuse. But the President's climate-change crusade did not miss a beat.In eight years out of office, President George W. Bush said virtually nothing about his successor, his successor's policies or even his own legacy. His father did likewise about his successor, Bill Clinton. But in the waning days of his presidency, Obama and his press secretary attacked his successor while criticizing his successor's cabinet choices. Obama even carps on Donald Trump's use of social media, specifically Twitter, which enabled Trump to go around the traditional anti-GOP media and beat Clinton while spending half as much money.Compared to other presidents, Obama entered office as a young man and leaves as a young man. Hell hath no fury like a left-wing president, with plenty of sand left in his hourglass, out to preserve his ""legacy.""RELATED:ObamaCare: Latest News, Analysis And Fact CheckingGlobal Warming And Climate Change Facts And Fiction

1405,NOV,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has halted or partially halted several early stage clinical trials of a Seattle Genetics (SGEN) drug being developed to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the company said Tuesday.Premarket trading in Seattle Genetics was temporarily halted on the news. Seattle Genetics plunged 15% to 52.36 on the stock market today, touching a nearly two-month low. Seattle Genetics stock hit a record high of 75.36 on Nov. 10, and it had been up 38% for the year before Tuesday.The holds were on trials of SGN-CD33A, vadastuximab talirine, in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia.""The clinical holds were initiated to evaluate the potential risk of hepatotoxicity in patients who were treated with SGN-CD33A and received allogeneic stem cell transplant either before or after treatment,"" Seattle Genetics said in its press release Tuesday. ""Six patients have been identified with hepatotoxicity, including several cases of veno-occlusive disease, with four fatal events.IBD'S TAKE: It has not been the best of times for biotech and medtech stocks of late, but some tech groups are almost always doing well. Get a jump on hot tech areas by keeping track of IBD's Tech Leaders.""Overall, more than 300 patients have been treated with SGN-CD33A in clinical trials across multiple treatment settings. Seattle Genetics is working diligently with the FDA to determine whether there is any association between hepatotoxicity and treatment with SGN-CD33A, to promptly identify appropriate protocol amendments for patient safety and to enable continuation of these trials.""The company said other ongoing trials of SGN-CD33A are proceeding with enrollment.In a recent interview with IBD to look ahead at 2017, which will appear later this week, Seattle Genetics CEO Clay Siegall said of the firm's 33A AML drug: ""We'll be starting a randomized phase 2 (trial) in younger AML patients, younger being less than 60 years old. So that will be a big trial that starts this year (2017).""A ""pivotal"" study on elderly AML patients was not affected, nor were some other studies, Needham analyst Chad Messer pointed out in a research note Tuesday. He also pointed out that the company's treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma is far more important, with major data on tap for 2017. Messer maintained his buy rating and 72 price target on Seattle Genetics stock.Siegall, in the IBD interview, also was asked for his thoughts about the 21st Century Cares bill, which aims to speed up the FDA drug approval process. He said:""As far as the (21st Century) Cares bill goes, I'm very supportive of anything we can do to make developing therapies for patients in need more efficient or more robust. We work with people with cancer and people that are dying of cancer and have relapsed after multiple therapies, so we see it everyday. ... So I love the fact the country is making this a priority and making a good budget to do biomedical research and to improve how we make medicine for patients.""Having said that, I also think the FDA model is very good. And I applaud the FDA on the work they are doing, because what I have seen over 25 years is how hard the FDA works and how the intentions of the FDA are to provide approvals for the best medicines and to protect the country from medicines that should not be approved.""

1406,NOV,"Stocks added to recent gains with four trading days remaining in the year as a key survey on U.S. consumer confidence hit its highest level since August 2001.Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) marked its 10th straight gain Tuesday, rising more than 29% over that long stretch. On Tuesday, shares rose more than 5% to 115.93 and hit a new all-time high of 116.65.Such a robust advance over a narrow period of time, on top of strong gains over the past nine months, is equivalent to the traditional climax run, a key IBD sell signal that carries the most weight during a market that has reached bubblelike conditions.It's very hard to call the current equities market ""bubblelike,"" even if so-called price-to-earnings valuations of the S&P 500 are above historical averages. Despite a quarter-point hike in interest rates earlier this month, and plans by the Federal Reserve to possibly raise rates three more times in 2017, the speed in which the money supply will tighten does not appear to be affecting the yield curve lately.Nonetheless, Nvidia holders can decide to sell at least a portion of their position and get prepared for the inevitable correction and new base building that follows.Normal cup bases range from a decline of 12% from high to low to as much as 33% to 35%. However, in the case of a stock as strong as Nvidia, corrections in the range of 40% to 50% or more are not uncommon. Cisco Systems (CSCO) presented such a precedent during the 1994-to-1995 market pullback; after a huge move from its initial IPO base breakout in October 1990, the internet gear maker fell from 40.75 to 18.75 from March 1994 to July that year, a 54% decline.Nvidia hasn't climbed as much as Cisco did during its monster advance (a 2,297% run from the October 1990 breakout to the March 1994 peak). But its 251% gain from the breakout past a 33.16 cup with handle entry in March is still sizable. Also, Apple (AAPL), boosted by news reports that future iPhone models will carry a new dual vertical camera feature, marked its biggest gain in days with a 1% lift to 117.65. That put the megacap tech ever closer to a potential breakout from a solid base-on-base structure with a 118.79 proper entry point.Apple has also risen more than 7% past a 110.33 buy point within a cup with handle that sits within a long bottoming base pattern. Apple initially broke out of that cup base on Sept. 14, rallied 7.5%, then retreated to form the next base.The Nasdaq composite led the way, up 0.5%, while the S&P 500 trailed with a nearly 0.3% gain. The Nasdaq 100 powered 0.7% higher, indicating unusual strength among tech stocks and other non-financial sectors. The Dow Jones industrials rose just 0.1%, while the Russell 2000 gained 0.4%.Volume shot higher vs. the same time on Friday on the Nasdaq and fell mildly on the NYSE.Oil drilling, automaker, consumer lending, fabless semiconductor and metals-related stocks all paced the broad advance with gains of 1.5% or higher. Few industry groups were down, and included defensive-type industries such as electric utilities and mortgage REITs.Returning to Nvidia, the stock has shown the CAN SLIM-type combination of earnings and sales growth excellence, superior price-and-volume action, and heavy sponsorship by institutional investors. Total mutual and hedge fund ownership has boomed over the past three quarters, from 1,406 funds at the end of 2015 to 1,739 at the end of the third quarter this year.Yet the chart action shows that Nvidia's rally is achieving a pace that is difficult to sustain over the longer term. Nvidia has now risen 98% above its 200-day moving average, which is not a sell signal by itself. However, it serves as a warning for holders to watch the stock carefully for signs of a sudden drop in buying enthusiasm and eager selling.Nvidia also crossed above a fresh upper channel line that can be drawn starting with the high registered during the week ended June 3, connecting new highs set in the weeks ended Aug. 12 and Dec. 18. Such violations of the upper channel, following a long run that began with the breakout from a second-stage cup with handle at 33.16, indicate overheated buying.Use a large weekly chart at either Investors.com or IBD's Marketsmith to properly draw the upper channel line.As of Nov. 30, short interest in the stock hit 5.7 times Nvidia's 50-day average volume of 13.8 million shares, or 78.5 million shares, according to data from William O'Neil + Co. That's equal to 15% of the entire stock float of 507 million shares, and thus it's likely that much of the move in December may be tied to short covering.The stock is now trading well above its 50-day moving average near 85; a 27% drop to the 50-day line would be normal for a true market leader ready to correct and form a new base.Yet for now, GARP-style investors (growth at a reasonable price) may argue that Nvidia has plenty of room left to run in the near and middle term. Analysts see earnings rising 60% to 83 cents a share in the fiscal fourth quarter ending in January next year. Nvidia shares currently trade around 47 times earnings over the trailing four quarters.Growth is expected to slow in fiscal 2018, rising 12% to $2.70 a share. But in the fiscal third quarter, Nvidia slammed Wall Street's consensus profit view by nearly 46%. Watch to see how next year's profit estimates get revised.The Conference Board on Tuesday said its Consumer Confidence Index hit 113.7 in December, up from an upwardly revised 109.4 in November and well ahead of Reuters' consensus poll of 109.0.U.S. interest rates rose again, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond up to 2.57%, up 21 basis points over the past month. The 2-year Treasury yield is at 1.2%, up 12 basis points over the past month. Crude oil prices rallied to a new 52-week high; WTI futures jumped nearly 1.8% to $53.96 a barrel, eclipsing a near-term peak of $52.98 on Dec. 13.RELATED:Finding The Best Stocks: Can Nvidia's Fundamentals Make It The Next Apple?Stock Market Today: Which 3 Big-Cap Stocks Match Nvidia In Terms Of IBD Ratings?Strength In Chip Stocks: These Fabless Semiconductor Firms Are Rallying Along With NvidiaHow To Invest: Trading Wisdom From A Wall Street Great, Gerald LoebThe Bottoming Base, And How It Helps Investors Make Money

1407,NOV,"The term ""sector rotation"" has cropped up a great deal over the past five weeks.And with good reason. The combination of the surprise election of Donald Trump as president and the looming certainty of an interest-rate increase from the Federal Reserve launched a passel of rallies ranging from coal to savings and loans.But sector rotation was already well underway before the election.Sector rotation is a byproduct of institutional investors altering their focus within the market. This most often occurs gradually, over the span of weeks or months, as cyclical industries begin to turn up or down and as opportunities arise in a changing economic landscape.IBD'S TAKE: Industry and sector movements are a critical tool in tracking trends among institutional investors, and investing in tandem with institutional trends is what the 'I' stands for in the CAN SLIM investing strategy.By the end of the third quarter, a number of long-mending industries were beginning to show strength.Steel stocks were cycling up in a year that has seen profit return across much of the industry, asserting its influential effect on coal miners, ore miners and transportation. U.S. chemical producers built on a vast boom fueled by cheap gas prices. And energy plays had been climbing since January, as that industry moves toward what forecasters expect to be a balancing of supply and demand heading into 2017.As an industry group, steel makers rallied 43% through Nov. 7. The rally gained added life after the election, sending the group up 114% through Wednesday.The pre-election action had pushed aside some, but not all, of the sectors that had started the year in leading roles.  At the end of 2015, Internet, Office Supplies, Software and Building stocks all ranked in the top five among 33 sectors tracked by IBD.At the end of the third quarter, Chips, Electronics, Internet and Computer were four of the five top sectors.Mining, which ranked dead last at the end of 2015, was No. 1.A rally in gold prices beginning in early January sent gold mining stocks soaring. Mining crept to the No. 31 slot among industries by the end of January. By the end of February, the gold-miners industry group had rallied 28% since Dec. 31. Ore miners — the other mining-sector industry — were down 4.7%.At the end of March, Mining had seized the top slot among sectors.The Nov. 8 elections stirred the pot by reversing many expectations and pointing to opportunities where, a day earlier, there appeared to be none. That, combined with expectations of a Fed rate hike, quickly shifted Banks and Savings and Loans into the current top sector slots.Coal producers, part of IBD's Energy sector, had tumbled 27% in the first two months of the year. Coal stocks as a group would turn to rally 55% by Nov. 7, and 88% through Dec. 15 — aided by the election of the aggressively pro-coal Donald Trump.The domestic oil and gas producers industry group rallied 39% for the year to Nov. 7, and 46% to Dec. 15. Despite those advances, energy remained the year's least active sector — ranking No. 32 at the start of the year and No. 29 at the end of Q3. By Thursday, it had climbed only to No. 25.Many investors and analysts mistakenly use the terms ""sector"" and ""industry"" interchangeably. But this year's action within the energy group shows how there can, at times, be significant industry rotation without driving full-on sector rotation.Sectors are portions of the economy made up of multiple, related industry groups. Industry groups are groups of stocks that tend to have similar operations, products and markets. You can find out how IBD's 197 industries are divided among 33 sectors by using the Find Your Group's Sector page.The current breadth of leadership paints a positive picture heading into 2017. But it is also telling that, although there is much optimism toward opportunities tied to the presidential election, IBD's Sector Leaders — the most demanding screen at Investors.com for leading stocks — has revealed only two leaders since the start of December. At the end of 2015, six stocks ranked as Sector Leaders.The big money is still moving. New opportunities are being forged.RELATED:Factory Growth Jumps, Builder Sentiment Soars As Trump Fuels Animal SpiritsTo Spot Sector Rotation, Employ Multichannel ThinkingFinding Growth Stock Gold: The Case For A Trump Era Secular Bull Market

1408,NOV,"The market rally in the weeks after the election of Donald Trump is being buffeted by volatility, uncertainty and global crosscurrents — trends that are now playing out in the gold market.Prices, which had been going nowhere but down, surged 1.5% on Thursday, part of a rally since Dec. 27 that has erased more than one third of the metal's 14% postelection plunge.Shares of Newmont Mining (NEM) and Barrick Gold (ABX), big losers in the weeks after Trump's win, were up 4.8% and 6.3%, respectively, in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today, hitting levels not seen since before voters went to the polls.Treasury yields had been a one-way bet higher, with the 10-year yield rising 100 basis points to 2.62% Dec. 16 from 1.62% Nov. 8. Yet despite solid economic readings and the Federal Reserve's surprise signal that there might be three rate hikes in 2017, the 10-year yield's slide took it all the way down to 2.37% on Thursday.Higher interest rates and a stronger U.S. dollar have been talked up by various macroeconomic strategists as near sure things in 2017, but the dollar's rise also has suddenly hit resistance. The U.S. dollar index slid 1% vs. a basket of other advanced economy currencies on Thursday and has now given up more than one-third of its postelection rise.So why is the Trump rally suddenly facing turbulence?Thursday's moves appeared to be at least partly tied to a sudden reversal of China's currency, which had been a one-way bet lower vs. the dollar. Market players speculated that the People's Bank of China may have intervened to prop up the sagging currency in an effort to stem capital outflows.The Chinese government has been instituting capital controls, which has fueled a surge in prices of  bitcoin, as the digital currency can be sold on bitcoin exchanges outside of China. Bitcoin prices in China plunged more than 20% overnight as the yuan suddenly reversed higher, potentially a sign that the crackdown on capital leaving the country could intensify.IBD'S TAKE: The Federal Reserve, long worried about paltry growth, has shifted to the role of traffic cop. Now the key question is whether Donald Trump's fiscal fuel will raise the economy's speed limit, allowing for faster growth without pushing inflation much above the Fed's comfort zone.The market action in China is a reminder that if the U.S. is winning all the time, as Trump intends, the global economic backdrop could deliver some surprises from the countries that are losing. On Thursday, Mexico's central bank intervened to prop up the sagging peso, which has been battered by concern over Trump's policies.Ford (F) said on Tuesday that it's canceling plans for a new car factory in Mexico. On Thursday, Trump tweeted a warning to Toyota (TM) that it will pay ""a big border tax"" if it builds a plant in Mexico to ship Corollas to the U.S., echoing a threat aimed at General Motors (GM) days earlier.The volatility in interest rates, the dollar and gold also reflect uncertainty about the economic and political outlook. The Trump rally has been built on big expectations set by the president-elect and encouraged by his party's control of Congress.Those expectations haven't been dashed, by any means. Investors are still expecting big corporate tax cuts to lift earnings growth as well as infrastructure spending and individual tax cuts to boost the economy.But there may be a creeping sense of uncertainty about just how much Trump can get done, how fast it will happen, and whether some of his moves may backfire.RELATED:Ford Cancels Mexico Plant; Trump Threatens GM With 'Big Border Tax'

1409,NOV,"Filings for U.S. unemployment benefits declined to their lowest level in eight weeks, but other data showed companies added fewer jobs than forecast in December.Showing volatility typical around the holiday period, jobless claims dropped by 28,000 to 235,000 in the week ended Dec. 31, a Labor Department report showed Thursday in Washington. The median projection of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for 260,000.Meanwhile, data from the ADP Research Institute in Roseland, N.J., showed Thursday that private payrolls climbed by 153,000, below forecasts of 175,000. That came after a revised 215,000 gain in November. Goods-producing industries, which include manufacturers and builders, reduced head counts by 16,000, while service providers boosted payrolls by 169,000.""Job growth remains strong but is slowing,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics Inc. in West Chester, Pa., said in a prepared statement. Moody's produces the figures with ADP. ""Smaller companies are struggling to maintain payrolls while large companies are expanding at a healthy pace.""ADP found that businesses continue to add workers to meet sales, helping to sustain the progress that has put the job market at or near the Federal Reserve's maximum-employment objective.The slower pace of hiring underscores the challenge for companies in finding skilled workers as the labor market tightens, one reason wage growth may accelerate.The data provide more clues on the employment situation ahead of the Friday release of the Labor Department's monthly payrolls report, which is expected to show the economy added positions in December to cap another solid year of gains.Hiring in construction fell by 2,000 while factories subtracted 9,000 workers. Companies employing 500 or more workers increased staffing by 63,000 jobs. Payrolls rose by 71,000 at medium-sized businesses, or those with 50 to 499 employees, while small companies expanded payrolls by 18,000.The Labor Department figures, meantime, usually show swings around the year-end holidays. Firms generally have avoided firings as the job market tightens and the supply of available workers shrinks.Filings have remained below 300,000 for 96 consecutive weeks, the longest streak since 1970 and a threshold economists say is indicative of a healthy labor market. An average 263,000 Americans filed for benefits each week in 2016, down from 278,000 in 2015.The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits rose by 16,000 to 2.11 million in the week ended Dec. 24, the highest since early September. The unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits held at 1.5%. These data are reported with a one-week lag.Estimates in the Bloomberg survey for initial claims ranged from 250,000 to 275,000. The Labor Department revised the prior week's reading to 263,000 from an initially reported 265,000. Last week's figure was close to the four-decade low of 233,000 from the week ending Nov. 12.Six states including Virginia and Wisconsin had estimated claims last week, as did Puerto Rico. There was nothing unusual in the overall data, according to the Labor Department. The four-week average of claims, a less-volatile measure than the weekly figure, decreased to 256,750 from 262,500 in the prior week.
"
1410,NOV,"Federal Reserve officials focused on the impact of potential fiscal stimulus during their December policy meeting, with many starting to worry that the central bank might eventually be forced to quicken the pace of interest-rate increases to head off higher inflation.Almost all the participants ""indicated that the upside risks to their forecasts for economic growth had increased as a result of prospects for more expansionary fiscal policies in coming years,"" read the minutes of the Dec. 13-14 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, released Wednesday in Washington.Despite growing attention to the risks of fiscal policy spurring faster growth than currently forecast, most on the committee reiterated that a ""gradual"" pace of rate hikes over the coming years would likely remain appropriate.The minutes of the session, at which officials raised their benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point, showed that uncertainties over future fiscal policies weighed heavily in their discussion of the economy and the future path of monetary policy.IBD'S TAKE: The Federal Reserve will likely play traffic cop to Trump in 2017 as he hits the fiscal accelerator.President-elect Donald Trump promised higher spending on infrastructure, tax cuts and regulatory reform during his campaign, but has offered few new details of his policy goals since winning the Nov. 8 election. His inauguration is set for Jan. 20.""Participants emphasized their considerable uncertainty about the timing, size and composition of any future fiscal and other economic policy initiatives as well as about how those policies might affect aggregate demand and supply,"" the minutes said.The committee was divided on how far unemployment was likely to fall, and over the consequences for inflation if it fell significantly below the Fed's goal.""Many participants"" judged the risks of a sizeable undershoot on unemployment had increased somewhat, according to the minutes. Still, ""most participants"" expected the jobless rate would fall only ""modestly below their estimates of the longer-run normal rate.""The minutes showed that ""about half"" of the committee members had begun to incorporate assumptions about expansionary fiscal policy into their forecasts.Among officials still emphasizing the downside risks to the economy, some mentioned repeatedly the headwind created by an appreciating dollar.The U.S. currency has surged since the election, partly in anticipation of fiscal policies under the incoming Trump administration. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which measures the greenback against 10 global currencies, had appreciated 5.2% between Nov. 8 and the end of FOMC's meeting on Dec. 14. Since then it has strengthened an additional 0.9%.A stronger dollar hurts growth by making U.S. exports less competitive and slows inflation by making imports cheaper.At their December meeting, officials raised the number of quarter-point rate hikes they foresee in 2017, to three from two, while signaling growing confidence in the economy, according to their median estimate.Unemployment declined to 4.6% in November, its lowest level in more than nine years and close to most economists' estimates for the its lowest sustainable level. The Fed's preferred measure of price inflation was 1.6% in the 12 months through November after excluding food and energy components. Policy makers expect that to rise this year toward their 2% goal.The FOMC holds eight scheduled meetings a year, with the next session slated for Jan. 31-Feb. 1.

1411,NOV,"Mortgage applications tumbled 12% in the last two weeks of the year, but demand for buying a home fell much less, holding onto most of its postelection gains despite the recent rise in borrowing costs.Refinancing activity plunged 22%, seasonally adjusted, in the two weeks ended Dec. 30, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday, tumbling more than 50% in just four weeks.Mortgage rates, already climbing ahead of Election Day, soared following the election of Donald Trump. President-elect Trump has pledged tax cuts, regulatory reform and an infrastructure spending blitz that could boost economic growth and inflation, pushing Treasury yields higher.Demand for loans to buy a home dipped 2% over the last two weeks of 2016, and were off 1% vs. a year earlier. But purchase applications are still up nearly 16% since the week ended Nov. 11, which largely included pre-election responses.IBD'S TAKE: A key question for the housing industry in 2017 is how aggressive the Federal Reserve will be. Policymakers have signaled three rate hikes this year, but the Fed may play traffic cop as President Trump hits the gas.The average fixed-rate mortgage fell 6 basis points to 4.39% in the latest week, but is still up from 3.75% in the week ended Nov. 4. The prior week's 4.45% was the highest in two-and-a-half years.Many prospective buyers may be rushing to buy a home while rates are still historically low. But the rush may be fading as higher rates and still-rising home values take their toll on housing affordability, especially millennials.In addition to the recent dip in purchase applications, the Pending Home Sales Index unexpectedly fell to a 10-month low in November, the National Association of Realtors said last week.Other data, including new- and existing-home sales showed increases, with the latter hitting their best levels since before the housing bust. But those reports may not be as timely as the pending sales or the mortgage applications.On the upside for housing demand, job growth continues at a modest pace with indications that wage gains are starting to pick up.Shares of homebuilders, including KB Home (KBH), Toll Bros. (TOL), D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN), Pulte Group (PHM) and LGI Homes (LGIH) rallied on the stock market today in afternoon trading.KB Home rose 3.6% and Toll Bros 2%. Both hit recent highs in early December, in part due to Toll's quarterly earnings, and have pulled back modestly since then.D.R. Horton climbed 1.7%, Pulte Group 2.4% and LGI Homes 0.8% intraday, but their charts do not look that healthy.RELATED:Pending-Home Sales Hit 10-Month Low As Mortgage Rates 'Dispirited' BuyersExisting-Home Sales Make A Surprise Jump, Prices Up 6.8%New-Home Sales Jump As Buyers Rush To Lock In RatesCase-Shiller: Home Prices Rise 5.1% Vs.

The stock market will be closed on Monday.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) eked out a 0.1% gain on the stock market today and a 0.3% gain for the week.Gold was in the spotlight on Friday, as it fell for the seventh week in a row.However, some strategists still hold a positive long-term view on gold, citing investors' loss of confidence in central banks and the uncertainty following Donald Trump's presidential election win.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), the largest gold-backed ETF, melted after the Nov. 8 election.It came under further pressure last week following the Fed's decision to raise interest rates and to signal three rate hikes for 2017 — more than the consensus two.Higher interest rates put downward pressure on the yellow metal, which bears no yield.From Nov. 8 to Dec. 22, the SPDR Gold ETF booked a loss of 11.9% as the dollar surged to its highest level in 14 years.But currency-hedged peers, which seek to neutralize risk from a rising dollar, held up better.AdvisorShares Gartman Gold/Yen (GYEN) and AdvisorShares Gartman Gold/Euro (GEUR) lost 1.4% and 7.3%, respectively, since the election.These commodity ETFs use foreign currencies to invest their assets in the gold market. They are ideal for investors who are bullish on both gold and the greenback.Gold priced in the euro has gained 9.7% year to date, through Dec. 22, as tracked by GEUR.Gold priced in the U.S. dollar has risen 6.0% over the same period, as tracked by GLD.GEUR, which launched in 2014, has outperformed GLD over the past two years as well.Yet GEUR has been slow to gather assets. It holds $18.59 million and trades roughly 30,000 shares on average a day.If gold investors are unsure about the direction of the U.S. dollar, they would be better off diversifying with ETFs, Noah Hamman, CEO of AdvisorShares, told IBD via email on Friday.He suggested that those investors could allocate to GEUR and GYEN alongside other gold ETFs that invest in gold in dollar terms, such as GLD or iShares Gold Trust (IAU).A blend of GLD, GEUR and GYEN also gives investors a slightly smoother ride in their gold exposure over time, he added.Gold serves as a safe-haven asset. It tends to rise when the markets are under stress — and so does the dollar.""Holding gold in a non-U.S. dollar denominated currency may help to limit the downside risk during stressed market environments, where the U.S. dollar becomes a safe haven store of value,"" AdvisorShares notes on its website.Gold mining stocks also have tumbled after the Nov. 8 election and recent Fed rate hike.VanEck Gold Miners (GDX) sits 39% below its August high.IBD'S TAKE: ETF investors have a wealth of choices when it comes to investing in gold for different market conditions.Here's a look at the performance of major exchange traded funds across key asset classes on the stock market today.The Relative Price Strength (RS) Rating measures a stock's price performance over the last 12 months vs. all stocks and ETFs, on a scale of 1 to a best-possible 99.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), +0.1%, RS 57PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), +0.1%, RS 54SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), 0%, RS 65IShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH), +0.2%, RS 66IShares Russell 2000 (IWM), +0.5%, RS 72IShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), +0.3%, RS 38Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), +0.5%, RS 38SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), +0.3%, RS 17United States Oil (USO), +0.9%, RS 59IShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG), 0%, RS 30PowerShares DB U.S.$ Bullish (UUP), -0.1%, RS 54IPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (VXX), -0.5%, RS 1RELATED:Stock ETFs Rally; One Hot Tip For Investing In Gold As Dollar Surges

1419,NOV,"Online shoppers are swarming to Amazon.com (AMZN) this holiday season and the e-commerce giant has gained share vs. Best Buy (BBY), Wal-Mart (WMT) and Apple (AAPL), says market research firm Slice Intelligence.But Amazon and the other FANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL), the parent company of Google — mostly fell in the stock market today, while Apple rose a small fraction.Slice late Thursday said some 45.5% of consumer online spending went to Amazon in the week ended Dec. 17, up from 42.3% the previous week.Best Buy had 2.9% of online spending, with Wal-Mart and Apple both at 2.6%, says the market tracker.Slice Intelligence says electronics, as usual, are the top product category, followed by apparel. Apple orders had the highest average price tag at $350.IBD'S TAKE: Apple and most of the FANG stocks are showing weak relative strength vs. the broader market. True market leaders show rising RS lines. To find stocks with RS lines hitting new highs, take a free MarketSmith trial.Amazon may be getting a boost from improved logistics, with the average package for all online sellers arriving in just three days, compared to five days in 2015.Morgan Stanley, in a research report, says Amazon's fast-growing Prime membership will also likely drive a strong holiday season.Apple and the FANG stocks have largely sat out the stock market rally since Republican Donald Trump's surprise election as president. Investors have poured money into other sectors expected to benefit from infrastructure spending, lighter regulation and tax cuts.A strong holiday season could help Amazon stock, which touched a low of 719 on Nov. 14. Amazon stock, though, fell 0.75% Friday to 760.59. Amazon stock has been consolidating and trades near its 50-day moving average with a buy point of 847.31.Apple stock has formed a cup pattern and is nearing a buy point of 118.79. Apple stock edged up 0.2% Friday to 116.52.Netflix remains on the IBD Leaderboard of top-performing stocks. Netflix is drawing near a 129.39 cup-with-handle buy point, but rose just a penny, to 125.59, on Friday.Facebook stock is trading below its 50-day moving average. Facebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg sold nearly 800,000 shares in the social media company as part of a preplanned sale. Facebook has a buy point of 133.60, but it fell 0.11% Friday to 117.27.Alphabet stock was upgraded on Wednesday by Aegis Capital with a 980 price point on views that margin pressure will ease on advertising products. Alphabet stock is trading above its 50-day moving average with a buy point of 839.10. Shares of Alphabet, though, slipped 0.23% Friday, to 807.80.RELATED:Trump, Silicon Valley Shake Hands; Amazon's Bezos Hails 'Productive' MeetingWill Trump's China Bully Pulpit Backfire On Tech Firms?

1420,NOV,"Small-cap stocks thrived on Friday, yet the market as a whole acted the way it usually does right before Christmas. It made harmless moves, as most senior equity traders have already taken off for the three-day holiday weekend.The Russell 2000 gained 0.6% en route to a mild weekly gain, cutting away some of the prior week's 1.7% sell-off. Among the major indexes, the Nasdaq composite was next best, rising 0.3%.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both edged barely higher. Volume was sharply lower vs. Thursday, according to preliminary data.Yet some funds and professionals acted like busy Santa elves in accumulating more shares in one of the top growth vehicles of 2016, sending Nvidia (NVDA) up another 2.5% to 109.78, good enough for a ninth straight up day and new highs.The top chip play has now gained more than 230% from a mid-March breakout from a second-stage cup with handle at 33.17.Meanwhile, Dow 30 component Apple (AAPL) also acted in a positive manner. The megacap tech bounced off a mild intraday low of 115.59 to close a bit higher at 116.52.As noted in a recent Stock Market Today column, Apple has done enough hard work to craft a cuplike base that sits atop another cup-with-handle pattern. That latter pattern was formed out of a long bottoming base.The question for market observers now is this: Will the market show enough strength for new breakouts by Apple and others? Or, will Apple pull back to shake out the last uncommitted holders who have been sitting on paper losses and eager to bail out?That, in essence, is the psychology behind the building of a cup with handle. Remember that a handle should reflect a shakeout, and thus you'll see a downward slant along the lows as a handle forms. With narrow handles, check the slope on a daily chart. The minimum length of a handle on either a cup, double bottom or saucer is five trading sessions, or a week, on a weekly chart.Nvidia represents the future of computing, and the roles of semiconductors to make machines and devices connected to the internet, and enhance people's lives and the workplace.The Santa Clara, Calif., firm also currently boasts superior IBD Ratings, including a 99 Composite at IBD Stock Checkup on a scale of 1 to 99; a 96 EPS Rating; a 99 RS; and a top-flight A for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity).Are there other large-cap companies that more or less match Nvidia's solid ratings? Yes.IBD screened for stocks that have a minimum 98 Composite Rating; a $25 billion market cap or higher; average daily volume of at least 500,000 shares; a full-year EPS growth estimate of 15% or higher; and trading no more than 15% below a 52-week high.In addition to Nvidia, three names show up: Applied Materials (AMAT) (FY 2017 earnings are seen jumping 37% to $2.40 a share), Broadcom (AVGO) (FY 2017 EPS estimate up 20% to $14.09), and Charles Schwab (SCHW) (FY 2016 EPS estimate up 29% to $1.30, FY 2017 up 22% to $1.58).The former two are noted in IBD Leaderboard, with Applied as a watchlist candidate. Schwab ranks No. 24 in the IBD 50.Applied Materials, which may get a boost by the emergence of actuator chips, and Broadcom have fiscal years ending in October. Actuators turn digital signals into physical motion, light, and other forms of ""analog"" activity.Schwab has enjoyed strong gains along with other brokerages following Donald Trump's surprise Nov. 8 election win.Pretax margin at Schwab has surpassed 30% in 2013, 2014 and 2015, up from the high-20s in FY 2010 to FY 2012.Higher interest rates are likely to boost Schwab's income from investments and margin loans.

1421,NOV,"The $1.6 billion USAA Growth & Income Fund (USGRX) has picked up steam. Its 13.44% gain this year going into Thursday tops 75% of its large-cap blend rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. That's better than its 8.53% annual pace over the past three years, which beats 56% of its peers.The fund has received some of its drive from holdings like Applied Materials (AMAT), a semiconductor equipment and software maker that is up 75% year to date and has IBD's top Composite Rating of 99; and smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM), which is up 34% this year and has a good 85 Comp Rating.IBD'S TAKE: Chemicals maker FMC, which is up 46% year to date, is another holding helping to drive Growth & Income. FMC's third-quarter earnings per share growth of 60% beat analysts' estimates. As IBD recently reported, it guided for full-year EPS of $2.76 to $2.86 a share, above consensus forecasts for $2.75.One reason for the fund's stronger showing this year is the spark it received from a rally in energy names like Cimarex Energy (XEC) and EOG Resources (EOG).Another reason is that its financial services stocks got a good bump up from the November election, in part on the expectation that the Republican victories would lead to a lighter regulatory burden on banks, says Michael Nayfa, assistant manager of the 40% fund sleeve run by a team from subadvisor Barrow Hanley Mewhinney & Strauss. At the same time, interest rates have been rising in anticipation of the Federal Reserve's rate hike this month. Higher rates have improved banks' net interest margins and profit outlook.For example, SLM (SLM), the private education-loan originator better known as Sallie Mae, is up 70% this year. It gapped up 18% the day after the election, and is up 56% overall since the election. The stock has a sterling 91 Comp Rating.Money center bank Morgan Stanley (MS), with a 96 Comp Rating, is up 36% this year and 27% since the election.The fund's management approach, with two separate sleeves of securities run independently of each other, is a two-heads-are-better-than-one strategy. Basically, it doubles the number of best ideas the fund can have.USAA's John Jares and John Toohey, who run a 60% sleeve, have been making changes since taking the helm of their segment of the fund from a subadvisor on Nov. 20, 2012. Since then, they have employed a more concentrated approach with their sleeve, trimming it to 60-80 names from its prior range of about 130-150, Jares says. And their top 10 holdings now tend to account for 30% to 50% of their sleeve. That's up from 20% or less.The idea is to boost the contribution to fund performance from their best ideas. ""Too much diversification is negative,"" Jares said.Jares and Toohey began their current stake in Applied Materials in Q1 2013, while the semiconductor industry was still under pressure from the financial crisis. Applied had completed a combination with Varian Semiconductor in 2011. After that, Applied began to cut costs, Jares says. ""They also increased R&D and began to get more products through their pipeline,"" Jares said. ""Now they have gained market share since the combination with Varian.""The Barrow Hanley sleeve focuses more on value-oriented stocks than the Jares-Toohey sleeve. That means hefty weights in financials and health care. But the Barrow Hanley sleeve also holds what assistant manager Michael Nayfa calls value technology names. ""Those are stocks that pay high dividend yield, have high free cash flow and that trade at reasonable valuations,"" Nayfa said.Microchip Technology (MCHP), for instance, has a dividend yield of 2.2%. Its shares are up 40% this year and within 2% of its all-time high.""It's a semiconductor company that is predominantly in microprocessors,"" Nayfa said. ""It's gaining market share across the auto and industrial spaces.""Microchip acquired Atmel early this year. ""We like the deal,"" Nayfa said. ""It's a good fit. Atmel gives them a foothold in 32-bit processors, which some (investors) argue they are behind in. This deal can be 20% to 25% accretive to their earnings. Microchip has a proven record of buying and integrating assets. They do a good job at cost synergies. It can be hard to reduce costs without losing business, but they do it.""RELATED:Check Out This Top Mutual Fund's Portfolio

1423,NOV,"When it comes to emerging markets, many ETF investors might feel stuck between a precious rock and a hard place.On the one hand, this asset class is a key portfolio diversifier that gives investors a smoother stock market ride. And it was a star performer in their portfolios this year.On the other, the Nov. 8 election result derailed the rally for emerging market (EM) exchange traded funds and muddied the outlook for developing economies.Notwithstanding President-elect Donald Trump's protectionist rumblings on China, Mexico and international trade, some strategists advise keeping faith with emerging markets.""We see further upside given improvement in macroeconomic fundamentals, subdued inflation, reform momentum and stronger earnings,"" Heidi Richardson, head of investment strategy for U.S. iShares, wrote recently. ""We think global GDP growth has the potential to surprise on the upside in coming months, which should be positive for trade and emerging markets.""Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), the $43.30 billion juggernaut among EM ETFs, is nursing a 6.0% bruise in the final quarter of 2016 after a sharp postelection slide.Year to date through Dec. 21, VWO is still up 10.4% on the back of strong rallies in the first three quarters.Still, this bellwether ETF has seen net inflow of roughly $1.55 billion since the election, taking its asset haul in 2016 to $6.75 billion, according to FactSet data.After Nov. 8, shares of VWO and its largest EM rivals, including iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM), sliced below key short- and long-term levels of support.And on Thursday, several of these ETFs undercut short-term lows to fall 10% or more under their 52-week highs — which technically marks a market correction.For investors focused on long-term goals such as retirement, the correction is not much of an issue. But active traders, focused on the short term, have more to lose.A main worry is the greenback, which recently hit a 14-year high. A stronger dollar could squeeze emerging markets, making it harder for companies there to pay back massive amounts of dollar-denominated debt.ETF investors need to be aware, too, that a rising dollar may mean their greenback-denominated foreign investments won't see the same returns as overseas indexes, even if those markets rise.But one investing expert considers the good news for the dollar to be baked in. The single biggest reason to favor emerging markets now, he believes, is attractive valuations.""Emerging markets are a good and inexpensive investment that can really rocket forward,"" said Andy Kapyrin, director of research at Regent Atlantic, a $3 billion-plus registered investment advisor. ""They don't need to deliver good growth or good news to be decent performers.""For exposure to emerging markets, Kapyrin likes iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets (IEMG).The ETF offers diversified exposure to almost 1,900 large-, mid-, and small-cap companies in more than 20 emerging markets for a rock-bottom fee. Its 0.14% expense ratio is bettered only by Schwab Emerging Markets Equity (SCHE).For added diversification and growth benefits, Kapyrin layers on SPDR S&P Emerging Markets Small Cap (EWX).Small EM companies are more focused on domestic economies and consumers, and less roiled by global shocks and macroeconomic changes, he told IBD in a phone interview.Looking ahead, experts caution that a home country bias could hurt investors. BlackRock, the firm behind iShares ETFs, believes rotating to emerging markets will be necessary to seize growth.""Emerging market (EM) equities present a potential opportunity given higher rates of economic growth than many developed countries and more attractive valuations,"" the firm wrote in its 2017 investment outlook. ""In fact, the recent reflationary turn presents a tailwind for some emerging markets, bolstering commodity prices and boosting consumption.""Commodity-driven Russia has, in fact, been a big postelection winner.Since Nov. 8, iShares MSCI Russia Capped (ERUS) has vaulted nearly 20%. Meanwhile, its ETF peers investing in the other three major emerging markets — India, China and Brazil — have declined as much as 15%.Strategists at BlackRock recommend a selective approach to EMs, as valuations climb.They highlight potential opportunities in the mainly commodity-importing Asian region, which can be tapped with iShares MSCI India (INDA), iShares MSCI China (MCHI) and iShares MSCI Indonesia (EIDO).For investors who want to stay broadly diversified but wish to ""take the bite out of swings in EM equities,"" they suggest iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility Emerging Markets (EEMV).For tapping the growing EM middle class, one money pro likes Columbia Emerging Markets Consumer (ECON).RELATED:6 Best ETFs To Profit From The Trump Effect On The Stock Market

1424,NOV,"Another day, another pipeline protest by ""keep it in the ground"" activists.On Dec. 8, a dozen people swarmed a construction site near the Hudson River in an attempt to halt construction of Spectra Energy's AIM pipeline, which is designed to carry natural gas from New Jersey to Massachusetts. The protesters, who call themselves the HudsonStand12, were arrested and charged with criminal trespass and resisting arrest by authorities in Cortlandt, New York.Those arrests come on the heels of the monthslong protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline project in North Dakota, which, of course, followed the brouhaha over the Keystone XL pipeline.Climate activists are now hoping to block oil and gas pipeline projects across the country due to their claim that we must keep all hydrocarbons in the ground to avert catastrophic climate change. Those same activists repeatedly claim we don't need fossil fuels because we can rely solely on wind and solar energy.But while they obsess over our carbon footprint, climate activists don't give a fig about the land-use footprint of renewables. Indeed, the dirty truth about ""clean"" energy is that it requires shocking amounts of land. In a recent report for the Manhattan Institute, I show that using wind and solar energy to reduce domestic carbon dioxide emissions by 80% by 2050 (80 by 50) will require covering about 287,700 square miles of territory — an area about the size of Texas and West Virginia combined.I calculated the land-use requirements by examining three decarbonization scenarios that have been published over the past few years including the wind, water, and solar scenario that has been endorsed by the leaders of the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, and 350.org. Averaging those three scenarios shows that achieving 80 by 50 with renewables alone will require about 1,958 gigawatts of wind energy capacity and about 2,441 gigawatts of solar capacity.I then used data from the Department of Energy and published media stories to calculate wind energy's capacity density, that is, its overall footprint. The result: wind energy's footprint is 3 watts per square meter, or 1 gigawatt per 131.3 square miles. I relied on published data for three large California solar-photovoltaic projects to calculate solar's capacity density. The result: solar's footprint is 36.3 watts per square meter or 1 gigawatt per 10.6 square miles.These land-use figures are relevant because of the growing rural backlash against renewable-energy projects. For instance, while national media focused on protesters who gathered near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, to oppose Dakota Access, they ignored the recent rejection of a huge wind project located about 170 miles west of there.On Nov. 15, Billings County officials rejected the application for a 383-megawatt wind energy project that was to cover some 25,000 acres. Chief among their concerns was the project's visual impact, including the fact that some of the turbines would have been visible from inside Theodore Roosevelt National Park.In New York, three upstate counties — Erie, Orleans, and Niagara — as well as the towns of Yates and Somerset, are all fighting a proposed 200-megawatt project called Lighthouse Wind. In Vermont, about 160 towns and cities have signed the Rutland Resolution which calls for more local control over the siting of renewable-energy projects.Renewables are also hammering wildlife. Not only are wind turbines killing significant numbers of eagles and other birds, a recent study by scientists from the US Geological Survey have found that wind turbines are now the planet's largest killer of bats.For decades, a central tenet of environmentalism has been small footprints in everything from agriculture to urban planning. But now, in the name of climate change, environmentalism has been turned on its head. Rather than advocate for people, landscapes and wildlife, our biggest environmental groups are cheering for renewable energy schemes that disregard all three.In short, keeping it ""in the ground"" requires decimating much of what's above ground. That's a lousy trade.

1425,NOV,"A buy rating was reiterated on e-commerce platform provider Shopify (SHOP) by Rosenblatt Securities, which cited stronger-than-expected growth in online shopping during the holiday sales season.MasterCard (MC) forecast that online sales rose 19% vs. last holiday, while Customer Growth Partners forecasts that online sales rose 15%.""Both of these numbers were above any previous expectations and Shopify was prepared to take advantage of the upside,"" wrote Rosenblatt analyst Kirk Adams in a research note Tuesday.

1428,NOV,"For a lot of investors, 2016 ended with OK — but not spectacular — returns. The S&P 500 finished an often tumultuous year with a 12.48% gain through Dec. 29, including dividends. That beat its three-year average annual gain of 9.18%, but fell short of its five-year average yearly return of 14.67%, according to Morningstar Inc.Mutual fund industry bigwigs generally expect more gains in 2017. But it won't be as easy as it was in 2016, they caution.Rich Weiss, a senior portfolio manager on a team that oversees 20 American Century target-date, target-risk and asset-allocation funds, warns that the rally from early November through mid-December may have left less room for the market to rise in 2017. In December, many of his team's funds were taking year-end profits.Still, the Federal Reserve's hike in its key interest rate and upward moves in oil and gold prices last week as well as U.S. consumer confidence are harbingers of reflation — rising inflation, nominal growth and wages, said Richard Turnill, asset management mammoth BlackRock's (BLK) global chief investment strategist in a Tuesday commentary.The chief beneficiaries of reflation should be value stocks, especially U.S. regional banks, some health care stocks and companies able to expand their dividends, Turnill wrote.""We see earnings growth and further rotation into big sectors such as financials underpinning a U.S. stock market advance in 2017, but we are cautious in the near term after large inflows and new record highs,"" he wrote.Turnill also likes European and Japanese stocks going forward, in part because of weak currencies ""though we are wary of political, policy and trade risks in the eurozone,"" he said.In addition, he wrote, ""We favor emerging market equities, given structural reforms, improving profitability and low valuations.""Darrell Riley, a vice president in T. Rowe Price's asset allocation group, expects the stock market to gain ground again in 2017, but less than it advanced last year. ""A 6% total return is realistic,"" he said. ""Two percent from revenue growth, 1% from margin expansion, 1% from buybacks and 2% more from dividends.""Best Stock Mutual Funds Of 2016Riley cites factors that could fuel continued gains.

Energy funds were second best, sparking ahead 30%.Health care was the only sector to lose ground, sliding 10%.In fixed income, high-yield bond funds led the way with a 13% total return. Emerging-market debt funds were next, notching a 10% return.Overall, the year consisted of two phases. ""It was a tale of two markets: pre- and postelection,"" Weiss said. ""Before the election, the market was winding down, it was sluggish. Market leadership indicated we were heading into an economic slowdown, with defensive sectors leading.""But once investors began to expect Trump and Republican victories — starting shortly before the election — ""there was a rebound in the market, with renewed energy and optimism,"" Weiss said.Investors began to anticipate the benefits of tax cuts, less business regulation and repatriation of corporate cash held abroad. ""That all coincided with a strengthening in oil prices,"" Weiss said, buoyed by an OPEC deal to cut production and stabilization of Chinese economic growth.But don't expect the economy or the markets to trend upward without interruptions in 2017. ""We will see volatility amid risk,"" Aymeric Forest, head of global income for the multi-asset team of global asset manager Schroders. Forest cites geopolitical risks globally.In the U.S., ""the new administration, like every new administration, will make mistakes,"" said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.And eventually — maybe as early as 2017 — rising interest rates might could slow economic activity, Weiss says.Forest added, ""It will be important for investors to remain flexible to take advantage of opportunities, and they should take a multi-asset approach, especially in their search for income.""RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewHot Stocks That Made Craig Hodges A Top Fund ManagerSix Steps To Take Now With Your Personal Financial Action Plan

1429,NOV,"A new year renews hopes of stock market success for ETF investors and reminds them to beware of old, painful traps. As you draw up your investing action plan for 2017, some tips from pros may be helpful.But first, here is a look at the past year in exchange traded funds, because no look forward is complete without a look back.In a word, 2016 was a scorcher. Even the simplest, broadest and cheapest exposure to the stock market through ETFs paid off.Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTI), SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) and iShares MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI) advanced 12.8%, 12.0% and 8.4% last year, respectively.Best And Worst ETFs Of 2016The gains for SPY outpaced the approximately 10% average annualized return for the S&P 500 since 1926 — and were impressive given the sharp, repeated bouts of volatility in the stock markets.Even more impressive was the performance of specialized ETF strategies that investors seized to profit in 2016.PureFunds ISE Junior Silver (SILJ) ended the year with a 138.5% gain, despite a knock back in the final quarter. It is the best performer of 2016 among 1,763 nonleveraged ETFs.VanEck Russia Small-Cap (RSXJ) flew 103.7% higher, VanEck Vectors Fallen Angel High Yield Bond (ANGL) 25.7% and PowerShares DB Base Metals (DBB) 25.6%.With several ETFs outperforming across every major asset class — U.S. and foreign stocks, bonds and commodities — the industry itself kept up its hot growth streak.Total assets in U.S. exchange traded products stood at $2.455 trillion in November, up 16% from 2015 and more than double the level from five years ago, according to Morningstar data.Importantly, that asset growth was driven by net new inflow. Investors poured $224 billion in fresh money into U.S.-listed ETFs in 2016 through November.That, says Ben Johnson, Morningstar's director of global ETF research, is on track to be a record by the time 2016 closes out.Investors prize broadly diversified exposure to core and satellite segments of the financial markets. Investing in ETFs is a low-cost and tax-efficient way to get that exposure.As you prime your portfolio for the new year, bear in mind that the market and investment outlook is a lot different from years past.That's tied in large part to a change in the political regime. A Donald Trump presidency, coupled with a Republican-controlled congress, should translate to a more favorable business environment.Some industries and sectors are expected to benefit more than others from the likelihood of corporate tax cuts, less stringent regulations and more government spending. Think banks and insurers, oil and gas firms, and makers of heavy machinery and building products.It's not too late to ride the great rotation into the financial, materials and industrial sectors since the Nov. 8 election.Investors should keep the best opportunities within these broad sectors in mind as they make their financial plans, Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA, said on a recent webcast.In 2016 as a whole, and following the Nov. 8 election, ETFs with a smaller cap skew — such as Fidelity MSCI Industrials (FIDU) and SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense (XAR) — have edged out rivals with a larger cap skew — such as Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI) and PowerShares Aerospace & Defense (PPA).That trend could continue in a climate of stronger GDP numbers and rising interest rates.""Smaller-cap stocks generally are more sensitive to the U.S. economy,"" Rosenbluth told IBD. ""Since the election, optimism has improved for future growth.""For much of the past seven years, growth outpaced value. But in 2016, investors turned to inexpensive names.""This shift signals a clear risk-on tone by the market,"" strategists at State Street Global Advisors wrote recently. ""And that could continue if the Trump administration continues to strike a more pro-cyclical, pro-business tone.""The investment management firm tied the value comeback to investors' leeriness of scarce earnings growth and relatively high stock valuations.Some ETFs make their focus on value stocks self-evident — iShares Russell 1000 Value (IWD), iShares Edge MSCI USA Value Factor (VLUE) or Vanguard Value (VTV), for example.Their top holdings include household names such as Apple (AAPL), Exxon Mobil (XOM), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Pfizer (PFE) and AT&T (T).In other cases, such as iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor USA (LRGF) or SPDR MSCI USA StrategicFactors (QUS), the value bet is less obvious.Most dividend ETFs offer a value tilt, too, but not all may fare equally well in the reflationary environment ahead.High-dividend stocks will likely struggle amid rising rates, according to BlackRock strategists.On the other hand, quality companies that consistently grow their dividends should hold up better when yields rise, they added.These companies can be found in an ETF wrapper within iShares Core Dividend Growth (DGRO), ProShares Russell 2000 Dividend Growers (SMDV) and ProShares S&P MidCap 400 Dividend Aristocrats (REGL).SMDV and REGL jumped more than 30% apiece in 2016 to become the top diversified ETFs of 2016 in their respective categories.A total of 249 exchange traded products debuted in 2016 — the fourth highest total since 1993, according to Morningstar — proving to some that you can have too much of a good thing.Johnson, Morningstar's ETF guru, is a vocal critic of what he describes as the ""spaghetti cannon"" of very niche and increasingly complex ETFs being launched in the market.He notes with some satisfaction that 2016 was also a record year for ETF closures — approximately 114 by his count.""I would expect that as time goes on, that number will only continue to grow as a lot of the spaghetti that providers have been slinging against the wall in recent years ultimately fails to stick,"" he was quoted as saying recently.Happily, smart ETF investors ""aren't taking the bait"" of gimmicky new products, he added.As evidence, Johnson points to the fact that most of the new money is going into the lowest cost, most broadly diversified ETFs that serve as core portfolio building blocks.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewSmall-Cap Value ETFs Show Again Why They Are Darlings Of The Market

1431,NOV,"The infrastructure rally, the telecom rally, the oil rally and the bank rally.Those were some of the stock market trends that highlighted 2016, and each is reflected in the year's 100 best stocks.A chunk of the year's winners owe their success to the final two months of the year. Without the postelection rally, some of the stocks may not have made the list. The Nov. 8 election, which resulted in Republican control of the White House and Congress, sparked institutional investors to spend their capital on infrastructure stocks, financials and (for a time) pharmaceuticals.President-elect Donald Trump promised massive spending on roads, highways, airports and other public works projects. Banking executives cheered his criticism of regulation in the industry. Drug manufacturers were relieved that Hillary Clinton lost, only to watch in dismay a month later as Trump blasted high drug prices in much the same way Clinton had.A few biotechs made the top 100, and all were new issues in 2016 or went public within the past three years. In 2015, biotechs and other medicals dominated the year's top 100.Best Stocks Of 2016Banking stocks benefited from Trump's victory and a favorable trend in interest rates. Several regional banks made the 2016 winners list, but there could have been dozens more had they met the requirements for this list, which include a minimum price of 12 a share at the beginning of the year. Most regional banks are thinly traded.That gave rise to little-known leaders such as Independent Bank Group (IBTX) and Middleburg Financial (MBRG), which had their most productive breakouts in October.Heavy construction companies — sure to win more business in an infrastructure boom — saw their share of winners too. Argan (AGX) extended an already successful year with a breakout to new highs Nov. 14. Mastec (MTZ) broke out the day after the election and soared as much as 31% from its buy point.Put steel makers in that mix as well: Steel Dynamics (STLD) and Schnitzer Steel (SCHN) saw noticeable improvement in their stock performance after the election. The industry may end up benefiting from trade tariffs.July saw the start of a rally in telecom stocks, as talk of a supercycle of upgrades in high-speed network communications swept through the industry. Finisar (FNSR) and Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT) are symbols of that trend, which has cooled off.Despite losing about half its value since a Sept. 7 peak, Acacia Communications (ACIA) is still ending the year nearly three times higher than the 23 price of its initial public offering on May 13.As oil prices rebounded in 2016, so did the beaten-up energy sector. About a dozen oil stocks are in today's list, more than any other sector. Continental Resources (CLR), Chart Industries (GTLS) and Unit Corp. (UNT) were some energy stocks that kept a fairly steady advance throughout the year.While industry trends underscore the success of the Top 100 stocks, bear in mind that only a few from each sector made it to the list. Indeed, that shows the value of good stock-picking skills. The history of market winners is laden with examples of companies that excelled in their groups.For a lot of stocks, the price run-ups coincided with improvement in earnings. Some went from declines back to gains. Poor performance had hurt their EPS Ratings, and that's one reason why they didn't show up in IBD screens until late in the year, if at all.Nvidia (NVDA) is a good example of finding the best an industry can offer. Known best for computer graphics technology, Nvidia was discussed in IBD 50 coverage on Feb. 22, while the stock was forming a base with a 34.04 buy point. The company's sterling fundamentals caused Nvidia's inclusion on the list.The stock was already on its way to 2016 glory, more than doubling in the first 10 months of the year. But then, a strong earnings report Nov. 11 sparked a burst that sent the stock up 77% more.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewApple, Broadcom, Nvidia Among RBC's Top Stock Picks For 2017Can Trump Revive Reagan's Stock-Market Magic?

1434,NOV,"Weight Watchers International's (WTW) stock is getting another boost from the falling weight of Oprah Winfrey, the company's backer and most famous customer.Shares climbed as much as 19% Thursday after Winfrey announced she'd lost 40 pounds using the program. The diet company, whose shares had fallen 54% this year before Thursday's surge, is unveiling new TV ads featuring Winfrey that tout her weight loss. The media magnate and talk-show veteran became a centerpiece of Weight Watcher's comeback plan last year when she bought a stake in the company and joined the board.In October 2015, when Weight Watchers first announced its deal with Winfrey, the shares more than doubled in a single day. Though the previous rally has faded, Winfrey's subsequent endorsements of Weight Watchers have given the stock temporary jolts.The shares gained 27% over two days last December when Oprah tweeted a video about using the weight-loss program, and there was a 20% bump in January after Winfrey said she had lost 26 pounds while still eating bread every day.The latest marketing push begins next week, just before the New Year's holiday. The coming weeks are critical for Weight Watchers, as the company typically adds about 40% of new customers in the first quarter, when resolutions push people to seek out diets.The stock climbed as high as $12.50 on Thursday, its biggest intraday gain since Nov. 4.Weight Watchers has been hit hard by the rise of free fitness apps, and a move away from strict calorie counting among dieters. But Winfrey's wide-ranging influence has brought new life to the brand. Weight Watchers has added subscribers for three straight quarters after years of declines.The New York-based company hopes that Winfrey's new ads, which emphasize that she still enjoys pasta and tacos, will convince dieters that its updated program is an effective weight-loss tool.""It's vitally important that Oprah is living the program and articulating it in a way that's authentic,"" said Maurice Herrera, the head of marketing at Weight Watchers. ""It really connects with prospective members.""Despite the subscriber gains, it's been a rocky year for Weight Watchers.The company has billions in debt, and its stock is heavily shorted. In September, Chief Executive Jim Chambers announced he was leaving after about three years at the helm. That sent the shares plummeting to their lowest level in nearly a year.Chambers had been working to turn around the company, an effort that included revamping its nutrition program and adding a social-networking component to its app. Now, Weight Watchers is being run by a trio of executives who constitute the ""interim office of the CEO.""The ads rolling out next week show Winfrey doing yoga and cooking pasta. As consumers have changed their perception of wellness, Weight Watchers has pivoted to emphasize that weight loss and indulgence aren't necessarily mutually exclusive. Winfrey will hammer that message home, Herrera said.""People want to know what's on her mind and how she's living her life,"" he said. ""This will definitely get people's attention.""

1435,NOV,"President-elect Trump has promised action on high drug prices, but prospects of government taking control of drug pricing ""has largely subsided"" thanks to Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton, Needham said in an bullish research report Thursday on the specialty pharma sector.Furthermore, Trump's stated plans to lower corporate taxes and lessen the tax burden of U.S. companies looking to bring cash back to the U.S. should spark drug industry M&A, Needham analyst Serge Belanger wrote in his research report.Belanger named ACAD Pharmaceuticals (ACAD) and tiny Corium International (CORI) at the top picks in his specialty pharma coverage area.In an interview with Time early this month, when he was named the magazine's Man of the Year, Trump gave his most definitive statements yet on the long-simmering issue of escalating drug prices. ""I'm going to bring down drug prices,"" he told Time. ""I don't like what has happened with drug prices.""IBD'S TAKE: Drug stocks haven't been booming, but see which health care-industry related companies make the latest IBD 50 ranking of stocks that have performed the best in the past 52 weeks, with an emphasis on the most recent six months.The comments hurt drug stocks. But while drug pricing will remain an issue, Trump didn't expand on those comments in that interview or subsequently, Belanger told IBD via email, after we asked if the analyst could amplify on his report.""Even with Trump's comments, the idea of the federal government negotiating drug prices rather than insurers seems far-fetched now,"" Belander said in his email. ""We assume that pricing scrutiny of generic and old drugs will continue — PBM/payers (pharmacy benefit managers and health insurers) have been active in this area.""But while ""there had previously been talk from the Democrats of having Medicare and other agencies negotiate their own drug prices much like the VA and Medicaid do now ... pricing control of newly approved drugs seems less of an issue now with Republicans having across-the-board control.""Mylan (MYL) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) are among the few companies that have received the most heat from consumers and lawmakers for escalating drug prices.The Justice Department is investigating possible price collusion among makers of generic drugs, with companies such as Mylan, Allergan (AGN), Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Endo International (ENDP) among those being investigated.In its first charges in that investigation, the DOJ this month charged former Heritage Pharmaceuticals CEO Jeffrey Glazer and President Jason Malek with felony counts related to conspiring to fix prices for a diabetes drug and an antibiotic drug.The next day, the attorneys general of 20 states sued Mylan, Teva, Heritage and three other drugmakers on price-fixing allegations.Besides less threat of drastic drug-price actions, Belanger sees a much-improved climate for mergers and acquisitions in the sector.""Drivers of increased M&A activity for 2017 and beyond are likely to be some of the proposed tax policy changes of the new

Shares had been forming a flat base, with a buy point of 82.83.""Weak fiscal Q3 results were attributed to slipped U.S. government deals, lower upfront payments for large multiyear deals and a more back-end-loaded period,"" said John DiFucci, a Jefferies analyst, in his research report. ""The reasoning was somewhat difficult to follow and does little to explain the weak fiscal Q4 guidance, other than assuming another more back-end-loaded quarter than usual.""IBD'S TAKE: There's a dearth of computer software stocks in the IBD 50 roster of growth stocks. But chipmaker Nvidia leads the IBD 50. Check out what other semiconductor, optical and wireless companies make the current ranking of top-performing stocks.Red Hat late Wednesday said earnings per share minus items rose 27% to 61 cents from the year-earlier quarter, topping Wall Street consensus estimates of 58 cents. Revenue for the quarter ended Nov. 30 rose 17% to $615 million, missing consensus estimates of $621.7 million.For the current quarter, Red Hat forecast EPS of 61 cents, in-line with views. Red Hat said it expects revenue of $618 million at the midpoint of its guidance — well below consensus estimates of $637.7 million, as polled by Thomson Reuters.Still, RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg maintained his a buy rating.""We'd buy the stock on weakness as billings should accelerate into Q4,"" he wrote in a report. ""Further, we continue to expect margin improvement in fiscal 2018.""Red Hat's Linux software runs computer servers in corporate data centers. Red Hat aims to sell customers a broader set of software for managing application servers and data storage.The company's biggest revenue generator is Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).The company also said that CFO Frank Calderoni would be stepping down in late January to enable him to accept a CEO position at another company. The company will appoint Eric Shander acting CFO. He's vice president of finance and accounting and principal accounting officer.Analysts were lowering their outlooks to account for Red Hat's disappointing guidance.""We are lowering our fiscal 2018 billings growth estimate from 13.2% to 10.5%, and lowering our FCF (free cash flow) estimate from $842 million to $784 million,"" said Keith Bachman, a BMO Capital Markets analyst, in a report. ""Given changes to our top-line and FCF estimates, we are lowering our target price from 89 to 75.""Even with improved billings growth in Q4 from the closing of delayed deals, we believe that questions on billings growth in 2018 will keep the stock range-bound.""Needham analyst Scott Zeller lowered his price target on Red Hat stock to 89 from 98. He cited the disappointing billings due to customers hesitating to pay upfront for multiyear deals and ""slipped"" federal deals. ""We believe cash-conservation behavior is driven by macro uncertainty at the moment,"" he wrote in his report.But large-size sales were positive, analysts pointed out.Jason Ader, analyst at William Blair, said in a report: ""On the bright side, large deal momentum remained strong, with 73 deals greater than $1 million, up 20% year over year,"" William Blair analyst Jason Ader wrote in his research note.

1438,NOV,"Japanese electronics company TDK said Wednesday that it plans to buy motion-sensing chipmaker InvenSense (INVN) for $1.3 billion to pursue new opportunities in sensors for automobiles and internet-connected devices.TDK said the all-cash deal will strengthen its position as a major player in sensor systems.TDK will pay $13 a share for InvenSense, which is a 20% premium to its closing price on Tuesday and 52% premium to its 60-day volume-weighted average trading price. TDK expects to complete the acquisition in the second quarter of its fiscal year ending March 31, 2018.InvenSense stock was up 17.6% to 12.75 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: InvenSense has been a laggard of late among semiconductor stocks. It is not among the eight chip stocks on the IBD 50 list of top growth companies.The transaction will combine inertial, pressure, microphone and ultrasonic wave sensor technologies from InvenSense with TDK's pressure, temperature, electric current and other sensors.San Jose, Calif.-based InvenSense is best known as a provider of motion sensors for smartphone makers, including Apple (AAPL) and Samsung. It also makes sensors for wearables, game devices, cameras and drones.TDK plans to pursue sensor fusion, the combination of multiple sensor technologies and software for advanced products.""Our strategic goals are aligned, and we are confident that together with TDK we will accelerate our roadmap to provide next-generation sensor technologies in key fields for the world's most innovative companies,"" InvenSense CEO Behrooz Abdi said in a statement.The TDK-InvenSense deal is the latest in a flurry of chip M&A activity this year.On Nov. 21, Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) announced plans to buy Applied Micro Circuits (AMCC) for $770 million.On Nov. 2, Broadcom (AVGO) announced a deal to acquire Brocade Communications Systems (BRCD) for $5.9 billion.On Oct. 27, Qualcomm (QCOM) announced plans to buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) for $39 billion in the largest semiconductor M&A deal ever.RELATED:Nvidia Soars To Record High On Big Price-Target HikeApplied Materials Downgraded; 3 Other Chip Gear Makers Rated Buy3 Chip Companies Named Top M&A Targets In 2017

Insiders said the firm upped its bid on Actelion to $250 per share, valuing Actelion north of $27 billion, in an attempt to secure the deal before Christmas.At the time, insiders said French Sanofi was mulling a bid and had informally let Actelion know of its interest.

1440,NOV,"At a time when banks from Goldman Sachs Group (GS) to Societe Generale are predicting that the global copper market is about to tighten, a 62% surge in stocks on the London Metal Exchange is a reminder of the oversupply that the industry has faced in recent years.The six-day streak of deliveries, which ended Monday with the largest one-day inflow since at least 1994, has weighed on prices and supported less optimistic forecasters who say that a rally that began in November isn't supported by fundamentals.""Copper inflows into the LME between Dec. 12 and 19 have certainly dented some of the early December copper optimism,"" said David Wilson, director of metals research and strategy at Citigroup (C) in London.The rally in copper prices in November was underpinned by signs of a rebound in Chinese demand and bets that U.S. infrastructure spending and economic output will increase when Donald Trump takes office. The surprise election result also prompted investors to buy up hard assets as a hedge against inflation and continued dollar strength.That momentum was lost as LME stockpiles jumped, bringing prices to one-month lows this week. Copper fell 1.6% to $5,419.50 a ton on Thursday, the lowest since Nov. 18, and is down 9.2% from this month's high on Dec. 5.But a closer look at LME inventories reveals a complicated set of supply and demand conditions. Throughout the year, an unprecedented volume of copper has been delivered on to the exchange, but it has been canceled almost as quickly as it has arrived. The result is a 'noisy' snapshot of the global copper market, London-based Societe Generale analyst Robin Bhar said by phone.To make sense of what's been happening, it helps to look at the market for copper concentrates, the semi-processed ore used to make the refined cathode that's been piling up on the LME.Following a surge in mine supply, copper concentrate imports into China have risen sharply as smelters there have taken advantage of an increase in the fees they charge to turn concentrates into metal.But as they've boosted production, the glut in concentrates has slowly fed through into the refined market, putting pressure on local premiums for copper cathode and causing imports of finished metal to slow. China may be the world's largest consumer of copper, but at certain points this year some smelters have found it more profitable to sell cathode to traders in the international market rather than domestic customers.By taking advantage of cheap freight, storage incentives, low financing costs and a ""contango,"" or increase, in the forward price curve on the LME — a market structure where prices are cheaper today than they are in the future — traders can break even or turn a small profit by storing the metal in private warehouses while they wait for demand conditions to improve.That hasn't been the only trade in town this year, however. Other merchants have also been buying up exchange stocks to deliver to contractual customers in China. In doing so, they have complicated the efforts of rival traders trying to profit from storing metal, as buying stock from the LME has caused the forward price curve to go from contango to a more negative ""backwardation"" frequently this year.In the process, the profitability of storing metal has periodically broken down. As the losses have become too large to bear, traders holding stock in private warehouses have chosen to deliver it on to the LME to eliminate their exposure. In this way, the competing ambitions of rival trading houses have created a carousel-like churn in LME copper stocks.What the deliveries show is that the market is still dealing with the ""wall of supply"" that arrived in recent years, but anyone taking a bearish view on copper after seeing stocks rise would be getting the market ""seriously wrong,"" Bhar said on Tuesday.In the concentrates markets, there is evidence that the oversupply that has caused stocks to swell may be coming to an end. Treatment and refining charges have fallen under benchmark contracts for next year and are also sliding rapidly in the spot market, threatening the fragile economics that have contributed to the dramatic movements in copper stocks this year.""Traders will always play these types of games,"" Bhar said. ""The job of analysts is to try to look through the muddied waters and discern an overall trend. For me, the trend is still positive.""

Aging baby boomers have entered the market on the high-end offerings while families and nature lovers have helped grow things on the lower end. Having enough labor supply to keep up with product demand is seen as one of the biggest challenges ahead.But what does the chart say? The most recent consolidation was a short cup-shaped base that saw a low-volume breakout Nov. 17. Low-volume breakouts are suspect, but increasing volume on the right side of the cup did show signs of some institutional involvement in the buying. Another factor that would have made the trade tricky is that earnings were just a week away. If shares were still bought, at least a cushion of around 5% would have been made before the earnings report.The company beat earnings estimates by more than 20%, sending the stock up by more than 12% in the next trading session. That quickly put shares in the 20% profit-taking range from the recent breakout in less than four weeks, just shy of the eight-week hold rule when gains of that magnitude are made in three weeks or less. This rule hasn't been used as frequently in recent years because the market's short rallies and shallow corrections have made holding more difficult.In this case, when Thor hit the 20% profit level, selling to lock down the profits would have been justified. It is often observed that after moves of 20% to 25%, stocks tend to base again, as it looks like Thor is currently doing. By locking in the profit, you avoid the risk of holding onto dead money while the stock consolidates, or worse, subjecting yourself to a correction that wipes out your profits.If Thor truly does have more miles to go, the current consolidation could be merely a pit stop. Once it's all gassed up, you can always buy the stock back and get back on the road.

1444,NOV,"Like the proverbial dog who just caught the car he's been chasing, Republicans are about to gain control of ObamaCare's fate, but with no clear idea what to do with it — or how to bury it.The GOP says that it will take several years to put what would inevitably be called TrumpCare in place, but they don't want the responsibility for overseeing and enforcing ObamaCare — individual mandate and all — in the interim.Republicans have settled on what might be called a hurry-up-and-wait solution to this awkward spot they're in: Repeal ObamaCare as soon as January but wait to sunset most of its provisions until perhaps 2020. Yet a range of policy experts, including some Republicans, and health care industry players have warned that repealing the law without simultaneously replacing it could blow up the individual insurance market operating under ObamaCare rules.After a repeal vote, even if the GOP were to keep the individual mandate, relatively young and healthy people may be even less likely to sign up for coverage. Under such conditions, health insurers which have already grown weary of taking it on the chin in the ObamaCare exchanges might not stick around. UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) already are exiting most of the ObamaCare markets where they did business in 2016. Anthem (ANTM) has warned that it might do the same.The risk is that large swathes of the country could find themselves with zero individual market insurers in 2018. That would be an emergency, which might prompt the government to try and fill those gaps by essentially bribing insurers to offer coverage or perhaps temporarily removing income limits for Medicaid.IBD'S TAKE: Read why UnitedHealth is fast becoming the Amazon of health care and why it isn't sweating forthcoming policy changes under Donald Trump.There are two apparent motivating factors behind the GOP repeal-now strategy: 1) Republicans can claim to have done something substantive for those who oppose the law; and 2) They can justify a vote to cut some ObamaCare taxes immediately, including  a 3.8% tax on investment income.With a 52-48 majority, Republicans would need to keep all but two senators on board to repeal ObamaCare provisions through a procedure known as reconciliation that is limited to tax and spending measures. That means many of ObamaCare's key provisions, such as those guaranteeing coverage to everyone at a price unrelated to health status, would stay in place until there's a bipartisan consensus to get rid of them.At least two Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, have said the GOP should have a replacement plan lined up before repeal, so there's some possibility that a repeal of ObamaCare's major tax and spending provisions won't make it to Donald Trump's desk.Repealing the Medicaid expansion, which provided coverage up to 138% of the poverty level, would be more straightforward to do through reconciliation. The GOP has long sought to deliver Medicaid funding to states in the form of block grants that provide greater flexibility but which are likely to increase at a rate below health care inflation to curb government spending.Hospitals were already in a bad place before the election, but the outlook is even bleaker now. IBD's Medical-Hospitals industry group is ranked No. 195 out of 197 based on price performance, trailed only by gold and solar power.Outright appeal of the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion and individual market subsidies could cost hospitals $400 billion in revenue and $165.8 billion in income over the coming decade, an analysis for the Federation of American Hospitals and American Hospital Association found.Yet Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick, who downgraded Tenet Healthcare (THC) to underperform on Nov. 21, has warned of further downside for hospitals from Medicaid block grants that push states from traditional fee-for-service Medicaid into adopting Medicaid managed care programs. Skolnick estimates that hospitals get 48% less in revenue per patient from Medicaid managed care than fee for service. Likewise, she says, Medicare Advantage pays 17% less per patient than traditional Medicare, suggesting more downside if Republicans turn Medicare into a premium-support program as House Speaker Paul Ryan has advocated. Health insurers, on the other hand, might stand to gain from GOP-style Medicaid and Medicare reform, which could bring an influx of new customers.RELATED:The Only Way For TrumpCare To Be 'Terrific'

1451,NOV,"Data from No. 1 biotech Amgen's (AMGN) LDL-busting drug could boost Regeneron (REGN) in 2017, but disappoint the too-high expectations of Amgen investors, Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young said Tuesday.Young upgraded Regeneron stock to an outperform rating and upped her price target to 485 from 481, citing the April launch of dupixent, an eczema drug with Sanofi (SNY). But PCSK9 data from top rival Amgen due in Q1 also could also be a catalyst for Regeneron's own PCSK9 drug, she wrote in a research report.Amgen investors, however, have set their expectations too high on Repatha, Amgen's PCSK9 inhibitor, following successful data from a study in September, she said. In that coronary intravascular imaging trial, Repatha met its primary and secondary endpoints in coronary artery disease.""We still see some upside into Repatha outcomes data in 1Q17,"" she wrote in a research note. ""We think the risk/reward is unfavorable since expectations are pretty high after success of the GLAGOV study.""IBD'S TAKE: Will Trump break with Republicans to pressure drug prices? It's looking more and more likely he will. Will biotechs survive the political pressure?Young downgraded Amgen stock to a neutral rating and cut her price target to 180 from 200. She sees Amgen's base business — rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel — becoming weaker and trimmed her total product-sales view by $670 million.Enbrel sales came in flat in Q3 at $1.45 billion amid contract negotiations. Next year, Enbrel sales will be driven on volume rather than net selling price, the company said on its Q3 earnings conference call with analysts. Though the company upped its 2016 guidance at that time.Celgene (CELG) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) top Young's 2017 biotech watchlist. She is cautious on 2017 in general, however, given comments from President-elect Donald Trump that he will go after escalating drug prices. In the six weeks following his election, biotech and drug stocks have nearly round-tripped, first rising and then falling.IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group hit a six-week high on Nov. 14 after Trump's election, but is down 9% since then. Still, shares remain 5% above their close on Nov. 8, rising 0.85% in the stock market today. Amgen stock fell 0.35% Tuesday to 147.22, while Regeneron stock slipped 0.20% to 371.02.""We don't expect drug pricing chatter to moderate, especially considering comments already made by the president-elect,"" Young wrote.

""FireEye was called in to protect the Clinton Foundation this past summer, while private company Crowdstrike was hired by the Democratic National Committee after it was hacked.""IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia tops the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks,  which now includes more nontech companies and no software security providers.IBD's 25-company Computer-Software Security group ranks just No. 166 out of 197 industry groups, as it's been a down year for many of the companies after a big 2015.After a slew of high-profile data breaches in 2013-14, many companies rushed to upgrade firewalls that sit between private networks and the internet and invested in threat detection technologies. That uptick in crisis spending drove security software stocks to fresh highs in mid-2015.

1453,NOV," Two months ago, the liberal media erupted in horror after the third presidential debate. Fox's Chris Wallace challenged Donald Trump on whether he would accept the result of the election, and Trump said he would wait and see. NBC described a ""flood of condemnation"" and cited President Obama accusing Trump of ""(undermining) our democracy."" ""Today"" co-host Savannah Guthrie called it an ""earthquake.""Guthrie turned to retired anchorman Tom Brokaw to denounce Trump. He said: ""This is not a banana republic. We've got more than 200 years of presidential elections and graceful and peaceful transitions to the new administration. As you saw, even Richard Nixon, Al Gore, the people who were caught up in very close races, said, 'I accept that this is the new president.' ""Trump won the election handily with 304 electoral votes, and Democrats flip-flopped, sullenly refusing to accept the results. And so did the ""objective"" media. On Dec. 18, there was no ""earthquake"" at NBC when Hillary Clinton aide John Podesta refused to say that President-elect Trump won a free and fair election. He said instead that it was rigged by the Russians.And it was the ballot errors. And FBI Director James Comey. And the fake news epidemic. And the Constitution — that  blasted Electoral College! Nobody brought in Brokaw to lecture Team Hillary about banana-republic behavior.Back in October, The New York Times issued a front-page alert, saying, ""In a remarkable statement that seemed to cast doubt on American democracy, Donald J. Trump said Wednesday that he might not accept the results of next month's election if he felt it was rigged against him — a stand that Hillary Clinton blasted as 'horrifying' at their final and caustic debate on Wednesday.""Two months later, the Times was eagerly giving oxygen to any protest against Trump, no matter how fanatical. It said: ""In Florida, protesters swarmed the Capitol rotunda, one hoisting a 'Trump Is Too Rusky' sign featuring a hammer and sickle. In Wisconsin's statehouse, a heckler shouted, ''We're all going to go to war and die thanks to you.'""This was somehow democracy in action. There was no remarkable or horrifying adjective at the top of the story. Instead, the Times turned to Adam Jentleson, a top aide to retiring Sen. Harry Reid, who warned, ""There's not going to be a grace period this time because everybody on our side thinks he's illegitimate and poses a massive threat.""Even the leftist late-night comedians showed the double standard. CBS ""Late Show"" host Stephen Colbert mocked Trump in October, saying: ""Oh, suspense! Democracy's going to end in a cliffhanger! I guess we're all going to have to wait until Nov. 9 to find out if we still have a country — if Donald Trump is the mood for a peaceful transfer of power or if he's just going to wipe his fat a-- with the Constitution.""After the election, Colbert said: ""Walking around the streets of New York today, a lot of people (were) a little rough. You know, you could see it in their eyes. ... This is what it feels like when America's made great again."" The crowd laughed. He continued: ""And I was really hoping it would feel better because this sucks! And I don't know if you guys had any trouble getting in here tonight because right now, tonight, thousands of people have taken to the streets in protests in cities all over America.""Colbert told his audience to accept President Trump (how noble). But the protesters still drew screams and hearty applause. Somehow they weren't fat dictators using the Constitution as toilet paper.The Times insisted on Monday that ""the uneasiness with Mr. Trump has hardly receded in the nearly six weeks since his election."" That is because the press will not stop agitating, and all the while they call it ""news.""That, folks, is also ""fake news.""

1455,NOV,"Barely one in five millennials and Gen Xers is investing enough in stocks, stock mutual funds and stock ETFs, according to a new survey from the TransAmerica Center for Retirement Studies (TCRS).Only 21% of millennials and Gen Xers are invested mostly or entirely in stocks, which is the appropriate asset allocation for most workers in their age groups.The rest are investing so conservatively that they are wasting precious time and money. Based on historical rates of return, they are crimping the size of their retirement nest eggs.IBD'S TAKE: Use of stocks and stock mutual funds isn't the only way that millennial and baby boomers investors differ. Millennials are also more bullish about the prospects for a bull market. See how a stock like Nike is contributing to the market's current run in this IBD report.The better news is that there are specific steps that young workers can take to boost the growth of their retirement accounts, says Catherine Collinson, president of TCRS.And many baby boomers should listen up too. Many of them are also investing in assets that do not tend to grow as fast as stocks. For people who expect to live 20 to 30 years in retirement, that puts their retirement savings at risk of losing purchasing power over time if their balances don't outgrow inflation.While just 21% of millennials and Gen Xers are heavily invested in stocks, 54% of millennials and 57% of Gen Xers have invested roughly half their retirement accounts in slow-growth bonds and other assets. Many are mainly or entirely in bonds and stable-value assets like cash.""That pattern is of great concern to us,"" Collinson said. ""The conventional wisdom is certainly that younger people — people in those two generational groups — who have a longer time horizon and a (greater) risk tolerance than someone nearing retirement should be invested more in stocks.""Among baby boomers, only 15% are invested mostly or entirely in stocks.The survey did not specifically try to learn the workers' reasons for investing conservatively, but Collinson thinks she knows why.""Anecdotally, we hear that many younger people are afraid of the stock market,"" she said. ""Many entered the workforce around the time of the big market decline in 2009. The impact on the economy and stocks was terrifying.""In addition, many lived with their parents for years after college and witnessed the impact up close on their parents' retirement savings. ""Those things have made equity markets scary for them,"" Collinson said.So how can millennials, Gen Xers and baby boomers do better with their retirement portfolios? Here are several steps:How much do stocks outperform bonds and cash? By a lot. From 1926 through Nov. 30 of this year, U.S. large cap stocks averaged a 10% yearly gain and U.S. small caps notched a 12.08% annual advance, according to Morningstar Inc. In contrast, long-term corporate bonds barely did half as well, scoring a meager 6% annual gain. Cash advanced at a snail's pace, averaging a 3.39% annual return.RELATED:What 71% Of Millennial Investors Believe Vs. 50% Of Baby BoomersMarriage And Money: Key Differences Between Millennials And Boomers

1456,NOV,"Oil rose to a 17-month high Tuesday as the market shifted focus from output cuts by OPEC and other nations to the global supply balance in 2017.Futures rose 0.3% in New York after surging 2.6% Monday when Saudi Arabia signaled it may cut more than initially agreed and 11 non-OPEC producers also committed to a reduction. That prompted the International Energy Agency to predict U.S. shale output will rise next year, while the oil glut will disappear and global markets will become undersupplied in the first half of 2017. Investors boosted bullish crude bets in the run-up to the Nov. 30 deal.""These cuts move the market from surplus into deficit,"" Andrew Slaughter, executive director at the Deloitte Center for Energy Solutions in Houston, said by phone. ""These cuts will eat into the inventory overhang. How fast this happens depends on how much of a cut OPEC delivers.""Oil has risen about 17% since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed Nov. 30 to trim output for the first time in eight years. The subsequent deal reached last weekend with nonmembers encompasses countries that produce about 60% of the world's crude. The price rally has led to predictions of a production revival in the U.S., where shale output from seven fields may increase next month, a report showed.West Texas intermediate oil for January delivery rose 15 cents to settle at $52.98 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It's the highest close since July 14, 2015. Total volume traded was about 17% above the 100-day average.Brent for February settlement increased 3 cents to $55.72 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, closing at a $1.78 premium to WTI for the same month. The global benchmark crude also closed at the highest level since July 2015.""I think $50 to $60 crude is here to stay,"" said Rob Thummel, a managing director and portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors in Leawood, Kan., who helps manage $15.5 billion. ""It's a sweet spot that will lead to adequate rates of demand growth while spurring enough production.""The Federal Reserve began a two-day policy meeting Tuesday that's projected to result in an interest-rate hike Wednesday.""All of the markets are focused on the Fed right now,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. ""There are doubts about how closely OPEC will adhere to its targets. History doesn't favor them when it comes to this matter.""Global oil stockpiles will decline by about 600,000 barrels a day in the next six months as curbs by OPEC and its partners take effect, said the IEA, which had previously assumed inventories wouldn't drop until the end of 2017.U.S. crude inventories probably shrank by 1.5 million barrels last week for a fourth straight decline, according to the Bloomberg survey before an Energy Information Administration report on Wednesday. Supplies remain at the highest seasonal level in weekly data compiled by the EIA since 1982.""The financial flows into crude after the OPEC and non-OPEC agreement have left a lot of froth in the market,"" said Ed Morse, head of commodity research at Citigroup. ""The higher the price goes and the faster it happens, the higher and faster production of U.S. shale goes up.""

1459,NOV,"Tesaro (TSRO) won priority review from the Food and Drug Administration for ovarian cancer medication's New Drug Application. That came a day after the FDA approved an ovarian cancer drug from Clovis Oncology (CLVS).Tesaro stock advanced 7.3% to 136.47 on the stock market today, after hitting a record high of 148.74 on Nov. 14. Tesaro stock is getting support at its 50-day moving average.Clovis stock rose 5% Tuesday to 42.49, above a 40.39 buy point first cleared on Dec. 6. On Monday, Clovis leapt 8.8% to 40.48, surging more than 20% intraday, after the FDA gave accelerated approval to rucaparib, which will be marketed under the brand name Rubraca.AstraZeneca (AZN) rose 0.26%, but has been trading below its declining 50-day line since late September. AstraZeneca's drug, Lynparza, was approved to treat some forms of ovarian cancer in 2014. IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks have nearly round-tripped a rally following Donald Trump's election on recent commentary from the president-elect that he will bring down drug prices. Will Trump follow through on his pledge?Tesaro's niraparib is being investigated as a treatment for recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer following platinum-based chemotherapy. It has a Prescription Drug Free User Act (PDUFA) date of June 30.In a phase 3 trial, niraparib extended progression-free survival (PFS) to a median 21 months vs. 5.5 months in the control arm for patients with the BRCA mutation associated with breast cancer. In the non-BRCA group, the median PFS was 9.3 months vs. 3.9 months for patients in the control arm.An Expanded Access Program (EAP) for niraparib is planned for January. It will open up niraparib to ovarian cancer patients who wouldn't otherwise be eligible for a clinical trial.Niraparib, like Lynparza and Rubraca, belong to a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors. Poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) are enzymes used to repair damaged DNA. Companies like Tesaro, Clovis and AstraZeneca are investigating whether inhibiting those enzymes could help treat certain cancers.RELATED:Tesaro Bolts On Ovarian Cancer Win Vs.

1460,NOV,"Red Hat's (RHT) fiscal Q3 earnings, to be posted after the close Wednesday, are expected to be among its best in more than a year.Analysts expected earnings per share minus items of 58 cents, up 21% from the year-earlier quarter and matching its biggest percentage gain in six quarters. Revenue for the quarter ended on or near Nov. 30 is expected to be $621.7 million, up 19% and matching its biggest growth for the past nine quarters.For the current quarter, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the No. 1 provider of open-source Linux software to post 17% EPS ex items growth, to 61 cents, on 17% growth in sales, to $637.7 million.IBD'S TAKE: Software stocks are lacking in the IBD 50 roster of growth stocks, while semiconductor, optical and wireless gear firms are well represented. Red Hat stock fell 1.3% to 79.39 in the stock market today. Shares are down 4% in 2016. Red Hat has the highest Composite Rating of the eight companies in IBD's Computer-Software Desktop group, but the group ranks only No. 144 out of 197 industry groups. Microsoft (MSFT) and Adobe Systems (ADBE) also belong to the group.Red Hat stock is trading above its 50-day moving average, with a buy point of 82.83 from a flat base.Red Hat's Linux software runs computer servers in corporate data centers. Analysts are looking for traction in Red Hat's public cloud business as customers shift computing workloads to cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN) and a Red Hat partner.Red Hat took part in the late-November AWS re: Invent developers conference, noted Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard in a research report.""Post-AWS re: Invent, we come away believing that Red Hat's role in the public cloud is secure medium term, and we expect management will continue to bring evidence that large cloud adopters are purchasing more on-premises,"" Pritchard wrote.The company's biggest revenue generator is Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Red Hat aims to sell customers a broader set of software for managing application servers and data storage.Red Hat's cloud revenue mainly comes from customers using RHEL software on a ""pay as you go,"" or software-as-a-service, basis.RELATED:As Networks Speed Up, Arista Gains Ground On Giant CiscoMicrosoft Stock Gets Price-Target Hike As Cloud Bets Pay OffRed Hat Fiscal Q2 Earnings, Q3 Guidance Top Views, Stock Rises

1461,NOV,"Gold prices slid 2.9% on Thursday to a 10-month low while silver prices crashed 7% as markets continued to react to the Federal Reserve's more hawkish policy outlook for 2017 amid President-elect Donald Trump's plan to step on the fiscal accelerator.While hiking its key interest rate a quarter-point on Wednesday, as expected, Fed policymakers signaled a likelihood of three more rate hikes in coming year vs. the two 2017 hikes telegraphed in September.Fed intentions helped lift the U.S. dollar index to the highest level since January 2003, a negative for gold, which is priced in dollars and whose safe-haven demand as a store of value is being tarnished by a stronger dollar and improving growth. The Spdr Gold Trust ETF (GLD) fell 1%, setting a 10-month low.Shares of gold miners including Barrick Gold (ABX), Royal Gold (RGLD) and Newmont Mining (NEM) have been among the biggest laggards in the Trump rally. The IBD Mining-Gold/Silver/Gems group is rated 194 out of 197 industry groups based on stock price performance.On the stock market today, Barrick lost 5%, hitting a multimonth low intraday after sliding 6.4% on Wednesday. Royal Gold gave up 6%, on the heels of Wednesday's 4.0% decline. Newmont shares sank 2.4% on Thursday after skidding 6.5% a day earlier.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Freeport McMoRan, one of the world's largest copper mining companies and among the best ways to play the copper rally, cleared a buy point at 13.69 on Nov. 10 and quickly became extended, surging 21% in two weeks. The stock has pulled back, but is worth keeping on your watch list. Visit IBD Leaderboard to keep track of leading stocks like Freeport and others nearing a buy point.Silver Wheaton (SLW), which owns rights to gold and silver production at various mines, tumbled 8.8% after Wednesday's 3% skid.""Investors might conclude that even with higher rates looming for 2017, U.S. equities will remain the asset class of choice for most,"" wrote INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir.Investors looking for a safe store of value in this climate may have reason to turn to other metals — those with more industrial applications. IBD's Mining-Metal Ores group has been among the biggest winners of the Trump rally, helped in part by his agenda for an infrastructure-spending binge.Since Nov. 8, gold prices have fallen close to 12%, while copper is up about 9%, though copper prices had been firming before the election on a more favorable supple-demand balance.Freeport McMoRan (FCX), a leading stock in the group, is also a gold miner, but it derived 67% of revenue in 2015 from sale of copper and 10% from gold, with oil and molybdenum accounting for most of the balance. Shares of Freeport rose as high as 14.97 but reversed lower to trade down 4 cents at 14.61.Mining giants Rio Tinto (RIO) and BHP Billiton (BHP) fell 2% and 1.4%, respectively.RELATED:Fed Sees 3 More Hikes In 2017; 'Fiscal Boost Not Needed,' Yellen SaysWhy Some Strategists Still Like Gold Despite Its Recent WeaknessProfit Recession Is Over, Here Comes The Best Earnings Growth Since 2014

Total Cloud revenues reached $1.1 billion.Wall Street Q3 estimates: Oracle did not provide a Q3 outlook in its earnings release. Wall Street is modeling flat EPS ex items of 64 cents, on sales of $9.24 billion, up 2.6%.Stock: Oracle shares were down nearly 2% after the earnings release, after falling 2 cents to 40.86 in the stock market today, close to a 42.10 buy point.On the conference Analysts will be looking for more insight on its cloud transition and on its acquisition of NetSuite, a provider of cloud-based customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning software.

1463,NOV,"Eli Lilly (LLY) stock popped to a three-week high Thursday — its highest point since terminating a key Alzheimer's program in November — on its Wall Street-topping 2017 sales and earnings guidance.Early Thursday, Lilly guided to $21.8 billion to $22.3 billion in 2017 sales, topping the consensus of 21 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $21.67 billion. Lilly also sees $4.05 to $4.15 earnings per share ex items, beating analysts' model for $3.97.""This is the first time Lilly has provided initial guidance above the consensus on both metrics since we began tracking this in 2013,"" Evercore analyst John Scotti said in a research report. ""And of those years, only 2013 guidance was above consensus on EPS, not revenue.""IBD'S TAKE: Drug stocks have taken a hit recently on commentary by President-elect Donald Trump that he would go after spiraling drug prices.Eli Lilly management says Wall Street likely didn't account for the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim's animal health business, which is expected to pull in $200 million in 2017 sales.Lilly also expects exclusivity for chemotherapy Alimta next year in Japan and the U.S. and minimal generic competition in Europe. The consensus instead models a 10% year-over-year decline in the U.S. and a 16% dip in ex-U.S. sales.In the stock market today, Lilly stock jumped 5.5% to 71.37.Shares crashed to a two-year low Nov. 23 after Lilly said it would scrap its work on Alzheimer's drug solanezumab after it missed its primary endpoint in a late-stage trial.Shares are still trying to recover. Lilly stock has traded below its 50-day moving average since mid-November, reflecting a similar trend for IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group.

1464,NOV,"Arista Network's (ANET) court victory over Cisco Systems (CSCO) on Wednesday isn't the end of its litigation with networking giant Cisco, but analysts say it's a big win.An eight-person jury ruled that Arista owed no damages over Cisco's claims of copyright infringement. Cisco had been seeking roughly $335 million in damages.Arista's network switches speed up communications among computer servers packed into the data centers, and the switches interconnect racks of servers in different buildings so they behave like one data center. Customers include Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook (FB).""We believe that while the litigation path remains long, Arista remains the best secular story in IT hardware, based on its disruptive technology and positive exposure to public cloud titans,"" Kulbinder Garcha, a Credit Suisse analyst, wrote in a research report Thursday. He has a buy rating and price target of 110 on Arista Networks stock.IBD'S TAKE: Arista is No. 10 on the IBD 50, a screen of leading growth stocks. Chipmaker Nvidia still tops the IBD 50, but see what other takes make the list of stock that have performed the best over the past 52 weeks.Arista stock, though, fell 1.1% in the stock market today to 96.80. Shares are up 25% this year and are extended from an 87.72 buy point first touched on Nov. 15.Cisco stock rose 0.56% Thursday to 30.63, and it's up more than 10% this year. Cisco stock is trading above its 50-day moving average for a third day, and it has a buy point of 32.04 out of a flat base.An International Trade Commission judge ruled Dec. 2 that Arista infringed on two Cisco patents. The ITC judge's ruling is subject to full commission review, which is expected to be completed by April 9, 2017.Cisco prevailed in a similar patent case in June, but Arista has continued to ship products to customers amid an ongoing legal battle.Arista Networks has denied infringing Cisco's patents but also says it has modified its network software to resolve issues.Founded in 2004 and publicly traded since June 2014, Arista began focusing on cloud data centers in 2008. Much of Arista's senior management team came from Cisco.RELATED: As Networks Speed Up, Arista Gains Ground On Giant CiscoWill Broadcom Chip Boost Arista Networks Vs. Cisco Systems?

1465,NOV,"In a video posted to his political campaign's YouTube account on Nov. 21, President-elect Donald Trump vowed to withdraw the U.S. from the ongoing negotiations related to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a 12-nation trade agreement designed to reduce government barriers and tariffs restricting exchanges between consumers and producers in Asian countries.By restricting trade and making it harder for goods to flow in and out of the country, Trump, who campaigned on promises to make government work for the working man, would actually be making government work for special-interest groups, such as industry lobbyists.Milton Friedman, an economist allegedly revered by many lawmakers who are now backing Trump's trade tirades, warned us about how voluntary exchange across national borders is a canary for looming political problems.In his book ""Capitalism and Freedom,"" Friedman wrote that nationalist attacks against free trade are often the first step toward an assault on freedom.""Interferences with international trade appear innocuous; they can get the support of people who are otherwise apprehensive of interference by government into economic affairs; many a businessman even regards them as part of the 'American Way of Life'; yet there are few interferences which are capable of spreading so far and ultimately being so destructive of free enterprise,"" Friedman wrote. ""There is much experience to suggest that the most effective way to convert a market economy into an authoritarian economic society is to start by imposing direct controls on foreign exchange. This one step leads inevitably to the rationing of imports, to control over domestic production that uses imported products or that produces substitutes for imports, and so on in a never-ending spiral.""Lowering foreign governments' barriers against American-grown agricultural goods and expanding the scope of markets into which American goods could be more fairly traded and sold would have benefited people in rural areas, Trump's geographic power base in the Nov. 8 election.According to estimates from the American Farm Bureau Federation, TPP would have increased annual U.S. net farm income by about $4.4 billion and created over 40,000 farming jobs.Free-trade opponents, now ascendant, have claimed TPP was a scheme designed by big businesses to benefit big businesses. Ironically, the Center for Responsive Politics' examination of over 400 reports filed with the U.S. Secretary of the Senate's Office of Public Records shows much TPP-related lobbying did not come from potential beneficiaries, but from well-funded opponents seeking special government protections from competition, such as the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) and the United Automobile Workers (UAW).AFL-CIO and UAW are only able to exist by siphoning their lifeblood from the body of productive voluntary exchange in the same way a parasite might. By seeking to insert Washington, D.C., into the process of consumers trading dollars for goods and producers trading goods for dollars, by erecting trade barriers, lawmakers are handing AFL-CIO and UAW even more opportunities for graft.The effects of Trump's anti-trade rhetoric aren't limited to keeping U.S. goods off the shelves in Japan or Malaysia, though. In September 2016, Trump promised to add a 35% tax on automobiles manufactured in Mexico, a country often scapegoated by ""economic nationalists.""""When that (Ford) car comes back across the border into our country that now comes in free, we're going to charge them a 35% tariff,"" Trump told morning talk-show hosts in September.This economic nationalism, implemented in the form of a wall against shipping goods purchased by American consumers, would add about $2.8 billion to the Ford company's cost of business, causing automobile retail prices to shoot up in response to the federal government's added regulatory costs.As Friedman also famously observed, ""One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results."" After running a campaign predicated on helping the little guy get ahead, such policies would have the opposite effect.Trump's economic populism may be intended to benefit the working man and not the connected insider, but restricting free trade and giving Washington a larger role in people's economic decisions will only benefit government and those who depend on government for their paychecks. RELATED:Dems Embrace Organized Labor, And Labor Embraces Them Right BackIs 'Transparency' In Trade Talks Just A Smoke Screen?Is Free Trade Dead?

1466,NOV,"Consolidation in the semiconductor industry is likely to continue next year, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland said Wednesday.He identified three publicly traded chip companies that are likely M&A targets in 2017: Marvell Technology Group (MRVL), Microsemi (MSCC) and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM).""While semiconductor companies are likely late cycle, white-hot M&A activity cannot be ignored, as over 20% of all U.S. publicly traded semiconductor companies were acquired in each of the last two years,"" Rolland said in a research report. ""The big get bigger and the small get bought.""The chip industry consolidated by 25% in 2015 and 20% in 2016, he said.""While this pace is likely to slow in 2017 (we expect about 15%), it remains well above the historical average of about 5%,"" Rolland said.IBD'S TAKE: Microsemi is one of seven chip industry stocks on the IBD 50 list of top growth companies. Others include Nvidia and Macom Technology Solutions.His ""top takeouts"" are based on an analysis of earnings power after potential synergies from M&A. Rolland gives a 25% chance each to Marvell, Microsemi and Maxim being acquired in 2017.Shares of Microsemi closed 0.9% lower at 54.70 on the stock market today, and Marvell dipped 0.35% to 14.26, while Maxim eased 0.8% to 38.64. Microsemi touched a record high of 57.32 on Thursday, and Marvell hit a 19-month high of 15 on Nov. 21. Maxim is forming a flat base with a buy point of 42.47.Outside of M&A, he favors semiconductor stocks tied to the massive hyperscale and cloud computing buildouts, expected infrastructure and military spending acceleration under President Donald Trump, and ""a bona fide optical supercycle.""In the hyperscale market, he sees Cavium (CAVM), Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Intel (INTC) and Broadcom (AVGO) as winners.In the infrastructure and defense market, he identified Microsemi, Maxim and ON Semiconductor (ON) as winners.In the optical networking market, he pointed to Broadcom, Intel and Microsemi as winners, along with Applied Micro Circuits (AMCC), which is being acquired by Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI).Of all those chip stocks he picked Broadcom, Microsemi and ON Semi as his ""top 3 ideas for 2017."" RELATED:Nvidia, 2 Other Chip Stocks Get Buy Ratings, Qualcomm Downgraded

1468,NOV,"The buildout of fiber-optic networks by Verizon Communications (VZ), Comcast (CMCSA) and Frontier (FTR), as well as the growth of cloud- computing data centers, has boosted revenue growth at CommScope Holding (COMM), says Citigroup, which initiated coverage on the maker of data connectivity products with a buy rating.""We believe fiber to the home (FTTH) trends in North America and Western Europe support our thesis of a turnaround in the Connectivity division, with around 50% of its sales related to telcos,"" Citigroup analyst Stanley Kovler said in his research report Tuesday. ""We believe CommScope is levered to the fiber builds at Verizon, Frontier, and other a large telcos, along with cable companies.""Kovler set a price target of 45 on CommScope stock.

""We believe Accenture's competitive differentiation (digital capabilities) and a high degree of diversification will enable the company to deliver another solid quarter.""IBD's Computer-Tech Services group ranks just No. 66 out of 197 industry groups.Accenture's guidance may be affected by companies waiting to finalize IT spending priorities until the incoming Trump administration outlines its policies, says Pacific Crest Securities.RELATED:Accenture Spikes To 16-Year High As Earnings Top, Bookings StrongInfosys Cuts Revenue Outlook Again, Stock Falls

1474,NOV,"U.S. stock indexes chalked up moderate gains Tuesday morning. Small caps outperformed, while the Dow Jones industrial average is approaching 20,000.The Dow industrials rose 0.4% not far from their intraday high of 19,987. The Nasdaq popped 0.5%, while the S&P 500 advanced 0.3%. Volume in the stock market today is running higher on both major exchanges.The small cap Russell 2000 jumped 0.7%.Blue chips were mostly up. Dow component Caterpillar (CAT) led with a 1.5% early gain. The heavy equipment maker recently found support in its second trip to the 50-day line.The large cap stock broke out of a flat base in late September, clearing an 84.83 buy point. The stock fell about 5% below the entry, but never triggered a sell rule.Apple (AAPL) jogged closer to a 118.79 buy point as it added 0.4% to 117.13. Apple is headed toward its 10th gain in the past 11 sessions. In fiscal 2017 ending in September, Apple is expected to grow earnings 8%, a downward revision. But in fiscal 2018, earnings are expected to grow 12%, an upward revision.In Q3, funds picked up their exposure to Apple, after declines in the previous two quarters. Funds adding exposure included Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX), which stepped up exposure about 10%.West Texas oil and natural gas explorer Callon Petroleum (CPE) fell 1.6% Tuesday morning as it showed some signs of settling down.The stock has been a wild trader. Callon's Nov. 28 failed, triggering the 8% sell rule as it eventually dropped about 14% below a 16.46 buy point. The past four sessions, however, have involved tighter action.Callon announced Monday that it had closed its previously announced offering of 40 million shares of common stock. This increased the number of shares outstanding by about 25%. Proceeds from the offering are expected to be used to fund the pending Ameredev Acquisition.RELATED:Salesforce Rated A BuyCommScope Started At Buy On Two DealsWhen Did Apple Initially Break Out?Sector Rotation In 2016: Why Money Is Flowing Into Coal, Oil, Steel

1475,NOV,"Investors did not let a spate of violent incidents in Germany and Turkey spoil the ongoing Santa Claus rally in U.S. stocks as the market focused on the potential for more economic growth in the coming year.Growth companies showed strength Tuesday, as seen by another gap up in Nvidia (NVDA) shares to new highs in robust turnover. Nvidia is No. 1 in the IBD 50. On Monday, Yahoo Finance named the Silicon Valley giant in graphics processors the company of the year.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) rose to an intraday high of 117.50 before easing a bit. Ending the session at 116.95, the megacap tech is now within arm's length of a possible breakout past a 118.79 base-on-base entry point.Small caps continue to rule the market's roost in 2016. The Russell 2000 gained 0.9%, extending its rebound off the Nov. 3 short-term low to more than 19%. The S&P SmallCap 600 rallied 0.8% while the S&P MidCap 400 was up 0.5%, moving more or less in step with the other key indexes.The Nasdaq composite and Dow also rose 0.5%; the S&P 500 gained around 0.4%. Volume was virtually flat vs. Monday on both exchanges, according to preliminary data.Watch for economic data on Thursday, including the final print on Q3 U.S. GDP, November personal income and spending, November leading economic indicators, November durable goods orders, and weekly jobless claims.The exit from government bonds did not stop on Tuesday. Another sell-off in the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond sent the yield rising to as high as 2.566%, according to real-time trading data from Tradeweb, hovering near the multimonth peak of 2.6%. The Federal Reserve raised the fed funds rate by a quarter point on Dec. 14 and signaled the possibility of three additional hikes in 2017.Elsewhere in the stock market today, General Electric (GE) helped lift the Dow industrials, rising 1% to 32.25 and posting a third straight solid advance. The industrial and media giant cleared a narrow five-day handle within a five-month cuplike base, triggering a breakout at 32.10.Volume has been robust over the three-day advance. Q4 earnings are expected to lift 77% to 46 cents a share after a 26% decline in the year-ago quarter.For the investor who is long in Nvidia, one needs to be aware of key sell signals that would help lock in a strong gain near the end of this leading growth stock's run. They would include a climax run; a series of negative reversals in heavy volume; big gaps down in price or the single biggest point drop since Nvidia's March breakout past a 31.16 entry in a cup with handle pattern; and a severe break below the 10-week moving average in monster volume.None of these signals have appeared so far. Nvidia's 3.5% gain is the product of a solid gap up in price. That is, Tuesday's intraday low of 104.12 is nicely above Monday's intraday high of 102.45; hence, the price gap.Some hot stocks, when they go into a climax run, often feature a so-called ""island top"" formation. But Nvidia does not meet this criterion, given that the gain since the start of its current six-day price run does not exceed 20% to 25%.From the Dec. 12 close at 89.59, Nvidia has vaulted as much as 18%.Keep an eye on Wall Street's potential revisions to earnings estimates. Right now, the Street sees earnings in the fiscal year ending in January rising 44% to $2.41 a share. Growth is expected to slow to an 11% rise in FY 2018, but analysts tend to lowball their forecasts that far into the future.Nvidia also has a habit of providing conservative guidance. In the October-ended fiscal third quarter, the company smashed the consensus view with earnings of 83 cents a share, more than 45% above Wall Street's 57-cent forecast.In the prior three quarters, Nvidia's average EPS beat was 6.9%.With a float of 507 million shares and 539 million shares outstanding, it would not be at all surprising if CEO Jen-Hsun Huang and crew decide on a stock split. The last split was 3-for-2 in September 2007, which came soon after a 2-for-1 split in April 2006.That second large split came just weeks before Nvidia's stock peak that year at 39.67; during the 2008 subprime debt crisis, shares plunged more than 85% to a low of 5.75.Other companies that are showing marvelous price gains, excellent fundamentals that back up the strength, and solid institutional sponsorship include the following:Thor Industries (THO), No. 2 in the IBD 50 and $5.6 billion market cap: The RV maker, featured frequently in IBD's market columns including Stock Spotlight, gained 1.7% to 106.44. It's rallied 22% since clearing an 87.18 cup buy point.GATX (GATX), No. 3 in the IBD 50 ($2.6 billion market cap): The rail car leasing firm rallied 4% to clear a narrow, tight consolidation; at 64.19, the small cap name has jumped 35% past a 47.51 aggressive entry within a six-month first-stage base that is part of a long, bottoming base pattern. Evercore Financial (EVR), No. 11 in the IBD 50 ($2.8 billion): The investment bank, specializing in M&A advisory work, gained 4.3% to 71.60. RELATED:Hot Growth Stocks: Can Nvidia's Fundamentals Turn It Into The Next Apple?The Bottoming Base Pattern: Why It Helps Investors Make MoneyThe Bottoming Base Pattern, Part II: How Apple Formed It In 2009Finding Strength In The Transport Sector: It's Not Just The Airlines And GATXThe Big Picture: The Market Remains In A Confirmed Uptrend

For the second time in the last three trading sessions, Broadcom stock hit its buy point of 179.52, where it has encountered resistance after touching a record high of 181.90 on Friday.

1478,NOV,"While there's attention on how Apple (AAPL) and the so-called FANG internet giants are performing, several megacap stocks have broken out and retaken buy points in the past week. General Electric (GE), IBM (IBM), Home Depot (HD) and Comcast (CMCSA). All four have market caps above $150 billion.Keep in mind that these four giants, with fundamentals that range from decent to lackluster, are late to the party. Many other stocks have had earlier run-ups and breakouts.General Electric rose 8 cents to 31.86 on the stock market today. GE closed Friday up 0.8% at 31.78, slightly above a 31.59 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. GE just topped that entry on Wednesday, then pulled back on Thursday. Volume was not impressive on the breakout, raising at least a yellow flag.GE peaked at an eight-year high of 33 on July 19, then pulled back to the 50-day line, where the stock clung tightly, barely moving for the next several weeks. Shares then broke down until early November. Shares have rebounded nicely since then, regaining their 50-day line on Nov. 9, the day after the presidential election, and then their 200-day line on Nov. 10.GE has struggled to deliver growth in core industrial orders and revenue, but investors are betting that the company will benefit from tax cuts, infrastructure spending and pro-energy moves under the Trump administration.GE's relative strength rank is a mediocre 46 out of 99. But its RS line, which gauges a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500, has improved since late October. (The RS line is the thin blue line on the chart below).IBD'S TAKE: Here are five shale stocks that were near buy points before non-OPEC members agreed Saturday to join and OPEC production cut.Big Blue fell 0.6% to 165.50 Monday. IBM retook a 161.96 buy point on Wednesday in above-average volume, continuing to rise through Friday to close at 166.52, the highest since late July. IBM initially moved into buy range on Nov. 21, but fell back down on Dec. 1.IBM revenue has fallen vs. a year earlier for 18 straight quarters, though the declines have shrunk to just 0.3% in Q3.Home Depot rose 0.9% to 134.58. Shares climbed 0.65% to 133.39 on Friday, adding a little distance from a buy point of 132.23 first topped on Wednesday in above-normal trade. Home Depot hit a record 139 on Aug. 2, then retreated somewhat over the next three months before bottoming on Nov. 1.Comcast fell 0.7% to 68.97, just above a 68.46 buy point. Comcast first topped that entry on Nov. 17, after racing from the bottom in the prior two weeks. Much of the run-up was in very heavy volume, though the actual breakout had essentially flat trading activity. As recently as Wednesday, shares sometimes fell back below the buy point, at least intraday.Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal in addition to its cable and internet infrastructure, could benefit from tax cuts and a possible reversal of net neutrality rules under the Trump administration.As for Apple and the FANG stocks, Apple and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) fell less than 1% but closed above their 50-day lines after both retook that key support level on Friday for the first time in weeks, joining Netflix (NFLX). Netflix ended virtually unchanged.Amazon (AMZN) fell 1.1%, consolidating between its 50-day and 200-day lines. Facebook (FB) remains stuck below its 200-day after coming up just short on Friday. Facebook pulled back 1.6%.RELATED:FANG+: Apple, Alphabet, Facebook Regain Key Support Areas

1480,NOV,"Top U.S. shale stocks re-entered buy range Monday as crude prices spiked following Saturday's agreement between OPEC and top non-OPEC producers to cut output next month, but they erased much of their gains or even traded lower as oil prices pared gains.U.S. crude futures rose 2.6% to $52.83, their best close since July 2015. But oil rose more than 5% intraday.Shale bellwether Continental Resources (CLR) rose as high as 57.81 intraday, clearing a 54.42 buy point, but closed down 2.8% to 52.80 on the stock market today.The stock previously broke out with a 23% pop after OPEC announced its production agreement on Nov. 30, but drifted lower amid doubts that it can actually be implemented.Diamondback Energy (FANG) surged to 113.16 intraday, easily topping its 106.94 entry point, but settled off 1% at 104.99. Diamondback shot up 13% on Nov. 30 that initially put it in buy zone.Concho Resources (CXO) fell 1.1% to 140.84 after initially rising to 147.55, breaking out from its 143.70 buy point. Unlike Continental and Diamondback, Concho never quite made it into buy zone earlier, despite a 12% post-OPEC run-up.Parsley Energy (PE) and Pioneer Natural Resource (PXD) held onto fractional gains, but below entry levels reached early Monday.Parsley was up 0.85% at 36.63, still less than a dollar below its 37.30 entry point, after rising as high as 38.18. Pioneer rose 1% to 188.96, back below its 193.49 buy point, pulling back from an intraday high of 195.Diamondback, Parsley, Pioneer and Concho are also big players in the Permian Basin, which has seen a spike in drilling activity as its low-cost reserves allow producers to extract oil profitably, even with prices still well below 2014 highs.RELATED:'NOPEC' Deal Could Send Oil To $60 By January, But Can It Be Enforced?Oil Soars Nearly 5% On Non-OPEC Deal, Saudi SurpriseSaudis Signal 'Shock And Awe' After Russia, Non-OPEC Nations Pledge Output CutsGeneral Electric, IBM Among 4 Megacap Stocks In Buy Range

1481,NOV,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) stock crashed to a three-year low Monday after its CEO and CFO unexpectedly resigned amid the company's monthlong accounting probe into sales of immunosuppressant Soliris.In the stock market today, Alexion stock toppled 12.9% to 115.08, earlier falling as much as 20% to its lowest point since October 2013. Shares already had plunged 11% in the two days following Alexion's Nov. 9 announcement of the probe into whether an employee engaged in sales practices inconsistent with company policies.On Monday, Alexion tapped former AstraZeneca (AZN) CEO David Brennan to temporarily replace CEO David Hallal, who resigned for personal reasons. Brennan has been on Alexion's board since July 2014 and previously led AstraZeneca from 2006 to 2012. Spencer Stuart will search for a permanent CEO.Former Honeywell International (HON) CFO David Anderson will permanently succeed CFO Vikas Sinha, Alexion said in a press release. Anderson served as Honeywell's CFO from 2003 to 2014.IBD'S TAKE: More challenged Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Novo Nordisk could fall behind Eli Lilly and AbbVie in 2017. But IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group is down 19% for the year.The resignations of Hallal and Sinha were effective immediately and come as Alexion preps to wrap an internal audit into its sales practices. Alexion postponed its Q3 filing on Nov. 9 amid the allegations by a former employee.Alexion expects to file its delayed 10-Q form for the period ended Sept. 30 in January. At this point, the investigation hasn't found cause to require Alexion to update its previously-reported results, the company said.Chairman Leonard Bell touted the management shake-up in a statement.""This leadership transition comes during a period of great strength and momentum,"" he said. ""The fundamentals of Alexion are very strong. We have three highly effective therapies and a robust rare disease pipeline. We are well-positioned for sustainable growth.""RELATED:Bristol-Myers, Celgene Stocks Rocket After Sweeping Q3 ExpectationsAlexion Crushes Q3 Expectations; Stock Bounds On Drug Trial Plans

1482,NOV,"Global oil markets will swing from surplus to deficit in the first half of 2017 as OPEC and other producers follow through on an agreement to cut supply, according to the International Energy Agency.Oil stockpiles will decline by about 600,000 barrels a day in the next six months as curbs by OPEC and its partners take effect, said the agency, which had previously assumed inventories wouldn't drop until the end of 2017. Russia, the biggest producer outside OPEC to join the deal, will gradually implement the full reduction it promised, according to the IEA.Oil has gained about 17% since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed on Nov. 30 to trim output for the first time in eight years, an accord expanded on Dec. 10 with the participation of 11 nonmembers including Russia and Kazakhstan.""Before the agreement among producers, our demand and supply numbers suggested that the market would rebalance by the end of 2017,"" the Paris-based agency said in its monthly market report. ""If OPEC promptly and fully sticks to its production target"" and other producers cut as agreed, ""the market is likely to move into deficit in the first half of 2017.""The stockpile declines will only occur if OPEC reduces supply enough to meet and maintain a target of about 32.7 million barrels a day, the agency said. The organization pumped a record 34.2 million a day in November, making the cut required to reach its target even bigger, according to the IEA, which advises 29 nations on energy policy.""The move into deficit in the market comes with a big 'if',"" said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas SA in London. ""A number of moving parts will have to come together before this happens. In the end, the proof is in the pudding.""There are some signs the market is already starting to tighten. While inventories of crude and refined oil in industrialized nations remain 300 million barrels above their five-year average, they dropped for a third month in October, the longest run of declines since 2011, according to the IEA.As a result of the Dec. 10 deal, the agency chopped its 2017 estimate for total non-OPEC supply growth in half, to 220,000 barrels a day. Non-OPEC supply will average 57 million barrels a day next year.The IEA reduced its 2017 forecast for production in Russia, which promised to deliver half of the total non-OPEC cut, by 140,000 barrels a day. Russian output of crude and condensate will fall to 11.3 million barrels a day in the second quarter from 11.6 million in the fourth as the country gradually implements a cut of 300,000 barrels, according to the report.While Kazakhstan also agreed to make a minor reduction, the IEA kept its projections for the country unchanged following the government's insistence that output from its three largest fields won't be constrained. Kazakh production will grow by 160,000 barrels a day next year.The agency increased its forecast for global oil demand in 2017 by 100,000 barrels a day. Consumption will rise by 1.3 million barrels a day, or 1.4 percent, to 97.6 million a day.

1483,NOV,"The Nasdaq composite was under pressure in afternoon trades Monday, but selling was less pronounced in the S&P 500 thanks to strength in oil and gas names.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) was the worst performer in the Nasdaq 100, down more than 15%, after its chief executive and chief financial officer departed amid an investigation into the company's sales practices for its flagship drug Soliris.Also in the Nasdaq 100, Viacom (VIAB) slumped more than 7% after Shari Redstone, vice chairwoman of Viacom and CBS (CBS), said she's no longer interested in merging the two companies.The Nasdaq lost 0.8%, but action was much quieter in the NYSE indexes with the S&P 500 down 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average up marginally. Volume on the Nasdaq was tracking about 10% lower than Friday's level. NYSE volume was tracking about 10% higher.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude oil futures jumped more than 3% to $53.23 a barrel after Saudi Arabia signaled it's ready to cut output more than initially thought, while non-OPEC countries like Russia also agreed to cut output. Crude futures rose more than 5% earlier in the day.IBD'S TAKE: Energy stocks are rallying en masse as oil prices pop on the 'NOPEC' deal. But investors should still focus on stocks that are breaking out of bullish consolidations. Continental Resources and Diamondback Energy are among shale stocks hitting buy points Monday.In the stock market today, Lockheed Martin (LMT) was down more than 4% after President-elect Donald Trump carried over last week's talk of Air Force One's high price tag to the high cost of Lockheed's F-35 fighter jets.IBD 50 name Callon Petroleum (CPE) gapped up and rose 5% intraday, but the gain faded and shares were down 1.4%. Callon reclaimed a 16.46 buy point with conviction on Nov. 13.IBD 50 name Charles Schwab (SCHW) eased 1% after completing a three-weeks-tight pattern in the latest week.Several retail-related groups underperformed, but Burlington Stores (BURL) continues to trade tightly near highs after a bullish move during the week ended Nov. 25.

1485,NOV,"Oracle (ORCL) reports quarterly earnings after the market close Thursday, with analysts looking for more insight on its transition to cloud computing and its acquisition of NetSuite.The Wall Street consensus is for earnings per share minus items to fall 5% from the year-earlier quarter to 60 cents, on a 1.7% revenue uptick to $9.14 billion, for its fiscal second quarter ended Nov. 30.The enterprise software giant has been steadily transitioning more of its business to the cloud and away from selling on-premise, licensed software.On Nov. 7, Oracle completed its $9.3 billion acquisition of NetSuite, a provider of cloud-based customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning software. Oracle co-founder and Chairman Larry Ellison owned a nearly 40% stake in NetSuite.But UBS recently said several software vendors have hinted that the U.S. election and Brexit-related uncertainties have extended sales cycles and caused deal slippage.IBD'S TAKE: Oracle stock is up about 10% this year as it trudges through a flat base with a 42.10 buy point. Oracle moved above its 200-day moving average on Dec. 7, a bullish indicator. But the stock has a week IBD Composite Rating of 39, meaning it has been outperformed by 61% of stocks in the past year.Adobe Systems (ADBE) will also report earnings after the market close Thursday. Adobe also went through a cloud computing transition that is now paying off. Cowen recently rated Adobe as one of its top ideas for 2017. Adobe and Oracle will be the first of the big tech firms to report financials that include November, the month of Donald Trump's surprise presidential victory, which has sparked the stock market though not so much the tech sector.Ronsenblatt Securities analyst Marshall Senk has a buy rating and price target of 48 on Oracle stock.Senk expects Oracle to report cloud revenue of $1.05 billion, up 60%. And he said despite continued market share gains by No. 1 infrastructure-as-a-service cloud services provider Amazon.com (AMZN), he does not see that having a big impact on Oracle's platform-as-a-service cloud business in coming quarters.""For Amazon to take share in this market, we would need to see wholesale deflections off the Oracle database for large-scale production applications — which is a business risk we don't believe large customers are willing to take,"" Senk wrote in a research note.Oracle stock fell 1 cent to 40.51 in the stock market today.Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White rates Oracle stock a buy, with a price target of 47.""We believe the worst of this cloud transition is behind Oracle,"" he wrote.RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan has an outperform rating on Oracle and price target of 43.RELATED:Trump Invites The Tech Leaders Who Opposed Him In For A TalkCoupa Software Earnings, Guidance Top Wall Street Expectations

He also elevated the stock to ""best idea"" status for 2017.""Fundamentals for the video game space remain strong and TTWO has the best catalyst path into 2017,"" Creutz said in his research report.Take-Two stock rose 0.5% to 50.03 on the stock market today, nearly 9% extended from a breakout at 45.97 touched on Nov. 3. Take-Two hit an all-time high of 50.56 on Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Take-Two stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 62, meaning it has outperformed 62% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. It ranks No. 3 out of 15 stocks in IBD's Computer Software-Gaming industry group. To see which stocks lead the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""We believe that with fiscal 2017 results largely derisked due to the strong performances of 'NBA 2K17' and 'Mafia 3,' the case for owning the stock ahead of what we expect to be a very successful 'Red Dead Redemption 2' launch in fall 2017, and a significant uptick in fiscal 2018 EPS, is very straightforward,"" Creutz said. ""On average earnings power, Take-Two continues to trade at a discount to peers.""Take-Two's fiscal 2017 ends March 31.Take-Two historically has traded at a discount to rivals Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) because of its volatile product release schedule tied to big games.But with the success of the ""NBA 2K"" and WWE series games as well as ""Grand Theft Auto Online"" that has become less of a factor, Creutz said.RELATED:Activision Shot Down By 'Call Of Duty' Sales ConcernsRetailers Heavily Discount Video Games To Drive SalesHoliday Video game Gifts: Wrapped Present Or Digital Download?

1487,NOV,"Generating income in the current market environment has been a bit like a carnival game. It can take a lot of effort and the prize may seem of little more value than a cheap stuffed pink elephant with uneven button eyes.Interest rates on Treasury bonds remained near historic lows this year, forcing many income investors to chase yield in junk bonds and dividend-paying stocks.At this point choices for dividend stocks range from those down a lot and offering juicy yields, like energy refiner and marketer CVR Energy (CVI), which is 51% off its 52-week high and has a dividend yield of 10.8%, and transportation services company Scorpio Tankers (STNG), 53% below its high, yielding 12%. At the other end of the spectrum are stocks that have been on the upswing but have less potent yields, such as food giant Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), which is up 22% this year but pays a dividend yield of just 2.7%.Still, dividends could get more appealing. What if tax cuts under President Trump coax corporations to repatriate overseas caches of cash back to the U.S.? Many companies might use the bounty to boost their dividends.Special Report: Dividend And Income InvestingMany companies have already used those overseas cash stashes. Tony Hallada, CliftonLarsonAllen Wealth Advisors (CLA) managing partner, said, ""Corporations issued a massive amount of corporate bonds at record low interest rates that was collateralized by the assets held overseas. Many used the bond-sales proceeds to increase their dividends. This way they could pay out some of this buildup of capital on the balance sheet, borrow at record low rates and avoid paying the taxes on the repatriated money.""The game is changing already. Bond yields are rising as the economy strengthens and the Federal Reserve on Wednesday nears what is expected to be its first rate hike in a year. The 10-year Treasury yield has pushed as high as 2.4% in recent days, a level not seen since July 2015. Boatloads of erstwhile bond investors parked in dividend-paying equities are waiting to jump back into their preferred ""safe"" investment class.But investing in bonds when interest rates are rising can cause principal to erode since bond prices fall when rates rise. And when money moves back into bonds to capture higher yields, it could rush out of dividend-paying stocks that have been bid up to high valuations by income seekers.What's the smart play for retirees and others searching for income?Given today's risks in any one type of bond or income-oriented stock, the secret to winning the income prize is to be flexible. You need a variety of income sources, tilting toward those whose valuations hold steady while they churn out income, and tilting away from those whose prices sag and undercut your total return.You can get higher yield than what's paid by safe blue chip stocks by taking on credit risk. Ditto for bonds; you can get higher yield if you accept higher risk. But odds are you're aiming for a relatively safe balance of yield and risk.Telecom's Verizon (VZ), for instance, is approaching the end of the choppy year with a 9% gain and yielding 4.6%. Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) is up 35% and yielding 3.1%.Don't expect the Federal Reserve to help your pursuit. Even with rate hikes, rates will remain near historic lows. And rate hikes can crush securities' prices.""The current environment is murky,"" said Radu Gabudean, a manager of several American Century funds, including $52.6 million Multi-Asset Income (AMJAX) and $16.4 million Global Allocation (AGAVX).Among stocks, sectors that tend to pay higher yield have grown pricey because investors have crowded into them. Among bonds, you have to give up more and more credit quality to find higher yield. Both of those facts threaten your ability to score price gains. You could even end up eating a loss.""Focusing your investments on those equity sectors and in lower-quality bonds is a dangerous investor behavior,"" said Justin Christofel, co-manager of $13.7 billion BlackRock Multi-Asset Income Fund (BAICX).Christofel exhibits flexibility by including covered call options among his fund's income sources. About 13% of its shareholders' money is invested in such options, which aim to minimize the high yield-high risk trap. But 20% to 30% of the fund's yield is from covered calls, he says.The fund's 12-month yield is 4.47% as of Nov. 30, according to Morningstar Inc. That's more than double the 2.08% yield from the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), a proxy for the popular big-cap stock benchmark.Covered call options are a way to wrest income from stocks that pay few if any dividends.  Individual investors can follow this strategy on their own if they invest the time to shop for worthwhile stocks, arrange an option trading agreement with a brokerage and sell calls on specific stocks.""But it's far easier to have a financial advisor do it for you, or to use a mutual fund that holds them,"" Christofel said.IBD'S TAKE: You can learn more about investing in covered call options in this IBD report.The strategy involves buying a stock and at the same time selling to another investor that stock's potential price gain above a certain specific price. You pocket any gain up to that agreed upon threshold, known as the strike price. The person who bought the option gets any gain beyond that.This strategy generates income through the price — called the premium — the second investor pays for the option. Mutual funds pass those premiums through to shareholders as income in the form of dividends.This income strategy relies on potential share-price appreciation, not dividends paid. That means covered call options help a fund diversify its risks and avoid stocks with cyclically inflated share prices.""We can generate income this way without relying on sectors and geographies that investors are most likely to turn to for dividend income, such as staples, REITs, utilities and telecom,"" Christofel said.In turn, that frees his fund to focus on stocks with better prospects for price gains, improving the fund's overall total return potential.How can you tell if any given mutual fund holds covered call options? It's easier with some funds than others. In its monthly commentary, Christofel's portfolio details the share of income from each of its strategies. As of Oct. 31, the largest slice of its income pie was from covered call options, whose 30% share topped the second-largest source, global high yield bonds at 18%.The covered call option portion of his portfolio customarily yields 10% to 15% annually, he adds. Compare that to the 2.08% average 12-month yield of dividend-oriented stock mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. as of Nov. 30.The strategy only works if the stock you use gains in price. Christofel sees the best opportunities for this tactic at the moment in financial stocks. Also promising are technology, consumer discretionary and industrials.Many additional strategies involve the familiar tit-for-tat, seeking some relatively safe balance of yield and credit risk or market risk. Among them:Linda Duessel, executive vice president and equity markets strategist for Federated Investors, likes stocks that raise their dividends. Payout is not their only benefit. The stocks tend to outperform other stock categories after Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes.""It's common with the first rate hike, and I call the hike that (may come out of) the Fed's next meeting (Dec. 13-14) a 'first hike' because the prior one was a year ago,"" Duessel said.Those stocks tend to climb because rate hikes occur amid economic strength, which helps companies lift their dividends.You can play this strategy through mutual funds or individual stocks. If you go with individual stocks, weigh how much a stock's price has risen in, say, the past year. The higher it has climbed, the harder it will be to score additional appreciation.""This is the category we're having the most discussions with clients about,"" said Terry Simpson, U.S. multiasset strategist for the BlackRock Investment Institute. ""This area offers higher yield with only a small increase in risk. A more stable U.S. dollar can create an opportunity for foreign-currency bonds.""But if the dollar rises in value, that could lure investors away from emerging markets debt, hurting their prices, Simpson cautions. ""An aggressive Fed tightening cycle or a global risk-off situation could threaten the asset class,"" he added.U.S. dollar-denominated emerging markets debt yielded 5.13% on average as of Nov. 30, according to the Bloomberg Barclays Emerging Markets USD Aggregate Bond Index. Its local currency counterpart yielded 5.18%.Attractive yields are this category's driver. But beware of volatility. ""High-yield bonds have been the best-performing category this year, along with emerging markets debt,"" said Adam Kramer, a manager of $42.7 million Fidelity Advisor Multi-Asset Income Fund (FWATX). ""But the year before, high yield was the worst performing.""The category's total return is vulnerable to cycles in sectors where it is highly exposed, such as financials and energy.High-yield bonds averaged a yield of 6.57% as of Nov. 30.Joanna Bewick, manager of two Fidelity Investments income-oriented mutual funds, describes convertible bonds as bonds on steroids. They generate income like bonds, and they offer the price appreciation potential of stocks. Convertible bonds averaged a yield of 3.31% as of Nov. 30.These loans are typically made to large corporations. The loans' interest rates are adjustable, usually every 90 days. That protects the lender in a rising rate environment.Borrowers generally have sound fundamentals. Still, these loans are typically below investment grade. The loans are senior secured debt, which give lenders first claim on the borrower's assets if it defaults. You can play these instruments through loan participation or bank loan mutual funds.Current 12-month yield is more than double the S&P 500's. But total return historically lags the broad stock market over multiyear periods.Elsewhere in our special report on dividend and income investing, you can read reports that offer tips about a wide variety of income strategies:RELATED:Want Income?

1488,NOV,"The Nasdaq and S&P 500 were poised Monday afternoon to end a six-session win streak, unwinding part of the Trump rally at least for a day.The small-cap Russell 2000, which has led the rally, dropped 1.2%. The Nasdaq fell 0.7%, while the S&P 500 trimmed 0.1%. However, the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.1%. Volume in the stock market today was running about 10% higher on the NYSE and 11% lower on the Nasdaq.The day's big gainers included oil stocks and utilities. On the downside, the groups favored by the rally that appears to have come with President-elect Donald Trump — steel, cement and bank shares — were down.No market can go straight up, but two stocks in the Dow have taken a stab at it recently. Goldman Sachs (GS) rose about 40% since its October breakout before correcting 2% Monday afternoon. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) advanced almost 25% since bouncing off its 50-day line in early November and fell 1% intraday Thursday.The Dow is trailing the small-cap indexes but has outperformed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq since the Election Day close. The Dow is up 8% vs. 5% for the S&P 500 and 4% for the Nasdaq.Among the cement plays, Dallas-based Eagle Materials (EXP) is testing its short term 10-day moving average. Short-term investors will sometimes sell if a stock violates that line after an advance from a breakout.Eagle Materials rose as much as 13% after an opening price gap up Nov. 9 but fell 2.6% Monday afternoon. The stock is trying to cross and hold above the 100 price level. The 100 price area could develop into a support or resistance level.Steel stocks were down, with several testing the 10-day lines. They included Nucor (NUE), Steel Dynamics (STLD) and United States Steel (X).Stocks have gotten extended, and many leaders are well above the traditional 50-day and 200-day lines. Individual investors may wish that leaders would come down and test the 50-day line to create follow-on buy areas, but wishes don't always come true. If the stock market resumes its bullish thrust in the days ahead, then the 50-day line is unlikely to come into play.On Tuesday and Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will meet. The Fed is expected to increase interest rates. However, market watchers will be looking for clues regarding future rate hikes.RELATED:The Fed Won't Rain On Trump's Stock ParadeOil Deal Could Send Crude to $60 By January

1489,NOV,"Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Facebook (FB)  COO Sheryl Sandberg and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) co-founder and CEO Larry Page and Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt are among tech industry leaders expected to attend a summit with President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday, Bloomber and online news site Recode reported Sunday, where U.S. economic growth as well as China, taxes and immigration policies could be on the agenda.Most tech industry leaders who attend will fly east from Silicon Valley. The meeting is planned at the Trump Tower in Manhattan.Trump transition advisor Peter Thiel, a PayPal (PYPL) co-founder and now a noted venture capitalist, has also reached out to Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella, and the chief executives of Cisco Systems (CSCO), IBM (IBM), Intel (INTC) and Oracle (ORCL), according to reports. Thiel was by-far Trump's biggest high-level Silicon Valley tech backer, even speaking in a prime spot at the Republican National Convention.Apple's Cook, Oracle co-CEO Safra Catz and Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins have confirmed they're going, says a Bloomberg report. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk also will attend, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, though Recode on Sunday said Musk was iffy.IBD'S TAKE: Apple and most of the FANG stocks are showing weak relative strength vs. the broader market. True market leaders show rising RS lines. To find stocks with RS lines hitting new highs, take a free Marketsmith trial.Netflix (NFLX) CEO Reed Hastings, Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick will not be attending and have other plans, said the Recode report.Recode on Sunday said it wasn't clear if Amazon.com (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos would attend, but Yahoo reported Monday that Bezos would attend.During the Presidential campaign, Trump called Amazon a monopoly and said it benefited from unfair tax advantages. Trump also has feuded with the Washington Post, which is owned individually by Bezos.Worries that Trump trade policies or future comments over Taiwan could raise tensions with China's government remain a concern of Apple, because of iPhone sales in China.Google, meanwhile, apparently won't have the same kind of access to top officials at the Trump administration as it did during the Obama administration.Trump has proposed a one-time tax cut for the repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas, with tax rates falling from 35% to 10%. The top five overseas cash holders are Apple, Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Oracle.During the Presidential campaign, Trump stated his opposition to the H-1B specialty-occupation non-immigrant visas — a key tool of U.S. tech companies looking outside the U.S. to fill key skilled tech jobs that they say are otherwise tough to fill.The largest tech stocks, in general, had not joined as much in the stock market rally post-Trump triumph, with sectors such as oil and banks seeing a bigger boost, though the big techs have done better of late. But Apple stock fell 0.57% in the stock market today, while Facebook and Amazon fell 1.6% and 1.1%, respectively.Apple stock found some support at its 50-day moving average, a key support line, while Facebook and Amazon were facing tests at their 200-day and 10-day lines, respectively.Netflix stock was flat at 122.83. It has a buy point of 129.40 out of a cup-with-handle base. Google stock fell a small fraction to 807.90, still above its 50-day line after retaking that support level on Friday for the first time since Nov. 10.RELATED: Apple, Microsoft, Cisco Eye Trump Overseas Cash Tax Plan

1491,NOV,"Oil prices soared Monday after non-OPEC producers agreed to curb output and Saudi Arabia suggested it would cut its own production by even more than planned over the weekend.U.S. crude futures rose 4.5% to $53.82 a barrel Monday morning, touching their highest levels since July 2015. London-based Brent futures leapt 4.3% to $56.66.OPEC agreed on Nov. 30 to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day. But that deal was contingent on noncartel members such as Russia and Mexico cutting output. On Saturday, they agreed to reduce production by 558,000 barrels per day, with most of that coming from natural declines vs. taking deliberate action to throttle back output. Minutes after that ""NOPEC"" deal, Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih said that ""we're going to cut and cut substantially"" below the levels agreed on.Higher oil prices should be good news for energy stocks when regular trading opens Monday.IBD'S TAKE: The surprisingly strong OPEC and non-OPEC production deals should boost energy stocks, but what are your best plays? Parsley Energy is among five shale companies near buy points heading into the new trading week.Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 2.1% to 90.89 after the opening bell on the stock market today, hitting a four-month best. Exxon Mobil may also be moving on news that Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson is President-elect Donald Trump's likely nominee for Secretary of State.Chevron (CVX) rose 2.5% Monday morning to a fresh two-year high.Shale stocks tend to be more volatile than global, integrated energy giants like Exxon and Chevron. Permian Basin-focused shale companies such as Diamondback Energy (FANG) and Parsley Energy (PE) shot up 5% and 3%, respectively intraday, breaking out of consolidations into buy range.Market sentiment could change quickly on the oil production deal as investors look for signs that producers are actually implementing cuts.Production cuts, along with demand growth, should start to whittle down huge global stockpiles.Saudi Arabia is betting that U.S. shale producers won't be able to quickly boost output, even though the number of rigs in operation has picked up over the last several months.Back in 2014, Saudi Arabia opened up the spigot on production, hoping plunging prices would drive out higher-cost U.S. shale. U.S. output declined, eventually, but much more slowly than Saudi officials had thought.RELATED:Saudis Signal 'Shock And Awe' After Russia, Non-OPEC Nations Pledge Output Cuts

1492,NOV,"The massive sector rotation since the Nov. 8 election struck technology companies hard, but the strongest names are making a powerful comeback. That has renewed interest among ETF investors for one postelection laggard.After straddling the 10-week moving average for five weeks, PowerShares QQQ (QQQ) on Dec. 13 broke out of a first-stage flat base with a 119.76 buy point in massive volume. It has advanced 1% from the pivot in six days.With massive stakes in large-cap techs and biotechs, this Nasdaq-100 tracker fund is a touchstone of the stock market for CAN SLIM-oriented growth investors.In an interview with IBD, John Frank, an equity product strategist at PowerShares, discusses the ETF's rising fortunes.IBD: Why did the Nasdaq-100 index, tracked by QQQ, lag the postelection rally and what has made it perk up?
"
1493,NOV,"Frank: The immediate reaction to the election was that a (Donald) Trump victory is good news for business generally, but especially great news for small caps and financials. While less regulation is a tail wind to all companies, it disproportionately benefits smaller companies that don't have scale and resources to overcome onerous regulation.Given (that) the Nasdaq-100 is comprised of large-cap companies and excludes financials, its underperformance immediately after the election made sense.In addition, there was public opposition to Trump from the tech community at large before the election, which caused some negative sentiment for tech companies. At this point, it doesn't seem likely that the new administration is going to be extra tough on the technology sector and, in fact, Trump (on Dec. 14) held a roundtable with various CEOs of some of the largest tech companies — an encouraging sign for the sector.IBD: QQQ made a 52-week high on Dec. 13. Could it go much higher?
"
1494,NOV,"Frank: It's always difficult to predict future returns, but QQQ is well positioned over the long term.Two main drivers of returns are earnings growth and valuations. Given the composition of the fund, QQQ has attractive earnings growth both realized and forecast (Nasdaq-100 had 8.09% earnings growth in the third quarter with forecast of 30.75% for the next 12 months vs. S&P 500's 2.91% in Q3 and forecast of 19.00%).In terms of valuations, the Nasdaq-100 is currently trading at a 7.8% premium to its historic forward price-earnings ratio, while the S&P 500 is at 21.3%.IBD: Are you seeing notable changes in flow of money for the ETF?
"
1495,NOV,"Frank: Before the election, QQQ saw tremendous inflow during the last week of October, totaling $2 billion. The week ended Dec. 9 saw $1.5 billion of outflow.On Dec. 13, we saw $1.8 billion of inflow, which was the best single day in over six years.(Editor's note: PowerShares QQQ topped share creations among all ETFs in the week ended Dec. 19, absorbing $2.57 billion, according to FactSet data.)IBD: Which stocks and sectors among QQQ holdings are driving the most recent rally?
"
1496,NOV,"Frank: Since Dec. 1, QQQ is up 4.3% through Dec. 13, with every sector having a positive return. Tech has had the highest return at 5.8% as of Dec. 13.The largest contributors to performance have been Apple (AAPL) (up 5.2%), Microsoft (MSFT) (6.4%), Alphabet (GOOGL) (6.4%), Amazon (AMZN) (4.1%) and Intel (INTC) (9.0%), which together accounted for roughly half of QQQ's total return of 4.3% this month through Dec. 13.(Editor's note: Month to date through Dec. 19, QQQ is up 2.5% vs. a 2.9% advance for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY).)IBD: What needs to happen to get QQQ going again?
"
1497,NOV,"Frank: The best thing that can happen for QQQ is policy certainty. Until we know what the true policies (under Trump) are going to be, markets will continue to be volatile as investors speculate.Earnings of the underlying constituents are solid overall, and many of the companies have robust growth outlooks due to their consistent reinvestment into themselves via R&D (research and development).Constituents within QQQ have global reach and are the backbone of today's digital economy.PowerShares QQQ, which allocates 57% of portfolio assets to the technology sector, is rising on the stock market today.Chipmakers including Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) surged on Tuesday to their best levels in the past year.Elite IBD 50 stocks Nvidia and Broadcom are both top 25 stock holdings in the PowerShares QQQ ETF.Nvidia is the best performer among 107 stocks in the QQQ portfolio, having vaulted 218% in the past year.Chip ETF Pegs A New High Amid Nvidia Upgrade; Gold Resumes Its Plunge

1498,NOV,"Mimicking President-elect Donald Trump — who has called himself ""the king of debt"" — risk-loving millennials used exchange traded funds that employed leverage to juice their returns in the wake of the real estate mogul's election victory.That didn't work out so well for them. With preferences for gold and volatility, however, they were largely in line with what the consensus called for in the event of a Trump victory — in other words, far off the mark.""From triple X leveraged products to Vanguard, millennials have shown they favor the extremes in terms of their growing ETF usage,"" said Bloomberg Intelligence ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas. ""However, when it comes to calling the Trump rally, they weren't alone in getting it wrong — every generation thought gold would rally.""By and large, young Americans betrayed dim expectations of Trump's economic impact, flooding into a pair of triple-levered ETFs that own gold miners — Direxion's Gold Miner Bull (NUGT) and Daily Junior Gold Bull (JNUG) — and therefore benefit when the safe-haven asset gains in value.They also plunged into the ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures (UVXY), which tends to benefit from increases in stock market volatility. The two other ETFs that have attracted the top-five biggest inflows from millennials after Nov. 8, according to TD Ameritrade data, are the iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) and Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTI). That takes the average performance of the five ETFs most favored by millennials since the election to minus 27%.The Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners fund has been the worst-performing ETF since Nov. 8, notes Balchunas.Despite their penchant for triple-levered products, millennials do have some redeeming qualities.""When picking investments, millennials with TD Ameritrade accounts prefer a collection of low-cost Vanguard funds,"" notes Balchunas — exactly what you'd expect from investors with long time horizons and decent risk appetite.But when millennials try to time the market with tactical trades, they turn into adrenaline junkies, choosing triple-levered oil ETFs and other products that have up to 14 times the volatility of the S&P 500 index as their preferred trading vehicles.

NBCU acquired movie studio DreamWorks Animation for $3.8 billion in August.""Excluding the Olympics, we forecast 5.9% revenue growth at NBCU in 2017, up from 1.4% in 2016.

1504,NOV,"Stocks showed small movement Monday, but small caps fell harder with the Russell 2000 retreating nearly 1.1%. In contrast, the S&P 500, up 3.1% last week, lost just 0.1%.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, fell around 0.6% to 113.30. More importantly, the stock held above its key 50-day moving average. And Intel (INTC) helped prop up chipmakers with a 0.7% gain to 35.97. Intel has been working on a new saucerlike base since peaking at 38.36 in October.The Nasdaq composite dropped 0.6% on Monday, following last week's 3.6% rally, but volume on fell about 6% vs. Friday's level, according to preliminary data. That's a sign that big funds weren't overly eager to sell positions and raise cash.The NYSE composite outperformed by losing just 0.1%. Big Board turnover grew. The S&P 500 was also off just 0.1% while mega-cap names were virtually flat. Due to the small declines, the 500 avoided getting tagged with a new distribution day, or bout of heavy professional selling. The distribution count on the 500 is now at 2, down from 8 on Nov. 1, according to the IBD Market Pulse table found in each daily Big Picture column.A low distribution day count implies that large funds, banks, pension plans and the like are accumulating shares on net. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating on the S&P 500 is positive at C+ as of Friday's close.The S&P 100 was up a fraction while the Dow Jones industrials edged 0.2% ahead.Oil and gas royalty trust, oil drilling, and international oil and gas exploration companies paced the upside with gains of 1% or more. IBD's Medical-Diversified group, which includes Dow 30 component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and the Internet-Network Solutions group also excelled with gains of 2% and 1%, respectively.J&J jumped nearly 3% to 115.36 in heavy turnover, stopping short of retaking its 50- and 200-day lines. The stock is just 8% below a 52-week peak, but it's still in the early stages of forming a potential new base.The worst declines in terms of industry groups belonged to department store chains (down more than 4%), airlines (-3%), leisure products (-3%) and steel production (off more than 2%). Southwest bank, cement and aggregate, security software and consumer loan companies also sold off hard.Back to the tech sector, Microsoft (MSFT) rose 0.3% to 62.17, extending its gains from a breakout past a 58.80 base-on-base buy point to 5.7%. The mega cap is now slightly extended past the 5% proper buying range.Qualcomm (QCOM), which makes the IBD Dividend Leaders screen, gave up little ground as it builds on gains since a July 21 breakaway gap past a bottoming base buy point of 56.37. Yet the stock may also be working on a new flat-base-like structure. Qualcomm was also showcased in today's The Income Investor column.Netflix (NFLX) continues to show tight action after a strong rally last week. Down just 5 cents on Monday to 122.83, the video streaming giant is still above an aggressive entry point near 120, according to IBD Leaderboard. The standard buy point is 129.39.In the energy sector, numerous oil and gas explorers struggled to hold big opening gains in the wake of another surprise agreement among non-OPEC oil-producing nations to join in the body's historic decision to cut overall production starting in January.Britain's integrated oil major BP (BP) rallied more than 1% to 36.51, at one point getting as high as 36.96, or just a few cents above a 36.93 cup buy point. The eight-week cup sits within a much longer and deeper bottoming base pattern. Halliburton (HAL) ran up to a session high of 56.08 before sinking back to 54.49, up just 0.5%. The oilfield services giant, however, has climbed more than 16% since clearing a 47 flat-base buy point in early October.At one point, Halliburton pulled back below the 47 entry to an intraday low of 45.08, but that 4% drop was not enough to trigger the 8% loss-cutting sell rule following a good breakout.Wall Street sees Halliburton reversing from a net loss of 5 cents a share in 2016 to a net profit of $1.03 a share in 2017.The week features only a sliver of companies reporting quarterly results, but they include two major big-cap software names, Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe Systems (ADBE). The latter is expected to grow fourth-quarter profit 39% to 86 cents a share. Over the prior six quarters, earnings have grown on average 53.2%.In August, Adobe pushed past a 100.66 flat-base entry point and rallied more than 10% before fading. Yet in its most recent correction, the stock found bullish support at the long-term 200-day moving average. Watch to see if the stock can hurdle its 50-day moving average, which would boost the odds of a fresh breakout.Besides the upcoming Federal Reserve decision on interest rates on Wednesday, keep an eye out for the November report on producer level prices. The Econoday consensus forecast calls for a 0.2% month-to-month rise.RELATED:Why Did Apple Form A Bottoming Base, And How Can Investors Profit From It?Why Apple Is Forming A New Base And Flexing Strength AgainWhy Is Adobe A Top Tech Stock Pick For 2017?Will Apple Invest In A Massive Softbank Fund?

1507,NOV,"As the lead manager of two Fidelity Investments income-oriented mutual funds, Joanna Bewick's job is to squeeze payouts from a wide assortment of stocks and bonds while at least preserving capital if not growing it.It's been a challenging task for fund managers this year. On the one hand, they've had to scratch for yield as Treasuries bounced around historical lows. And on the other hand, they had to gauge how to play the markets as the Fed and the economy lurched in fits and starts toward the point of rate liftoff.Bewick's two funds, $5 billion Strategic Dividend & Income (FSDIX) and $7.6 billion Strategic Income (FSICX), attacked the problem with different tools. To accomplish her goal of providing income to investors, Bewick and her teammates rely partially on assets other than plain-vanilla dividend-paying stocks and interest generating bonds.Strategic Dividend's 12-month yield was 2.57% as of Dec. 2, according to Morningstar Inc. It's up nearly 11% this year. Strategic Income's is yields 3.45% and is up 8% this year. The broad market, in the form of SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), is up nearly 12% and yielding 2.01%. That means that for every $100,000 a person invests in, say, Strategic Dividend, it generates $2,750 a year of income.Special Report: Dividend And Income InvestingFrom her office in Boston, the 48-year-old Bewick talked with IBD about how she tackles her daily challenge.IBD: Is this problem of generating income at a time of low rates as daunting for a professional money manager as it is for individual, retail investors?Bewick: In my view, this income problem, whether taken up by an institutional investor or a household investor, is the most challenging question of our time. How to generate income to live on is a real puzzle.IBD: You manage a fund that invests mainly in stocks but also bonds as well as a bond fund, so you're involved with a wide range of strategies. Sometimes investors may want one or the other, or exposure to the types of income provided in both funds?Bewick: Yes.IBD: Many individual investors wonder what the relative pros and cons are of each asset class, including some that many investors view as alternative classes. How would you describe those?Bewick: It tends to come down to a trade-off between safety and higher yield. Sovereign debt in developed markets, the G-7 and the U.S., is considered safe. That is, there is low expectation of a default. The con is that these represent low yields. But the pro is that even in a downturn that may affect equities and credit, this is an area of the capital markets that tends to be a diversifier for portfolios and tends to hang in there in price. So even though it does not offer the (higher) yields of the past, we are committed to keeping these in our portfolio. This is the they-let-you-sleep-at-night part of the portfolio. Returning capital is just as important as return on capital.IBD: What about your high yield bonds?Bewick: Bonds are higher in the capital structure than equity. And loans are even higher than bonds. That matters because in the event the issuer defaults or goes bankrupt, the higher securities are in the capital structure, the earlier they get paid back from remaining assets.IBD: What are bank loans?Bewick: Loans tend to be issued by the same noninvestment grade issuers as (some) bonds. That's a negative. They are issued by banks, then sold to entities like Fidelity. But they tend to have a floating rate aspect. They move with the general interest-rate environment, which is a pro. So their yield can be higher, but the con is higher risk.IBD: Of course, you are an active manager. Why should shareholders use active managers for these investments?Bewick: Figuring out which securities have a higher risk (of default) requires a significant amount of active management. I know ETFs have become a fashionable way to get exposure to a lot of things. But high-yield can be fraught with land mines. An active manager can assess each name's risk. And index (which ETFs tend to track) is stuck with each name in an index regardless of its risk.IBD: Same trade-off with bank loans?Bewick: Yes. These are noninvestment grade. There can be defaults. That risk can be mitigated by active management.IBD: Describe the pros and cons of emerging markets debt.Bewick: It has the advantage of higher yields. It gives your portfolio international exposure. In a diversified fund, it has diversified risk. That can be a plus. Also, there's a unique idiosyncratic risk to each country. Some have a commodity base for their economy. If it's a commodity that is lagging, that is a risk. Also, if rates rise in the U.S. we could see rates fall in some other emerging markets.
"
1508,NOV,"IBD: What about nonbond income generators? Describe the pros and cons there.Bewick: In general, the pro is that they tend to be less rate sensitive than bonds.Typically, we see rising rates on bonds when the economy is doing well. That's a pro. The con aspect is that if people are counting on rising value, they are getting into equities' characteristics. And stocks tend to be several times more volatile.The high dividend yielding space has been popular with a lot of investors who are seeking income, but that has driven valuations up. That's a concern. For us as active managers, it's important to look at valuation and make sure earnings support it.IBD: What are the reasons to like REITs and what are the risks?Bewick: The pro is that they're a very stable source of income. Income comes from rents from commercial entities, so the leases tend to be very long-term. As long as the commercial entity can afford to pay the rent, that income stream is quite stable. And REITs are required to pay out 90% or more of their income. That's a terrific positive.The con is that since the taper tantrum (in 2013 when investors sold-off U.S. Treasuries after the Federal Reserve said it would taper buys of bonds and mortgage backed securities), REITs have become more rate sensitive. Their correlation to the 10-year Treasury is nearly zero because commercial leases tend to be multiyear and not locked into rates, but unfortunately in the near term investors are hypersensitive to rates. Since June 30, rates have picked up and REITs have been disproportionately hit by concern over rates, and have higher negative returns than other higher dividend yielding stocks.IBD: What are the pluses and minuses of convertibles?Bewick: I love the optionality of convertibles. I mean the option of converting them to equity. They provide income with potential for capital appreciation like equity.The negative of optionality is that it is likely to lower the yield, lower than, say, a high-yield bond. But the opportunity for appreciation means the issuer does not have to offer as much income. Their volatility can go both ways. But the bond features give you some protection against the potential loss of value.A third plus is that they tend to be short duration, with short maturities, so they are less rate sensitive.IBD: What's to like and dislike about preferred stock?Bewick: The attractive thing is that their yields are among the highest in income categories. But that income needs to be justified based on fundamentals and on the legal structure of the entity.About 80% to 85% of the space (that issues them) is banks, so it's not terribly diversified. Any time you are buying preferreds, you are essentially buying a bank portfolio. That's why in our fund we've coupled them with other strategies.In addition, because they have such high interest rates, preferreds tend to have a long duration profile, so they've very sensitive to interest rates.Despite that, they've shown themselves to be not as bad as REITs (in rate sensitivity). But quarter to date as of Nov. 16 they've shown a loss of about 3.77%, yet they're up 2.5% year to date.Also, they're callable — the issuer can buy it back at a predetermined price. If you buy it as a premium of 102 and it gets called at 100, that loss can cuts into your return on yield. An individual investor needs to understand all the details of that.IBD: Is it advantageous to buy some of these securities through a mutual fund because a fund family has more expertise than the typical individual investor in understanding features like callability?Bewick: I would say so. Also, a fund diversifies an investor's risk. It can diversify sources of income among many asset classes.IBD: What's your advice for individual investors who want to pursue these strategies on their own?Bewick: Be patient. Don't try to time the market with investments like these. Develop an investment plan to targets appropriate risk and reward. Then give your plan time to work through the market cycle. Don't make decisions based on short-term conditions.IBD: Describe each of these funds, please, Joanna.Bewick: Strategic Dividend & Income is an income-oriented equity fund. It mixes higher-yielding income equities with REITs, preferred stocks and convertibles (and can have other bonds too).Both funds offer income opportunities, but they have different risk profiles, which is why they are segmented into two funds. The bottom line is that folks who can take on equity-like exposure and the volatility that can go with that, the second fund — Strategic Dividend — may be for them.IBD: Describe Strategic Income Fund's breadth.Bewick: It's a traditional bond portfolio. It has a broad mix of assets. It includes the highest quality portions of bonds. Those include U.S. and other developed market bonds. And we have high-yield bonds and emerging market debt. The high-yield portion includes both bonds and floating rate loans. But it's mainly (about 66%) in U.S., investment grade bonds. A lot of it is government bonds. For typical household investors, non-U.S., noninvestment grade bonds and loans are often viewed as exotic. Exotic can be a euphemism for riskier.IBD: And generally speaking, does yield tend to be higher the more exotic a bond or loan is?Bewick: Yes.IBD: Tell me roughly what the yield is for some major types of bond in Strategic Income.Bewick: Three-to-five-year U.S. Treasuries' average yield to maturity is 1.2% as of Sept. 30. The one-to-three-year group has an average YTM of just under 1%. Foreign developed market sovereign debt has an average YTM of 1.8%. Emerging market sovereign debt has an average YTM of 5.9%.Emerging market corporate bonds have an average YTM of 6.7%. High-yield bonds have an average YTM of 7.4%. Noninvestment grade bonds have an average YTM of 6.7%.IBD: Looking at Bloomberg Barclays indexes, I see that yields for high-yield bonds rose a little between September and Nov. 30. They actually fell slightly for convertibles. For emerging markets local currency and U.S. denominated, they were up about 65 basis points to 5.18% on average. U.S.-denominated emerging markets were up 63 basis points to 5.13%. The biggest move was by 7-to-10-year U.S. Treasuries, up 79 basis points to 2.32%. What are the weights of those groups in the fund?Bewick: The fund held 14% in U.S. Treasuries. Three-to-five-year U.S. Treasuries are the largest maturity group. They account for over 4% of portfolio assets. The next largest U.S. Treasury maturity group is the 1-to-3-year group, with a weighting of 3.7%.Foreign government bonds comprise roughly 17.5% of our assets. About 7.5% of the portfolio was in developed market sovereign debt. An additional 10% was in emerging market sovereign debt. And 4.6% was in emerging market corporate bonds. Also, 31.2% was in high-yield bonds. Noninvestment grade bonds made up roughly 50% of the portfolio.RELATED:Flexibility Is Needed For New Era Of Income InvestingProfits From Stock Gains And Augment A Low-Yielding PortfolioHow To Find Dividend Stocks With Staying Power

1509,NOV,"Income from mutual funds? That's the holy grail of investors who yearn for a way to generate income that's as simple — and safe — as pocketing 5% interest from savings accounts in the good ol' days. But how can you do it? Many bond yields remain low. And rising rates have chipped away at bond prices. Investors fear similar damage in the REIT, telecom and utility spaces.What's an income investor to do? Mainly, don't rely on any one strategy. Use a variety of sources to cut your volatility, minimize price pullbacks and maximize your income.If instead you stick to a single, narrow strategy, expect volatility and uncertainty.Take a look at dividend funds that are not REIT, telecom or utility sector funds. Only two of the 11 that are in the top 10% in total returns over the three years ended Nov. 30 were also in the top 10% over the past 10 years. Another seven of those 11 funds don't even have a 10-year record.Special Report: Dividend And Income InvestingWhy diversify instead of relying on just one strategy? No one source of income looks sufficient, says Radu Gabudean, a manager of several American Century target date and target risk funds as well as $52.6 million Multi-Asset Income (AMJAX) and $16.4 million Global Allocation (AGAVX). Why not ""hire"" a professional fund manager, who can tap into a variety of sources for income for you, allocating from one to another as their fortunes rise and fall?""We have exposure to REITs, other dividend stocks in both the U.S. and internationally, high-yield bonds, convertibles, emerging markets debt,"" Gabudean said, referring to Multi-Asset Income.So, if you take that route, how do you decide which income-producing fund — or two or three — is right for you?An income-oriented stock fund will likely be more volatile than a bond fund over the long run. Yet many stock funds can generate better income in the foreseeable future. Those yields can be much higher, but only if you're willing to take a chance on a fund that tilts toward stocks that are troubled, at least in the near term.As for bonds, sure, yields are creeping up and the Federal Reserve is expected to resume its rate hikes. But rising rates translate into bond price declines.Look at four categories: dividend funds as well as utility, REIT and telecom sector funds. REITs, or real estate funds, offered the best 12-month yield, averaging 2.30% as of Nov. 30. That topped the other four groups' averages. But REIT funds' year-to-date total return of 1.10% was the worst of the four. Dividend funds' 11.69% total return was the best year-to-date average return. But its 1.64% yield was the worst.In contrast, qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are taxed at a maximum of 20%. Under a Trump administration, tax rates may decline. But there still may be a tax advantage to income in the form of dividends and capital gains. Still, this year and possibly in years to come, you may want to create income by selling stock fund shares that have risen in value rather than by relying on dividends or interest. And the best price gains may come from stock funds that don't make income-generation a priority at all.How do some mutual funds navigate around these choices? Look at holdings in $2.3 billion Invesco Dividend Income Fund (FSTUX). Over the past three years, the fund's 11.26% average annual return ranks tops among all dividend stock mutual funds.The fund's 1.75% 12-month yield is slightly better than average.The fund's top-performing stock this year through Dec. 7 was Kennemetal (KMT), which makes tooling, engineered components and advanced materials. Shares are up 77% for the year. And the stock's 2.3% dividend yield was slightly better than the broad market's 2.01%, measured by SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY).Not bad? Not so fast. Earnings per share growth has declined in six of the seven most recent quarters. The stock has a weak 54 Composite Rating from IBD. Still, this stock has mounted a powerful rally, even providing a nice gain after breaking out of a base last month.The portfolio holds sturdier looking names. A Composite Rating of 98 and an SMR Rating of A for Microchip Technology (MCHP) are signs of greater strength. Its stock is up 39% for this year. And EPS growth has accelerated, rising by 0% to 3%, 22% and 42% the past four quarters.IBD's TAKE: SMR is a proprietary rating pioneered by IBD to help investors identify companies with superior Sales Growth, Profit Margins, and Return on Equity ratios. You can learn more about how to use SMR here at IBD's website.RELATED:How To Generate Investment Income Despite Low Interest RatesFidelity's Joanna Bewick Describes Pros, Cons Of Animals In The Income ZooAlternative Assets Can Spike Your Income Flow

Don't chase it though, because it's extended from a 100.39 cup-with-handle buy point.In the stock market today, shares of Mosaic (MOS) slumped 5.4% to 27.96 on news it's buying Vale's (VALE) fertilizer business for $2.5 billion in cash and stock. Mosiac is just below a 29.22 cup-with-handle buy point after erasing an 8% gain.On the earnings front, homebuilder Lennar (LEN) gained 1.2% to 43.94 after reporting double-digit earnings and sales growth before the open. However, when it comes to leaders and laggards in the group, Lennar is definitely the latter. Resistance has been strong lately around the 45 price level.IBD'S TAKE: For a look at some leading small-cap names in the homebuilding group, consult an IBD Stock Checkup.Sucampo Pharmaceuticals (SCMP) was a top gainer in the IBD 50, up 8% to 17.05. It's a highly profitable biotech but also on the speculative side with a market capitalization of less than $1 billion. Its lead drug is Amitiza, used to treat constipation, and Rescula, an eye drug to treat open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.Sucampo is closing in quickly on its Nov. 30 intraday high of 17.54.

1512,NOV,"BP (BP) is piling up assets with more than $3 billion of deals in three days as Chief Executive Bob Dudley sees the company emerging from the doldrums after a two-year price slump.Since Saturday, BP has announced a $2.2 billion expansion of output in Abu Dhabi and a $916 million investment in fields in Mauritania and Senegal. That brings its 2016 acquisitions to more than $3.8 billion, the highest in four years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The spending spree may herald a return to growth for Dudley, who has spent most of his six-year tenure divesting assets to pay for the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010, for which BP set aside more than $50 billion.Now Europe's No. 3 oil company, a third smaller since then, plans to start seven or eight major projects next year as crude prices recover from their worst collapse in a generation.""It's time for BP to start growing,"" Dudley, 61, said in a Bloomberg Television interview in Abu Dhabi over the weekend. ""We've walked through so many difficulties in the U.S. that I think the company now is well-positioned for growth.""BP shares have risen almost 40% this year. Notwithstanding a slide in the next few weeks, that would mark the stock's best year since 1993. Its larger European competitors have also performed well, with Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) adding 50% and Total SA (TOT) 17%.The Abu Dhabi and West African deals secure new reserves and production for BP well into the next decade, said Brendan Warn, a managing director at BMO Capital Markets in London. Shell's purchase of BG Group Plc this year gave it assets in Brazil and Australia, Eni SpA (E) has gas projects in Egypt and Mozambique and Exxon Mobil (XOM) is seeking to buy InterOil (IOC), but investors weren't sure where BP's future volumes would come from, he said.""The market was questioning their ability to grow post-2020 and these are the resource-sustenance deals they were looking for,"" he said. ""The timing of these deals is also interesting, coming at a time oil prices are rising.""Benchmark Brent crude has gained 48% this year, reversing last year's 35% decline. Amid the rally, BP has also snapped up a 10% stake in Eni's giant Zohr gas field in Egypt for $375 million and a bigger chunk of Indonesia's Tangguh liquefied natural gas project for $313 million.In a further sign of confidence, BP this month approved the  $9 billion expansion of its Mad Dog deepwater project in the Gulf of Mexico, not far from the site of the oil spill. It also backed an $8 billion expansion of the Tangguh project in July.Oil companies have been emboldened by a recent 20% surge in the oil price after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said Nov. 30 it would cut production to curb the global oversupply. OPEC oil ministers have said a price of $60 a barrel would be acceptable to everyone.BP says it can cover spending and dividends without having to borrow at a price of $50 to $55 a barrel next year, down from an earlier estimate of $60.While oil is currently around $55, it has averaged less than $45 a barrel this year compared with $108 in 2013, and BP's adjusted earnings have fallen year-on-year for nine consecutive quarters. The company trimmed its 2016 capital-expenditure forecast last month.""One has to have some confidence in the price,"" Dudley said. However, ""we are going to remain very, very disciplined about the capital we spend and projects we select.""

1513,NOV,"Since Nike last reported quarterly earnings, a few things have changed.America elected a new president, Adidas is back at the No. 2 spot in the U.S. athletic market and Nike's upcoming second-quarter earnings release will no longer prominently feature its highly watched ""futures"" orders, a metric that has been known to move share prices.Of those factors, the contentious election might be the least impactful on Nike so far. Shares have only slipped 0.6% since Nov. 8, though the stock has tumbled 19% this calendar year. Nike dipped 0.1% to close at 50.85 on the stock market today, dropping further below its 50-day line.""I don't think the election has impacted consumer demand, but many apparel retail stocks have traded down on concerns over possible changes to trade regulations,"" said Morningstar apparel retail analyst Bridget Weishaar (who does not cover Nike), when asked about the impact of the election on the broader retail environment.When Nike reports after the close Tuesday, per-share profit is expected to decline 4% to 43 cents on 5% revenue growth to $8.09 billion.Significantly, this will mark the first earnings release that does not share the company's futures orders, a Nike-made term that reflects products scheduled for delivery to retailers.As the company points shoppers to its app, website and stand-alone Nike stores, the metric is losing some relevance — at least, to Nike, which said in its last earnings call that its ""evolving business mix"" means that futures and revenue are less correlated now.Shifting the disclosure to the earnings call with management may alleviate some of the pressure around the quarterly figure, particularly following the last three quarters of missed forecasts.IBD'S TAKE: Wondering what happened last quarter? Nike beat on both the top and bottom lines but its stock took a hit when futures growth fell short of expectations. You can stop looking at that metric now, said Nike.Meanwhile, Adidas and Under Armour (UAA) remain pressing challengers.Nike ""faces potentially peak market share and operating margin in N. America as Adidas remains in a robust product cycle while Under Armour expands distribution and categories,"" wrote Cowen analyst John Kernan in a Dec. 6 report, downgrading Nike to market perform from underperform.Its three-striped rival, Adidas, is back in the spotlight following a sluggish period in the U.S. that saw the athletic apparel maker ceding its second-place spot to Under Armour in 2014. The Germany-based maker of Superstar and Stan Smith shoes has since clawed its way back up, however.From NPD Retail Tracking service, Adidas has once again attained #2 spot in US sport footwear & apparel, passing UA. and behind Nike/Jordan— Matt Powell (@NPDMattPowell) October 25, 2016Investors and analysts will also be looking for further signs of slowing in Nike's basketball business.But such concerns are ""overdone"" and ""shortsighted,"" wrote Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser on Monday, highlighting the company's brand and innovation pipeline. He has a positive rating on the stock.""The point is, NKE doesn't remain complacent for very long and the stock chart reflects this,"" said Poser. ""Historically, shares rallied 20%+ following other periods of investor angst (Mar-Sep 2002, Jan-Aug 2006, May-July 2012). We believe the recent pullback is a buying opportunity.""Also next week, mall-based athletic shoe retailer Finish Line (FINL) will report quarterly earnings on Wednesday. Analysts expect a loss of 18 cents a share, narrowing from a 49-cent loss a year earlier. Finish Line sells shoes from Nike, Under Armour and Adidas.After breaking out past a buy point on Dec. 8, Finish Line stock has fallen for six straight sessions.RELATED:Skechers Comeback Seen; Nike Loss To Under Armour, Adidas Could RampNike Seeks 'Energy Harvesting,' Augmented-Reality PatentsUnder Armour Clinches First Pro-Sports Deal; Nike Gets Nod From HSBC

""Lam has historically traded at a discount to peers given its outsized exposure to memory. However, we believe improvements in its logic business will persuade investors to apply a higher multiple to the business.""Hari set a 12-month price target of 90 on KLA-Tencor. Its shares rose 1.5% to 79.37 on Monday and is within a buy zone from a breakout at 75.60 first touched on Nov. 7.""We also recommend that investors buy KLA as we view the company's exposure to foundry spend as a key factor that should drive positive estimates revisions over the next 12 months,"" Hari said.Lam abandoned its bid to acquire KLA in October after the U.S. Department of Justice expressed opposition to the deal.RELATED:These Tech Stocks Are Thriving In The IBD 50Applied Materials Hits 16-Year High, Then Retreats, After Q4 EarningsKLA-Tencor, AMD, Maxim Integrated Earnings Top Views; Chip Stocks DivergeLam Research Earnings Beat, Revenue Just In Line

1515,NOV,"Media Bias: The losers in the 2016 election have now discovered there's yet another reason for their rejection at the polls: ""fake news."" Funny, but fake news has been with us all along. It's called the mainstream media, and it's been engaged in faking news for decades.Led by Facebook social-media titan Mark Zuckerberg, progressive activists and their allies in the left-leaning online world want to crack down on what they call ""fake news"" — which essentially amounts to anything they disagree with or that doesn't comport with their progressive world view. Zuckerberg has promised to work with several fact-checking groups to find bogus stories.""We've focused our efforts on the worst of the worst,"" he said, ""on the clear hoaxes spread by spammers for their own gain, and on engaging both our community and third-party organizations.""Those ""third-party organizations"" are of clear concern, however. They include Factcheck, the Associated Press, PolitiFact, the Washington Post, ABC News and Snopes. If you look among that group for a conservative or even centrist outlet, you won't find one. In fact, Snopes, as the Daily Caller reports, ""almost exclusively employs leftists."" From what we know of the others, who are mostly what now passes as ""mainstream,"" the same is true.So you will have mostly left-wing gatekeepers deciding what's a ""hoax"" and what's true. Our guess is you will find that any story that comes from a right-of-center site will be vetted carefully, even extremely, while the usual lies spewed by the mainstream media will get little or no vetting. A clear sign that this is an attempt to shut down conservative opinion is the fact that the American Civil Liberties Union, a far-left group that purports to support First Amendment rights, enthusiastically supports it.Not only does this not remove ""fake news"" from the web, it will deeply imperil First Amendment rights and have a chilling effect on communications over the internet.We're glad to see that even the New York Times has weighed in, saying it's bad idea in an editorial.As many others have said, who decides what's ""real"" and what's ""fake""? And by what criteria? Their own subjective views of the world? Sorry, but we're not willing to hand our rights to free expression to a bunch of people who aren't entirely sure we should have those rights.It's not likely to go away. In his very last press conference, President Obama ripped into what he called ""domestic propagandists"" that passed on fake news and helped Donald Trump defeat Hillary Clinton.Speaking one day after Facebook announced its efforts to stop ""fake news,"" Obama said: ""If fake news that's being released by some foreign government is almost identical to reports that are being issued through partisan news venues, then it's not surprising that foreign propaganda will have a greater effect.""Get the big picture here? He's basically accusing those who politically disagree with him of colluding with foreign governments. Will treason accusations be next?Moreover, what he didn't say is that he, his party and the left in general benefit tremendously from the overwhelmingly leftward slant of the mainstream media — and have for decades.Since Nov. 8, the whole liberal media complex has gone into a spasm of recrimination, lashing out at those they hate most and at their lost influence. Once upon a time, they controlled nearly everything, with the exception of a small handful of conservative publications. Now the internet teems with conservative voices, and the inherent democracy of that has served as a much-needed counterbalance to the nonstop liberal rhetoric featured in the Big Media. The loss of its monopoly on the news is a big problem for the left.No, we're not for printing ""fake news"" — or lies. But we're a little concerned that many of those who will now be checking for fake news mostly passed on reporting the president's lies about ObamaCare, or on Hillary Clinton's clear negligence and falsehoods about Benghazi after four Americans died, or her 2008 campaign claim to ""landing under sniper fire"" in Bosnia in 1996, or who showed respectful reverence for mass murderer and political sociopath Fidel Castro upon his death, or any number of other false narratives and outright lies the Big Media have either propagated or let stand.Yet, suddenly, after Donald Trump shocks the world by winning an election he wasn't supposed to win, the conservative, right-leaning media on the web and elsewhere are to blame. The left has taken it a step further, suggesting that Trump and the right-wing media in some sinister way worked with Russian President Vladimir Putin to defeat Hillary. The goal is to delegitimize Trump as president, as we've noted before. It's an old Democratic trick.Well, for the record, we're all for investigating Russian meddling in our election. But the record shows that that didn't decide the outcome. And this ""fake news"" panic has nothing to do with policing the truth, but everything to do with trying to shut down balanced political debate in this country.RELATED:Clinton Email Scandal: Hillary's Hypocrisy And Media's Bias RevealedWhy Did The Polls Get It Wrong?

1516,NOV,"Oil advanced to the highest since July 2015 Monday after Saudi Arabia signaled it's ready to cut output more than earlier agreed and non-OPEC countries including Russia pledged to pump less next year.Futures climbed 2.6% in New York and 2.5% in London. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said Saturday the biggest crude exporter will ""cut substantially to be below"" the target agreed on last month with members of OPEC. His comments followed a deal by 11 non-OPEC countries to join forces with the group and trim output by 558,000 barrels a day next year, the first pact between the rivals in 15 years.U.S. oil futures have gained almost 20% since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed on Nov. 30 to cut output for the first time in eight years. Saudi Arabia, which initiated OPEC's decision in 2014 to pump without limits, is leading efforts to regain control of the market. The OPEC and non-OPEC plan encompasses countries that produce about 60% of the world's crude.""The non-OPEC cut was expected but nobody foresaw the Saudi statement,"" Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York, said by telephone. ""The market's giving bonus points because the Saudis are willing to do whatever has to be done to balance the market. We wouldn't be up anywhere near as much on the agreement alone.""West Texas Intermediate for January delivery rose $1.33 to settle at $52.83 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It's the highest close since July 14, 2015. Total volume traded was about 81% higher than the 100-day average at 3 p.m. ET.Brent for February settlement climbed $1.36 to $55.69 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The contract closed at the highest since July 22, 2015. The global benchmark crude ended the session at a $1.94 premium to February WTI.""The main impact of the non-OPEC collaboration is to pull the global market into balance, if not in deficit, in the second quarter of 2017, rather than in the third quarter,"" said Sarah Emerson, managing director of ESAI Energy in Wakefield, Massachusetts. ""On an annual average basis, this pushed the global balance into a 200,000 to 300,000 barrel-a-day deficit for the year.""Oil and gas companies advanced in the U.S. and Europe. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), the biggest U.S. energy producers, climbed 1.9% and 0.7%, respectively, at 3 p.m. ET.""I can tell you with absolute certainty that effective Jan. 1 we're going to cut and cut substantially, to be below the level that we have committed to on Nov. 30,"" Al-Falih said Saturday in Vienna. The Saudi minister added that the country was ready to take production below 10 million barrels a day, a level it has sustained since March 2015.Al-Falih and his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak also revealed Saturday that they have been working for nearly a year on the agreement, meeting multiple times in secret. OPEC two weeks ago agreed to reduce its own production by 1.2 million barrels a day, and Saudi Arabia has long insisted that any cuts by the group be accompanied by action from other suppliers.""The Saudi statement show's they're really serious,"" Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Mass., said by telephone. ""There's little chance that they'll bail if things get difficult. It's clear they want to make this work.""Oil prices at $60 a barrel would be ""ideal"" for OPEC as higher levels risk sparking a recovery in competing supplies from the U.S., Nigerian Minister of State for Petroleum Emmanuel Kachikwu said in a Bloomberg Television interview.

1520,NOV,"VanEck Vectors Coal ETF is ending 2016 as one the year's winners as signs indicate that demand for coal should remain strong.But the ETF is showing signs it may need a break.The exchange traded fund has climbed about 150% from its January low — a price advance that has met little opposition. The ETF this week fell below the 50-day moving average for the first time since it broke out of a base in June. That marks a potential change in direction, but so far the drop has been mild enough that it leaves the possibility of a rebound. It would also give investors a chance to buy on a secondary buy area of support.One way to tell how an ETF is acting is by checking its main components. On that account, there are mixed signals.The fund's top holding, Teck Resources (TECK) with nearly 9% of the weighting, is in step with the ETF. It also dipped below the 50-day line this week. Teck, a Canadian mining company, is fighting to get back above the line, and success would bode well for the ETF.At the same time, two Australia-based stocks also have fallen modestly below the 50-day line this week. Aurizon Holdings is forming the right side of a base, while Whitehaven Coal slipped below support after a strong run this year.Other big holdings are not providing much direction. Some are flagging while others remain in price uptrends. Consol Energy (CNX), the only other major U.S. stock in the fund, failed a Nov. 30 breakout.The coal industry may be a pariah for clean-air advocates, but that hasn't done much to slow demand. Coal remains a major source of fuel for energy producers in many countries.China is the largest producer and consumer of coal-fired electrical power. China's coal-power generation capacity will grow as much as 19% over the next five years, even as the government tries to cut pervasive pollution in its skies, Bloomberg reported last month.Chinese companies make up 23% of VanEck Vectors Coal's portfolio, the largest of any single country.Some coal is used in steel making, and the surge in steel stocks since the U.S. election contributes to the outlook for coal.On Nov. 22, Teck Resources raised its forecast for steel making coal for the fourth quarter, citing strong spot prices. It saw the blended price for its products at $200 to $205 a ton, up from a forecast below $200. Its guidance for sales volume was unchanged at 6.5 million tons.Historically, the ETF has gone through major price run-ups and declines, including one that lasted from 2011 to January's low. Because of that steep slump, the ETF has an average annual return of -10.5% since its inception in January 2008. But 2016 has been the year to own it — it has more than doubled.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

1523,NOV,"Oracle (ORCL) shares were down Friday following mixed fiscal second-quarter results after the market close Thursday that beat on earnings but fell short on revenue.The enterprise software giant reported non-GAAP revenue of $9.07 billion, up 1% year over year and just below the consensus estimate of $9.14 billion. Earnings per share minus items of 61 cents was down 3% but a penny above views.But results showed continued progress in Oracle's transition to the cloud. Cloud software-as-a-service (SaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) non-GAAP revenue rose 87% to $912 million. Total cloud revenue reached $1.1 billion.Oracle stock sank 4.3% to 39.10 in the stock market today, falling below both its 200-day and 50-day moving averages, a bearish signal.Still, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Marshall Senk maintained a buy rating and 48 price target on Oracle stock.IBD'S TAKE: Oracle has been climbing the right side of a base-beside-a-base pattern since early November. Oracle has an IBD Composite Rating of 41, meaning it's underperforming 59% of stocks in the past year. To see which tech stocks are doing better, check out the IBD 50.""Our partner research does point to a significantly larger pipeline for the back half of (fiscal 2017), particularly in cloud ERP (enterprise resource planning) where we continue to see Oracle competing very effectively vs. both SAP (SAP) and Workday (WDAY),"" Senk wrote in a research note.Workday stock plunged 12.5% on Dec. 2 after the cloud software provider forecast current-quarter revenue and billings that disappointed amid growing competition.Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White maintained a buy rating and 47 price target on Oracle stock.""After Oracle's stock has flatlined from 10 quarters ago, we believe the worst of this cloud transition is behind the company,"" White wrote in a report. ""Taking a step back and analyzing Oracle's cloud performance today relative to 3-4 years ago, the progress the company has made during this time has defied all the skeptics, and the company has built a formidable cloud franchise.""Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis also maintained a buy rating. He has a price target of 45.""Our view on Oracle is pretty simple: Expectations are low and the stock is cheap enough that we think shares could appreciate on gradual multiple expansion as investors gain confidence in the firm's cloud traction,"" Davis wrote in his report.BMO Capital Markets maintained an outperform rating but lowered its price target to 45 from 46. ""We think Oracle had a mixed quarter, but on balance we thought there were more negatives than positives,"" wrote BMO analyst Keith Bachman.Oracle completed its $9.3 billion acquisition of NetSuite on Nov. 7.

1524,NOV,"The market may hate uncertainty, but it has reacted with unmistakable enthusiasm to the prospect of a political leader who is an unknown quantity. So have investors in exchange traded funds.Since the Nov. 8 election, major indexes have shot to record highs and investors have poured billions into ETFs. The rally has been fueled by optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's proposals of more government spending, less regulation of certain industries, and tax cuts.In recent interviews with IBD, two money pros expressed hope for the stock market going into the new year.Tempering this sentiment is their circumspect view of the Trump agenda, the earnings picture and the economic outlook.Philip Blancato of Ladenburg Thalmann discussed where he is looking to tap growth and where he is hunting for income as both hopefulness and wariness color his views. One of his top ETF ideas, VanEck Vectors Fallen Angel High Yield Bond (ANGL), outperformed in the past month and is among the ETF winners of 2016.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2016Brian Sterz of Miracle Mile Advisors identified some ETFs that could benefit most from the ""Trump bump"" in the markets.Here are the ETF investing pros in their own words:Philip Blancato is CEO and president of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York City. The registered investment advisory firm has $2.2 billion in assets under management.We are fairly optimistic about U.S. equities going into 2017, but not without caution. There still remains uncertainty on what President-elect Donald Trump will do, but the broad direction is pointing to the positive side.We believe the S&P 500 will eke out returns between 5% to 7% as the U.S. economy continues to expand at a modest rate between 2% and 2.5% and profits expand modestly.Volatility will be heightened more than its current level as markets trade more actively on the president-elect's announcements and actions.We also believe the Fed will raise rates in a gradual manner with two hikes at most in 2017. Given the concern surrounding rising rates, I chose two fixed-income ETFs with compelling cases.Additionally, active-management and smart-beta ETF strategies can be used to take advantage of price dislocations in less price efficient asset classes.VanEck Vectors Fallen Angel High Yield Bond (ANGL) invests in below-investment-grade corporate bonds that were rated investment grade at the time of their issuance.Higher-yielding bonds should be less affected by rising rates than your standard corporate bonds, which have lower yields. When interest rates increase, bonds with lower yields are less attractive than bonds with higher yields and as a result they can experience a more significant sell-off. So, higher coupons actually help to cushion the impact of rising interest rates.Further, ANGL invests in ""fallen angels,"" which are higher-quality, high-yield bonds that are trading at a discounted value when purchased. So, the majority of the selling of these bonds is already done before they are purchased, which makes these bonds even less interest-rate sensitive.Between Nov. 8 and Dec. 12, when the 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield increased from 1.88% to 2.49%, ANGL outperformed the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index by 3.96%. Also, high-yield bonds outperformed corporate bonds in 2013 during the ""Taper Tantrum"" period, when rates were increasing.ANGL invests in bonds that have had historically higher average credit quality than the broad high-yield bond universe. The yield is attractive in this low-interest-rate environment at 5.23%. And the ETF's current 27% allocation to the energy sector could be beneficial given OPEC's agreement to cut oil production.ANGL is up 23.66% this year through Nov. 30.Fidelity Total Bond (FBND), an actively managed ETF, is based off Fidelity's Total Bond Fund (FTBFX), which has a long-term track record of strong risk-adjusted returns. The strategy invests across various sectors, maturities and credit qualities to achieve a diversified core bond position.FBND has an attractive yield of 2.96% and a duration of 5.32 years. The ETF has navigated volatile fixed-income markets, and I believe its actively managed approach can adapt to future rate hikes. Year to date through Nov. 30, it returned 6.09%, outperforming the Barclay's Aggregate Bond Index.(Editor's note: FBND trades on average less than 50,000 shares a day. Ladenburg Thalmann says that, as long-term investors, they can be patient when trading in and out of an ETF to ensure they execute trades at reasonable prices.)JPMorgan Diversified Return International Equity (JPIN) is passively managed to an FTSE index developed by JP Morgan Asset Management to provide exposure to developed international equities.JPIN uses a top-down risk-allocation framework that equally distributes portfolio risk across 40 regional sectors. It ranks holdings with a focus on value, size, momentum and low-volatility factors. The construction methodology entails monthly rebalancing, liquidity screens and turnover constraints.Active management has a better chance of success in less price efficient asset classes like international equities. So we are willing to take some active bets through the use of smart-beta strategies like JPIN.Brian Sterz is an investment advisor at Miracle Mile Advisors, an RIA firm based in Los Angeles; AUM: $ 720 million.Despite the strong investment returns following the Brexit decline and, more recently, the U.S. election, we believe that domestic stock markets will be volatile next year but ultimately positive.Given that the Fed and most economists predict only modest GDP growth, and the Fed is set to again raise interest rates, stock market returns will be based on forecasts of what effect any tax and fiscal policy legislation will be able to achieve in 2018 and beyond.While the rhetoric is known, the substance is not yet, and the market will move based on perceptions of what will ultimately be passed. We see the S&P 500 ending next year at 2400, and small-cap stocks outperforming large peers, but with a high probability of a correction during the year.Dispersion is likely to increase, meaning that investors will have to pick their sectors and markets much more carefully than during these previous ""Fed driven"" years.The surprise of next year may be that Europe, trading at low valuations and even lower investor sentiment, may outperform U.S. stocks. Given the positive intermediate market responses to both England and Italy's populist referendums, there may be precedent for such follow-through across the region.SPDR Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) holds 58 stocks in the energy sector. Following OPEC production halts, and potentially firmer oil and gas prices, domestic exploration and production (E&P) companies are set to ramp up production.Given the turmoil in the industry over the past year, and subsequent cost and debt rationalization, these firms are set to generate dramatically increased profits given increased demand and decreased regulation.The sector performed well in 2016, though it has trailed the S&P 500 on a two- and five-year basis, and appears set to rebound sharply.SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) invests in homebuilders, home furnishers, home-improvement stores and the like. U.S. homebuilders are set to profit from an environment of encouraging housing data, limited supply of available housing stock, and increasing employment and wages.As the demand for new homes continues to outstrip supply, these firms are dramatically ramping up efforts to produce homes to sell. The sectors' revenues rose 20% in the first three quarters of 2016, and diversified builders are beginning to expand margins going into the new year.Despite this, stocks in the sector have not yet caught up to the fundamentals and may outperform going forward as they do.SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) invests in stocks that have borne the brunt of campaign rhetoric for more than a year and now trade at their lowest valuations in more than two years.Historically, these have made for strong entry points for long-term investors.We like the prospects for the industry as it is filled with innovators creating solutions to a constantly evolving collection of medical concerns.One could view the sector as a collection of venture investments, and owning a broad basket of these potential future market leaders is the best way to own them.ETFs such as iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) or SPDR Biotech are great ways to get this exposure. They include many of the smaller-market-cap, early-stage names that may be tremendously volatile before eventual large gains.For those who are looking for stable health care exposure, an ETF such as Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) holds a broader range of biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical-device stocks that, owned together, may offer a potentially smoother investor experience.RELATED:Which ETF Investment Strategies Are Right For You?

1525,NOV,"The massive sector rotation in the past month reminded ETF investors that while not all stocks move in tandem or with equal force at the same time, some stocks do. That simple fact underlies the popularity of sector rotation strategies.Gradient Investments' Tactical Rotation strategy is a momentum-driven, ETF-based investment approach that has successfully navigated not only the wild swings in the stock market in 2016, but also the bear market of 2007-09.The ETF holdings of the Gradient Tactical Rotation strategy recently included PowerShares S&P 500 High Beta Portfolio (SPHB), which is among the best-performing ETFs of 2016 to date.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2016In the first of a series of interviews with ETF strategists, IBD asked the portfolio manager behind the tactical rotation strategy what the momentum indicators are saying about global markets right now.Mariann Montagne a portfolio manager at Gradient Investments, a $1.1 billion money management firm based in Minnesota, replied that the United States is still the best place to be among global markets, as it has been all of this year.Montagne also discussed the strategy's methodology and performance in the interview. Here is what she said:IBD: What is your stock market outlook?Mariann Montagne: We are positive on the U.S. markets based on our fundamental outlook for earnings growth resumption.

We believe this earnings growth will accelerate into the last quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, with the S&P 500 likely gaining 5% to 10% in the coming year as these earnings increases come to fruition.IBD: Your Gradient Tactical Rotation (GTR) strategy straddles the active-passive divide in investing. How exactly?Montagne: We use quantitative measures to calculate price momentum among nine global market subsectors. The strategy uses (passive, index-tracking) ETFs to gain exposure to the offensive/high-beta stocks, the broad market, or defensive/low-volatility stocks, all tracked across three geographies: the U.S., international developed markets and emerging markets. We determine which subsector is currently displaying the strongest price momentum measured both on a shorter- and longer-term basis.Based on monthly results, it can move — or rotate — from one subsector of the global markets to another to catch the next wave of positive price momentum. Even though we hold just one ETF at a time, the GTR is well diversified with a minimum holding of 100 stocks in each ETF. If there is no positive momentum in any of the nine global subsectors, the GTR will rotate to an ETF comprised of 100% Treasury bills, which is essentially cash.IBD: What do investors like in this strategy?Montagne: The GTR has been successful in navigating a wide variety of market conditions over time. The fact that it has the option to move to 100% cash is also attractive to investors.IBD: The strategy seeks to beat the market by measuring momentum indicators. What are they saying about the markets right now?Montagne: From Oct. 1 through Nov. 30, the GTR strategy had been invested in the U.S. high beta or offensive sector of the U.S. market. We use PowerShares S&P 500 High Beta Portfolio (SPHB) to get that exposure. The holdings of this ETF are weighted toward the financial, energy and information technology sectors, which happened to be some of the best-performing sectors postelection. After a big high-beta rally in November, the strategy rotated to the broader-based U.S. market index for the month of December. We use iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV) for exposure.IBD: The strategy moves 100% to cash in sustained down markets. When has it done that before?Montagne: Going back to 2001, the only time the strategy/algorithm went to cash was at the end of June 2008, staying there exactly nine months. The rules-based process determined that the strategy re-enter the markets in April 2009. The quantitative process seeks to protect on the downside, and participate on the upside, by investing in strength and avoiding weak global market subsectors.IBD: How did it perform in the bear market of 2007 to 2009?Montagne: It rose roughly 45% in 2007 vs. a 5.5% gain for the S&P 500; dropped 24.5% in 2008, the year it went to cash, vs. a 37% decline for the S&P 500, and advanced roughly 104% in 2009 vs. 26.5 for the S&P 500.IBD: How else does it mitigate risk?Montagne: The GTR has the ability to rotate to a low beta geographic subsector when volatility is running high in other subsectors of the global stock markets. Thus, it can become defensive if the market is experiencing higher levels of volatility or in a sustained downturn.IBD: How has the strategy performed lately?Montagne: Year to date through Nov. 30, the strategy is up 19.75% net of investment management fees vs. a 9.81% gain for the S&P 500 and a 2.33% decline for the MSCI EAFE index. Our holdings in the defensive PowerShares S&P Low Volatility (SPLV), with its focus on higher quality, dividend-paying stocks, created outperformance in the first several months of the year, while the switch to the high-beta ETF added to that outperformance postelection.IBD: What else should investors know about GTR?Montagne: The GTR strategy is suitable for the growth allocation in an investor's overall portfolio. This is a proprietary strategy offered by Gradient Investments in the independent RIA channel. Our minimum investment is $25,000, and only IARs (Investment Advisory Representative) and RIAs (Registered Investment Advisor) associated with Gradient may offer this strategy to their investors.IBD: What are its assets and fees?Montagne: The GTR strategy has more than $260 mil in assets under management and fees are competitive within our industry.IBD: What key criteria do you use for investing in an ETF?Montagne: We generally prefer an ETF with assets exceeding $100 million, but the key is the liquidity of the underlying assets. Fees are dependent upon services offered, and we continually seek out competitive ETFs with lower fees.RELATED:Which ETF Investment Strategies Are Right For You?

1526,NOV,"In the first 20 trading days after the presidential election, businessman and President-elect Donald Trump could already lay claim to a title.The Trump stock market got off to its best start since Reagan in 1980 and Clinton in 1992. The No. 1 rank, among those three, depends on which index is used. As first impressions go, Trump was the king of the small-cap Russell 2000, up 14% in his first 20 days. Clinton was the champ of the Nasdaq, up 8% in the first four weeks after his election. Reagan was the general on the large-cap S&P 500, up 6% in the first four weeks.Obama and the two Bushes got negative receptions in their first 20 trading days.Can Trump bring back the Reagan-like exuberance? A first impression can fade to an unremarkable performance in a month or two. Yet Reagan and Trump might share one big thing in common: Reagan's presidency coincided with the start of a supercycle in August 1982. As noted in the front-page article of IBD Weekly during the week of Nov. 14, some market watchers say the same thing could happen to Trump.The challenge is spotting a new reality quickly enough to profit from it. How is that best done?For stock pickers, broadly based indexes aren't a particularly good way to find anything specifically useful in the presidential stock-market story. A better gauge is to look at which industry groups thrived and which sagged during a presidency. This tells individual investors where money is flowing.And it could point the way to stock-market winners, as the Trump presidency unfolds over the next few years.IBD studied the past five presidents and how they did in each industry group. The results included some surprises, along with a sense of how much or how little presidents matter to the stock market.Five factors emerged in relation to how the stock market reacts to a president:Confidence: President Reagan, probably the most optimistic of the five presidents, communicated confidence. Retail is the sector that benefits most directly from consumer confidence, and Reagan is the only president with two of his top four industry groups from the retail sector. Retail-Super/Mini rose 738% and Retail-Department Stories 640% from October 1980 to October 1988. (Results were scanned with Oct. 31 as the cutoff date in order to include reactions to a candidate's win and to eliminate at least part of the lame-duck window.)Innovation: A president has no role to play in engineering new products. But when inventions lead to breakthrough products and the companies become rewarding investments in the stock market, a president can help by getting out of the way and keeping others out of the way. President Clinton signed the Internet Tax Freedom Act in 1998. The Internet-Content group rocketed 1,240% during the Clinton presidency.Obstacles: A president's economic policies can provide obstacles to both a particular industry and sometimes the whole economy. President Obama's administration essentially declared economic war on coal and on for-profit education. Over eight years, the coal group's stock price dropped 46% and for-profit schools slid 48%. In a less direct way, President George W. Bush's spending policies probably harmed the economy. Federal government spending increased 70%, and Bush vetoed few bills. Of the five presidents, George W. Bush had the highest percentage of industry groups that turned in a negative return (30.7%).Incentives and deregulation: The top-performing industry group under Reagan was generic drugs, which rose 859%. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 made generic drugs more accessible, cutting prices for consumers. According to the medical journal ""Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica,"" only 13% of prescriptions in the U.S. were for generics in 1983. By 2012, generics accounted for 84% of prescriptions.Unintended consequences: Obama probably did more for the firearms business by accident — with his high-profile opposition — than any gun rights advocate ever did on purpose. Consumers, who were afraid of seeing access to firearms abridged, stepped up and bought more firearms than they otherwise might have. Smith & Wesson (SWHC) and Sturm Ruger (RGR), the only two publicly traded firearms stocks, rose 1,050% and 832% in the Obama era.After the election of Trump, who is regarded as more friendly to gun rights, the stock prices of Smith & Wesson and Sturm Ruger dropped as much as 28% and 27%, respectively, before recovering some of the losses. (For purposes of this article, we treat the firearms stocks as if they were an IBD industry group rather than a small part of the Security/Safety industry group: The move in firearm stocks was too big to be ignored.)How should individual investors handle the so-called Trump stock market?So far, savings and loans, banks, and semiconductors have been the leading sectors. Metals, transports and building have been the fastest-rising sectors. You can track the leading sectors by going to the IBD Data Tables feature inside the Stock Lists section at Investors.com, then click on ""Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables.""But there's no guarantee that those groups will ultimately be the biggest winners under Trump.The groups that ultimately lead during the Trump presidency may not be evident at first. If individual investors are to profit handsomely in the Trump years, they should regularly monitor upward moves among sectors and IBD's 197 industry groups (within the Data Tables, click on ""Industry Sub-Group Rankings""). The best stocks tend to show excellent industry sector and group strength. That's why IBD's stock tables are organized by top-ranking sectors first.The addition of new industry groups also should be watched. For example, some groups, such as Retail-Internet, didn't exist in the Reagan era.Without knowledge of how sectors and groups are performing, identifying the hottest sectors, the hottest industry groups and the hottest individual stocks in a timely fashion would be very difficult.As always, investors should follow IBD's standard advice on stock selection: Wait for a strong market uptrend; identify the top groups or sectors in that uptrend; buy the leaders within the favored area; don't buy too far extended past a proper breakout point; monitor the best stocks for new bases, breakouts and buy opportunities.DATA ON FIVE PRESIDENTS AND THE STOCK MARKETThe First 20 Trading DaysTrump: Russell 2000, up 14%; Dow, 7%; S&P 500, 5%; Nasdaq, 4%Obama: Russell 2000, -17%; Nasdaq, -16%; S&P 500, -13%; Dow, -11%Bush II: Nasdaq, -18%; Russell 2000, 8%; S&P 500, 6%; Dow, -3%Clinton: Nasdaq, 8%; Russell 2000, 7%; S&P 500, 2%; Dow, 1%Bush I: Dow, 1%; S&P 500, 1%; Nasdaq, -1%; Russell 2000, -1%Reagan: S&P 500, 6%; Nasdaq, 6%; Dow, 4%; Russell 2000, not available—The list below shows the best-performing industry groups for each president from Reagan through Obama.

1527,NOV,"The past year has been a breakout one for Veeva Systems (VEEV) — doubly so if you look at its stock chart.The cloud-based software company, which develops applications for the life sciences industry, aims to displace legacy on-premise systems that make compliance with FDA and other international regulations especially painful and time-consuming. Veeva first made a splash with its customer relationship management software for drug sales reps. Now it's capitalizing on its strong position providing cloud-based content management for drug trials, where it faces competition from Medidata Solutions (MDSO), another cloud-based software company, and Oracle (ORCL).Growth has been robust, with sales gains gradually trending up to 34% in its October quarter. Despite a recent pullback, Veeva stock has advanced 44% in 2016, leaving behind a two-year trading range as its market position caught up with the hype surrounding its 2013 IPO.In 2016, Veeva expanded into tracking quality control processes for drug manufacturing. IBD talked to Veeva CEO Peter Gassner about the big picture behind Veeva's success and key milestones ahead for the company in 2017 and beyond.IBD: You have said that the life sciences industry ""has to move off legacy systems to the cloud."" Why is that, and how far along is that process?Gassner: It's a long-term process, but they have to move over time because really the best applications are in the cloud. That's where all the innovation is going, that's where all the venture-capital investment, that's where all the best technology people are doing things.A large pharmaceutical company, let's say one in the top 10, they will have over 5,000 people globally, both people inside their company and outside their company, collaborating around the process of executing these trials, literally around the globe — from China and Japan to Europe to Latin America and the United States, and you just can't do that effectively without a system designed for that.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Veeva Systems cleared a buy point at 42.68 on Nov. 23 on the heels of a strong fiscal third-quarter earnings report. But the stock gave back a 12% gain as it plunged back to its buy point five days later, a sell signal. Wait for the stock to regroup and form another price consolidation before considering buying shares. IBD Leaderboard keeps tabs on leading stocks like Veeva to help you spot buying opportunities as they emerge and sell signals to lock-in profits.The majority of the mission-critical systems in life sciences are still not in the cloud. They're still on premise. Not all things can be changed at once. It's still early. But if you look at the chief information officers of the pharmaceutical companies, most of them have what's called a cloud-first strategy. When they have to get a better application because there are some operational inefficiencies, they will absolutely look to the cloud first. And the reason is basically, with the cloud, if you get on a cloud application, not only is it likely to be better, but it's always going to be up to date. You don't have to upgrade your servers and do things like that. You just subscribe to it and it's always going to be up to date.IBD:  Veeva has announced a series of products coming to market for 2017, including Vault CTMS (clinical trial management), EDC (electronic data capture) and eSource in 2017. Explain how these products will build on your existing capabilities to expand your market opportunity.Gassner: What Veeva's done is we've built this (cloud application) platform called Vault, and that's the (content management) platform we used to develop these applications. We've been perfecting that platform over the past four or five years and it's pretty good and efficient now, and that's why we're able to develop these applications pretty quickly.We're now the first company that will have a full suite for clinical operations (CTMS, study start up, electronic trial master file) and also clinical data management, which is EDC and eSource. There's actually no other company that has that full suite of applications all on one common platform. Customers would like a common platform if they can get it, because then they have a common way of operating it. They have a common trust in that platform and they know that Veeva will do the necessary integration points between these applications, so they can really get a suite of applications for operating their clinical trials and that's really not been possible before. EDC and eSource expand our market by $1 billion and that brings our total addressable market to $7 billion.IBD: You set a goal in 2015 for Veeva to top $1 billion in revenue in 2020 from life sciences customers. With revenue jumping 34% in the third quarter to $142.8 million, are you running ahead of schedule?Gassner: We set the goal of a $1 billion revenue run rate in 2020 and at our analyst day in September, we did say that we're increasingly confident in that because we're actually tracking slightly ahead in Veeva Vault and we're on track in commercial cloud. So overall, we are slightly ahead of our plan. So that's pretty good to set out a plan and execute to the plan. That's what we do. We're proud about that. How we're getting there is by focusing on the customer success first and then our employee success second, because if you look at being a billion-dollar company with then plenty of room to grow after that into a multi-billion-dollar company, we're at 1,700-plus employees now. We need more employees than that to get us there, right? And it's about how do we build that great team.  The one thing I feel really confident about is our strategy is right on. We know the products we need to build and sell and get to a leadership position in. Now we just have to execute.IBD: What impact, if any, do you see on the life sciences industry and Veeva's market opportunity from the outcome of the U.S. elections and the recently passed 21st Century Cures Act?Gassner: I don't really see any major impact on technology based on this year's election. In terms of the 21st Century Cures Act, that's a little different because, I think, the science of healthcare is definitely advancing faster than ever before. I think there will be increased discussion with the regulators. That will end up being positive for the industry overall, because what it will do is get the industry and regulators more aligned because they both want to get the right treatments to the right patients as quickly as they can. When that happens, there's more value transferred from the industry to the population, there's less friction and it should be better for the industry. So what I'm pleased about is the discussion, the open-mindedness, the realization that, wow, our processes need to evolve, now that we have genomics, personalized medicine, cures for breakthrough things. So I think it will be positive for the industry, but like all new policies, we just have to wait and see how it plays out.IBD: While Veeva is focused on fully capitalizing on the large life sciences market, will 2017 be the year in which Veeva seeks to expand outside of life sciences and into other highly regulated markets?Gassner: We have our Vault platform, and we're developing a lot of good applications on that, and a few of those are applicable outside of life sciences.

1528,NOV,"Advancements in driverless-car technology will be revealed by Mobileye (MBLY) and partner Delphi Automotive (DLPH) at the CES show in Las Vegas next month.Mobileye, a developer of advanced driver-assistance technology, hooked up with auto supplier Delphi in August after it parted ways with Tesla Motors (TSLA) in July. The pair will jointly develop off-the-shelf autonomous driving technology for automakers.Earlier, Mobileye joined Intel (INTC) and BMW (BMWYY) in another partnership to develop a fully automated driving system.Mobileye's core product is chip and software technology that provides image processing and analysis used in cars with camera-based systems for assisted driving, such as automatic braking.At the CES show in Las Vegas Jan. 5-8, Mobileye and Delphi plan to showcase their autonomous-driving technology with a 6.3-mile drive on highways and surface streets, using prototype vehicles. Mobileye will also reveal the progress it has made with mapping technology, which is the best in the business, Dan Galves, Mobileye's senior vice president of communications, said in a briefing Thursday morning.IBD'S TAKE: Despite safety questions, the self-driving-car era is arriving fast, perhaps this decade. Automakers and tech companies are plowing billions of dollars into research and forging alliances in a rush for the inside lane on the automobile's most revolutionary track since the Ford Model T a century ago.Mobileye, Intel and BMW aim to deliver a fully automated all-electric vehicle by 2021. Intel will provide a broad set of technologies, including machine learning and artificial intelligence. Mobileye is providing chips and software. BMW says this partnership is the foundation for BMW Group's autonomous-driving strategy, as it plans for fleets of fully autonomous vehicles.Mobileye's CES briefing comes just days after Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) said it separated its self-driving car efforts into a new company, called Waymo, but under the Alphabet umbrella. The new Waymo unit also confirmed that it isn't trying to be a carmaker, but will focus instead on technology that enables autonomy. John Krafcik, the former auto exec who has led Alphabet's driverless-car project for the past several years, will stay as Waymo's CEO.Apple's rumored car project is also reportedly headed in a similar direction as Waymo, after initially contemplating development of a car and self-driving systems. Apple has publicly acknowledged its interest in autonomous vehicles, telling transportation regulators that its work could revolutionize the ""future of transportation.""Apple hasn't confirmed a specific project related to autonomous cars. But in a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Nov. 22, Apple said it is ""investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.""Mobileye's split with Tesla was a result of the fatal crash involving a Tesla Model S that was using Autopilot mode, and for ""pushing the envelope in terms of safety"" with Autopilot, Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua said in September.Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the split was ""inevitable,"" and suggested Mobileye was holding Tesla back, with Tesla focusing on radar technologies and away from the camera technologies backed by Mobileye.Mobileye stock rose 0.51% to 35.29 in the stock market today but is trading below its 10-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages. RELATED:Mobileye Beats Q3 Earnings Estimates, Investors ShrugMobileye To Race Tesla, Google, Nvidia In Car Mapping Data

It' s now just 3% shy of eclipsing an all-time peak of 250.70 set in October 2007, before the ""Great Recession"" bear market of 2008 to early 2009. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) rallied nearly 2% to 85.99; the Wall Street and consumer and business lending giant has now risen more than 32% past a 65.08 cup with handle that formed within its large bottoming base.Volume was running sharply higher on both main exchanges vs. the same time Wednesday.In the stock market today, a flurry of tech industry groups, as seen in IBD's daily ranking of 197 industry groups, showed heavy buying demand by institutions. Top tech industry groups for the day included medical software (up more than 6%), fiber optic telecom (up more than 2%), computer hardware and peripherals (+2%), fabless semiconductor (+1.8%) and semiconductor manufacturing (+1.8%).Perhaps the market perceives the latest hike in short-term interest rates as having a minimal impact on companies' growth prospects in 2017.Apple got a boost in part by bullish comments from analysts at Needham as the investment bank called it a top pick for 2017 and forecast a 30% price gain in shares.Apple, which originally pushed past a 110.33 cup-with-handle buy point on Sept. 14 within a long bottoming base pattern, rallied as much as 7.5% before retreating below that proper entry. But in November, Apple showed fortitude with a strong bounce off the 200-day line. And last week, shares thrust back above the 50-day moving average, a key signal of renewed demand from big fund managers.The Accumulation/Distribution Rating for Apple has improved to a bullish B-, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The rating tracks price and volume changes over the past 13 weeks to give users an idea of whether a stock is under net accumulation or net distribution.In the fabless semiconductor industry group, Semtech (SMTC) continues to act well after shares cleared a 28.30 cup-base buy point on Nov. 23. The stock gained 0.9% to 32.45 on Thursday, rising more than 15% past the proper entry, so it's extended for now. Intraday, shares made a new 52-week high of 33.25.For nearly a week, volume stayed quiet following Semtech's breakout. However, turnover bulged 473% above the 50-day average on Dec. 1 and shares jumped more than 3.5% after the expert designer in mixed-signal integrated circuits reported a 95% surge in October-ended fiscal Q3 earnings to 37 cents a share, nearly 3% above the consensus view.The gain stretched a streak of accelerating growth to three quarters. Earnings dropped 50% in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year, then rose 11% and 46% the following two periods.Sales grew 18% to $137 million, marking a third quarter of accelerating growth (following a drop of 9%, then gains of 1% and 8%). Wall Street sees Semtech's earnings per share rising 58% to $1.36 in fiscal 2017, then climbing an additional 21% to $1.65 in fiscal 2018, ending in January that year.On the downside, apparel makers slid hard. Under Armour (UAA) dropped sharply for the third time in four sessions, sinking 2.4% to 30.91. An attempt to rally back above the key 50-day moving average last week failed.The sportswear leader has shown impressive fundamentals that include 26 straight quarters of 20%-plus top-line growth. Yet the Baltimore-based firm faced a fast-changing brick-and-mortar retailing landscape as UA's key partner, Sports Authority, decided earlier this year not to pursue restructuring and keep some of its shops open.While Under Armour operates its own trademark and outlet stores, the bulk of its revenue comes from the wholesale channel. In Q3, sales in that segment grew 19% to $1.01 billion, while direct-to-consumer sales jumped 29%. International net revenue surged 80% on a currency-neutral basis.Keep track of the uptrend's health by monitoring IBD's The Big Picture column as well as IBD ETF Market Strategy, which offers subscribers signals on whether to be 100% invested in a diversified equity-index-tracking exchange traded fund, 50% invested, or fully in cash.RELATED:Will Tesla Motors Join Apple As A Future Stock Breakout?What Is The Bottoming Base Pattern, And Why Apple May Form One AgainThe Bottoming Base Pattern, Part II: How Apple Formed One In 2009The Case For A Trump Era Secular Bull Run; Which Sectors Will Thrive In 2017?

Muse upgraded Nvidia stock to buy from hold and set a price target of 120, up from 87. Nvidia stock jumped 5.8% to 96.45 on the stock market today, though the overall market slumped late after the Fed raised interest rates, as expected, and indicated more hikes would happen in 2017. Nvidia stock hit an all-time high of 96.62 on Dec. 8 and has nearly tripled this year.Nvidia, a member of the IBD 50, has been on a tear since Nov. 11 after it reported fiscal Q3 sales and earnings that crushed estimates and guided higher for the current quarter.Best known for making graphics processors for PCs and video game consoles, Nvidia has branched into new markets like data centers and auto infotainment systems.

1538,NOV,"Oil tumbled Wednesday as the dollar climbed against its peers after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time this year.Futures fell 3.7% in New York after closing at a 17-month high on Tuesday. The Fed also forecast a steeper path for rising borrowing costs in 2017. The advance of the greenback reduced investor appetite for raw materials priced in the U.S. currency. Prices dropped earlier after a government report showed that crude supplies at the biggest U.S. storage hub rose to a six-month high.Oil has gained about 15% since the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed Nov. 30 to trim output for the first time in eight years. A deal reached over the weekend in Vienna to secure supply cuts from 11 non-OPEC producers means the accord encompasses countries that produce about 60% of the world's crude.""The Fed announcement is strengthening the dollar and that's driving crude,"" Gene McGillian, manager of market research for Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn., said by telephone. ""The market has reacted positively to the OPEC agreement. Some of the optimism has worn off because we have to see them make the cuts and inventories are way too high.""West Texas Intermediate oil for January delivery dropped $1.94 to close at $51.04 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract climbed to $52.98 on Tuesday, the highest settlement since July 14, 2015. Total volume traded was about 36% above the 100-day average at 3:01 p.m ET.Brent for February settlement fell $1.82, or 3.3%, to $53.90 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude closed at a $1.81 premium to February WTI.Crude stockpiles at Cushing, Okla., the delivery point for WTI, rose by 1.22 million barrels to 66.5 million in the week ended Dec. 9, according to the Energy Information Administration. The hub had a working capacity of 77.1 million barrels as on Sept,. 30, according to the agency.""The build at Cushing left supplies at 66.5 million, which is getting close enough to operational limits to raise concerns,"" said Thomas Finlon, director of Energy Analytics Group in Wellington, Fla., said by telephone. ""If the gains persist, we would soon be looking at a tricky situation.""Nationwide inventories declined 2.56 million barrels to 485.8 million. Supplies are at the highest seasonal level in more than three decades, according to EIA data. A 1.5 million barrel decrease was forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, and a 4.68 million barrel gain was reported Tuesday by the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute.""We're up an awful lot and the market was due for a pullback,"" said Bill O'Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis.

1539,NOV,"Japan's parliament passed a bill legalizing casinos early on Thursday, paving the way for billions of dollars of potential investment after years of political wrangling.The revised casino bill was passed in both houses, Kyodo News reported, after hours of delaying tactics by the opposition. Details of the so-called integrated resorts must be laid out in a separate implementation bill before any casinos can be built — meaning none is likely to open its doors in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.International gaming companies have been mulling investments in Japan amid a boom in tourism, particularly from China. Wynn Resorts (WYNN), MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) are among the operators that have expressed interest. Opening two integrated resorts in major population centers could bring in $10 billion in revenue, with potential for $30 billion if they spread across the country, according to a report by CLSA this month.""This is a landmark occasion and should be a shot in the arm as it relates to investor sentiment in all gaming names that could be players in Japan,"" Grant Govertsen, an analyst at Union Gaming, said in a research note.Some members of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's junior coalition partner Komeito, which is backed by a Buddhist group, have been reluctant to accept legalization because of concerns over gambling addiction and money laundering. A duty to tackle addiction is included in the revised bill, as is a requirement to review legalization within five years.""We have to pay close attention to the implementation bill,"" said Satoshi Sakamoto, who has been tapped by Konami Holdings Corp. to head a new company in Japan to invest in casinos after the legislation passes. ""If we are going to have casinos in Japan, we will establish the best regulations in the world, along with the personnel and systems to enforce them. It's important that we create facilities where guests have a safe and pleasant experience.""Japan already allows gambling on horse, boat and bicycle racing, while the pinball-like game of pachinko has spawned its own addicts. A survey published by public broadcaster NHK this week found only 12% of respondents were in favor of lifting the casino ban, with 44% opposed and the remainder unsure.The bill was previously abandoned after being submitted to Parliament in 2013 and debate was delayed after a second submission last year. It was rushed through this session after discussion was reopened on Nov. 30.Komeito leader Natsuo Yamaguchi was quoted by Kyodo News as saying earlier this month many people felt the discussion period had been too short. With a majority in both houses, Abe's LDP no longer needs Komeito to help it pass legislation, although it does rely on its ally for electoral support.Yokohama and Osaka have been touted as potential venues for the first casino resorts, while Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike has not come out clearly in favor of a venue in the capital.

1540,NOV,"Stocks opened modestly higher Wednesday. A surprise surge in producer prices and a slowdown in retail sales had little impact on trading, as investors focused on the Federal Reserve's policy announcement this afternoon.The Nasdaq climbed 0.1% while the Dow industrials and S&P 500 were up a fraction.Markets generally expect a quarter-point hike in the Fed's target interest rate to 0.50%-0.75%. The move follows a quarter-point increase a year-ago — the Fed's first increase since June 2006. The more intense scrutiny is likely to be on any sense of whether the regulators plan additional rate hikes in the coming year, and at what pace. The policy announcement is scheduled for 2 p.m. ET, followed by a press conference with Chairwoman Janet Yellen at 2:30 p.m. ET.Nvidia (NVDA) opened 1% higher, rising after Evercore ISIS Group upgraded the stock to buy, from hold, and gave it a price target of 120. Nvidia ended Tuesday at 91.17. The stock has been consolidating for four weeks, following a powerful rebound from support at its 10-week moving average.Nordson (NDSN) snapped 6% higher at the open. The maker of industrial adhesive and coating systems' fiscal fourth-quarter sales and earnings blew past analyst expectations, and management raised its first-quarter guidance to above consensus views. The stock, which has a daily dollar volume of $24 million, ended Tuesday in a buy range above a 102.30 buy point from a flat base.General Motors (GM) dived 2.5% in early action. News reports said General Motors' joint venture in China was under investigation by China's National Development and Reform Commission for possible antitrust violations. GM shares ended Tuesday near new highs, after exiting a 13-month consolidation.Qualcomm (QCOM) slipped 0.5% after JPMorgan Chase trimmed the stock to neutral from overweight. Qualcomm is forming a flat base with a 71.72 buy point.The growth of retail sales slowed to 0.1% in November, the Commerce Department said, down from October's 0.6% gain and well below expectations for a 0.4% advance. Minus autos and gas, sales rose 0.2%, also down from 0.6% in October and below projections for a 0.3% increase.The Labor Department reported prices paid to producers jumped 0.4% in November. That was a big step above October's flat performance, as well as the 0.2% gain expected by analyst consensus. Prices were also up 0.4% minus food and energy, vs. a 0.2% slip last month, and topping views for a 0.2% increase.The Federal Reserve reports November industrial production and capacity data at 9:15 a.m. ET.At 10 a.m. ET the market gets October business inventories data from the Commerce Department, followed by weekly crude oil supply numbers from the Energy Information Administration at 10:30 a.m. ET.Oil futures backed off after a four-day advance and ahead of the this morning's weekly inventories report from the EIA. West Texas Intermediate dipped 1% to near $52 a barrel. Brent crude hovered around $55.Gold edged up 0.5% to above $1,164 an ounce, but remains in a downtrend and has declined 11% since a Nov. 2 high. The dollar weakened, with the U.S. Dollar Index holding about even so far for December.

1541,NOV,"AMAG Pharmaceuticals (AMAG) has the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for preterm birth, but a key doctor has high hopes digoxin immune fab (Digibind) could gain rampant adoption in pre-eclampsia.Dr. Garrett Lam was on a call Monday with Needham analyst Serge Belanger and investors to discuss AMAG's Makena. Makena is a hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection used to lower the risk of preterm birth in women with a history of it.Outside Makena, Lam sees promise in the use of Digibind for pre-eclampsia. AMAG entered into an exclusive agreement with Velo Bio in July 2015 to acquire the rights to the orphan drug upon completion of a phase 2b/3 study, likely to wrap up in 2018.Digibind, an antidote to a digoxin overdose, has shown promise in pre-eclampsia in the past. A 2008 study by Protherics showed the drug preserved renal function, but didn't have a noticeable impact on hypertensives. Infants on Digiband fared well.IBD'S TAKE: AMAG stock is ranked second in its 421-company IBD industry group, behind Biospecifics Technologies. To see the group's other top performers, visit the Stock Checkup.Protherics was later acquired by BTG. A BTG spokesperson told IBD that BTG stopped development on the drug and rights reverted to the originator, Glenveigh Pharma. BTG was uncertain whether Glenveigh continued Protherics' pre-eclampsia research.""Dr. Lam expects that a product like DIF (Digibind), if shown to be effective and eventually approved by the FDA, would see wide use pre-eclampsia given the overall lack of effective treatments,"" Belanger wrote in a research report.In the meantime, AMAG has the market pegged on preventing preterm birth with Makena. But the company will experience better growth on expanding market access and reimbursements, Belanger says. He has a buy rating and 40 price target on the AMAG stock.The company is working on a subcutaneous auto-injector for Makena that could see traction given patients must now make weekly visits to a clinic for injections. Plus, its cord blood unit is seeing growth and are often seen as ""insurance policies.""AMAG stock closed up 1.5% at 34.50 on the stock market today, as it continued a four-day run in the black. Shares hit a buy point of 29.69 on Nov. 9, and are now nearing profit-taking territory.RELATEDAMAG Pharma Acquiring Stem-Cell Bank For $700 MillionNew Highs Plentiful; 'Trump Trade' Continues In Many Names

1543,NOV,"Small business owners are more upbeat, with optimism surging after Election Day, according to National Federation of Independent Business data released Tuesday.The NFIB's small business optimism index rose 3.5 points to 98.4, the highest since the cycle peak in December 2014. But that masks the sentiment shift after Donald Trump won the presidential election and Republicans retained control of Congress.""What a difference a day makes,"" said Juanita Duggan, NFIB President and CEO. ""Before Election Day small business owners' optimism was flat, and after Election Day it soared.""A net 15% of companies plan to add staff, up from 10%. But job creation plans shot up from a net 9% through Nov. 8 to 23% after Election Day. A net 20% of small business owners expect higher sales postelection, up from 4% in early November.Most notably, a net 38% expected business conditions to improve after Trump's victory vs. -6% through Nov. 8. That's the highest since November 2004.""If higher optimism can be sustained, I expect that in the coming months we'll see an increase in business activity, such as hiring and expanding,"" said NFIB chief economist William Dunkelberg.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose to a 10-year high in December, even with Democrat sentiment falling.Stock markets have rallied as investors see corporate tax reform, regulatory relief and perhaps ObamaCare repeal. Small businesses have even more to cheer.Unlike multinational giants, especially techs such as Apple (AAPL) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) that have vast intellectual property assets, small firms can't sidestep the taxman via complex, global tax-minimization schemes. So lower business tax rates will have a big impact on their after-tax profits.Also, Trump and a GOP Congress could eliminate or slash the estate tax, a huge issue for small business owners.Regulatory relief would have outsized benefits on smaller firms, which lack dedicated staff focused on compliance with complex and costly rules.""Small business owners are clearly encouraged by the election results, but now it's time for President-elect Trump and congressional leaders to deliver,"" said Duggan. ""Federal taxes, regulations, and ObamaCare are the three biggest impediments to running a small business in America.""Trump carries risks for business, but more for corporate titans than Main Street minnows. Small businesses have less to fear from Trump's protectionist instincts than S&P 500 companies that have big exports, imports and overseas operations. And Trump isn't likely to single out a small firm for public criticism.Trump in recent days has blasted Boeing (BA) over Air Force One presidential jet replacement costs and the ""out of control"" F-35 by Lockheed Martin (LMT). He's criticized and later reached a deal with United Technologies (UTX) over Carrier jobs in Indiana heading to Mexico.

1544,NOV,"An 11-word phrase omitted from an Alexion Pharmaceuticals' (ALXN) statement could be telling in the wake of the unexpected departures of former Chief Executive David Hallal and Chief Financial Officer Vikas Sinha, RBC analyst Simos Simeonidis said Tuesday.Before Monday's resignations of Hallal and Sinha, Alexion had announced an internal probe into allegations by a former employee that some personnel ""engaged in sales practices that were inconsistent with company policies and procedures"" revolving around orders placed for the immunosuppressant Soliris. At the time, Alexion said it hadn't identified ""instances where Soliris orders were not placed by customers for patients.""But that latter phrase was missing from Monday's press release announcing the executives' departure, Simeonidis said. It was unclear what the possible ethics breach might be, leaving analysts to piece together what issues the company faced.""We believe that the omission of the (phrase) from Monday's press release may point to what could be behind yesterday's management changes,"" Simeonidis wrote in a research note. He has an outperform rating and 188 price target on Alexion stock.Hallal and Sinha exited Alexion on Monday, prompting the stock to dive as much as 16.9% before settling down 12.9% at the closing bell. On the stock market today, Alexion stock fell another 4.4% to 110.01, touching a three-year low for a second straight day.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs have nearly lapped a rally following the election of Donald Trump who, last week, said he would tackle rising drug prices. Could your biotech picks get quashed in the fallout?Alexion postponed filing its quarterly 10-Q on Nov. 9 as a result of the ongoing investigation. The company expects to file the document for the quarter ended Sept. 30 in January. On Monday, it said former  (AZN)AstraZeneca CEO David Brennan will replace Hallal on an interim basis. And ex-Honeywell (HON) CFO David Anderson will permanently succeed Vikas.Simeonidis estimates Soliris sales for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome represent a 115 price target. For the third quarter, reported Oct. 27, Soliris sales in those two segments represented 91% of $799 million in worldwide sales.A change in Soliris sales practices could be devastating, Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison wrote in a research report. Harrison downgraded Alexion stock to equal weight from an overweight rating. Management indicated the probe centers on sales recognition and accounting, he noted.This suggests ""limited risk to patient recruitment and field selling practices, (but) modest inflections in factors such as Soliris future growth which could be impacted by changes in selling practices or ability to access certain markets,"" he wrote.However, Harrison finds Alexion's next-generation Soliris, ALXN1210, encouraging. The drug has a seemingly better profile with less frequent dosing vs. Soliris. Furthermore, management's ability to move patients onto the next-generation platform could give Soliris a tail beyond its patent expiration in 2021.RELATED:AMAG Pharma Up On Preeclampsia Drug Potential; Stock On Four-Day Run

1547,NOV,"Call it the Donald Trump effect. As charitable donors open their wallets during this year-end giving season, signs show some are experiencing more than just the usual motives for giving.Sure, at least some Americans are well-fixed to donate, given the booming stock market and low jobless rate.But in the wake of Donald Trump's election as president, signs show new political urges pumping up the giving action. And experts say those postelection factors have both long and short-term implications.Key politically linked moves this year-end: Amid concern about the future of social programs, data show some donors racing to support favorite organizations. And all the while, experts say the prospect for tax reform has been firing up some accountants and advisors: Sensing fewer tax benefits of giving ahead, some are suggesting higher-income clients boost their charitable giving in 2016.IBD'S TAKE: Want to make your charitable donations stretch further? IBD Leaderboard provides you with top-performing stocks that can expand your charitable portfolio. On the social front, data show support ballooning lately for some causes and groups. Some examples: Between the day after the election and Nov. 28, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) drew more than $15 million of donations. On Nov. 29, which was Giving Tuesday, donations to the ACLU hit $1.72- million, which was 965% higher than the group obtained last year on Giving Tuesday.At the Sierra Club, online donations this November reached $1.8 million. That was 852% higher than online donations the same month last year.But for many high net worth donors, a different issue — the prospect of major tax reform — is also drawing attention this year-end. As experts explain, many wealthier donors value the tax incentives available for charitable giving. Should these enticements be trimmed, as seems likely, giving by the wealthy (whose donations comprise a large chunk of all charitable giving) could drop.As C. Eugene Steuerle, of the Tax Policy Center, sees it, ""There is some probability there will be a tax bill in 2017."" He believes that ""If what was stated in the presidential campaign is put into effect, charitable giving could fall at least 4.5% to as much as 9%, or between $13.5 billion and $26.1 billion in 2017.""Key aspects of the Trump Tax Plan that experts believe affect charitable giving: cuts in federal taxes, with the highest marginal income tax rate trimmed to 33% from 39.6% (which is also included in the House Republicans' tax reform blueprint.); a cap on tax deductions ($200,000 for married tax filers, $100,000 for single filers); and a boost to the standard tax deduction.Of course, it's still unclear what tax changes might occur. Nonetheless, some advisors suggest donors act now to capitalize on today's tax benefits.  For those who itemize tax deductions, some suggest boosting their giving — pushing into 2016 donations planned for future years.As Elda Di Re, partner at accounting firm Ernst & Young, sees it, ""Uncertainty around tax reform is having a huge impact on giving by high net worth individuals. Those in the highest federal tax bracket feel that, this year, the benefit of tax deductions could be better than they'll ever see again.""She provides this illustration: ""Let's say you give $100,000 to charity.  For those in the top 39.6% federal tax bracket, the tax deduction on that gift now saves you $39,600 in taxes. If the tax rate falls to 33%, you save a lesser $33,000.""Thus, Di Re recommends, ""If you are in the top tax bracket, accelerate your charitable contributions, (advancing them) to this year.""To help with some of these, and other, tax issues, some advisors recommend using a donor-advised fund (DAF) as a giving vehicle. This philanthropic tool, sponsored by a public charity, allows donors to be eligible for an immediate tax benefit for contributions into their DAF account. Donors can give ""cash, publicly traded stock or illiquid assets,"" points out Karla Valas, a managing director of Fidelity Charitable, administrator of Fidelity's DAF. But there's no pressure to pick a recipient charity before year-end: DAF users can recommend over time which nonprofits they wish to support.Given the hot stock market, some believe DAFs could prove especially useful this year. The thinking: If investors put appreciated shares held for more than a year in a DAF account, they could get a tax deduction this year on the fair market value of the shares, without needing to pay capital gains tax on the gift.

1549,NOV,"Mutual fund company T. Rowe Price has a positive outlook on the economy and stock market, tempered by unknowns about the Trump presidency's impact in these areas.The risk of recession is low next year, the U.S. economy should continue to grow at a 2% clip and the U.S. stock market seems reasonably valued with a current forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16.8, said the experts at T. Rowe Price (TROW). The big fund company, with $812.9 billion in assets under management, gave its views at its 2017 Global Market Outlook in New York Nov. 17.T. Rowe's chief U.S. economist Alan Levenson said the U.S. economy's expansion ""has room to run"" and forecast gross domestic product will grow 2% next year and possibly another 2% in 2018 depending on the policies enacted by the new Trump administration. He said the threat of recession next year is ""vanishingly low,"" but the possibility increases in two to three years.""It's difficult to discern what the president-elect will do as president,"" said Levenson. ""There is some hint that the line on trade has softened from what it was during the campaign, but on immigration it's hard to tell.""The appointment of Jeff Sessions as Attorney General leads him to believe that a hard line will be pursued on immigration and there is no evidence that they will back away from that. Levenson said that trade restrictions, such as renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, and a tough immigration regime would be more negative for the economy and have a greater effect to the downside earlier in the year than tax cuts and fiscal stimulus would have to the upside.However, he suggested that President-elect Trump might be getting the message that he'd be doing lot of damage to U.S. businesses and jobs by imposing immigration restraints.""If I could confidently take that off the negative side of the ledger, that would make me feel better about next year, but right now there is a lot of uncertainty,"" the economist said. ""I have a lot more confidence on tax reform than on the spending side, because the GOP wants tax reform too.""Larry Puglia, the portfolio manager of $32.6 billion T. Rowe's Blue Chip Growth Fund (TRBCX) as well as its U.S. Large-Cap Core Growth Portfolios, said the market is reasonably valued based on the 25-year averages of a number of traditional measures of the S&P 500. The forward P/E ratio was 16.8 on Sept. 30, compared with the 25-year average of 15.8. Although the market has moved up since the election, it's still fairly valued, he said. Price-to-book is 2.6 compared with the average of 2.9, and the dividend yield is 2.2% compared with the average of 2.0%.""Valuation is not unreasonable and should not preclude the market from going up,"" said Puglia. ""Investors should follow a pattern of consistent investing. We don't think we're in a bubble.""IBD'S TAKE: Whether the market is overvalued or undervalued, it usually pays to know the strongest stocks driving the market now. You'll find them in IBD Leaderboard.He said parts of the market had gotten expensive, such as utilities, telecommunications and consumer staples, but they had corrected significantly and are no longer extended. Still these are not areas he favors. He likes information technology, financials, health care and industrials. However, industrials have had a big run up since the election and health care remains controversial as the fate of ObamaCare and Medicare remain uncertain.Puglia said small-cap stocks rallied hard after the election and now large-cap stocks look more attractive. And large-cap growth looks more attractive compared with large-cap value stocks.With stock dividends yielding nearly the same as the 10-year Treasury bond, about 2.2%, Puglia said that makes stocks more attractive than bonds.As for rising interest rates, when 10-year Treasury yields are below 5%, rising rates have historically been associated with rising stock prices.
"
1550,NOV,"""When yields move up, stocks perform well too. That's what the analysis says,"" said Puglia. ""Few people think Treasuries will move above 5%, so that means we have a lot of running room for the rates to go up and for stock to do well.""""I think this election is potentially quite important,"" said Puglia. ""The economic policy proposed by Trump, such as cutting tax rates and lessening regulation and an infrastructure program could have a favorable impact on stocks and could bring a long bull market. But there's a lot of uncertainty, because we have to be careful not to foment a trade war.""RELATED:Top Fund Holds Stocks Suited For Trump EraSpecial Report: Dividend And Income Investing

1551,NOV,"The November election hit the reset button for the stock market, and for MFS Mid Cap Growth Fund's holdings as well, including Nvidia and Domino's Pizza.""In February, the market was expecting a GDP slowdown or even a recession,"" said Paul Gordon, a co-manager of $2 billion MFS Mid Cap Growth Fund (OTCIX). ""Today, the market expectations are for an improvement in GDP growth. It's a complete 180-degree turn.""The change in sentiment boosts the outlook for many growth-oriented stocks, particularly small and midcap stocks, which have been outperforming larger cap stocks since the election. Since Nov. 4, iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) is up 18%, iShares Core S&P MidCap ETF (IJH) is up 14% and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) is up 9%.MFS Mid Cap Growth, which looks for companies best positioned for growth several years hence and which have misread valuations, benefited from the shift in the market's tastes in market cap. It also holds stocks whose sectors were impacted by the election results. Several were already in MFS Midcap Growth's portfolio before November.One is Parsley Energy (PE), which is exploring and developing oil and gas in west Texas and southeastern New Mexico. Another is Gartner (IT), an information technology provider.Energy stocks have received a boost from president-elect Trump's stated support for that sector as well as from OPEC's deal to cut production. Gartner is a technology company that got 62% of its 2015 revenue from the U.S. and Canada. Despite its overseas exposure, the midcap stock does not strike many investors as the sort of high-profile tech name that is likely to draw retaliation in the event of a Trump-triggered trade war.Parsley was up 101% this year going into Dec. 14.It has a very strong 94 Composite Rating from IBD. The fund's current stake first appeared in the portfolio's Sept. 30 disclosure. ""Parsley operates in the Permian basin,"" Gordon said. ""We think it has an attractive cost position. They have attractive inventory, such that it should enable them to have years of profitable growth.""Gartner sells research and consulting to companies, mainly to their IT departments. ""Gartner helps a company decide what technology to buy and what price to pay, so you quickly get a return on (what you pay to Gartner),"" Gordon said. ""Gartner's cost is a small percent of a customer's IT budget, but they are important to an IT department. They have an opportunity to grow the number of customers they have and the amount of products that each customer purchases.""Gartner's service is bought on a subscription basis, ""so it has nice recurring revenues and can typically price-up every year,"" Gordon added. Gartner has a so-so 79 Comp Rating.Among holdings that are not Trump-era plays, IBD Leaderboard stock Domino's Pizza (DPZ) is up 45% so far this year. That leaves shares extended.Earnings per share grew 10%, 21% and 43% the past three quarters.""Our thesis is that the pizza market is highly fragmented,"" Gordon said. ""What's changed is that Dominos has started to leverage its scale to drive market share. They have an app. Once it gets on a phone, it's very sticky and makes ordering pizza very easy. And it's very hard for the mom-and-pop stores to compete with that.""Nvidia's (NVDA) EPS growth has speeded up for five straight quarters. The company is driven by three business lines. ""The big winner has been its online gaming,"" Gordon said. ""It's also growing sales to data centers."" In addition, it is driven by the market for its autonomous driving products, Gordon says.IBD'S TAKE: Check out IBD's Stock Checkup to see what growth metrics it takes for Nvidia and Inphi to be the Nos. 1 and 4 stocks in our Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group.Gaming provides 60% of sales. That's nice, Gordon says, adding that it makes the company vulnerable to a slowdown in that business segment. But he does not foresee such a development.Inphi (IPHI) is a newcomer to the portfolio. Up 61% this year, shares are fighting to stay above their 10-week moving average.The stock sports a sterling Comp Rating of 97. EPS grew 13%, 50%, 20% and 142% the past four quarters.""It's an analog semiconductor business that we think has a multiyear opportunity with its product cycle in optical,"" Gordon said, referring to the use of Inphi products in high-speed telecom and internet networks.""By virtue of being an analog business,"" he added, ""it has above-average barriers to entry by competitors. Its opportunity to grow at an above-market speed is for several years.""MFS Mid Cap Growth was up 6.10% this year going into Wednesday.

1555,NOV,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted loss of 18 cents per share, much wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 4 cents. Lower contribution from all segments led to the poor show. Operating profit from the Rig Technologies segment totaled $18 million, way below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $34.81 million. Further, operating profit from the Completion & Production Solutions segment was $16 million, lagging the estimate of $26.55 million. Operating profit of $12 million at Wellbore Technologies also fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.88 million.The bottom line also compared unfavorably with the last report’s loss of 4 cents. On the bright side, loss per share narrowed 43.7% from the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year improvement was led by robust performance by the onshore-levered Wellbore Technologies segment.Total revenues of $1,795 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,853 million.

QuoteSegmental PerformanceRig Technologies: Revenues came in at $483 million compared with $582 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting a decline of 17%. Revenues at the segment also declined 21.3% sequentially. Slowdown in new offshore rig construction led to the weak performance.The unit’s adjusted EBITDA was $45 million, slightly lower than $47 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. The segment’s EBITDA fell 35.7% sequentially, affected by low orders.Wellbore Technologies: The segment’s revenues rose 28.1% year over year to $711 million. Strong demand from greater market adoption of the unit’s superior technology services drove revenues. However, revenues showed a marginal drop from $715 million recorded in the prior quarter owing to reduced activities in the Eastern Hemisphere, partly offset by robust growth in the Western Hemisphere.Importantly, the unit improved significantly from last year’s adjusted EBITDA of $38 million to $103 million on the back of higher volumes and pricing gains. However, the figure was lower than the prior-quarter’s $107 million.   Completion & Production Solutions: Revenues at the segment were $670 million, up from $648 million in the year-ago quarter. However, the top line was lower than $690 million in the last report due to client associated equipment deferrals.The unit recorded adjusted EBITDA of $73 million, down from $77 million and $74 million in the year-ago quarter and prior quarter, respectively.BacklogCapital equipment order backlog for Rig Technologies was $2,050 million as of Mar 31, 2018, including $201 million worth of new orders.Moreover, the Completion & Production Solutions segment reported a backlog of $1,010 million in capital equipment order at the end of the first quarter.

1556,NOV,"It was a week where both oil and natural gas finished lower.On the news front, Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) struck a pact to unload its Canadian natural gas gathering and processing businesses C$4.31 billion ($3.3 billion), while Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) plans to put most of its oil and gas fields in the ageing North Sea for sale.Overall, it wasn’t a good week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged down 0.5% to close at $73.80 per barrel, natural gas prices fell around 2.3% to $2.858 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: BP, Baker Hughes, EQT & More)The U.S. crude benchmark slipped for the first time in three weeks following a shock build in domestic inventories and rise in the oil drilling rig count. President Donald Trump’s tweet demanding action by OPEC to calm rising oil prices also played spoilsport.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved southward last week following a larger-than-expected increase in supplies.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Enbridge Inc. is expected to raise C$4.31 billion ($3.3 billion) from the divestiture of its Canadian natural gas gathering and processing (G&P) business to Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P.The assets include G&P units in the Montney, Peace River Arch, Horn River and Liard basins in British Columbia and Alberta. The G&P units have a total operating capacity of 3.3 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) and 3,550 kilometer of natural gas gathering pipelines. It comprises 19 natural gas processing plants and liquids handling facilities.The proceeds from this transaction will help Enbridge pare its C$61.2 billion debt load that it assumed following last year’s Spectra Energy buy. The latest deal takes the company’s divestments to C$7.5 billion for this year – significantly above the targeted C$3 billion.2.    Chevron is set to put up many of its North Sea oil and gas assets for sale, in a bid to streamline portfolio. The assets it intends to offload include Britannia and its satellites, along with Alba, Alder, Captain, Elgin/Franklin and Erskine fields. The move is part of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Chevron’s strategic review of global portfolio to determine the competitiveness of all its projects. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The decision seems to be a prudent one as extracting oil from North Sea is not so economical because production costs are much higher than the returns. Even other biggies like Bp plc and Royal Dutch Shell plc have jettisoned their non-core assets in the region. Early last year, Shell offloaded a large chunk of its North Sea assets to smaller rival Chrysaor Holdings Ltd. for $3.8 billion. BP also divested 25% of stake in the Magnus Field to EnQuest PLC.Notably, output from North Sea accounts for just about 3% of Chevron’s total production, providing around 50,000 barrels of oil and 155 million cubic feet of natural gas a day. Instead, the company wants to sharpen its focus on the lucrative shale exploration in Permian, along with some of its major projects in the Gulf of Mexico and Kazakhstan.

However, a delay in the recovery of international oilfield development activities has compelled the company to cut its guidance. Hence, it now expects total revenues in the band of $174-$175 million against the prior guided range of $177-$179 million. It now anticipates EPS within 57-58 cents.Core Laboratories’ Reservoir Description unit will bear the brunt of reduced revenues as most (almost 85%) of the segment’s income is based on international activity levels. Delayed activities in the North Sea, Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions as well as the Gulf of Mexico will impact its revenues.Higher ramp-up costs related to deployment of new laboratory technology and infrastructure are also expected to hurt the segment’s operating income.

1557,NOV,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal to form a joint venture (JV) with Saudi Aramco for manufacturing onshore rigs and equipment in Saudi Arabia. The latest development will brighten prospects of the energy services sector in Saudi Arabia and boost future growth potential of National Oilwell.The Rig-Building JV DealThe JV, which will serve as a major hub for high-specification rigs with breakthrough technologies, aims to construct up to 10 onshore drilling rigs annually. It will also supply advanced drilling equipment, spare parts and packages for jack-up rigs, along with providing repair and maintenance services for the sophisticated drilling technologies.Located at Ras Al Khair on the kingdom’s east coast, the facility will lead to the creation of around 1,000 jobs.

The tie-up is also supported by Saudi Aramco’s partnership with Nabors Industries Limited (NBR  -  Free Report), which has already agreed to purchase 50 onshore rigs over a period of 10 years.Deal Motive for Saudi AramcoWith the deal leading to the creation of high-specification land rigs along with providing after-market services in Saudi Arabia, it will advance the kingdom’s oil services industry. It will help in encouraging trade with locally produced goods and services. Of late, Saudi Aramco has entered into strategic alliances with various U.S. oil companies including Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Weatherford International PLC, among others, to promote bilateral business between the two countries.The deal is in sync with Saudi Arabia’s reform program “Vision 3030,” as the JV will bolster the kingdom’s manufacturing capabilities, and spur economic diversification along with the creation of jobs. Under the reform plan, the country aims to fuel economic modernization and foreign investment. Saudi Aramco’s plans for IPO are also part of Vision 3030, as the company intends to diversify globally.While the IPO-offering plans have made a slow progress, the company is gearing up for downstream efforts, and aiming to maximize value by making investments in refineries and chemical plants. Saudi Arabia is taking a keen interest in investing in Texas petrochemical plants, and the refineries in Corpus Christi and Port Arthur. In fact, it is planning to invest $18 billion in its U.S. subsidiary, Motiva Enterprises LLC's Port Arthur refinery that has a processing capacity of 603,000 barrels of crude per day.Just a week ago, Saudi Aramco announced its collaboration with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) to foray into the retail petroleum business in India. Both the company signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with a consortium of three Indian national oil companies for investing in the development of $44-billion mega refinery in Ratnagiri.Encouraging Prospects of National OilwellNational Oilwell Varco is one of the biggest manufacturers of drilling equipment in the world, boasting an impressive business model. Strong demand for the firm’s onshore-focused Wellbore unit offers strong upside potential. The latest JV with Saudi Aramco is expected to boost the prospects of National Oilwell going forward, thereby driving revenues and earnings.While offshore-levered Rig Technologies is still bearing the brunt of reduced activities and declining backlog, the gradual uptick in the oil prices is likely to spur a recovery in the offshore segment in the coming period. In fact, last month, National Oilwell inked a deal to acquire a Dutch offshore rig design and engineering company, GustoMSC, boosting the former’s supply chain. The deal is considered as a vertical integration. The acquisition strengthens National Oilwell’s hold in the offshore industry, expanding equipment-providing business to the upstream companies.National Oilwell currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1558,NOV,"It was a week where oil prices tumbled to their lowest levels since April. However, natural gas futures edged closer to the psychologically important $3 level.On the news front, energy biggie Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) outlined plans to double earnings by 2025 in its annual meeting and European peer Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) announced early production start-up at the Kaikias subsea development in the Gulf of Mexico. Meanwhile, Pedro Parente abruptly resigned from the position of CEO of Brazil’s Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report).Overall, it was another mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 3.1% to close at $65.81 per barrel, natural gas prices edged up some 0.8% to $2.962 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Shell's GoM Find, Cheniere's FID on Train 3 & More)The U.S. oil benchmark slumped for the second week on fears of supply increase, bearish EIA inventory numbers, and soaring rig count.Oil futures fell after reports emerged that Saudi Arabia and Russia were in discussion to step up output amid reduced supply from Iran and Venezuela.The commodity was also spooked by the federal government’s EIA report that revealed increases in refined product inventories - gasoline and distillate. On a further bearish note, the report revealed that U.S. output edged up 44,000 barrels per day last week to 10.77 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs climbing – this time by 2 following a large increase of 15 last week – brought further downside.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved northward last week. Apart from the weekly inventory release showing a smaller-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies, the commodity got a leg up from rising power sector demand.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    In its annual meeting, ExxonMobil Corporation announced its intention to increase earnings by more than two-fold by 2025 and address the risks of climate change.ExxonMobil’s plan will be especially aided by lower-cost-of-supply investments in U.S. tight oil, deepwater and liquefied natural gas (LNG). This will be backed by a group of industry-leading technologies comprising advanced seismology, integrated reservoir modeling and data analytics.ExxonMobil plans to boost tight oil production by fivefold in the U.S. Permian Basin. The company will also bring online 25 projects globally that will add volumes of more than 1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day. About 10 billion oil-equivalent barrels was added to its resource base in 2017 in locations including the Permian, Guyana, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea and Brazil.Recently, the company announced plans to reduce greenhouse emission by 2020. ExxonMobil targets a 15% cut in methane emissions and a 25% deduction in flaring from levels in 2016. Since 2000, the company has spent more than $9 billion on lower-emission energy solutions that have enabled it to achieve 10% improvement in energy efficiency across global refining operations.

The European oil giant recently announced that the first phase of its deepwater Kaikias project in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) has become functional and that too one year prior to the scheduled date. The first phase of the project is expected to produce up to 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.The Kaikias project is a joint venture undertaken by Shell and MOEX North America, a subsidiary of Tokyo-based Mitsui Oil Exploration Co. Shell holds 80% operating interest in the project, while the remaining 20% stake is held by MOEX North America. Kaikias is estimated to hold more than 100 million barrels of oil equivalent and the project is set to develop in two phases.Shell took the final investment decision (FID) on the project in March 2017 and has been betting on cost and technology efficiencies to make the project more competitive since then. Notably, it has managed to lower the cost of Kaikias by 30% since the FID on the project. Simplified well designs, along with utilization of the existing oil/gas processing equipment and subsea umbilicals brought down the costs. While the total cost of the project has not been disclosed; Shell expects to push breakeven oil prices lower than $30 per barrel.3.    Petrobras’s shares declined more than 20% in the mid-day trading to eventually close at $10.13 (14.6% down) on Jun 1, after the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s CEO Pedro Parente stepped down from his position. Following his resignation, the Brazilian real also weakened against the dollar, sparking fear over the country’s economy. The CEO’s resignation came in the wake of the nationwide trucker strike in Brazil, which had strangled the country’s economy for more than a week. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In an attempt to resolve the truckers’ strike in Brazil, the government intervened on May 23 to temporarily lower diesel prices at the pump by 10% along with freezing the prices for 60 days.Parente believed that the strike had challenged the implemented pricing policy, which is depicted in a statement during his resignation. Per the statement, his role “as CEO had stopped being positive and the government needed to consider alternatives to its pricing policy going forward”.Ivan Monteiro will be serving as the interim CEO after Parente’s resignation. Monteiro has been the CFO of Petrobras since 2015, supervising the company’s successful debt-reduction attempts. He had also led the initial public offering of the company’s fuel-distribution unit, Petrobras Distribuidora S.A. that managed to raise $1.5 billion.

(NOV  -  Free Report) recently agreed to acquire a Dutch rig design and engineering company, GustoMSC. The deal is expected to enable Houston, TX-based National Oilwell to expand its equipment-providing business to the upstream companies. The financial details of the deal are yet to be disclosed.GustoMSC’s designs are present in 10% of the jackup fleet and 8% of the floater fleet, both of which are currently active globally. Hence, the acquisition strengthens equipment provider, National Oilwell’s hold in the offshore industry. Moreover, with the recent improvement in the oil-price environment, the deep-water energy sector is expected to bounce back, making National Oilwell’s move even more profitable in the coming days.Additionally, the acquisition is expected to help the company enhance its jack up equipment, geophysical gear transporting skids and other vessels, with the services designed to broaden its portfolio. The move boosts National Oilwell’s supply chain and is considered as a vertical integration. Furthermore, along with providing offshore oil and gas services, GustoMSC also serves the wind markets.(Read more Is National Oilwell's GustoMSC Acquisition Beneficial?)5.    Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) recently decided to break the OneLNG joint venture (JV) with Golar LNG Limited, primarily due to financial delays. The JV was created to develop the offshore Fortuna LNG project in Equatorial Guinea, in association with Ophir Energy Plc. The project is located in the Block R, operated by Ophir.Although the development plan of the project was ready way back, finding attractive debt financing for the project and finalizing on the investment decision got delayed. The JV was created in July 2016, in which Schlumberger holds 49% stake. The JV holds 66.2% interest in the Joint Operating Company — which was created to develop the offshore Fortuna FLNG project — and Ophir owns the rest of the stake. The total cost of the Fortuna project is anticipated to be around $2.1 billion.With oil price on the rise, the profitability of the project has increased. Yet, the final investment decision failed to meet the previously announced timelines. Focusing on the project would only block Schlumberger’s resources, which the company can use in other projects.

1559,NOV,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) recently agreed to acquire a Dutch rig design and engineering company, GustoMSC. The deal is expected to enable Houston, TX-based National Oilwell to expand its equipment-providing business to the upstream companies. The financial details of the deal are yet to be disclosed.Per Rystad Energy, an energy consultancy and data-providing firm, GustoMSC’s designs are present in 10% of the jackup fleet and 8% of the floater fleet, both of which are currently active globally. Hence, the acquisition strengthens equipment provider, National Oilwell’s hold in the offshore industry. Moreover, with the recent improvement in the oil-price environment, the deep-water energy sector is expected to bounce back, making National Oilwell’s move even more profitable in the coming days.Additionally, the acquisition is expected to help the company enhance its jack up equipment, geophysical gear transporting skids and other vessels, with the services designed to broaden its portfolio. The move boosts National Oilwell’s supply chain and is considered as a vertical integration. Furthermore, along with providing offshore oil and gas services, GustoMSC also serves the wind markets.Notably, in 2012, Parcom Capital, a private-equity firm from Netherlands, bought GustoMSC for around $185 million. National Oilwell’s strong balance sheet, with cash and cash equivalents of $1,236 million as of Mar 31, 2018 and a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 16.1% — much lower than the industry’s 63.4% — can support the acquisition.Price PerformanceNational Oilwell has gained 27.1% in the past year compared with 9.3% growth of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, National Oilwell carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the Energy sector can opt for some better-ranked stocks in the same space like Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report), Delek US Holdings, Inc.

1560,NOV,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 9.5% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is NOV due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.First-Quarter 2018 ResultsNational Oilwell Varco reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted loss of 18 cents per share, much wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 4 cents. Lower contribution from all segments led to the poor show. Operating profit from the Rig Technologies segment totaled $18 million, way below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $34.81 million. Further, operating profit from the Completion & Production Solutions segment was $16 million, lagging the estimate of $26.55 million. Operating profit of $12 million at Wellbore Technologies also fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.88 million.The bottom line also compared unfavorably with the last report’s loss of 4 cents. On the bright side, loss per share narrowed 43.7% from the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year improvement was led by robust performance by the onshore-levered Wellbore Technologies segment.Total revenues of $1,795 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,853 million. Revenues also declined 8.8% sequentially. However, the top line improved nominally from the year-ago $1,741 million.Segmental PerformanceRig Technologies: Revenues came in at $483 million compared with $582 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting a decline of 17%. Revenues at the segment also declined 21.3% sequentially. Slowdown in new offshore rig construction led to the weak performance.The unit’s adjusted EBITDA was $45 million, slightly lower than $47 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. The segment’s EBITDA fell 35.7% sequentially, affected by low orders.Wellbore Technologies: The segment’s revenues rose 28.1% year over year to $711 million. Strong demand from greater market adoption of the unit’s superior technology services drove revenues. However, revenues showed a marginal drop from $715 million recorded in the prior quarter owing to reduced activities in the Eastern Hemisphere, partly offset by robust growth in the Western Hemisphere.Importantly, the unit improved significantly from last year’s adjusted EBITDA of $38 million to $103 million on the back of higher volumes and pricing gains. However, the figure was lower than the prior-quarter’s $107 million.  Completion & Production Solutions: Revenues at the segment were $670 million, up from $648 million in the year-ago quarter. However, the top line was lower than $690 million in the last report due to client associated equipment deferrals.The unit recorded adjusted EBITDA of $73 million, down from $77 million and $74 million in the year-ago quarter and prior quarter, respectively.BacklogCapital equipment order backlog for Rig Technologies was $2,050 million as of Mar 31, 2018, including $201 million worth of new orders.Moreover, the Completion & Production Solutions segment reported a backlog of $1,010 million in capital equipment order at the end of the first quarter. The figure included $324 million of new orders.Balance SheetAs of Mar 31, 2018, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $1,236 million and long-term debt of $2,707 million. The debt-to-capitalization ratio was around 16.1%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been five revisions higher for the current quarter compared to four lower. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted by 31.2% due to these changes.National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and Consensus  National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and Consensus | National Oilwell Varco, Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, NOV has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum is doing a bit better with a D. Following the exact same course, the stock was also allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate investors will probably be better served looking elsewhere.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, NOV has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

1561,NOV,"Results from 179 S&P 500 members are already out, bearing evidence to a strong start this earnings season.Picture This FarPer the latest Earnings Trends report dated Apr 20, 87 S&P 500 members have already reported results with their total earnings up 25% from the same period last year on 10.7% higher revenues. Notably, 82.8% of the firms surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings, while 67.8% topped revenue estimates.So far, just five of the energy companies on the S&P 500 index have reported their Q1 results. These include Halliburton Company, Kinder Morgan, Inc., Schlumberger Limited, Baker Hughes and Hess Corporation.Both the oilfield services players, Schlumberger and Halliburton met earnings estimates, indicating that the North American drilling market remains robust, driven by increased activity. Kinder Morgan delivered an earnings beat on the back of increased contribution from the liquid terminals and Texas Interstate System. Further, Baker Hughes and Hess Corporation also delivered better than expected results.Year-over-Year Gain Leads to Bullish ExpectationsA look back at the last earnings season reflects that earnings for the energy sector saw the strongest growth, recording a massive 136.6% year-over-year gain on 23.6% higher revenues.Also, for the first quarter of 2018, we expect the energy sector to eclipse all the 16 Zacks sectors. Per our expectations, earnings for the sector are expected to jump 59.6% from first-quarter 2017, while the top line is likely to witness an improvement of 15.9% from the year-ago levels.What’s Going in Favor of the Energy SectorThe first quarter of the year saw the U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014, despite record high domestic production. Per EIA data, the commodity rose about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018 to finish the quarter at $64.87 per barrel. It goes without saying that all oil-related stocks are thus poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices, as they will be able to extract more value for their products.Crude was supported by various catalysts, including strong demand and continued production curb from OPEC and its allies. Needless to say, such favorable developments have buoyed investors’ optimism surrounding the sector’s first-quarter results.Stocks’ Earnings to Watch on Apr 26Let’s find out what’s in store for the below-mentioned five energy companies that are slated to release their quarterly numbers on Apr 26.Contract drilling services provider Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) is expected to report fiscal second-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell.In the preceding quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 85.71% on the back of higher drilling activities at its U.S. Land Segment. Further, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 37.06% in the last four quarters.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase its odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Our proven model shows that Helmerich & Payne is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The company has an Earnings ESP of +16.93% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Recovering commodity prices along with higher rig utilization in Helmerich & Payne’s largest segment — U.S. Land segment — are expected to buoy the results this quarter also. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Helmerich & Payne’s largest segment’s operating income is pegged at $27.51 million, up from the last quarter’s figure of $24.75 million and the year-ago quarter’s operating loss of $51.85 million. (Read More: Can Helmerich & Payne Deliver a Beat in Q2 Earnings?)Pittsburgh, PA-based integrated energy company EQT Corporation (EQT  -  Free Report) is slated to come up with January-March operational results before the opening bell.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, EQT — an Appalachia-focused natural gas firm, with primary focus on production and midstream operations — has a decent record, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate just once in the last four reports.For this quarter as well, our model predicts an earnings beat as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of +18.59%.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the average daily sales volume for the first quarter is pegged at 3,959 million cubic feet equivalent per day (MMcfe/d), higher than 3,200 MMcfe/d in the preceding quarter and 2,110 MMcfe/d in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the Production segment is pegged at $371 million, reflecting an increase from $267 million in the last quarter and $257 million in the year-ago quarter.( Read more: EQT Corp Gears Up for Q1 Earnings: A Beat in Store?)The largest independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products in the United States, Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report), is another company to come up with quarterly numbers before the opening bell.The company boasts an excellent track record of having outperformed estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 10.26%.However, our model indicates that Valero Energy’s earnings streak might come to a halt this time around, as the company does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients. While the company carries a Zacks Rank #3, its negative Earnings ESP of 4.58% makes surprise prediction difficult.While improved refining margins and tax reform benefits bode well for the downstream operator, unplanned downtime and weather-related issues might affect Valero’s bottom line in the first quarter of 2018. (Read More: What to Expect From Valero Energy in Q1 Earnings?)Then there is Houston, TX-based exploration and production major, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), coming up with first-quarter numbers tomorrow, before the opening bell.ConocoPhillips has an average positive earnings surprise of 144.45% in the trailing four quarters. Our model indicates that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time around too, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.62%.Higher expectations for prices of natural gas, natural gas liquid and crude oil will likely favor the company’s first-quarter earnings.Lastly there is Houston-based, National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report), another energy company set to report results after the closing bell.  Last quarter, the company met the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 4 cents. In the trailing four quarters, National Oilwell witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 6.9%, without missing any estimates.Our proven model does not show that National Oilwell is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -20.00%.Apparently, National Oilwell even warned investors that its first-quarter 2018 revenues are expected to miss expectations primarily due to declined progress in new offshore rig construction as well as client-associated equipment deferrals. The company expects its revenues to come in at $1.8 billion in the first quarter, reflecting 3.4% year-over-year decline.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it.

1562,NOV,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results after the closing bell on Apr 26.Houston, TX-based National Oilwell is a world leader in the designing, manufacturing and selling of comprehensive systems, components, products and equipment used in oil and gas drilling and production worldwide.Last quarter, the company met the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 4 cents. In the trailing four quarters, the company witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 6.9%, without missing any estimates. This can be attributed to cost-reduction initiatives and improved efficiencies. This quarter, the company is expected to report a loss of 4 cents as well.National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | National Oilwell Varco, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayPrices of oil at the end of January to March quarter of 2018 were $62.73 per barrel, up about 8.4% sequentially and 27.2% from the year-ago period, amid improving demand outlook and OPEC-production cut deal. The energy equipment supplier is likely to realize the benefit of recovering commodity price environment.In the last reported quarter, the company reconstituted its offshore-focused business segments by combining Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarkets into a single unit named Rig Technologies, to reduce administrative burden of the company, aligning it better with evolving market conditions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Completion & Production Solutions segment’s first-quarter operating profit is pegged at $26.55 million, up from $8 million in the year-ago period and $19 million in the last reported quarter. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Wellbore Technologies’ first-quarter operating profit is $18.88 million, up from operating loss of $21 million and $57 million sequentially and year over year, respectively.However, the company recently warned investors that the company's first-quarter 2018 revenues are expected to miss expectations primarily due to declined progress in new offshore rig construction as well as client-associated equipment deferrals. The company expects its revenues to come in at $1.8 billion in the first quarter, reflecting 3.4% year-over-year decline. It is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.889 billion.Also, sequential shipments of subsea production equipment declined during the end of the first quarter, which can hurt the company's top line. Moreover, National Oilwell’s adjusted EBITDA is now anticipated to reach about $160 million, down from $197 million sequentially.What Does Our Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that National Oilwell is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP represent the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. National Oilwell has an ESP of -22.73% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 5 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 4 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: National Oilwell carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank of #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Energy Stocks with Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies from the energy space which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Frisco, TX-based Comstock Resources, Inc. (CRK  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #2 with an Earnings ESP of +37.34%. The company will report earnings on May 14.Houston, TX-based Oil States International, Inc.

1563,NOV,"It was a week where both oil and natural gas finished higher.On the news front, U.S. supermajor Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) gave its go-ahead to the $5.1 billion second stage of its massive Gorgon LNG project in Western Australia, while oilfield service providers McDermott International, Inc. (MDR  -  Free Report) and National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) provided first-quarter operational updates.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained around 8.6% to close at $67.39 per barrel, while natural gas prices rose 1.3% to $2.735 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: RDS.A & SM's Divestment Deals, KMI's Project Suspension & More)The U.S. oil benchmark settled at a three-year high last week on renewed geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and reports of strong OPEC compliance with the supply pact.Crude literally took off following news of U.S.-led military strike against Syria and gained further when Saudi Arabia claimed to have intercepted missiles fired by Yemeni rebels.Apart from the geopolitical risk premium, the commodity was also supported by a bullish ‘Oil Market Report’ by energy consultative body IEA. The agency, in its April publication, said that OPEC and its allies have been largely successful in erasing the global oil stock surplus through their high compliance rates on production curbs.Natural gas prices also moved northward last week following a larger-than-expected decrease in supplies. Investors were further encouraged by unseasonal winter-like weather that might lead to the fuel’s strong demand and push back the commencement of the injection season.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Chevronfinally announced its intention to proceed with the second stage of its multibillion dollar Gorgon LNG project in Western Australia's north-west coast. While Chevron is the chief operator of Gorgon LNG project holding 47.3% stake, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell own 25% interest each.Gorgon LNG project is the largest single resource project in Australia, dealing with the delivery of natural gas to international and domestic customers. The $69 billion project is one of the costliest energy projects, employing more than 10,000 people to construct the processing facility at Barrow Island. The Gorgon LNG project has a shipment capacity of 15.6 million metric tons per year.The second stage of the project involves a capital investment of around $5.1 billion. The investment in the second stage of the project would fit within Chevron’s planned annual investment of $18-$20 billion through 2020. Apart from leading to creation of jobs and boosting the local economy, the expansion of the project is likely to boost the domestic supply of gas from 200 terajoules (TJ) to about 300 TJ a day.

(VET  -  Free Report), an oil and gas producing company, has agreed to acquire its rival Spartan Energy Corp. in a C$1.4 billion ($1.11 billion) deal. The transaction is expected to enable Vermilion Energy to boost its North American light oil production. Notably, annual production of Spartan Energy is expected around 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d) this year, of which 91% is oil.Should the deal go through Calgary, Canada-based Vermilion Energy. Apart from increasing its hold in the region with 480,000 acres of light oil producing property, it will add low decline assets to Vermilion Energy's portfolio, which holds huge investment opportunities in the future. The additional production from the acquisition is expected to help Vermilion Energy reach its revised 2018 output guidance of 86,000-90,000 Boe/d. Moreover, proved and probable reserves of 113.5 million barrels will be added to Vermilion Energy's portfolio. The company increased its capital budget to C$430 million following the acquisition from C$325 million earlier.Additionally, operational synergies from the deal are expected to benefit Vermilion Energy in a tough energy environment in Canada, where lack of infrastructure is currently leading to discounted, and volatile pricing for crude and gas.

1565,NOV,"We are now at the beginning of the Q3 earnings reporting cycle. Only 5.2% of the total S&P 500 companies have reported their numbers so far, while none of the energy companies have reported their quarterly earnings yet.It should be noted that crude supply glut concerns have eased during the past July-to-September quarter, and this improvement is reflected in the Earnings Trends report that shows the energy sector as the prime contributor to the index’s year-over-year earnings growth.Meanwhile, we have used our proprietary screening tool to pick a few energy stocks that are poised to post strong Q3 numbers.Energy to Lead S&P 500 in Q3Here at Zacks, we divide the S&P 500 index into 16 major sectors, and the energy sector will likely contribute the most in Q3. We expect the sector to witness 123.1% year-over-year earnings growth on 17.8% gain in revenues.Eight of the 16 sectors will likely see year-over-year declines in third-quarter earnings while the rest, excluding conglomerates and the energy sector, are projected to report single-digit earnings growth. Only the energy sector is predicted to register triple-digit earnings growth. Excluding the energy sector, the S&P 500 index is anticipated to decline 0.7%.   Record Crude Price Backs EnergyAs per macrotrends, The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude saw a 12.2% gain in the third quarter of 2017 after two consecutive quarters of decline this year. Notably, this is the highest quarterly gain since the April-to-June quarter of 2016.Also, according to The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the average monthly price for the first two months of third-quarter 2017 was higher than the year-ago comparable period. Lower global crude inventory primarily supported the crude price rally in the third quarter.Oversupply Concerns Ease in Q3Per the EIA, during the July-to-September quarter of this year, worldwide oil inventories decreased by 500,000 barrels per day (B/D). With this, the inventory level fell for three quarters in a row.According to The Oil & Gas Journal, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) produced an average of 32.9 million B/D in the third quarter as compared to last November’s 33.4 million B/D.Thus, it can be safely concluded that the leading crude exporter’s landmark production cut deal primarily supported the draws in global crude inventory.Bet on Oil/Energy StocksCrude prices determine the fate of energy players. With the massive third-quarter crude improvement, upstream energy players are expected to report strong Q3 numbers. Companies involved in exploration and production activities will likely gain, while contract drilling players and drilling equipment makers are expected to clinch more contracts.  Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist. One way to do this is to pick stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy), or #3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Based in Vernier, Switzerland, Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report) is a contract drilling firm for offshore energy players. The company, expected to report Q3 numbers on November 1, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +73.86%.

1566,NOV,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed that crude stockpiles registered a fall of 1.4 million barrels as exports jumped to a new record. On a further bullish note, the report revealed that refined product inventories, gasoline and distillate, both dropped from their week earlier levels. Importantly, the positive data sets have added to the strong sentiment in the oil market.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 0.3% (or 18 cents) to $71.49 per barrel yesterday – the highest settlement since November 2014.Over the past month, the commodity has been supported by speculation that the United States could renew sanctions on OPEC-member Iran. True to predictions, U.S. President Donald Trump recently withdrew from a nuclear deal with the cartel’s third-largest producer and pledged to reimpose sanctions on Tehran. The action has stoked worries about a cut in Iranian oil exports by around 1 million barrels per day from the current levels and a supply shortage in an already tight oil market.Energy Stocks on a RollThe bullish oil market sentiment has encouraged buying in energy stocks, which lifted the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – more than 7% over the past month.The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) added 4.7% and 6.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report), Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) and National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 1.4 million barrels for the week ending May 11, following a decrease of 2.2 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 2.3 million barrels.Soaring exports in the wake of widening Brent premium to WTI led to the draw with the world's biggest oil consumer. This was partly offset by record high domestic production, which restricted the decline below expectations.In particular, U.S. output rose by 20,000 barrels per day last week to more than 10.72 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.Meanwhile, stockpiles have shrunk in 40 of the last 58 weeks and are down nearly 90 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 432.4 million barrels, current crude supplies are 17% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.However, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – edged up by 53,000 barrels to 37.2 million barrels.The crude supply cover was up from 26.0 days in the previous week to 26.1 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.5 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies were down a second week in a row as imports dropped, while demand remained strong with the onset of the summer driving season. The 3.8 million barrels decline – outpacing the polled number of 2 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 232 million barrels. Following last week’s draw, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 3.6% below the year-earlier level though it is in the top half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) inched down 92,000 barrels last week, unable to match up with analysts’ expectations for 1.3 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to lower imports and strong demand. At 114.9 million barrels, current supplies are 21.7% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up 0.7% from the prior week to 91.1%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report) may be an excellent selection.

1567,NOV,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a fall of 2.2 million barrels, the first increase in three weeks, and significantly larger than expected. On a further bullish note, the report revealed that refined product inventories, gasoline and distillate, both dropped from their week earlier levels. Importantly, the positive data sets have added to the strong sentiment in the oil market.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 3% (or $2.08) to $71.14 per barrel yesterday – the highest settlement since November 2014.Over the past month, the commodity has been supported by speculation that the United States could renew sanctions on OPEC-member Iran.

(NOV  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 2.2 million barrels for the week ending May 4, following an increase of 6.2 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 400,000 barrels.A sharp drop in net crude imports to its lowest since March led to the larger-than-expected draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production reached a new record.In particular, U.S. output rose by 84,000 barrels per day last week to more than 10.7 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.Meanwhile, stockpiles have shrunk in 39 of the last 57 weeks and are down nearly 90 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 433.8 million barrels, current crude supplies are 17% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.However, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 1.4 million barrels to 37.2 million barrels.At 26.0 days, the crude supply cover was unchanged from the previous week. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.7 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies recorded their first decrease in three weeks as imports and production dropped, while demand strengthened. The 2.2 million barrels decline – outpacing the polled number of 600,000 barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 235.8 million barrels. Following last week’s draw, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 2.2% below the year-earlier level and it is in the bottom half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) were down 3.8 million barrels last week, twice analysts’ expectations for 1.9 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to slightly lower production. At 115 million barrels, current supplies are 23% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was down by 0.7% from the prior week to 90.4%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products.

1568,NOV,"We issued an updated research report on energy equipment maker National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) on Sep 22. The company is one of the biggest manufacturers of drilling equipment which provides for a steady recurring revenue stream. However, with a major portion of the company’s total revenue coming from international markets, National Oilwell is exposed to business risks.  National Oilwell currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that the stock will perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.The company’s large installed base of rigs worldwide provides for a steady recurring revenue stream through demand for maintenance, parts and other expendable products. Most importantly, National Oilwell does not outsource part of its work like many other energy equipment makers but rather manufactures drilling equipment internally. This significantly lowers its cost of operations.Moreover, the company’s financial flexibility and strong balance sheet are real assets, cushioning it against periods of economic uncertainties. National Oilwell ended the most recent quarter with a cash balance of $1.5 billion and a manageable leverage of 16.2%.However, with new competitors entering the market and lowered capital expenditure by drilling contractors, National Oilwell has seen its new equipment package pricing fall around 10% below the levels achieved during the peak of 2007-2008.Also, National Oilwell conducts operations in many countries, with a major portion of its total revenue coming from international markets. As such, the company is exposed to risks associated with doing business abroad. Such risks include embargoes and/or expropriation of assets, exchange rate risks, terrorism and political/civil sentiment, etc.Moreover, National Oilwell – belonging to the Zacks Oil Field Equipment industry – lost 4.2% year to date. Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked players in the energy sector are TransCanada Corporation (TRP  -  Free Report), Transmontaigne Partners LP (TLP  -  Free Report) and Lonestar Resources US Inc.

1570,NOV,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc.’s (NOV  -  Free Report) shares have scaled a 52-week high of $40.92 in yesterday’s trading session, before eventually closing at $40.64, generating a healthy year-to-date rate of more than 12.8%. Notably, the stock has had a good run on the bourses over a year with its shares moving up 7.7%, handily outperforming its industry’s decline of more than 11.6% in the same time frame.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has the potential for further price appreciation with long-term earnings growth expectation of 6% and looks poised to touch new highs in the coming period. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company fared much better in 2017 compared with 2016, reporting a net loss of $237 million last year, significantly narrower than net loss of $2,412 million in 2016. National Oilwell Varco has also managed to post an average positive earnings surprise of 6.88% in the trailing four quarters. The Houston-based energy equipment supplier expects to deliver year-over-year growth of 12% and 162% in its revenues and earnings, respectively, in 2018.Let’s delve deeper to analyze what’s driving the stock.Crude Recovery to AidOil prices have finally recovered from their historic lows, settling at $60.46 per barrel at the end of 2017, up about 12.5% year over year. The improving energy landscape is attributed to tightening supplies, brighter demand outlook and OPEC-deal extension talks. The energy equipment supplier is likely to realize the benefit of recovering commodity price environment.Since the start of this year, with crude prices comfortably trading more than $60 and drilling activities on the mend, we expect to witness National Oilwell Varco's revenues, earnings and cash flow to grow gradually.In particular, strong demand for the company's land-related businesses in North America bode well for the energy equipment maker. With majority of its revenues generated from onshore markets, the company expects to return to profitability in 2018.Efficiency Strides Fuel EarningsSolid execution and cost-cut initiatives helped the company to deliver $289 million increase in its Adjusted EBITDA, which stood at $611 million in 2017 compared with $322 million in 2016. We believe that National Oilwell's aggressive cost reduction and improved efficiencies, which have helped it wade through tough industry environment over the past few years, will continue to boost the company’s results in the coming period.Wellbore Technologies Segment Set for GrowthWellbore Technologies generated strong revenues of $2,577 million in 2017, driven by robust demand for the unit’s services, products and technologies. The unit’s adjusted EBITDA surged to $305 million in 2017 compared with $90 million in 2016.Robust performance from onshore-levered Wellbore Technologies segment is likely to buoy the company’s top line and earnings in the future as well. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the EBITDA of the Wellbore Technology segment for the to-be-reported quarter stands at $117 million compared with $107 million and $38 million in the prior quarter and year-ago quarter, respectively.Cutting-Edge Technology to Drive PerformanceNational Oilwell is one of the biggest manufacturers of drilling equipment in the world, with an impressive business model. It is a global leader in solids control technology and waste management. Of late, the company embarked on a series of acquisitions including Remacut and Fjords Processing among others, expanding its directional drilling and diversifying the range of completion tools offering.National Oilwell is well positioned to deliver fluids processing technologies, as the production shifts to unconventional basins. The company is also uniquely positioned to bring automation and big data solutions to the oilfield.The company's joint venture with Saudi Aramco is also expected to support NOV's drilling technology franchise and contribute to earnings.Strong Cash-Flow Generation Bodes WellNational Oilwell’s debt-to-capital ratio stands at around 16%, which is much lower than most of its peers including Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), NOW Inc. (DNOW  -  Free Report) and Exterran Corporation (EXTN  -  Free Report) among others. The company’s current ratio also stands at 3.07, higher than most of its peers. Low leverage and high liquidity metrics increase National Oilwell’s financial flexibility, helping the company to tap on various growth opportunities.Free cash flow for the company was around $641 million in 2017. The newly enacted tax reforms will also help it to lower its cash taxes, boosting cash flow further.Offshore Segment: A Spoiler?Notably, late last year, National Oilwell combined two of its offshore-levered segments, Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarkets, into a single unit named Rig Technologies. The strategy has enabled the company to reduce administration burden and better align the company with evolving market conditions.However, we remain concerned about the offshore market that will likely lag the U.S. land-related market. Declining backlog associated with the Rig Technologies segment, due to lower activities and order cancellations, is a cause of concern.Final ThoughtsWhile National Oilwell is facing a few challenges in its Rig Technologies segment, we expect the company to tide over this limitation on the back of its strong onshore-focused Wellbore segment, superior technologies, robust financial metrics and operational efficiency.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1571,NOV,"Markets closed in the red for a second consecutive session on Monday. Losses were triggered after investors speculated over a sudden spike in inflation and resultant rate hikes rate by the Fed. These fears in turns were generated by by stronger than expected jobs data. All the major benchmarks ended in the negative territory, with the Dow slumping more than 1,000 points. Meanwhile, Jerome Powell was sworn in as the new Chairman of the Fed. Finally, the ISM Services index hit a 13-year high on Monday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 4.6%, to close at 24,345.75. However, the S&P 500 fell 4.1% to close at 2,648.94. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 6,967.53, losing 3.8%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 115.6% to close at 37.32 — its highest level since August 2015.A total of around 11.5 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 7.6 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by an 8.64 -to-1 ratio.

Such an increase in interest rates weighed on investor sentiment and led to broad based losses for the markets. An increase in bond yields continued to lure investors away from equities.However, yields fell to 2.7% after investors crowded into bonds later in the session. Moreover, an astounding growth in hourly and yearly wages in the U.S. gave rise to speculations regarding a possible spike in inflation and as a result a hike in interest rates by the Fed.Jerome Powell was finally sworn in as the Chief of Fed on Monday as he replaced the outgoing Janet Yellen. Further, the Brooking Institution announced that Yellen would be joining ex Chief of Fed, Ben Bernanke at the Washington-based think-tank post the end of her tenure as the Fed Chairwoman.Economic DataThe ISM Services Index surged to a 13-year high at 59.9% in January 2018.

Improving energy landscape is attributed to tightening supplies, brighter demand outlook and OPEC-deal extension talks.

Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,936 million for the quarter, up 14.4% and 5.5% year-over-year and sequentially, respectively.Robust performance from onshore-levered Wellbore Technologies segment is likely to buoy the company’s top line this quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of the Wellbore Technology segment in the quarter under review is $725 million compared with $693 million reported in third-quarter 2017 and $531 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.We believe that the company’s cost-containment efforts and solid project execution will lead to positive results.

The figure is also ahead of the prior-quarter’s EBITDA of 94 million.Further, the Completion and Production Solutions segment is also expected to drive the company’s results.

1574,NOV,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) recently restructured its business segments by combining two of its offshore-levered segments into a single unit. The company combined Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarkets into a single unit named Rig Technologies during fourth-quarter 2017. The strategic move is likely to enable National Oilwell to reduce the administration burden and better align the company with the evolving market conditions.While Rig Systems was engaged in the design and manufacturing of integrated drilling systems and components for land and offshore drilling rigs, Rig Aftermarket was involved in the delivery of consumables, spares and other necessary services to maintain the usefulness of the assets. Notably, both these segments witnessed weaker year-over-year income in the last quarter amid lower activities and order cancellations.The company which is expected to release fourth-quarter 2017 numbers on Feb 5, forecasts its offshore dependent unit Rig Technologies to deliver better-than-expected results in the quarter. However, management remains concerned about its Completion and Production Solutions arm whose results are expected to be below the prior guidance.Deferred deliveries of a new product in its Subsea Flexible Pipe business along with engineering challenges and scarcity of orders in its Process and Flow Technologies unit is likely to hurt the results of the segment. Meanwhile, National Oilwell expects results from its onshore focused Wellbore Technologies to be in line with expectations.Further, the company also anticipates to incur $120-$140 million pre-tax restructuring charges. This would include expenses for facility closures, severance and inventory write-downs, as well as other charges in the quarter under review.National Oilwell carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).National Oilwell Varco, Inc.

QuoteSegmental PerformanceRig Systems: Revenues came in at $346 million, down 39% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the unit incurred an operating loss of $7 million as against a profit of $7 million in the year ago quarter. Declining backlog and suspension of capital equipment deliveries to the third quarter dampened results, which were partly offset by cost cuts.Rig Aftermarket: The segment generated revenues of $341 million, down 6.3% from the year-ago period. However, operating profit increased 22.5% from the second quarter of 2016 to $76 million. Increased focus on efficiency and favorable mix of products drove the operating margin.Wellbore Technologies: The segment’s revenues were up 20.2% year over year to $614 million. Further, the unit’s operating loss narrowed by 83.5% to $24 million during second-quarter 2017. Rising momentum in the U.S. markets and modest improvement in international markets along with increased consumer demand for the segment’s products/services led to the improved results.Completion & Production Solutions: Revenues for the segment were recorded at $652 million, up 21.2% from $538 million in the year-ago quarter. The unit recorded operating profit of $27 million, turning around from an operating loss of $33 million in the corresponding period last year. Improvements in the segment’s land-oriented operations resulted in increased revenues.

1577,NOV,"We are entering the heart of the Q2 earnings season, with more than 50% S&P 500 members expected to come out with results by the end of this week.Picture Emerging Thus FarWe now have Q2 results from 97 S&P 500 members that combined account for 28.1% of the index’s total market capitalization. According to the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 8.4% from the same period last year on 5.1% higher revenues, with 78.4% positive earnings surprises and 72.2% beating revenue estimates.At this stage, we don’t have too many results from the ‘Energy’ sector. However, a number of companies have earnings lined up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.Energy: First-Half RecapLast year, 'Energy' was the strongest S&P sector performer, with a market-thumping 24% return. In particular, November's historic OPEC-led production cut deal to alleviate a supply glut managed to buoy oil prices and stabilize them around the psychologically important $50 per barrel threshold. The commodity was on a stellar run on optimism surrounding the agreement, and the outlook for oil stocks was getting better.The seemingly positive developments encouraged investors to bet on firming prices for 2017 with the oil industry finally hoping that 'this would be the year.' True to the strong sentiments, U.S. oil prices reached around $55 per barrel in late February, the highest level in 19 months.However, the situation is drastically different now, with the commodity having floundered in recent weeks. By Jun 21, crude had cratered more than 20% from its February highs and officially plunged into bear territory. In fact, prices ended down 14.3% for the first half of the year – the worst performance since 1998.Let's take a look at how oil and gas prices behaved during the second quarter of this year.Strong Q2 Earnings Growth PredictionA look back at the Q1 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were spectacular, driving the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index.The Jan-Mar 2017 period turned out to be a rather good one with both oil and natural gas prices benefiting from easier comparison figures from the year-ago period. While crude slumped to some 12-year low in the first quarter of 2016, natural gas futures dropped to its worst level in almost 17 years.As a result, the sector – whose year-earlier comparison was to an aggregate loss – came out swinging. For the sector components on the S&P 500 index, total Q1 earnings had robust year-over-year dollar growth on 33.8% higher revenues. While 69.7% of the companies were successful in beating earnings estimates, 63.6% of them outperformed the topline.The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q2 earnings season as well. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas are both averaging higher compared to the second quarter of 2016 when the energy companies reported unusually low bottom-line. While earnings for the Oil/Energy sector are set to jump a massive 271.4% – the highest year-over-year growth among all sectors – the top-line is likely to show a growth of 15.1% from the second quarter 2016 levels.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Jul 27Let’s see what’s in store for six energy companies expected to come up with Jun quarter numbers on Thursday, Jul 27.Contract drilling services provider Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) is expected to report before the opening bell.In the previous quarter, this Tulsa, OK-headquartered provider of drilling rigs, equipment and personnel to explore for and develop oil and gas missed estimates, weighed down by lower drilling activity, especially in the international markets.Regarding earnings surprises, Helmerich & Payne is on a bit of a slippery surface, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four reports. And our model indicates that the company is unlikely to beat on earnings this time around too.This is because, as per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat earnings. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.For the quarter to be reported, Helmerich & Payne has an Earnings ESP of -6.45%, while it carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. (Read more: Helmerich & Payne's Q3 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)Simultaneously, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Helmerich & Payne, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Helmerich & Payne, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Helmerich & Payne, Inc. QuoteHeadquartered in Houston, TX, National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) is another energy company set to report second-quarter 2017 results – this time after market closing. The company – which is one of the biggest manufacturers of drilling equipment – has a good track of having outperformed estimates in three of the last four quarters.However, National Oilwell is likely to break the trend in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because the company is a Zacks Rank #4 stock that has an Earnings ESP of -14.29%.National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | National Oilwell Varco, Inc. QuoteThen there is Pittsburgh, PA-based integrated energy company EQT Corp. (EQT  -  Free Report) coming out with Apr-Jun operational results before the opening bell.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, EQT – an Appalachia-focused natural gas firm with primary focus on production and midstream operations – has a decent record, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate just once in the last four reports. However, with an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3, our proven model shows that an earnings beat is uncertain for EQT in the upcoming quarterly release. (Read more: Can EQT Corp Spring a Surprise this Earnings Season?)EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | EQT Corporation QuoteWe also have Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) reporting second-quarter 2017 results tomorrow - again ahead of the opening bell. Coming to the earnings surprise history, this Findlay, OH-headquartered downstream operator has a good record: it’s gone passed estimates in three of the last four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 189.75%.But our model does not indicate that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time around, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. While a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

(VLO  -  Free Report) is the fifth company to come out with quarterly numbers tomorrow morning.Boasting of an excellent track of having outperformed estimates in each of the last four quarters, Valero Energy is likely to encounter a speed breaker in the upcoming release. This is because the combination of Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -1.85% makes it an unlikely candidate for earnings beat.

1578,NOV,"Energy equipment supplier National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Jul 27.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 15% on the back of rising momentum in the North American land market along with aggressive cost reduction and improved efficiencies. Further, the company had reported average positive surprise of 12.74% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | National Oilwell Varco, Inc. QuoteFactors to Consider This QuarterHouston, TX-based National Oilwell is a world leader in the designing, manufacturing and selling of comprehensive systems, components, products, and equipment used in oil and gas drilling and production worldwide.Drilling activities have increased of late due to an improvement in North American land market. This is likely to help National Oilwell witness higher revenues in domestic markets. During the second quarter, the count of U.S. rigs have increased around 15% to 940. Over the last one year the U.S. rig count has increased around 116%. This increased rig count bodes well for the energy equipment suppliers like National Oilwell. During the quarter, the international rig counts also rose by about 2%. National Oilwell Varco which conducts operations in many countries, with a major portion of its total revenue coming from international markets, is likely to benefit from the higher international rig count.  President Trump’s exit from Paris Climate accord also provided an impetus to drilling activities.During the quarter, the company inked an agreement with Saudi Aramco to form a joint venture in Saudi Arabia. This is likely to strengthen National Oilwell‘s drilling technology franchise and its financials. The company has a clean balance sheet with impressive liquidity and coverage ratios when compared to most of its peers including McDermott International, Inc. (MDR  -  Free Report) and Exterran Corporation (EXTN  -  Free Report) among few others. We also appreciate National Oilwell’s successful cost-management initiatives amid weak oil prices.However, weak oil and gas prices might mar demand for energy equipment suppliers. During the second quarter, oil and natural gas prices declined 8.4% and 5%, respectively. Lower commodity prices might lead to reduced exploration and production activities. This could call for lower investments by oil majors which will impact revenues of equipment supplier companies. This is also reflected in the share price of National Oilwell which witnessed a decline of around 18% in the second quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that National Oilwell is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -6.67%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at a loss of 16 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 15 cents.Zacks Rank: National Oilwell currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stock Poised to Beat Earnings While earnings beat looks uncertain for National Oilwell, another firm within the Oil and Gas Mechanical & Equipment industry Dril-Quip, Inc. (DRQ  -  Free Report), can be considered on the basis of our model, which shows that it has the right combination of elements to beat estimates this quarter:Dril-Quip has an Earnings ESP of +100% and a Zacks Rank #3.

1579,NOV,"Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Jan 22, before market opens.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.5%, thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America. The world's second-largest oilfield services company, after Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates. The company posted average positive earnings surprise of 41.23% in the trailing four quarters. Investors should note that Halliburton hasn’t missed earnings estimates since mid-2014.Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise  Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company Quote This Houston, TX-based provider of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells is likely to maintain this trend in the fourth quarter too. Evidently, multiple tailwinds including the recovery in commodity prices have buoyed the entire space.With U.S. activity accelerating and margins set to remain strong, Halliburton is likely to beat estimates in the quarter under review. The positive sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the strong earnings estimate revisions with two estimates going up and none going down over the last seven days for the current quarter.Factors at PlayPrices of oil at the end of the fourth quarter were $60.46 per barrel, up about 19.6% sequentially amid tightening supplies, improving demand outlook and OPEC-deal extension talks.The oilfield service provider is poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices.With the North American land market improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing — particularly for pressure pimping — Halliburton remains optimistic of generating higher earnings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter for Completion and Production revenues is pegged at $3,641 million, higher than $3,537 million and $2,268 million reported in the prior quarter and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively. Sales in the Drilling and Evaluation unit are forecasted to be $1,960million compared with the prior-quarter figure of $1,907 million and $1,753 million in the year-ago quarter.We also appreciate Halliburton’s successful cost-management initiatives amid weak oil prices over a length of time. Last year, the company successfully implemented its plan of cutting annual costs by $1 billion. In fact, Halliburton has used the challenges prevailing in the industry to its advantage, mainly by offering low cost solutions that aids producers in churning out more by investing less.All these positive factors are also reflected in the price movement of the company. Shares of the company have rallied over 6% outperforming the broader industry’s decline of 1.9% in fourth-quarter 2017. What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Halliburton is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for this company is +0.79%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Halliburton carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of an earnings beat.Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. On the other hand, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Energy Stocks With Favorable CombinationHalliburton is not the only energy firm looking up this earnings season. Here are some companies from the space which, according to our model, also have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:National Oilwell Varco Inc.

1580,NOV,"About a month has gone by since the last earnings report for National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 5.1% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsNational Oilwell reported narrower-than-expected third-quarter 2017 loss on strong performance from Wellbore Technologies and Completion and Production Solutions segment.Loss per share (excluding one-time items) came in at 7 cents compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 8 cents. The bottom line also improved considerably from the year-ago period’s loss of 34 cents.Despite challenging market conditions and the disruption caused by Hurricane Harvey, the strong acceptance of National Oilwell Varco’s new launches meant that adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $167 million, reflecting an improvement of $25 million from the second quarter.Third-quarter revenues of $1,835 million increased from $1,646 million a year ago but were below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,869 million as customers continue to restrict capital spending to only bare essentials.Segmental PerformanceRig Systems: Revenues came in at $330 million, down 29.8% from the year-ago quarter and below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $356 million. The unit’s adjusted EBITDA plunged 44% year over year to $28 million on deferred deliveries and scarcity of new equipment orders. However, it was ahead of the $25.3 million envisioned by analysts polled by Zacks as an amended agreement with a client resulted in wiping off around $100 million from the segment’s backlog and a small gain.Rig Aftermarket: The segment generated revenues of $311 million, down 3.4% from the year-ago period and unable to beat our projection of $349 million. Adjusted EBITDA dropped 14.8% from the third quarter of 2016 to $69 million and failed to match our projection of $87 million. Spare parts demand remains tepid due to weak market conditions, while an unfavorable product mix played its part too.Wellbore Technologies: The segment’s revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $672 million and rose 31.7% year over year to $693 million. Importantly, the unit improved significantly from last year’s adjusted EBITDA of $26 million to clock $94 million this time. The figure also managed to edge past our guidance of $93 million on higher volumes stemming from greater market adoption of the unit’s new technology introductions.Completion & Production Solutions: Revenues for the segment were recorded at $682 million, up 25.6% from $543 million in the year-ago quarter and just ahead of our $679 million estimate. The unit recorded adjusted EBITDA of $97 million, up from $43 million in the corresponding period last year and outperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $93 million. Heightened land activity in North America and the Middle East impacted profitability.BacklogCapital equipment orders’ backlog for Rig Systems was $2,010 million as of Sep 30, including $84 million in new orders during the third quarter.Moreover, Completion & Production Solutions segment reported a backlog of $974 million in capital equipment order as at the end of the third quarter. The figure – which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $898 million – included $463 million in new orders.Balance SheetAs of Sep 30, the company, which last year teamed up with General Electric Co. (GE - Research Report) to provide industry-leading standardized interfaces, had cash and cash equivalents of $1,722 million and long-term debt of $2,707 million. The debt-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 16.1%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been four revisions lower for the current quarter.National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and Consensus  National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and Consensus | National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Quote VGM ScoresAt this time, the stock has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is solely suitable for growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift. Interestingly, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are looking for an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

1595,NOV,"Picture Thus FarThe Q3 earnings cycle is in full swing with 138 S&P 500 members that account for 32.9% of the index’s total market capitalization having reported their numbers. Per the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 7.3% from the same period last year on 4.9% higher revenues, with 70.3% positive earnings surprises and 68.1% beating revenue estimates.As of now, very few energy companies have reported their third-quarter results. Notably, just two energy companies on the S&P 500 index have reported their Q3 numbers. These include the major oilfield services players Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report). Schlumberger reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of 42 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and higher than the year-ago figure of 25 cents.(Read more: Schlumberger Posts In-Line Q3 Earnings, Revenues Miss)Halliburton Co. reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America. Halliburton’s income from continuing operation came in at 42 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents. Notably this is the 13th consecutive earnings beat recorded by the company. Moreover, revenues of $5,444 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,318.9 million.(Read more North American Strength Drives Halliburton Q3 Earnings)Q3 Report Card: Oil and Gas Prices End on a Positive NoteOil: Prices of oil at the end of the third quarter improved amid continued decline in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative. With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, price of oil at the end of the third quarter was $51.67 per barrel, up about 10.5% sequentially. A year ago, crude prices lingered around $45 per barrel.Natural Gas: Prices of natural gas dropped about 3.5% in the July-September period owing to the fuel’s tepid demand due to mild weather conditions and hurricane-related power outages. Despite the sequential fall, natural gas prices remain favorable when compared with the corresponding period of 2016. The commodity futures ended the quarter at $3 per MMBtu, up more than 3% from the Sep 30, 2016 settlement of $2.9 per MMBtu.Energy Companies to Gain from Higher Prices: As we know, the profitability of energy companies is directly affected by fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Therefore, all oil/gas-related stocks are poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices as they will be able to extract more value for their products.Year-over-Year Gain Leads to Bullish ExpectationsA look back at the Q2 earnings season reflects that earnings for the sector recorded a massive 252.7% jump from the same period last year — by far the highest growth among all sectors — on 16.8% higher revenues.The energy sector is poised to see the strongest growth in Q3 again. Per our expectations, earnings for the sector are expected to jump 122% from third-quarter 2016, while the top line is likely to witness an improvement of 16.3% from the year-ago levels.Energy Stock Reporting Q3 Earnings on Oct 26Let’s see what’s in store for four energy companies that are slated to release their quarterly numbers.Texas-based leading refinery player Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) is slated to report results before the opening bell.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 13.89%, courtesy of higher throughput margin. Moreover, Valero surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters, with an average of 18.24%.Valero Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Valero Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Valero Energy Corporation QuoteValero is expected to keep its earnings streak alive this quarter also as it has the right combination of the two ingredients. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.27% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s refining segment earnings is $1,372 million, higher than $990 million recorded in the year-ago quarter and $959 million in the prior quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $20,183 million for the third quarter, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Our model predicted earnings beat earlier too. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an Earnings ESP of +0.27% and carried a Zacks Rank #2.Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) an independent oil refiner and marketer is set to release results before the market opens.The Findlay, OH-based downstream operator has a mixed earnings surprise history. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the last four quarters. In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 0.96% on lower gross margins and elevated costs.Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Marathon Petroleum Corporation QuoteHowever, our model indicates that Marathon Petroleum is likely to beat on earnings estimates this time, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.09%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s revenues from refining and marketing is pegged at $419 million, 36.9% higher than the reported figure in third-quarter 2016. We also expect profitability in its midstream (or pipeline transportation) segment to be 62.8% higher than the year-ago quarter to stand at $420 million. Earnings are likely to be driven by solid process and fractionation volumes, along with contribution from investments in new projects.Our model predicted earnings beat earlier too. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an Earnings ESP of +0.14% and carried a Zacks Rank #3.Energy equipment supplier National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) will report its results after the closing bell.National Oilwell Varco has a good track record of earnings surprise history, courtesy of its cost-reduction initiatives and improved efficiencies. The company delivered average positive earnings surprise of 10.46% in the trailing four quarters.National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | National Oilwell Varco, Inc. QuoteBased on our model, National Oilwell is likely to beat on earnings even this time, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +13.04%.Rising momentum in the U.S. markets and modest improvement in international markets along with increasing consumer demand are likely to improve the revenues of the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of the Wellbore Technology segment is $672 million compared with $614 million reported in second-quarter 2017 and $526 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Our model predicted earnings beat earlier too. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an earnings ESP of +10.91% and carried a Zacks Rank #3.Upstream energy player EQT Corporation (EQT  -  Free Report) is set to report results before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 6 cents per share surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents. EQT delivered average positive earnings surprise of 102.17% in the trailing four quarters.EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | EQT Corporation QuoteHowever, our proven model does not show that EQT is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of -31.31% and a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the average daily sales volume for the current quarter is estimated at 2,303 million cubic feet equivalent per day (MMcfe/d), which is higher than 2,177 MMcfe/d recorded in the preceding quarter and 2,131 MMcfe/d in the year-ago quarter. The company is poised to benefit as the midstream business might rake more profits for EQT given the fact that U.S. drillers continue to bank on shale plays.However, we are concerned by the increased spending of the company. EQT is expected to spend $1.5 billion in 2017.  During first-half 2017, EQT’s operating expenses related to transportation and processing activities surged more than 66%. If the trend continues, it might hurt EQT’s earnings.Even earlier, our model did not indicate that EQT will beat on earnings this season. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an Earnings ESP of -163.91% and carried a Zacks Rank #3.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

1596,NOV,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because National Oilwell Varco is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NOV in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss seven cents per share for NOV, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of eight cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NOV, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +13.04% heading into earnings season.National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | National Oilwell Varco, Inc.

1597,NOV,"Independent oil refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings on Thursday, Oct 26, before market opens.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 0.96% on lower gross margins and elevated costs. In particular, operating income from the Refining & Marketing segment – which is the main contributor to Marathon Petroleum earnings – fell to $562 million compared with $1,025 million in the year-ago quarter.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the Findlay, OH-based downstream operator has a mixed history. It went past the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the last four reports.Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Marathon Petroleum Corporation QuoteHowever, things do look bright for the company in the quarter under review. In fact, the positive sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter, which moved up 7.4% over the last 7 days.Moreover, shares of Marathon Petroleum have done better than the peer group so far this year. The stock has been up 14.2%, as against the Zacks Oil Refining & Marketing industry’s gain of just 2.5%.Let’s delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Marathon Petroleum’s third-quarter results.Factors to Consider This QuarterWe expect improving refining outlook to buoy the company’s bottom line in the third quarter of 2017. With margin estimates going up and throughput set to be higher, Marathon Petroleum’s refining and marketing unit is expected to report solid quarterly results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s revenues from refining and marketing is pegged at $419 million, 36.9% higher than the reported figure in the third quarter of 2016.Meanwhile, we expect profitability for the midstream (or pipeline transportation) segment to be $420 million, up from $258 million in the third quarter of 2016. Earnings will be likely driven by solid process and fractionation volumes, along with contribution from investments in new projects.Amid the encouraging scenario, the impact from Hurricane Harvey is expected to play a minor role in the quarter. We expect a fairly negligible effect on throughput/operations on the combined Galveston Bay/Texas City facilities, while cost increase is also likely to have a small negative effect on Marathon Petroleum’s quarterly results.Overall, the significant uptick in the refining business will likely offset any negative impact.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too shows that Marathon Petroleum is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for this company stands at +0.14%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Marathon Petroleum carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of an earnings beat.Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.

1599,NOV,"Domestic oil and gas explorer Whiting Petroleum Corporation (WLL  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Wednesday, Oct 25.In the trailing four quarters, the Denver, CO-based company had outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 7.14%.In the preceding quarter, Whiting Petroleum beat the consensus mark by 5.3% on robust output and cost control.Whiting Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Whiting Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Whiting Petroleum Corporation Quote The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Whiting Petroleum will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the third quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayOil Price Improvement: The U.S. oil benchmark wrapped up a strong quarter amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative.The rapid decline of oil inventories in recent months has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. Moreover, energy bodies OPEC and IEA both recently raised global oil demand forecasts for this year. Also, supply from the 14-member OPEC cartel is set to remain constraint for at least the next six months, helping to tighten the market significantly. Adding to the positive momentum, OPEC and Russia claimed to be on the right track in clearing the global oil glut with half the job done.With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, oil ended the third quarter at $51.67 per barrel, up about 10.5% sequentially. A year ago, crude futures hovered around the $45 per barrel mark.Whiting Petroleum stands to benefit from recovering commodity prices as it will be able to extract more value for their products.Asset Sale: In August, the Bakken-focused upstream operator inked a $500 million deal to divest its Fort Berthold assets in North Dakota to a private explorer RimRock Oil & Gas Williston, LLC. While the agreement will help Whiting Petroleum to reduce debt and streamline its portfolio, it is also likely to lower its third-quarter production.What to Expect?Management had earlier guided third-quarter total production in the band of 10.5-11.1 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE). We note that the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly output is 10.8 MMBOE, at the midpoint of the company’s forecast range but below the 11 MMBOE reported in the year-ago quarter. In particular, we anticipate oil production at 7.4 million barrels (MMBbl), down from the prior year quarter volume of 7.8 MMBbl.Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect average realized oil price to rise 7.2% from the year-ago quarter to $39.20 per barrel, while average natural gas price realization will be up 6.7% to $1.91 per thousand cubic feet.  What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too does not conclusively show that Whiting Petroleum will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.34%.Zacks Rank: Whiting Petroleum is #2 Ranked. Though a Zacks Rank of 2 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Whiting Petroleum, here are some firms from the energy space you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:National Oilwell Varco Inc.

1600,NOV,"Major oilfield service provider Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings on Monday, Oct 23, before market opens.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 21.1%. Moreover, both Halliburton’s segments – Completion and Production, as well as, Drilling and Evaluation – reported revenues slightly better than our estimates thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America.On a further encouraging note, the world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates. Investors should note that Halliburton hasn’t missed earnings estimates since mid-2014, as you can see in the chart below:Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise  Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteImportantly, this Houston, TX-based provider of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells is likely to maintain this trend in the third quarter. Evidently, multiple tailwinds including the recovery in commodity prices have buoyed the entire space.With U.S. activity accelerating and margins set to remain strong, Halliburton’s underlying results are likely to come ahead of our expectations. The positive sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the estimate revision trend has been solid with eight upward estimate revisions and just one down in the last two months.Consequently, the stock has done better than the peer group so far this year; it is down 17.5% in 2017 as against 30.2% loss for the Zacks Oil and Gas Field Services industry. Let’s delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Halliburton’s third-quarter results.A Likely Positive Surprise?With U.S. rig count falling to record levels last year, oilfield services players (like Halliburton) were hit hard. Unprecedented declines in activity levels and a sharp fall in upstream spending led to lower revenues and pricing headwinds.However, as commodity prices steadily improve and drilling activities pick up, the market for services companies is on the mend. Though we are still not anywhere near the activity highs seen in 2014, spending on exploration projects have experienced a much-awaited rebound. The energy explorers, buoyed by the jump in commodity prices, are set for improving sales and earnings – a part of which is likely to be pocketed by the long-struggling oilfield service providers.In fact, during last quarter’s earnings release, the company also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing - particularly for pressure pimping.As a proof of the resurgence in activities, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Completion and Production revenue is pegged at $3,430 million, much higher than $3,132 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. Sales in the Drilling and Evaluation unit is forecasted to be $1,888 million, more than the prior quarter figure of $1,825.We also appreciate Halliburton’s successful cost-management initiatives in the midst of weak oil prices over a length of time. Last year, the company successfully implemented on its plan of pruning annual costs by $1 billion. In fact, Halliburton has used the challenges prevailing in the industry to its advantage, mainly by offering low cost solutions that aids producers in churning out more by investing less.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too shows that Halliburton is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for this company stands at +0.08%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Halliburton carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of an earnings beat.Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. On the other hand, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Which Other Energy Companies Have Positive Surprise in Store?Halliburton is not the only energy firms looking up this earnings season. Here are some companies from the space which, according to our model, also have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +10.91% and a Zacks Rank #2. The energy equipment maker is expected to release earnings results on Oct 26. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Suncor Energy Inc. (SU  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +29.60% and a Zacks Rank #2. The Canadian integrated energy company is anticipated to release earnings on Oct 25.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>
"
1601,NOV,"Over the last three years, the energy market has experienced intense price volatility. However, it seems that following an extended period of relative weakness, energy stocks are finally on their way to recovery. With crude now back over $50 and natural gas revolving around the pivot point of $3, the panic that swept over the market are all but gone. The incredible turnaround has stoked high expectations from the energy sector going into the penultimate quarter of 2017.Let's take a look at how oil and gas prices behaved during the third quarter of this year and what makes the Energy sector a material factor this earnings season.Q3 Report Card: Prices End on a Positive NoteOil: The U.S. oil benchmark wrapped up a strong quarter amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative.The rapid decline of oil inventories in recent months has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. Moreover, energy bodies OPEC and IEA both recently raised global oil demand forecasts for this year. Also, supply from the 14-member OPEC cartel is set to remain constraint for at least the next six months, helping to tighten the market significantly. Adding to the positive momentum, OPEC and Russia claimed to be on the right track in clearing the global oil glut with half the job done.With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, oil ended the third quarter at $51.67 per barrel, up about 10.5% sequentially. A year ago, crude futures hovered around the $45 per barrel mark.Natural Gas: Natural gas fared badly, dropping about 3.5% in the July-September period, thanks to the fuel’s tepid demand on the back of mild weather conditions and hurricane-related power outages.Despite the sequential fall, natural gas prices are in a sweet spot compared to the corresponding period of 2016. The commodity futures ended the quarter at $3 per MMBtu, up more than 3% from the Sep 30, 2016 settlement of $2.9 per MMBtu.Energy Companies to Gain from Higher Prices: All oil/gas-related stocks stand to benefit from recovering commodity prices as they will be able to extract more value for their products.Year-over-Year Gain Leads to Bullish ExpectationsA look back at the Q2 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were spectacular, driving the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index. The April-June period turned out to be a rather good one with earnings for the sector recording a massive 252.7% jump from the same period last year – the most among all 16 broad Zacks sectors by a long way – on 16.8% higher revenues.The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q3 earnings season as well. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas both improved from the year-ago period. In fact, the strongest growth in Q3 is again set to come from the Energy sector. As per our Earnings Preview report, earnings for the sector are expected to be up 122.4% from the third quarter of 2016, while the top-line is likely to show an impressive growth of 17.9%.How to Identify the Outperformers?The encouraging figures suggest that there are a number of companies likely to beat our third quarter earnings estimates.Investing in such companies can fetch handsome returns for investors. This is because a stock generally surges upon earnings beat.But with a wide range of energy firms thronging the investment space, it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at stocks that have the potential to deliver better-than-expected earnings.While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers, our proprietary methodology - Earnings ESP - makes it relatively simple. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.You could further narrow down the list of choices by looking at stocks that have a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.5 Stocks to Invest InGulfport Energy Corporation (GPOR  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Oklahoma City, OK, Gulfport Energy is an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company with primary focus on the Utica Shale in Eastern Ohio and the SCOOP Play in Oklahoma.The company has beaten the Zacks consensus earnings estimate for the last four consecutive quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 57.92%.Powered with the right combination of the two key ingredients – an Earnings ESP of +6.08% and a Zacks Rank of 1 – our proven model shows that an earnings beat is expected for Gulfport Energy in the to-be-reported quarter as well.The company is expected to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1.Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report): Concho Resources, based in Midland, TX, is an independent energy exploration and production company with producing properties mainly in the Permian Basin of southeast New Mexico and west Texas.The oil and gas finder has been on an excellent run: beating their earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters.And, with an Earnings ESP of +11.53% and a Zacks Rank #2, an earnings beat is possible for Concho Resources in the upcoming quarterly release too.The company is expected to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31.National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report): National Oilwell Varco formerly National Oilwell, is a world leader in the design, manufacture, and sale of comprehensive systems, components, products, and equipment used in oil and gas drilling and production worldwide.Coming to the earnings surprise history, this Houston, TX-headquartered energy equipment maker has been on a mixed run: it went past estimates in two of the last four quarters.But our model indicates that National Oilwell Varco is likely to beat on earnings this time around, as it has a Zacks Rank of 2 and an Earnings ESP of +10.91%.The company is expected to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26.Suncor Energy Inc. (SU  -  Free Report): Calgary, Alberta-based Suncor is Canada’s premier integrated energy company. Suncor's operations include oil sands development and upgrading, conventional and offshore crude oil and gas production, petroleum refining, and product marketing under the Petro-Canada brand.The company has a good track of having outperformed estimates in three of the last four quarters.Suncor is likely to beat estimates in the to-be-reported quarter as well. This is because the company is Zacks Ranked #2 with an Earnings ESP of +29.60%.The company is expected to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25.Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report): Houston, TX-based Halliburton is one of the largest oilfield service providers in the world, offering a variety of equipment, maintenance, and engineering and construction services to the energy, industrial, and government sectors.It has a 100% track of outperforming estimates over the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise 67.17%.Powered with the right combination of the two key ingredients – an Earnings ESP of +0.17% and a Zacks Rank of #3 – our proven model shows that an earnings beat is expected for Halliburton in the to-be-reported quarter as well.The company is expected to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 23.Bottom LineRiding on the recovery in oil and gas prices, there are certain energy companies that are primed to outperform the Zacks Consensus Estimate. They certainly hold the potential to make investors standout gains.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

"
1602,NOV,"Key Points:
"
1603,NOV,"Falling oil and natural gas prices are causing brokerage analysts to reevaluate their forecasts on E&P companies
"
1604,NOV,"During the past two weeks, earnings estimates have been cut on 41 E&P companies
"
1605,NOV,"Positive revisions still outnumber negative revisions by a large margin, but the trend is clearly turning negative
"
1606,NOV,"Since early July, crude prices have dropped by more than 20%. Natural gas prices have dropped even more. Fears of weakening demand helped to deflate the energy bubble.
"
1607,NOV,"The demand concerns have been caused by revised forecasts for the energy sector and slower economic growth worldwide. Yesterday, the International Energy Agency proclaimed an easing to the tight global and supply balance that had played a significant factor in driving oil prices higher. Today, Japan said that GDP fell 0.6% last quarter.
"
1608,NOV,"Barring a supply disruption, such as a hurricane hitting the Gulf Coast, current trends suggest a further drop in oil prices.
"
1609,NOV,"For investors holding onto oil stocks, especially exploration and production (E&P) companies, this creates a problem. As I have previously stated on our Zacks Elite web site, brokerage analysts are likely using crude price targets of $110 to $120 per barrel in their profit forecasts.
"
1610,NOV,"Estimate Revisions
"
1611,NOV,"Starting last year, as the oil bubble inflated, brokerage analysts were forced to constantly adjust their models to reflect higher crude prices. This resulted in numerous positive revisions on oil exploration and production (E&P) companies. As long as oil remained above the prices used in the profit models, it was logical to believe that more positive revisions would occur.
"
1612,NOV,"Now the situation is reversing, with oil headed below what many analysts have factored into their models. Therefore, it is now logical to assume that profit forecasts will be lowered.
"
1613,NOV,"Profit Forecasts Starting to Get Cut
"
1614,NOV,"The numbers suggest a trend towards lowering profit projections has started. During the past two weeks, 81 full-year earnings estimates have been cut on E&P companies.
"
1615,NOV,"Andarko Petroleum (APC) has received the most negative estimate revisions with 7 covering brokerage analysts cutting forecasts. Though APC exceeded second-quarter earnings expectations with profits of $1.76 per share, its revenues were a bit light.
"
1616,NOV,"Forest Oil (FST) follows closely behind with 6 negative estimate revisions. Again, better-than-expected second-quarter earnings have not stopped brokerage analysts from lowering their full-year profit projections.
"
1617,NOV,"Denbury Resources (DNR  -  Free Report), EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report), Quicksilver (KWK) and XTO Energy (XTO) all have had five brokerage analysts cut their profit projections in the last two weeks. Earnings forecasts have also been cut on 35 other E&P companies.
"
1618,NOV,"Some Disagreement Does Exist, But The Trend Is Negative
"
1619,NOV,"As negative as this seems, the aggregate trend in estimate revisions for this industry group remains overwhelmingly bullish. The revisions ratio is 1.67, reflecting 214 positive revisions and 129 negative revisions. (Within recent weeks, 6 brokerage analysts have raised their full-year forecasts on APC and 3 have increased their profit projections on FST.)
"
1620,NOV,"The problem is with the trend, however. When oil prices peaked last month, the revisions ratio for E&P companies stood at 17.2, reflecting 241 positive revisions and 14 negative revisions.
"
1621,NOV,"Oil could fall to between $80 and $100 per barrel, barring any supply disruptions. Were this to happen, more earnings estimates could be trimmed on E&P companies.
"
1622,NOV,"This is not a case of anything being inherently wrong with the fundamental strength of these companies, but rather a change in the short-term risk/reward ratio. We have reduced our exposure to the energy sector in the Zacks Elite Focus List portfolio with the intent of adding back some oil and natural gas companies at lower prices.
"
1623,NOV,"For those wanting exposure to the oil and natural gas sectors, integrated oil and oil machinery and equipment stocks might be safer over the short-term. (We hold ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and National Oilwell Varco (NOV  -  Free Report) in our Focus List and Top 10 portfolios, respectively.) Those unwilling to endure short-term volatility may want to consider waiting for oil and natural gas prices to settle, however.
"
1624,NOV,"Related ETFs
"
1625,NOV,"There are various funds with exposure to the energy sector. Two E&P pure plays are iShares Dow Jones U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (IEO  -  Free Report) and First Trust ISE-Revere Natural Gas Index Fund (FCG  -  Free Report).

1628,NOV,"In China, 8 is considered a lucky number. As of Friday, 8/8/08, we were 88.8% done with the second quarter earnings season. The results have been mixed; encouraging in median EPS growth terms, but downright awful in terms of total net income growth.
"
1629,NOV,"Positive surprises are leading disappointments by a 2.4:1 ratio, which is only slightly below recent historical norms. The median surprise is also inline with recent history at 3.09%.
"
1630,NOV,"The median year-over-year EPS growth rate of 9.45% is wonderful news for the market. And it looks like it will probably hold up. Given the expectations for those that have yet to report that seems possible. The median expected EPS growth rate for the firms that are yet to report is 16.9%. Given the propensity for positive surprises to outnumber disappointments, on a median EPS basis, double-digit growth is possible.
"
1631,NOV,"Energy is finished reporting and currently holds the gold medal spot with growth of 25.4%. Tech is in silver, with median EPS growth of 22.2%. This is based on the results of 60 companies, or 84.5% of the total Tech firms in the index. Absent some significant positive surprises it seems unlikely to overtake Energy in the median EPS growth event. Telecom is in the bronze medal spot with 17.8%, and it should hold on to its place on the podium.
"
1632,NOV,"On the surprise front, two sectors have been particularly impressive. Health Cares median EPS growth rate is 14.3%.  Health Care is showing more than 6 positive surprises for each disappointment, with a median surprise of 4.69%. This is not based on just a handful or results either, as over 98% of Health Care reports are already in. The Industrials have been just as impressive, with growth of 13.6%, a 7.0 surprise ratio and a 5% median surprise.
"
1633,NOV,"The Financials have been the weakest sector by far, with the median EPS dropping by 17.4% from a year ago. The sector is responsible for one third of all the earnings disappointments to this point. The Consumer Discretionary sector is the only other one to show negative year-over-year growth on a median EPS basis (-4.3%).
"
1634,NOV,"The expected results for the remaining Financials are even worse the ones which have already reported, at -156.2%, but relatively few remain. The remaining Consumer Discretionary firms are expected to show a 1.1% increase, meaning that there should not be a big change from what has already been reported.
"
1635,NOV,"Some of the factors which should help median EPS growth are share repurchases, which though have slowed in recent months, will still reflect what happened last year. Oddly, increased share counts will also help boost EPS among the Financials. Since the ones that have increased their share counts the most (by going hat in had to the sovereign wealth funds looking for new capital) are also the ones that are likely to reports losses, so the loss per share will be less.
"
1636,NOV,"In addition, to the extent that firms have large operations overseas, they should benefit from the currency translation effects of the weak dollar. The weak dollar has also boosted those companies that export a substantial portion of their sales.
"
1637,NOV,"Keep in mind that median growth rates are inherently equally weighted, so the growth rate for Cabot Oil and Gas (COG) is just as significant to the results for the Energy sector as the growth rate for Exxon (XOM  -  Free Report).

"
1639,NOV,"While on a median EPS growth basis, things might look okay, the same is not true on a total net income basis. This is shaping up to be yet another very ugly quarter.
"
1640,NOV,"The blame for net income decline once again goes to the Financials (with best supporting actor nomination for the Consumer Discretionary). On a percentage basis, total earnings have collapsed even more for the Discretionary firms (-83.5%) than for the Financials (-81.9%). However, the Financials are normally a much bigger sector in terms of total profits. Last year, the Financials accounted for 27.4% of all net income reported at this point, this year they account for just 6.3%. By contrast, last year the Discretionary firms chipped in just 5.9% of all earnings. Overall, the second quarter is even weaker than the first quarter.
"
1641,NOV,"Total net income for the S&P 500 is expected to be 21.0% below the second quarter of 2007, which is not much of a change from the 20.8% decline posted so far. This is a weaker overall showing than in the first quarter (down 15.6%) and roughly inline with the fourth-quarter decline of 21.2%).
"
1642,NOV,"Looking ahead, the consensus is currently for very weak but positive growth in net income (up 2.2%), thanks to very high expectations for the Energy sector, and the Financials only being kicked in the stomach, not a little lower on the anatomy.
"
1643,NOV,"Total net income for all the S&P 500 firms that have reported so far is $161.8 billion versus $204.2.4 billion a year ago. That is however a slight improvement on a sequential basis from the $158.7 billion these same 444 firms posted in the first quarter. While the overall pie is smaller, the size of the slices has moved dramatically. With the Financials share shrinking dramatically, the shares for most other sectors have expanded. Energy is getting the biggest slice, almost 26%, up from 17.5% a year ago. Techs slice of the pie is up to 14.2% from 9.4% a year ago.
"
1644,NOV,"Surprisingly, Tech is leading in total net income growth reported so far, up 19.1%. Energy is in the Silver medal spot, but Tech is expected to fade at the end allowing it to take the gold. Health Care should make the platform, but with a distant third of 8.3% growth, but taking the second largest slice of the pie at 15.2%.

"
1646,NOV,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
1647,NOV,"With positive surprises outnumbering disappointments by almost 5:2, it is not a shock that the revisions ratio has started to climb from the depths. After all second quarter earnings are part of full year 2008 earnings, so if a company posts a positive surprise and the analysts dont raise full year earnings, they are implicitly cutting estimates for the third or fourth quarters.
"
1648,NOV,"The ratio is now at 1.05, a reading that is neutral, up from 0.98 last week, and 0.81 two weeks ago. The overall pace of estimate revisions continues its rise, and is approaching its seasonal peak. Over the last four weeks there have been 3,600 changes in estimates: 1,841 up and 1,759 down. (In comparison, last week there were 3,017 changes: 1,521 up and 1,556. This week or next should mark the peak of total revisions activity for the quarter. The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.95, slightly weaker than the revisions ratio, but also in neutral territory.
"
1649,NOV,"On the back of their strong surprise ratios, Health Care and Industrials have moved into the top slots for the 2008 revisions ratio, with readings of 3.11 and 2.24. Surprises have not been as strong for Energy (1.7:1 ratio, 1.42% median surprise), but it still has a respectable reading of 1.40. Financials and Discretionary are the weak sisters with readings of 0.49 and 0.63, respectively.
"
1650,NOV,"Notable Health Care stocks on the upside include Abbott Labs (ABT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and St. Jude (STJ). The Aerospace and Defense names were particularly strong among the Industrials, including General Dynamics (GD), Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) and Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report).
"
1651,NOV,"In the Consumer Discretionary sector, the analysts checked out of the hotel companies Marriot (MAR  -  Free Report) and Starwood (HOT). The Financials included in the Dow 30 seemed under particular pressure, including American International Group (AIG), American Express (AXP), Citigroup (C), and J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report).

1653,NOV,"Unlike 2008, there is no mechanical reason for analysts to raise their numbers for 2009 in response to an earnings surprise. While it did rise, it remains in negative territory. It rose to, 0.79, from 0.76 last week, and 0.66 two weeks ago.
"
1654,NOV,"The Energy sector, with a revisions ratio of 2.15, remains the strongest. Health Care also put in a decent showing at 1.91 Energy firms showing noteworthy strength include the Oil Service majors, Baker Hughes (BHI), Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report), National Oilwell Varco (NOV  -  Free Report) and Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report).
"
1655,NOV,"The revisions picture for the Financial sector is even worse for 2009 than it is for 2008, coming in at 0.24, or over four cuts for every increase. Revisions like these will eat away at the robust earnings rebound seen for 2009 (unless 2008 gets cut faster). If the Financials were excluded, the revisions index would pop to 1.04. We do not seem to be getting out of the woods on the Financial sector front. While there is weakness throughout the sector, major regional banks seem to be the worst hit. In particular, weakness at BB&T (BBT), Comerica (CMA), SunTrust (STI  -  Free Report), Regions Financial (RF  -  Free Report) and Zion (ZION  -  Free Report) was noteworthy.
"
1656,NOV,"The total number of revisions for the whole S&P 500 for 2009 is also near its seasonal peak. There were a total of 3,087 revisions: 1,360 up and 1,727 down. This is up 33.1% from 2,752 (1,189 up and 1,563 down) last week. The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.78, in line with the revisions ratio.

"
1658,NOV,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
1659,NOV,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2007, 2008 and 2009, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index.
"
1660,NOV,"For years, the Financials were the dominate force in the market, both in terms of market cap, and even more so in terms of total earnings. They have now been decisively dethroned on both counts. On the market cap front, Financials just recaptured 2nd place from Energy. However, the sector has now slipped into 5th place based on 2008 earnings. Still, despite their current problems, the Financials are still a very significant influence on the market.
"
1661,NOV,"Even with all the disasters in the sector, for 2007, the Financials accounted for 21.9% of the total net income for the S&P 500. In 2008, that is currently expected to decline to 11.0% before rebounding to 17.4% in 2009. However, in recent years the sector has accounted for well over a quarter of all earnings.
"
1662,NOV,"Energy has usurped the crown this year, with its earnings share climbing to 21.8% from 15.6% in 2007. Energy should keep the earnings crown for 2009 as well, gathering 20.0% of all the earnings of the S&P 500.
"
1663,NOV,"On the market cap (and index weight) front, Tech overtook the Financials a few months ago and currently stands at 17.6%. The Financials have plunged to 14.7% of the index. As recently as the end of February, Financials had a 17.2% index weighting versus 15.7% for Tech and 13.0% for Energy.
"
1664,NOV,"Keep in mind that these numbers are snapshots, when you should be thinking about a movie. At the end of February (the first time we had a complete read on 2009), the Financials were expected to gather 22.1% of all earnings for 2008, and Energy was expected to only get 16.0%. For 2009, the expected earnings shares were 15.0% for Energy and 22.4% for Financials. A year ago, before the credit crunch hit, Financials were expected to gather 26.3% of 2008 earnings and held a 19.4% weighting in the index.
"
1665,NOV,"Energy represented just 10.9% of the total market capitalization and was expected to get 12.9% of the total earnings in 2008.  In general it seems as if the Energy sector is consistently gaining 0.2% of share for each year every week, with a similar decline for the Financials. If those trends continue, then Energy could be as dominate on the earnings front in 2008 and 2009 as the Financials were in 2007 or 2006.
"
1666,NOV,"For many years, Financials were clearly the dominate factor in the overall market, despite generally selling for below market P/Es. Due to an implosion in earnings that has been far worse than the dismal market performance of the sector, the Financials now have the highest P/Es based on 2008 earnings, displacing the perennial high P/E sector Technology. Based on 2008 earnings, the Financials have a P/E of 19.4x. However, given the expectation that the bleeding will stop next year, the P/E based on 2009 earnings is just 10.0x. (The true P/E is probably higher since the actual earnings will be significantly lower.)
"
1667,NOV,"Energy has just taken the throne as the cheapest based on 2008 earnings trading at 8.8x, and 7.8x based on 2009 expectations. There is no question in my mind that Energy is the cheapest sector of the market, and every portfolio should be overweight in it. The Tech sector is still a bit on the expensive side, trading for 17.7x 2008 and 15.1x 2009 expectations. Health Care looks interesting trading at 14.4x 2008 and 13.0x 2009 earnings.
"
1668,NOV,"Keep your eyes on the revisions, they give you the best clue as to if the earnings will be achieved and if the P/Es are for real. While the recent declines in oil prices may cause the upwards revisions to moderate for the Energy sector, most analysts are using very conservative price assumptions.
"
1669,NOV,"The S&P 500 as a whole is trading for 14.6x and 11.7x 2008 and 2009 earnings, respectively. Based on a blend of 50% 2008 earnings and 50% 2009 earnings; that translates to a 7.60% earnings yield, which looks extremely cheap relative to a 3.93% ten year T-note. Even against the A rated corporate bond yield of 6.11% it looks attractive. However, the current level of expectations for corporate earnings still implies that profits will stay well above their historical averages as a share of GDP. That would be an exceedingly rare occurrence during a recession. The comparison between the earnings yield on the S&P and the 10 year T-note is in my opinion more a reflection of the extreme unattractiveness of long term T-notes at this point than stocks looking particularly cheap in general, however there are attractive stocks out there. It appears that the flight to quality has caused a massive bubble in the price of T-notes. This is far and away, in my opinion, the most significant bubble in the market today, not the price of oil. The prices are hard to justify given the risk that the massive injections of liquidity by the Fed to ameliorate the credit crunch will end up fueling the fires of inflation.

1671,NOV,"Data in this report, unless stated otherwise, is through the close on Thursday, 8/7/2008
"
1672,NOV,"The first quarter earnings season is all but over, with just a handful companies having not reported.
"
1673,NOV,"We can draw a couple of conclusions about the results. First is that there is a serious dichotomy between growth as measured by the median EPS growth rate and as measured by the total net income growth. The median EPS growth rate is fairly healthy, while the total net income reported is sharply below a year ago. More companies are posting positive surprises than disappointments, although the margin is slightly less than we have seen in the past. It is also clear that there seem to be two markets, with part of the economy continuing to enjoy very robust earnings growth, while other parts, chiefly the Financials, are having a down right awful earnings season.
"
1674,NOV,"Lets first look at the good news. The median year over year EPS growth rate is 9.0%, and six of the ten sectors are posting double-digit gains. While that is short of the sort of double-digit growth in median EPS that we saw quarter in and quarter out for many years, it is far from the end of the world. The median expectation for the handful of firms yet to report is for 5.7% growth. Assuming that those companies surprise by the same margin as the firms that have already reported (median surprise of 3.03%), we will see the current number stay right around where it is now, or even dip slightly.
"
1675,NOV,"The ratio of positive to negative surprises is running at 2.3:1. Not as good as in the past (over 3.0 is normal in recent years), but comfortably above 1.0. Only the Financials are posting more disappointments than positive surprises, and there just barely. The Financials have been responsible for 32.1% of all disappointments, even though they are responsible for only 18.9% of the total firms reporting.
"
1676,NOV,"On the other side, the ratio of positive surprises to disappointments is running at very high levels in Health Care (5.43) and Industrials (5.50). Energy, with a surprise ratio of 3.00, has the second highest median surprise, at 7.23%. Telecom has the best median surprise at 8.00%, even though its surprise ratio is just 1.67. However, given the very small number of firms in the Telecom sector (9), medians of any sort are less meaningful than sectors with large numbers of firms in them.
"
1677,NOV,"In terms of year-over-year growth, Energy is the clear winner, with half the Energy firms reporting year over year EPS growth in excess of 29.3%. Since all the energy firms have their numbers in, that number will not change. Tech holds the silver with 21.5% growth, while Industrials hold the bronze at 17.4%. Honorable (double-digit) mentions go to Telecom, Health Care and Staples. Financials and Discretionary are both posting negative growth, while Materials and Utilities were barely positive.
"
1678,NOV,"With the first quarter season over, it is time to turn our attention to the second quarter expectations. The bar is not set very high with the EPS at the median firm expected to be just 5.56% higher than a year ago. After factoring in the probability that there will be more positive surprises than disappointments, it most likely means that median year-over-year EPS growth for the S&P 500 as a whole will be around 8.0%. By sector, the broad outline suggests that the second quarter should be very similar to the first quarter. Energy and Tech are currently to again hold gold and silver, respectively, and Health Care may nudge out the Industrials for the Bronze. Financials and Consumer Discretionary are expected to again bring up the rear, with performances that are even worse than in the first quarter.
"
1679,NOV,"Keep in mind what the median measures. It is a gauge of what the ""normal"" firm will report in terms of EPS. It is not influenced significantly by extreme data points, and implicitly treats the results from Exxon Mobil (XOM), General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart (WMT) the as being just as important as the results for Murphy Oil (MUR  -  Free Report), Manitowoc (MTW) and Big Lots (BIG  -  Free Report). Changes in shares outstanding, due to buybacks or new issuance also affect the results in this measure, while they do not affect total net income.

"
1681,NOV,"Turning now to the ""worst of times"" in this tale of two markets. The total net income reported is 18.7% below the total net income that those same 493 firms reported in the first quarter of 2007. (This is an improvement from the 22.9% drop they reported in the fourth quarter.) Specifically, those firms reported $170.8 billion in net income (before non-recurring items) this year and $210.2 billion last year.
"
1682,NOV,"The Financials have been responsible for more than the entire drop in net income though. Total earnings in the sector are off 81.1% to $11.3 billion versus the $59.4 billion they reported a year ago. That is a drop of $48.2 billion vs. a drop of just $39.4 billion for the market as a whole. Put another way, if the Financials are excluded, then total net income is actually up 5.9%. While still below the median growth number (which would be 11.43% if the Financials were excluded) it is much less than the yawning chasm at the full S&P numbers show. The actual picture is some what worse than that for the Financials since some of there problems have been taken in the form of one time extraordinary charges, or have not even shown up on the income statement (just hits to the balance sheet taken in other comprehensive income).
"
1683,NOV,"Let's put what is happening to the Financials another way. At this point in the earnings season last year, the Financials had earned more than the next two highest sectors (Energy and Health Care) with the Telecom sector thrown in for good measure. This year they are in sixth place, behind Energy, Health Care, Industrials, Tech and Staples. The sectors earnings only exceed the small Telecom, Materials, and Utility sectors, all of which in normal times provide less than 4% of total earnings each, and the Discretionary sector, which is both hurting itself, and which tends to be highly seasonal (most retailers are in the sector). On the other hand, in the fourth quarter, Financials were dead last as the sector as a whole was bleeding red ink. Put another way, last year, the Financials gathered 28.5% of all the earnings in the S&P 500 in the first quarter, this year they were responsible for just 6.6%. Energy on the other hand was responsible for 21.0% of all first quarter earnings this year up from 13.6% a year ago.
"
1684,NOV,"The biggest earnings gains in the first quarter were in the Energy sector, with total net income 25.6% above last year, and in the Material sector, with a gain of 14.3%. Tech holds the bronze with growth of 14.0%and is the only other sector to post double digit growth on a total net income basis. While the Financials are clearly the core of the problem in terms of weak earnings, it has not been a good quarter so far for the Durables (down 37.9%). Health Care is up just 3.8%, a very significant slowdown from the 17.9% growth it showed in the fourth quarter.
"
1685,NOV,"Turning to the expectations for the second quarter, it looks ugly, but not quite as ugly as in the first quarter. The total net income for the S&P 500 is currently expected to be 9.8% below the second quarter of 2007. This improvement over the 18.7% decline in the first quarter is almost entirely a function of things being just ugly and not downright disastrous in the Financial and Discretionary sectors, which are expected to be down 41.6% and 25.0%, respectively. Not exactly a cause for celebration to my way of thinking. This is particularly true since three months ago, the expectations were that total net income would decline by 5.1% in the first quarter for the S&P 500, due in large part to declines of 31.5% in the Discretionary sector and a 24.8% decline in the Financials.
"
1686,NOV,"Meanwhile, all of the top five sectors in the first quarter are expected to see their growth rates drop by more than 5.0% (relative to the first quarter) in the second quarter. Energy is expected once again to lead the total net income growth race, but with only a 10.3% gain, down from 25.6% in the first quarter. Five sectors are expected to post lower total net income in the second quarter of 2008 than they did in the second quarter of 2007.

"
1688,NOV,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our ""revisions ratio"". This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
1689,NOV,"The revisions ratio dropped slightly after several weeks of improvement. It is now at 1.10, a reading that we generally consider neutral. With positive surprises running more than two to one over disappointments, one should expect to see more increases than cuts in full year expectations. After all, first quarter earnings are part of full year earnings, thus if a firm reports higher than expected earnings for the quarter, and the analyst does not raise his full year numbers by the amount of the beat, he is implicitly cutting his estimates for the rest of the year. There has not been much movement in the ratio in recent weeks, with the ratio falling to 1.10 from 1.14 last week and 1.08 two weeks ago.
"
1690,NOV,"The overall pace of estimate revisions is past the peak for this quarter. Over the last four weeks there have been 2,027 changes in estimates: 1,061 up and 966 down, down 39.1% from 3,326: 1,775 up and 1,551 down last week. The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.98, slightly below the revisions ratio, and in neutral territory. Six sectors are in positive territory. The Materials sector was the weakest this week, finally displacing the Financials and the Discretionary sectors from the cellar. In Materials, paper was pummeled (International Paper (IP  -  Free Report), Mead-Westvaco (MWV), and Weyerhaeuser (WY  -  Free Report)).
"
1691,NOV,"The Energy sector again topped the chart this week with a revisions ratio of 2.53. The general story is: Upstream good, downstream bad. Noteworthy for their strength were EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report), National Oilwell Varco (NOV  -  Free Report) and Transocean (RIG  -  Free Report). The independent refiners like Tesoro (TSO) and Sunoco (SUN) bucked the trend and were weak. As angry as people are about prices at the pump, this is strong evidence that it is the price of crude, not huge downstream (refining and marketing) profits that are the heart of the problem.
"
1692,NOV,"Telecom was strong thanks to upward revisions at Century Telecom (CTL  -  Free Report) and Windstream (WIN  -  Free Report).

"
1694,NOV,"The 2009 revisions story is similar to the 2008 story. Although the revisions ratio is below one, it reversed course from an improving trend, falling to 0.90, up from 0.98 last week, and 0.95 two weeks ago. The strongest sector this week was Telecom at 2.55, followed by Energy at 2.05.
"
1695,NOV,"The revisions picture for the Financial sector is even worse for 2009 than it is for 2008, coming in at 0.34, or almost three cuts for every increase. Revisions like these will eat away at the robust earnings rebound seen for 2009 (unless 2008 gets cut faster). We do not seem to be getting out of the woods on the Financial sector front. Speaking of woods, they were responsible for the weakness in the Materials sector, with most of the weakness there traceable to forest products companies like WY and IP.
"
1696,NOV,"The total number of revisions for the whole S&P 500 for 2009 is also well past its seasonal peak. There were a total of 1,625 revisions: 772 up and 855 down. This is down 38.0% from 2,619 (1,296 up and 1,323 down) last week. The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.84, somewhat weaker than the revisions ratio, and almost into negative territory.

1698,NOV,"Market Cap versus Total Earnings
"
1699,NOV,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
1700,NOV,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2007, 2008 and 2009, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing ""earnings share"". The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index.
"
1701,NOV,"For years, the Financials were the dominate force in the market, both in terms of market cap, and even more so in terms of total earnings. They have now been dethroned on both counts. Still, despite their current problems, the Financials are still a very significant influence on the market. However, it is now likely that they will lose the earnings crown this year to the Energy sector.  Even with all the disasters in the sector, for 2007, the Financials accounted for 22.2% of the total net income for the S&P 500. In 2008, that is currently expected to decline to 16.3% before rebounding to 20.3% in 2009. However, in recent years the sector has accounted for well over a quarter of all earnings.
"
1702,NOV,"Energy has usurped the crown this year, with its earnings share climbing to 18.5% from 15.8% in 2007. However, analysts expect a Financials restoration next year, with the sectors share rebounding to 20.3% while Energy slips back to 16.6%. On the market cap (and index weight) front, Tech overtook the Financials 17.0% to 15.7%. Energy, despite being the biggest expected earner for 2008, is only in third place when it comes to index weight at 13.8%. Given the ongoing estimate cuts in the sector, and the estimate increases in the Energy sector, I suspect the Energy sector might just keep its crown in 2009 as well, but that is a long shot prediction.
"
1703,NOV,"Keep in mind that these numbers are snapshots, when you should be thinking about a movie. Just three months ago, the Financials were expected to gather 22.0% of all earnings for 2008, and Energy was expected to only get 16.0%. For 2009, the expected earnings shares were 15.0% for Energy and 22.4% for Financials. Over the same time, the market cap share for Financials has slipped from 17.17% to 15.72%, while Energys share has risen from 12.99% to its current 13.81%.
"
1704,NOV,"For many years Financials were clearly the dominate factor in the overall market, despite generally selling for below market P/Es. Based on 2008 earnings, the Financials have a P/E of 14.9x and based on 2009, only 10.1x. However given the pace of estimate cuts in the sector, the true P/E is probably higher since the actual earnings will be significantly lower. Energy has just taken the throne as the cheapest based on 2008 earnings, trading at 11.5x, and 10.8x based on 2009 expectations. The Tech sector is far and away the most expensive in the market, trading for 19.7x 2008 and 16.7x 2009 expectations.  Keep your eyes on the revisions. Unless the spreading of economic weakness to the rest of the world causes oil prices to plunge (and the recent trends are very much in the other direction), you can have much more confidence in Energy earnings forecasts actually being achieved (or exceeded) than is true with the Financials.
"
1705,NOV,"The S&P 500 as a whole is trading for 15.4x and 13.0x, 2008 and 2009 earnings, respectively. Based on a blend of 67% 2008 earnings and 33% 2009 earnings; that translates to a 6.84% earnings yield, which looks extremely cheap relative to a 4.06% ten year T-note. Even against the AA corporate bond yield of 6.04% it looks attractive. However, the current level of expectations for corporate earnings still implies that profits will stay well above their historical averages as a share of GDP. That would be an exceedingly rare occurrence during a recession.  The comparison between the earnings yield on the S&P and the 10 year T-note is in my opinion more a reflection of the extreme unattractiveness of long term T-notes at this point than stocks looking particularly cheap in general, however there are attractive stocks out there. It appears that the flight to quality has caused a massive bubble in the price of T-notes. The prices are hard to justify given the risk that the massive injections of liquidity by the Fed to ameliorate the credit crunch will end up fueling the fires of inflation.

"
1722,NOV,"Yet, just as the boat ride ended suddenly, so will the current turbulence in the debt markets. For those willing to ride out the storm, there will be rewards. Granted, not a chocolate factory, but rewards nonetheless.
"
1723,NOV,"This is not to say that storm clouds are dissipating. As I mentioned in yesterday's Industry Rank Analysis, credit standards remain. Mortgage brokers are telling me that lenders are now requiring credit scores of 720, instead of 680, which means an even higher percentage of Americans are not going to easily be able to refinance their adjustable rate mortgages. The Fed is boosting its staff to deal with forthcoming bank failures. Spreads in the bond market remain wide. Proposed mergers and acquisitions that require debt financing are encountering difficulties (e.g. Clear Channel (CCU)), if not completely falling appart. The economy is sluggish.
"
1724,NOV,"Yet, there are multiple companies that are continue to do well. Just last week, Focus List member Kirby Corporation (KEX  -  Free Report) said first-quarter earnings will exceed its previous guidance. The stock jumped to a new record high on the news.

"
1729,NOV,"We are watching Barrick Gold (ABX  -  Free Report). The exposure to gold helps provide diversification to the portfolio, but ABX is susceptible to swings in gold prices. We expected volatility when we added the stock and we are continuing to monitor it.

1732,NOV,"For all the volatility of the past several days, it is a bit surprising that the Dow is holding what is essentially a 750-point trading range, even though the short-term support levels were broken. I'll get back to this in a moment.
"
1733,NOV,"Stocks whipsawed around on a variety of news. Thornberg (TMA) and Carlyle Capital Corporation essentially went bust. Bear Stearns (BSC) needed a bailout to stay afloat just days after the CEO said that his firm's ""balance sheet, liquidity and capital remain strong"". The Fed announced a new bailout plan. Oil and gold surpassed levels we would rather not think about. Inflation showed in the import data (but not in CPI), while retail sales stunk up the place.
"
1734,NOV,"The coming week could be equally busy with a Fed meeting and earnings reports from three of the major brokerage firms: Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report). Fiscal first-quarter estimates have been falling on all three, though earnings are the least of BSC shareholders' worries right now. Be happy that we've been purposely keeping the investment banks out of the portfolio.
"
1735,NOV,"Despite all of this, the major indexes really have not done much overall. The Dow did fall to its lowest levels since January, but these lows have not been passed. (As I said last week, this is the silver lining.) A three-month chart shows the range the Dow has been in this year.
"
1736,NOV,"It should be noted that the aggregate number of earnings estimates are dropping. Based on a four-week rolling period, 7,842 estimates for 2008 were revised versus 9,679 at the end of February. The revisions ratio (positive revisions divided by negative revisions) is flat, however, at 0.60.
"
1737,NOV,"We continue to see a disproportionately higher number of negative estimate revisions (4,909) than positive revisions (2,933), which is bearish. However, given the weakness in the economy, this is not surprising. (The revisions ratio on financial stocks worsened for the first time in several weeks, though the total number of negative revisions did not increase.)

1740,NOV,"There is a reasonable chance that we could sell National Oilwell Varco (NOV  -  Free Report) early next week. Full-year estimates have fallen recently and we have a nice gain in the stock that we don't want to slip away. By waiting until next week to make a decision, however, we will ensure that long-term capital gains can be realized. (The stock was added to the portfolio on Mar 15, 2007.) Keep your eyes open for an alert.
"
1741,NOV,"Arch Capital Group (ACGL  -  Free Report) will likely be sold on Monday. Full-year earnings estimates are falling on the company. The negative revisions are not dramatic, but enough to warrant selling the stock.
"
1742,NOV,"We are tightening the stops in the portfolio, which could lead to a bit more turnover. Unfortunately, our timing on Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) was less than perfect. We made the decision to sell the stock on Monday afternoon, but waited until Tuesday to announce it so that we would not create confusion with two portfolio alerts on the same day. Furthermore, the alert would have been sent out after 3pm ET on Monday, which also wasn't ideal. We still locked in a nice long-term gain, but a higher selling price would have been preferred.

1746,NOV,"As gold continues its ascent, brokerage analysts are raising their earnings projections on multiple companies within Mining-Gold. As is the case with oil, gold is reaching and staying at higher price levels than analysts had previously calculated in their models.
"
1747,NOV,"The glimmering metal is up by more than 10% since late December. Fears about the U.S. economy and speculation by traders are primarily responsible for the rise in gold prices. It should be noted that  many people in emerging economies view gold as a sign of wealth. Plus, there is the greater willingness of investors (both retail and institutional) to trade commodities.
"
1748,NOV,"Is it too late to get in on the gold rush? Judging by the recent estimate revisions, the answer is that there is still time. Brokerage analysts have underestimated what several mining companies could potentially earn this year, and as a result, forward-looking valuations are being adjusted accordingly.
"
1749,NOV,"The power of earnings estimates lies in the perception of valuation. As estimates are revised higher, stock becomes cheaper relative to projected profits. This process leads to further buying pressure and hence higher stock prices.
"
1750,NOV,"Like any commodity, gold can be volatile. Therefore, investors should keep an eye on both earnings estimates and the price of the metal itself. Current forecasts likely factor in some pullback in futures prices, but a significant pullback in gold futures could cause the estimate revisions to come down. Of course, if gold breaks through the $1,000 mark, 2008 profit projections could be revised even higher.
"
1751,NOV,"Gold mining companies with recent positive earnings estimate revisions include Golden Star Resources (GSS  -  Free Report), Iamgold (IAG  -  Free Report), Kinross Gold (KGC  -  Free Report) and Newmont Mining (NEM  -  Free Report). All of these are Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stocks.
"
1752,NOV,"As I mentioned in the opening paragraph, higher oil prices are causing brokerage analysts to reassess their projections. Regular readers will recall me mentioning this in late December.
"
1753,NOV,"The reassessment is continuing as oil appears to have found support at the $86-$87 dollar range and has yet to trade below $90 per barrel this year. Simply put, oil is staying at higher prices longer than anybody expected.
"
1754,NOV,"Along with oil prices, natural gas prices are also rising. Futures contracts for February delivery are up sharply since the start of year.
"
1755,NOV,"The combination of high crude oil prices and rebounding natural gas prices has caused several brokerage analysts to raise their earnings forecasts on multiple domestic exploration and production (E&P) companies. Among the beneficiaries are Apache (APA  -  Free Report), Cimarex Energy (XEC), Continental Resources (CLR  -  Free Report), Devon Energy (DVN  -  Free Report), Forest Oil (FST), Gasco Energy (GSX), Petrohawk Energy (HK) and Swift Energy (SFY).

1757,NOV,"Conversely, oil-service companies are less commodity price sensitive because, even with a significant pullback in crude, it still makes sense for oil companies to invest in capital improvement and maintenance projects. Oil service companies with rising estimates include: Zacks Rank #1 Rank stock Superior Energy (SPN) and Zacks #2 Rank stock National Oilwell Varco (NOV  -  Free Report).
"
1758,NOV,"This morning Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) officially announced that it was delaying the preliminary flight of its next generation jet, the 787. The Dreamliner not only uses new composite materials, but also uses new manufacturing methods that place increased reliance on the company's suppliers.
"
1759,NOV,"The launch of new product brings risks and, while profit forecasts for BA could drop, the cutbacks should be limited to Boeing and any supplier directly affected by the delay. Other aerospace companies will not be affected, since the product launch is a company-specific occurrence.

1762,NOV,"As I was reviewing the years market performance, I ran some tests on which Market Caps performed the best. 
"
1763,NOV,"I created three screens: one with Market Caps less than $800 Million (Small Caps), one with Market Caps between $800 million and $3500 million (Mid Caps) and one with Market Caps greater than $3500 Million (Large Caps). Each screen also consisted of only stocks trading over $5 with average daily trading volume of over 50,000 shares. 
"
1764,NOV,"I then backtested this screen over 2007 using a one-week holding period. This allowed each screen to participate in every start period. 
"
1765,NOV,"The tests showed that in 2007, Large Caps beat Small Caps by a wide margin: up 12% for Large Caps vs. -4% for Small Caps. 
"
1766,NOV,"This is significant because it marks the 3rd year in a row where Large Caps have outperformed Small Caps and Mid Caps. 
"
1767,NOV,"In 2000, the Smalls performed the worst, putting in a performance of roughly -10% with Mids doing the best. 
"
1768,NOV,"However, 2001 saw the Small Caps turnaround and beat everything else, producing a roughly 30% gain. The Large Caps did the worst at roughly -10%. 
"
1769,NOV,"2002 saw all the Market Caps come in virtually the same. And they all did poorly  as did the market. 
"
1770,NOV,"But 2003 saw another Small Cap outperformance with a 70% gain in comparison to the Mid Caps and Large Caps at 45% and 38% respectively. 
"
1771,NOV,"2004 saw the different Market Caps come in virtually tied again. Although the edge did go to the Small Caps. 
"
1772,NOV,"2005 saw the edge this time go to the Large Caps at approximately 12% in comparison to the Small Caps 4% - a last place finish. An eight point difference doesnt seem like a lot, but that is two times better than the Small Caps. 
"
1773,NOV,"2006 was a closer contest, but again the edge went to the Large Caps at roughly 19% with Small Caps and Mid Caps trailing at 18% and 16% for second and third place. 
"
1774,NOV,"2007s performance produced a clearer-cut winner though, with Large Caps doing 12% while Small Caps lagged behind at -4%. Mid Caps finished in between at 4%. 
"
1775,NOV,"So does that mean you should abandon Small Caps in favor of Large Caps? No. But should you have a mix of everything? Absolutely! Remember, some years one Market Size will outperform everything else, and sometimes by significant margins. But if you have exposure in all the Caps, you can make sure youll participate in the winningest group no matter what. 
"
1776,NOV,"But since Large Caps were the hands down winner, let me start you off with three Large Cap stocks with a Zacks #1 Rank or Zacks #2 Rank (i.e., Strong Buy or Buy Ranking).

"
1800,NOV,"Corporate profits for the second quarter look to be the slowest in quite some time. Earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to rise just 6.2%. On a company specific basis, the numbers look somewhat better with the median company expected to achieve 8.4% growth. Obviously, not every member of the S&P 500 has the same weighting in the index, hence the difference in growth rates.
"
1801,NOV,"Continuing a trend that occurred in the first quarter, growth is projected to be stronger among large-cap companies than among mid- and small-cap companies. The median company in the S&P 1500 (which is comprised of the S&P 500, the S&P MidCap 400 and the S&P SmallCap 600) will be 6.3%. The disparity may be partially explained by greater proportion of large-cap companies that have foreign exposure and have active share repurchase programs. Bigger companies also tend to be more diversified.
"
1802,NOV,"There have been second-quarter reports from 30 companies in the S&P 1500 so far. The numbers are running above expectations, with 17 positive surprises and five negative surprises (the remainder have matched expectations). Median growth is at 12.7%, but I would caution against reading anything into this. The sample used for these numbers is far too small to draw any trends from. Nonetheless, it does represent a positive preseason. 
"
1803,NOV,"Second-quarter earnings season will ""officially"" start on July 9 with Alcoa's (AA) report. The aluminum company is expected to have earned 87 cents per share, a penny higher than what it earned a year prior. The lackluster earnings forecast is fairly typical of what is likely to be reported by many metals companies. Brokerage analysts expect the median metals company to have generated 5.2% growth in the second-quarter. A rally in prices last year is setting up tough comps. 
"
1804,NOV,"However, earnings will vary by company, however, For example, Comercial Metals (CMC  -  Free Report) gave a bullish report last week. The company earned 82 cents per share during its fiscal third-quarter, 32% above year prior profits. Sales rose 15% to $2.3 billion. Higher volumes of scrap processed and favorable conditions in Europe helped to counterbalance the effect of volatile steel prices.
"
1805,NOV,"Investors who are looking for growth may want to focus on aerospace, container, medical and oil machinery and services companies.
"
1806,NOV,"Aerospace enjoyed strong growth in the first quarter and momentum appears to have carried over to the second-quarter. Defense spending by the U.S. government certainly helps, but the commercial side is the primary driver, a reflection of the ongoing worldwide economic expansion. Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) in particular is expected to show strong growth with profits of $1.14 per share following a year prior loss of 21 cents per share. The Dow component is also about to premiere its first new jetliner in 13 years, the 787 Dreamliner. Aerospace component companies Goodrich (GR) and Precision Castparts (PCP) are also expected to report strong growth.
"
1807,NOV,"Packaging company Ball Corporation (BLL  -  Free Report) has benefited from the strength in aerospace as well. The bigger driver for the company, however, has been rising sales of metal beverage packaging, both domestically and abroad. Food packaging is also a key driver for Sealed Air (SEE  -  Free Report), which is enjoying higher sales in Latin America and Asia.
"
1808,NOV,"Multiple medical-related companies should deliver double-digit growth. The Part D prescription drug benefit is continuing to help attract new enrollees to health insurers such as WellCare (WCG  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report). The growth for medical device companies, such as Zimmer (ZMH), reflects more company-specific issues than industry-specific issues. It should be noted, however, that the demographics of the U.S. will lead to higher spending on healthcare in the future.
"
1809,NOV,"Finally, oil machinery and service companies are benefitting from the same thing that has been helping them for multiple quarters now - crude's ability to stay at elevated prices. High oil prices make it worthwhile for major oil companies, refiners and exploration and production companies to invest in maintenance and new projects. All of this turn creates more business for likes of National Oilwell (NOV  -  Free Report), Smith International (SII) and Cameron International  (CAM).
"
1810,NOV,"The number of estimate revisions continues to drop for stocks within the Zacks Rank universe. Using a four-week rolling period, a total of 3,523 estimates were revised last week (1,703 positive revisions and 1,820 negative revisions). This compares to the peak of 13,077 estimate revisions during first-quarter earnings season. 
"
1811,NOV,"I expect this trend of fewer estimate revisions to continue until about mid-July when second-quarter earnings report start to be released en masse. Brokerage analysts have been less likely to adjust their forecasts between earnings seasons. This is a trend that has been amplified during the past two quarters and given the continuing uncertainty about the pace of economic growth, there is little reason not to expect this trend to continue.
"
1812,NOV,"What does this mean for the markets? Simply, the lack of positive estimate revisions is one less catalyst to move stocks higher. This is part of the reason the equity markets have been reacting to the sharp rise in treasury bond yields.

"
1831,NOV,"As many of you are already aware, Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) reported disappointing first-quarter results yesterday. The home improvement retailer earned 53 cents per share, six cents less than brokerage analysts had forecast and 17 cents below year-ago profits. Same-store sales dropped 7.6%. The earnings miss was not completely unexpected as four of the 16 covering brokerage analysts had cut their first-quarter and full-year forecasts during the seven day period leading up to the report. (Two brokerage analysts also lowered their first-quarter forecasts on Lowes (LOW  -  Free Report)).
"
1832,NOV,"Changing weather conditions in February and March played a role, though there are company-specific issues at HD that are not helping profits either. Plus, there is the competitive pressure being placed on the Home Depot by Lowes. 
"
1833,NOV,"At the macro level, the housing slump is major issue. A lower number of home sales mean fewer trips to the home improvement store for things. Flat-to-falling home prices make it less desirable to pursue home improvement projects. Tightening in credit standards are also likely playing a role to the extent that they make home equity credit loans more expensive and/or harder to get. Combined, these factors explain why Building Product-Retail/Wholesale has three Zacks #4 Rank stocks, including HD and LOW, and one Zacks #5 Rank stock, Builders First (BLDR  -  Free Report).
"
1834,NOV,"Higher oil prices and worldwide economic growth helped to support otherwise volatile freight rates in the first quarter. The overall increase in dayrates over the fourth quarter was significant because shipping rates have fallen materially from year-ago levels. The improvement is leading brokerage analysts to raise their forecasts on multiple companies within Transportation-Shipping, which contains nine Zacks #1 Rank stocks (strong buy) and seven Zacks #2 Rank (buy) stocks. 
"
1835,NOV,"Among the Zacks #1 Rank stocks within this group, Hornbeck Offshore (HOS  -  Free Report) and Teekay Shipping (TK  -  Free Report) both delivered bullish results within the past two weeks. 
"
1836,NOV,"HOS earned 67 cents in the first-quarter, 13 cents above expectations and 22% above year-ago results. (Investors should note that the boost in profitability also reflects a material increase in interest income. Excluding interest income, profits rose 10.6%.) Dayrates for tug and tank barges jumped 19.7% to $17,680 versus $16,799 in the fourth quarter. Dayrates for the companys offshore supply vessels were relatively stable at $19,073 versus $19,352 in the fourth quarter. Based on the assumption that dayrates will remain relatively stable throughout the remainder of the year, HOS raised its full-year profit guidance to a range of $2.29 to $2.77 per share from a range of $2.19 to $2.68 per share. Six of the 10 covering brokerage analysts raised their forecasts in response, pushing the consensus earnings estimate up 14 cents to $2.57 per share.
"
1837,NOV,"TK earned $1.12 in the first quarter, two cents above expectations, but down from year-ago profits of $1.58 per share. Revenue per day for the companys Aframax tanker fleet was $36,904 versus $34,789 in the fourth quarter. Revenue per day for the companys large and medium size tankers was $25,117 versus $24,544 in the fourth quarter. Six of the nine covering brokerage analysts raised their forecasts following the earnings report. The impact of these revisions was a 29-cent increase in the full-year consensus earnings estimate. The estimate now calls for profits to total $3.67 per share this year.
"
1838,NOV,"Last week, McDermott (MDR  -  Free Report) exceeded profit forecasts by 62 cents with earnings of $1.37 per share. Revenues more than doubled to $1,36 billion for the energy engineering and construction company, reflecting material impact of an acquisition plus good business conditions. Nearly all of the covering brokerage analysts raised their profit forecasts following the earnings reports, pushing the full-year consensus estimate up 86 cents to $4.08 per share.
"
1839,NOV,"McDermotts report follows several bullish earnings announcements from companies within Oil Field Machinery and Equipment. This group contains five Zacks #1 Rank stocks and four Zacks #2 Rank stocks. Oils ability to stay at elevated prices is having a beneficial impact on this group as it boosts spending on both maintenance and exploration. Demand for offshore equipment was a particular source of strength with both National Oilwell (NOV  -  Free Report) and Cameron (CAM) crediting strong demand for drilling products for boosting both their first-quarter profits and backlog. NOV and CAM are Zacks #1 Rank stocks.
