1,HRS,"Boeing's (BA) booming commercial aircraft business will help keep its stock strong while the overall defense sector's six consecutive years of outperformance have come to an end, according to Credit Suisse.XThe U.S. aerospace giant and Dow Jones Industrial Average component remains a top pick by analyst Robert Spingarn, who also downgraded or cut price targets on more pure-play defense stocks such as Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN), General Dynamics (GD), Harris (HRS), Huntington Ingalls (HII) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) were given downgrades or price target reductions.He noted that current defense-hardware stock valuations resemble levels reached in 2001 and warned that a big midterm win for Democrats could cause the stocks to crumble.""Whereas in 2001 those multiples were deserved in light of the beginning of a major land war and the end of an industry consolidation wave, today's market appears to have gotten ahead of itself,"" Spingarn said in a research note.""True, the 2018 budget was excellent and the 2019 budget looks favorable, but growth over 2018 is merely at inflation levels, and a possible blue wave in the midterms threatens a showdown in 2020 with the return of sequester looming as a tail risk.""Boeing, which broke out last week, fell 2.45% to 355.02 on the stock market today, still in buy range. Lockheed Martin fell 2.2%, Raytheon lost 2.9%, General Dynamics dipped 0.7%, Harris dropped 2.4%, Huntington Ingalls eased 0.9% and Northrop Grumman sold off 2.1%.Spingarn said valuations are too high when current budget documents and political realities are taken into account.But despite the seemingly limited upside for hardware stocks, there are still some big winners.""Overall, we remain more bullish on Commercial Aerospace, where Boeing and Bombardier remain our two top picks across the sector,"" Spingarn said.Ironically, given their trade spat earlier this year, Bombardier was named the top pick ahead of Boeing. The next two top picks were General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls, which have shipbuilding operations that should benefit from the Pentagon's focus on near-peer global rivals.However, the news was not as sunny for advanced weapons manufacturer Raytheon, as it was given a downgrade from outperform to neutral. General Dynamics, Harris, Huntington Ingalls and L3 Technologies remained rated as outperform, however all were given price target reductions.BWX Technologies, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman retained their neutral rating, however they were also all given target price cuts.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN: Lockheed Martin's F-35 Stealth Fighter Makes Combat Debut In Israeli Operation Boeing Stock Breaks Out; These 4 Aerospace & Defense Stocks Are Near Buy Zones Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

3,HRS,"Among Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund's (UMBMX) holdings, such stocks as Abiomed (ABMD), Arista Networks (ANET) and Comerica (CMA) are providing enough lift to keep the fund ahead of its midcap blend fund peers and within shouting distance of the S&P 500.X The fund is down 0.37% this year as of Feb. 28 vs. a 0.87% decline by its midcap blend peers tracked by Morningstar Direct and a 1.83% gain by the S&P 500.But it's the fund's longer-term performance that catches the eye. It's outperformed both its peers the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31. It rose 24.02%, and an average annual 14.17%, 16.35% and 11.13% in the past three, five and 10 years.Former Air Force B-52 bomber crew member Patrick Dunkerley and his co-managers oversee the top performing mutual fund. In an interview with IBD, Dunkerley credited the strong showing to his investment team, their disciplined investment process that combines fundamental, marco economic and technical analysis, as well as a flexible valuation approach.IBD: You not only beat peer midcap funds in the past 1, 3, 5 and 10 years, but you also beat the S&P 500 in that period, one of only 16 mid cap funds to do so. What's behind the strong performance in both short term and long term?Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersPatrick Dunkerley: We are fortunate to have performed well over many years and different time periods. We seek to generate good risk-adjusted returns as measured against our benchmark, the Russell Midcap Index.  I credit our team members, including our team chemistry plus our disciplined investment process for this sustained performance.Co-managers Derek Smashey and John Indellicate have been with us since inception in 2006, and co-manager Jason Votruba joined us in 2013, along with senior analysts Craig West following health care and Eric Chenoweth following energy and utilities, who joined us in 2016 and 2017 respectively.Our investment process is unique because we incorporate both top-down macroeconomic and company specific analysis, with an emphasis on quality stocks, and a flexible valuation approach, which changes depending if market conditions are bullish or bearish.IBD: The biggest exposure has been to tech, consumer cyclical, financial services and industrials. What do you see the source of performance in the balance of this year? What macro trends are affecting your decisions?Dunkerley: Healthy leading indicators, good credit availability, adequate money supply growth, and an upward slope to the U.S. Treasury yield curve all support our bullish equity view at the moment, but increased volatility seems likely given the market sentiment is adjusting to higher interest rates.  From a sector point of view, we are sticking with investments in cyclical companies for now, with an emphasis on technology, financials — including banks and insurance companies that benefit from higher interest rates, industrials, materials, and energy as strong U.S. and global growth is lifting earnings.The consumer discretionary sector is enjoying a new tailwind, with retail sales coming in stronger than expected, and more earnings performance likely as the U.S. tax cuts and wage increases stimulate growth.  We believe stock selection is important so we own deep discounters such as Ross Stores (ROST), or other retailers than can blunt the effect of online competition.  In addition, consumer companies offering unique experiences such as Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) benefit as millennial consumers seek entertainment, such as live concerts.We believe U.S. inflation will increase and the dollar should continue to be soft if risk-on investor sentiment prevails in 2018.Our position in gold miner Newmont Mining (NEM) helps to insulate the portfolio from a gradually declining U.S. dollar, and should capture benefits from an improving gold price due to curtailed capital spending in the gold mining industry. The company pays a 1.4% cash dividend yield, and has unhedged exposure to the gold price.Stronger defense spending funded by the recent federal budget should help companies like Harris (HRS), a leader in military radios. In addition, companies like Hexcel (HXL) and Xylem (XYL) are profiting from global growth in aircraft demand and the need for better water treatment, respectively.We expect equity markets to rise further, but, if credit conditions turn bearish due to an overly aggressive Federal Reserve, then we would become more defensively positioned.  This will eventually happen, but it's not happening at the moment and we believe bullish conditions for U.S. equities are intact, despite the recent volatility in the markets.IBD: Where are we in the small cap, mid cap and large cap cycle of outperformance/underperformance?Dunkerley: We think mid caps are set up for competitive performance with the other capitalization categories. For the trailing 10 years ended Dec. 31, 2017, U.S. midcaps and small caps have outperformed their large-cap cousins, as measured by the various Russell indexes, with midcaps generating the best returns over that time period.  This midcap outperformance is consistent with longer-term historical data dating back to 1979, although we would caution that mid caps do not outperform in every time period.For example, last year, the large caps outperformed.  But, given the long-term historical outperformance of U.S. midcaps, they deserve a premium valuation and currently they do trade at a slight premium to large caps, based on forward looking (estimated) price-to-earnings ratios.  We believe the recent outperformance of large caps was driven by a valuation discount that was too wide.  But that discount has narrowed.IBD: Do you buy only midcap companies or will you buy large caps and small caps as long as they don't lift or lower the average market cap above or below midcap?Dunkerley: We seek to buy stocks within the market capitalization range of our benchmark, the Russell Midcap Index, with particular emphasis on companies with greater than a $2 billion market capitalization as they are often more liquid.IBD: What's your process for buying stocks? Do you start with screening for fundamentals?Dunkerley: We believe an active approach can outperform the benchmark by choosing higher-quality stocks, and by employing both top-down and bottom-up portions of our research process.  We follow over 150 economic indicators on a weekly basis, and we employ a toolbox approach to valuation, utilizing different tools during a bull market cycle to measure upside potential of a stock, while paying more attention to downside valuation risk during bear markets.We believe a good understanding of the macroeconomic picture helps us to more effectively position the portfolio sector weights, which are important.In addition, our bottom up research checklist helps us to identify the fundamentally strong companies with favorable financial characteristics, undervaluation, good business models, effective management, and that are free from serious litigation risks.IBD: How big a role does technical analysis play in your selection process?Dunkerley:  We do look at charts, particularly as an aid for timing of trades, or to help better understand the fundamental picture at a company.  Some of the ""cheapest"" stocks in the long run, in other words the best long-term investments from my experience, are found making new highs.We don't have to be the first to buy or sell a stock in order to be successful, as significant moves up or down can often be long lasting.  So quite often, the market will ""discover"" a stock as evidenced by strong price action seen in the chart. We just have to do the fundamental work to make sure the investment is sustainable. We also buy stocks that are experiencing price corrections if we think they have the quality characteristics we seek, so we are not exclusively buying stocks near highs.IBD's TAKE: Many of the top performing stocks in the past were trading at new price highs and above-average P-Es before they made the biggest gains of their run-ups. IBD: What are your sell rules?Dunkerley: Our process is to sell a stock due to a negative change in the fundamentals, problematic valuation, if we find a better investment alternative, or to manage our portfolio characteristics. One advantage of active management is the ability to seek to sell stocks with weakening fundamentals before the bad news is fully reflected in the stock price, so we strive to act decisively when our thesis changes.IBD: Do you spend much time talking with company management or do balance sheet and earnings report tell you what you need to know?Dunkerley: We believe the numbers reported by companies are one of the most important clues in securities analysis, determining the quality of the business, spotting trends, and evaluating the effectiveness of management. Good investment practice involves a thorough understanding of the cash flow statement and balance sheet, in addition to the income statement. We believe too many investors ignore the former and emphasize the latter, and this causes problems particularly during bear markets.However, we also like to invest with good management teams, and our investment team meets with various company managements nearly every week, or sees them at conferences in order to better size up their strategies and abilities.We also read conference call transcripts to deepen our understanding of the businesses and better understand the strategy of management, in addition to face-to-face meetings.Finally, competitive dynamics are always important and we seek to own companies we perceive as having a sustainable advantage so they can better protect profits and grow, such as a unique products or strong industry position, new product cycle, or management skill.  But we don't exclude commodity businesses that we think are experiencing an upcycle in fundamentals.IBD: Do you have a standard size, steps or range for beginning positions?Dunkerley: We often ramp a new position to at least 50 basis points (half of 1%) of the portfolio fairly quickly.IBD: Your portfolio is quite diversified with 154 stocks and 18% in the top 10 and no stock account for more than a little above 3%. How do you manage your winners?Dunkerley: We let winners run when it seems prudent to do so, although we often trim the position if we think the upside move is overdone. Our forward-looking valuation tool, the discounted earnings model helps us to gauge upside potential in a stock, primarily during bull markets.We build these for each stock we invest in, it's part of our fundamental analysis. So if we notice a stock discounting too much of its future potential, we will often trim it down or swap into another stock. This is another advantage of active management over passive, when properly executed.IBD: What strategy do you have for lagging stocks that were put into the portfolio with expectations of superior gains but become a drag on portfolio performance?Dunkerley: Our sell discipline is well defined, and has helped us to outperform our Russell Midcap benchmark by controlling downside risk. We will sell or trim a stock when we detect fundamental deterioration in the business outlook, or if we determine that high valuation is an outsized risk. Each of our team members covers one or more sectors of the market, and we emphasize looking at the downside risks all of the time, but especially prior to each quarterly earnings report.So we do a lot of work detecting and analyzing downside risk factors in the stocks we own. It's an ongoing project, and we seek to avoid complacency regarding the fundamentals or the valuation. Keeping tabs on stocks we already own is the majority of the work we do typically.IBD: Turning to a few of your top holdings, DXC (DXC) has run up 50% since last April and is trading at all-time highs near 103, with a market cap of $29 billion. What do you like about the Hewlett Packard Enterprise spinoff? Sales are down and it's expected to post its first profit in five years. And does the stock have more room to run, or is it getting too rich — and its market cap too big?Dunkerley: A clearer picture of the earnings history can be found under the former ticker CSC. On a GAAP basis, the company was profitable four out of the past five years.  The top end of the market capitalization range of the Russell Midcap Index is currently near $40 billion, so a $29 billion market cap company is a midcap company as currently defined by Russell.We think the stock is cheap at under 7X total enterprise value to EBITDA if you look two years out, and Mike Lawrie, the CEO there has a great track record of delivering earnings progress, and positive shareholder actions such as special dividends and spinoffs.  If they successfully spinoff the government technology services business, that will be the second time he has accomplished a spinoff since 2015, back when it was named Computer Sciences and they spun off CSRA, another government services technology business.They also paid a $10.50 per share special dividend that year, so a repeat in 2018 of a special dividend would be sweet, but we can't forecast that.This is not a rapid top-line growth situation, it is more about rationalizing the business and managing it more efficiently, so margins can expand.  The recent merger with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Services gives Lawrie a bigger platform to work with. This is one of the best CEOs in America today, we think. So this is an investment in good management execution in what is a competitive technology services industry. We have owned this stock for many years and it has performed terrifically for shareholders.IBD: Abiomed has also run up, but it continues to post big earnings increases. What's the potential for this stock and what are the risks?Dunkerley: For the long term, we think Abiomed has great prospects.  They have a strong competitive position in small heart pumps for cardiac surgeries. We think the available possible total market (TAM) for these pumps could be as much as an estimated 500 thousand units globally over time, although we don't expect Abiomed to capture all of that market, as few companies ever do that and competition almost always surfaces at some point.We estimate their unit volumes just passed the 24,000 annualized run rate, so there is a long potential runway to this story. Their products are life savers in the hands of a well-trained cardiac surgeon, and they are expanding overseas.The risks in a stock like this are usually competition, which is developing slowly, high statistical valuation that can lead to a correction in the stock, or some type of unexpected flaw in the technology, or poor execution. Since their devices are approved and used in the U.S., Japan, and Germany, among others, and they have great sales and profit momentum, we view the latter risk as low. The stock has had a great run so it could be a better one to buy on pullbacks.IBD:  Atmos Energy (ATO) is 12% off its high and looking for a bottom. What's your thinking on this stock's prospects at this point?Dunkerley: This is a quality utility company, serving the lower-risk market of regulated gas utility service, with a service footprint in eight states including a large presence in Texas.  Regulated utilities offer a better safety profile in our opinion than many industries, so we have owned them in size from time to time when the cycle is right, such as when we expect interest rates to be stable or falling.Atmos has an excellent safety record, which helps them to gain favor with state regulators, and that has driven better than average earnings growth. They also maintain a conservative balance sheet, which we like.Atmos may be one of the few utilities that keeps a chunk of their tax savings from the recent corporate tax cuts, due to potential favorable treatment in Texas, where 70% of their assets are located. However, that is a developing situation and will depend on political outcomes, never a certainty.The main concern with the stock now is the direction of interest rates, which have moved higher.  So Atmos has moved down with the utility sector. Our weighting in utilities is underweight currently vs. the benchmark due to our outlook for higher interest rates.IBD: What happened to Arista Networks that it's 22% off its all-time high after beating earnings estimates? How do you handle a stock like this?Dunkerley: Arista is a share taker in the fast-growing switch market for cloud infrastructure. However after a big run-up, the stock has pulled back, possibly due to what we perceive as conservative guidance by management. We think Arista's advantages are in their software and management expertise, so we are confident in their long-term outlook. Enterprises are rapidly shifting workloads to the cloud and Arista's networking software was built for this environment.IBD: What's your favorite stock at this point, the one with potential to deliver the strongest performance?Dunkerley: For the near to intermediate term, I would have to go with DXC Technologies, our largest holding due to its low valuation and potential operating margin improvement, the potential for a spinoff, and or another special dividend. The global macroeconomic background is favorable for technology companies at the moment, with decent economic growth in many areas of the world, a change from a few years back.Finally, technology spending is a capital expenditure which we think can do well in the middle to late part of an economic cycle, since we believe companies are more likely to spend on technology systems when they feel better about their financial prospects. The recent corporate tax cut in the U.S. helps reinforce our point of view on this, we believe.  However, for the long-term, Abiomed may have the greatest upside potential due to reasons previously mentioned.IBD: Where did you serve in the Air Force, and are there any aspects of serving in the military that translate well to money management?Dunkerley: I served in B-52 bomber units, and was stationed in Maine and California. Military service is good at fostering teamwork and communications skills, and the ability to perform under stress. I enjoyed my time of service and learned a great deal.RELATED:Look Who's Replacing This Top Fidelity Manager During His LeaveWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?

7,HRS,"It may seem a bit far out — plans to send humans on a roughly seven-month, 34-million-mile ride to Mars, all for the privilege of standing where temperatures can get to 100 degrees below zero.XBut colonizing Mars is a central reason Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla (TSLA),  founded his rocket-ship company SpaceX 15 years ago. Musk, who spends equal time between Tesla and SpaceX, is one of four billionaires who are using their fortunes to fulfill a passion for space exploration and tourism.The four have attracted a fleet of venture capitalists, big corporations and other investors into a private-sector space race of sorts. They imagine a world where entrepreneurs can create business opportunities in space that include galaxies of small satellites controlling gadgets on the ground and initiatives to send humans on thrill rides to the moon, all outside the reach of government budget battles and a fickle voting public. Musk has said many times that the ultimate goal of SpaceX is to make Earth's population a space-faring society.SpaceX, based in Los Angeles County, already has taken a step into the heavens, ferrying supplies to the International Space Station. It's keeping an eye on further commercial exploration of the final frontier.""It's a fantastic time to be in the industry,"" said Carissa Bryce Christensen, founder of Bryce Space and Technology, a research and consulting firm for space and satellite industries.Startup space ventures have attracted more than $16.6 billion in investments since 2000, Christensen says. That money has funded 140 new companies, two-thirds of them in the last five years and most of them in the satellite business, she adds. Last year alone, $2.8 billion was pumped into 43 startup space ventures.""Musk changed the narrative, transforming the way people think and talk about space technology in a very inspirational way,"" Christensen said.Other billionaires doing business in the great beyond include Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, who established Blue Origin 16 years ago to make rocket ships for space tourism and science missions. Bezos recently said he sells about $1 billion in Amazon stock a year to finance his Blue Origin rocket company.Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Paul Allen has Stratolaunch Systems, which he co-founded to build the world's largest aircraft by wingspan, able to carry rockets to the edge of space to deliver small satellites into orbit. It has a partnership with Orbital ATK (OA).And Virgin Group founder Richard Branson is another space enthusiast. His company, Virgin Galactic, aims to be ready to launch its first passengers on thrill rides to suborbital space later this year. The cost per seat? $250,000. The spacecraft seats six with a two-person crew. Science missions are also planned.Musk, Bezos, Branson and Allen have brought back to life a U.S. space business that was demoralized by the retirement of the space shuttle fleet in 2011, Christensen says. Of the four, Musk has done the most to demonstrate an economic case for space, enticing previously reluctant venture capitalists to invest billions in the commercial transports outside the stratosphere.Musk founded SpaceX with $100 million of his own money, acquired from the sale of PayPal (PYPL), which he co-founded, to eBay (EBAY) for $1.4 billion. SpaceX now has a private-sector valuation of about $12 billion and holds multibillion-dollar contracts with NASA to resupply the International Space Station and deliver astronauts to and from the station. SpaceX also has extensive contracts to launch commercial satellites.Bezos' Blue Origin has made several test flights of its rocket, New Shepard, which is designed as a reusable spacecraft for space tourism that will fly passengers to the edge of space, about 62 miles high. It has made several successful launches but has not yet begun commercial operations.Blue Origin is building another rocket ship, called New Glenn, that it says will be taller and more powerful than the biggest rocket in development by SpaceX, the Falcon Heavy. The company's rockets are named after two of the original seven NASA Mercury astronauts, Alan Shepard and John Glenn.IBD'S TAKE: New products or services are part of the N in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system.

None of the four billionaire-founded space startups in this article trades publicly, but you can scroll our IBD 50 list of top stocks to discover other innovative companies. Bezos made billions from his creation of Amazon, which he has used to self-fund most of Blue Origin. He's pumped an estimated $1 billion in Blue Origin. In 2015, Google and Fidelity invested $1 billion in SpaceX.SpaceX initially fueled the jump in space activity by pushing down the cost of rocket launches. That put the ability to catch a ride to space well within the reach of entrepreneurs to create various commercial space operations.Phillip Spector, counsel at the Washington, D.C., office of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, says lowering the cost of space access was critical for commercial expansion. Before joining Milbank, Spector was executive vice president of business development and general counsel at Intelsat (I), one of the largest satellite operators worldwide.At Intelsat, ""The biggest issue we faced was around launch, the pricing for launch and availability. There were not enough suppliers,"" Spector said. ""The addition of competition from SpaceX was very welcome.""Investors have yet to benefit from this new wave of enthusiasm.Shares of many large space companies and government contractors have long traded on the public markets, including Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Orbital ATK, Harris Corp. (HRS), ViaSat (VSAT) and Orbcomm (ORBC). Boeing and Lockheed Martin have a joint venture called the United Launch Alliance that provides spacecraft launch services and competes against SpaceX.But there has yet to be a high-profile IPO from the crop of startup companies now flooding the market. The company best positioned for a possible IPO is SpaceX, which would undoubtedly draw widespread attention. But SpaceX recently shot down rumors that a public stock offering was in the planning.""Musk has been clear about not wanting to take SpaceX public,"" said Spector. ""We're not seeing a rush to IPOs among space companies out here today. I don't see Bezos or Branson having the need to take their company public.""But that hasn't stopped the chunks of money flowing into the market.""The funding environment for startup companies is robust,"" said Spector.Startup companies have focused on a number of narrow business models. One is building and launching fleets of small satellites to circle the Earth in a low orbit.They're using the satellites to study agriculture trends, track ships, produce high-frequency weather reports and study water pollution patterns, among other things. There's also a big market in the making with the advent of what's called the Internet of Things, which includes machine-to-machine communication.""These startups are doing some truly innovative things, using off-the-shelf technology and getting near the performance of assets that were 10 times the cost,"" said Dara Panahy, a Milbank partner who represents clients in aerospace and communications. ""That is a real game-changer.""Then there are massive projects such as OneWeb, which plans to launch the first of 700 satellites next year to provide high-speed internet and other communication services. Partners in the OneWeb venture include Branson, Qualcomm (QCOM), SoftBank (SFTBY), Airbus (EADSY) and Coca-Cola (KO). Investors plowed $1.2 billion into OneWeb in 2016.""The market has matured and grown and, along with some of the other enabling technologies, that lowered barriers to getting into space,"" said Panahy. ""So now you have true venture-capital-funded startups and angel-funded startups that can now launch on maybe less than $100,000.""That compares with launches in the tens of millions and even hundreds of millions of dollars in some cases today.Among the space startups is Rocket Lab, which has developed a rocket from scratch that's designed for frequent launches to low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab had the first test of its rocket, called Electron, in May. It plans to conduct two more test flights in 2017 and launch customer payloads next year.At full production, Rocket Lab expects to launch more than 50 times a year. In comparison, last year saw 22 launches from the U.S. and 82 internationally, according to Rocket Lab.Acquisitions have helped draw venture capital. They're the primary way VCs get a return on investment. Fifteen space-related companies have been acquired for a total value of $3.2 billion since 2000, demonstrating a return on investment that venture capitalists want to see.Among the acquisitions, Europe-based satellite operator SES paid $703 million to buy the other half of a company called O3b it didn't already own. O3b is a big player in the small-satellite communication field.Another startup is Planet, a maker of small satellites, with about 100 now in orbit, some about the size of a shoe box. Planet, previously known as Planet Labs, can image the whole Earth every 24 hours, providing data that can be used to solve commercial, environmental and humanitarian challenges.RELATED: In Jeff Bezos-Elon Musk Space Race, Score One For Amazon's BezosSpaceX Rocket Explosion Comes At Worst Possible Time For MuskSpaceX Jumps Aboard Space Tourism With Planned Moon Flight For TwoBezos To Launch Blue Origin Rockets At Cape Canaveral

8,HRS,"On Thursday, Harris (HRS) cleared an important performance benchmark, seeing its Relative Strength (RS) Rating jump into the 80-plus percentile with an improvement to 81, up from 78 the day before. X This proprietary rating tracks technical performance by showing how a stock's price action over the last 52 weeks measures up against that of other stocks on the major indexes. History reveals that the best stocks tend to have an RS Rating north of 80 in the early stages of their moves.Harris is still within a buying range after breaking past a 114.42 entry in a flat base. The proper buying range extends to 5% above the initial entry. Once a stock moves above that range, it's best to wait for it to set up another buying opportunity. Earnings grew 15% last quarter, up from 2% in the prior report. Revenue also increased, from -4% to 1%. Harris holds the No. 8 rank among its peers in the Telecom-Cable/Satellite Equipment industry group. Liberty Global Lilac (LILA), Adtran (ADTN) and Liberty Global Lilac (LILAK) are among the top 5 highly rated stocks within the group.RELATED:Which Stocks Are Showing Improved Technical Action?Why Should You Use IBD's Relative Strength Rating?How Relative Strength Line Can Help You Judge A Stock

9,HRS,"REDONDO BEACH, Calif. — Northrop Grumman (NOC) and NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, which will be launched next year, will probe deeper and see more than its predecessor, the Hubble.XLockheed Martin's (LMT)Hubble has returned mind-blowing images of black holes and nebulae since its launch in 1990 while producing breakthroughs in how we understand the universe, but researchers needed a more advanced system to probe further into space, especially to see how early stars and galaxies formed.""NASA wanted something that answered two questions: Are we alone in the universe and where did we come from?"" said Scott Willoughby, telescope program manager for Webb prime contractor Northrop, in a recent interview.The Webb telescope will be 100 times more sensitive than the Hubble, thanks to its 18 hexagonal mirrors, built by Ball Aerospace. Each mirror is over four feet across, forming a primary mirror 21.3 feet across. Hubble's primary mirror is just under eight feet across.The Webb telescope can also fix itself, unlike the Hubble, which required astronauts to fix the focus it a few years after launching in 1990. But because the Webb will be a million miles from Earth vs. the Hubble's 300-mile distance, a similar repair job won't be possible.Willoughby said the Webb has seven motors on its mirrors to ""change the prescription"" of the lenses and it takes just seconds to move the mirrors and change the focus.And unlike the Hubble, the Webb will capture infrared light, as its giant mirrors will be protected from picking up heat and light from the sun.Northrop built five massive sun shields from Kapton, a film made by Dupont (DD) that won't distort in the extreme cold of outer space.""The material has been used on smaller applications, but this is the first time it will be used as a giant umbrella application,"" Willoughby said.The price tag on Webb telescope also tops the Hubble's. The total estimated life cycle cost for the new telescope is $8.8 billion, which includes the operating costs for the first five years and for two years of data analysis, according to NASA. The Hubble's initial costs along with five years of operation and data analysis costs amount to $7.5 billion in today's dollars.Shares of Northrop were down 0.2% on the stock market today but still above buy range. Webb subcontractors Orbital ATK (OA) and Harris (HRS) were down 1.4% and 0.2%, respectivelyIBD'S TAKE: Northrop, Lockheed and Raytheon are already past their buy points. But fastener distributor and logistics services leader KLX could be ready to break out. On Monday, Northrop said that all five of the telescope's sun shield layers have been installed and fully integrated, and the company is now folding the 70-by-40-foot sheets to fit into an Ariane 5 rocket in time for deployment tests scheduled for later this month.The telescope is scheduled for an October 2018 launch from French Guiana. It will take six months for the telescope to unfurl its sun shields and mirrors, calibrate its instruments, cool down and reach its destination. Then the research can begin.One of the first missions will be taking a closer look at three planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system, which was discovered last year and could have the right conditions to support life.RELATED: The B-2 Maker Is Also A Stealth Chip Giant And Competes Commercially

11,HRS,"AT&T (T) did the expected Thursday and won the contract to build out FirstNet, the federal government's nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety.U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross made the announcement Thursday morning in Washington. Details of the agreement had yet to be ironed out, but AT&T will be the primary contractor responsible for adding towers and antennas to build out the vast network. AT&T said its ""team"" to deploy FirstNet includes Motorola Solutions (MSI), General Dynamics (GD), Sapient Consulting and Inmarsat Government.Congress has set aside $6.5 billion for the contract winner to design and build out the network. It's expected that AT&T will spend about $40 billion over the life of the deal to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network.As part of the contract, though, AT&T will gain access to a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the life of the 25-year contract. While the FirstNet public safety network would be prioritized for emergency responders, the winning bidder would also be able to use the spectrum for commercial purposes and consumer services, considered highly valuable.IBD'S TAKE: Shares in AT&T, which in October agreed to buy media giant Time Warner (TWX), are down about 2% in 2017. Rising interest rates are negative for high-dividend paying stocks, such as AT&T and Dow component Verizon Communications (VZ). Research other options at The Income Investor.AT&T beat out Rivada Networks, a consortium that includes wireless network makers Nokia (NOK) and Ericsson (ERICY) as well as chipmaker Intel (INTC), and Harris (HRS).Analysts say FirstNet's buildout should boost cell tower operators such as American Tower (AMT) and SBA Communications (SBAC).Shares of AT&T were up 0.8% to close at 41.76 on the stock market today.RELATED:Cell Tower Stocks Claw Back On Verizon-AT&T Unlimited-Data WarComcast, Charter Morphing Into Broadband-First Providers

12,HRS,"AT&T's (T) expected network upgrade tied to FirstNet, the federal government's plan to create a nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety, should boost the fortunes of American Tower[ticker symb=AMT], an analyst said Wednesday.Brandon Nispel, analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, hiked his price target on American Tower to 132 from 130.As part of the FirstNet contract, AT&T would gain access to a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for 25 years. Separately, AT&T has another 40 MHz of airwaves that would be part of a network upgrade. Wireless phone companies rent tower space to house radio antennas.""AT&T will have around 60 MHz of fallow spectrum to deploy, which we believe would benefit the towers,"" said Nispel in a report. ""We think American Tower and SBA Communications (SBAC) have the most to gain.""AT&T has been the front-runner to land the FirstNet contract and an announcement is expected soon.While the FirstNet public safety network would be prioritized for emergency responders, the winning bidder would also be able to use the spectrum for commercial purposes and consumer services. Nispel says the public safety network could require more towers in rural areas.IBD'S TAKE: Verizon and AT&T have been favorites of investors looking for high dividends, but there are other options, such as banks, industrials and real estate investment trusts (REITs). Check out IBD's Income Investor for high-dividend-paying stocks.""While exactly how AT&T will design the network is unknown, it should be clear that this should certainly benefit the tower operators. Once the terms of the contract are specified by the government, then the tower companies will have a better understanding of its potential,"" he added.AT&T beat out Rivada Networks, a consortium that includes wireless network makers Nokia (NOK) and Ericsson (ERICY) as well as chipmaker Intel (INTC), and Harris (HRS).AT&T likely did not bid aggressively in a government auction of spectrum owned by local TV stations, analysts say. That auction is expected to end in April. T-Mobile US (TMUS), Verizon Communications (VZ) and possibly cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA) are expected to garner the most spectrum.American Tower stock climbed 1.3% to close at 118.31 on the stock market today. American Tower stock is nearing a buy point of 118.36.

13,HRS,"Botched testing by a Lockheed Martin (LMT) subcontractor on a key component for the U.S.' newest Global Positioning System satellites raises new questions about the No. 1 defense contractor's supervision of the project, according to a top Air Force official.The mistake by subcontractor Harris Corp. (HRS) forced another delay in the delivery of the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites until later this month, according to Major General Roger Teague, the Air Force's chief of space programs. That will make the $528 million satellite 34 months late, according to service data.Lockheed has a contract to build the first 10 of the satellites designed to provide a more accurate version of the Global Positioning System used for everything from the military's targeting of terrorists to turn-by-turn directions for civilians' smartphones.The program's latest setback may affect a pending Air Force decision on whether to open the final 22 satellites to competition from Lockheed rivals Boeing (BA) and Northrop Grumman (NOC).""This was an avoidable situation and raised significant concerns with Lockheed Martin subcontractor management/oversight and Harris program management,"" Teague said in a Dec. 21 message to congressional staff obtained by Bloomberg News. Shares of Lockheed were up fractionally to 257.28 in late-afternoon trading.The parts in question are ceramic capacitors that have bedeviled the satellite project. They take higher-voltage power from the satellite's power system and reduce it to a voltage required for a particular subsystem.Last year, the Air Force and contractors discovered that Harris hadn't conducted tests on the components, including how long they would operate without failing, that should have been completed in 2010.Now, the Air Force says it found that Harris spent June to October of last year doing follow-up testing on the wrong parts instead of samples of the suspect capacitors installed on the first three satellites. Harris ""immediately notified Lockheed and the government"" after a post-test inspection, Teague said in his message.Lockheed spokesman Chip Eschenfelder said in an email said that testing of the capacitors' design was successfully completed in December.""The capacitors met all mission qualification requirements,"" he said, so ""we are confident the capacitors are mission-ready.""Harris spokeswoman Ellen Mitchell said in an email that company personnel last year identified a capacitor ""that was not subjected to all required qualification tests. Once the issue was discovered, Harris deployed a team dedicated to complete the required capacitor tests. The capacitor qualification testing was successfully completed in December 2016.""Teague said in an interview, though, that Harris was required to perform not only a test to show that the part met design specifications but a separate one to assess the component's reliability and whether it met a requirement to last 15 years. That second test wasn't accomplished because ""they used the wrong test item,"" he said.Cristina Chaplain, a military space systems director at the Government Accountability Office, said in an email that the latest problem ""undermines the faith in the progress, if any, that the government and contractor may have been making in turning around a culture that has led to multiyear delays"" and cost increases.The Air Force has decided to accept the first satellite even if its capacitors may be flawed because removing them could delay the delivery until October and cost about $70 million, Teague wrote to the congressional staff. The Air Force is confident in the first satellite's overall reliability based on 3,000 hours of cumulative testing, Teague said.The Air Force will have to pay to replace the suspect capacitors on the second and third satellites. That's because the satellites are being developed under cost-reimbursement-type contracts, which require the Pentagon to pay for cost increases, the service said.In an Air Force list of priorities that lacked funding for this year, the service said it needed $100 million for GPS III ""capacitor repair/replace."" Captain AnnMarie Annicelli, an Air Force spokeswoman, said the list represented potential expenditures on which final decisions had not been made.

14,HRS,"President Trump summoned some of America's most prominent corporate executives to the White House Thursday and told them he intends to put them to work restoring manufacturing jobs and U.S. dominance in trade.""They share our commitment to bring manufacturing back and to create jobs in this country,"" Trump said as he sat with the 24 business leaders, who included Dow Chemical (DOW) Chief Executive Officer Andrew Liveris, General Electric (GE) CEO Jeffrey Immelt, Lockheed Martin (LMT) CEO Marillyn Hewson, and Caterpillar (CAT) Chairman Doug Oberhelman.Trump used the public portion of the meeting to reiterate some of his campaign themes, blasting what he called ""unbelievably bad"" trade deals and singling out trade deficits with Mexico and China. He vowed to punish companies that move jobs outside the U.S. and promised to squeeze more money out of government contracts, citing his talks with Hewson, which he said cut the cost of Lockheed's F-35 fighter jet by more than $700 million.""She's tough, but it worked out well I think for everybody,"" Trump said of Hewson.Before meeting with Trump, the executives split into working groups to explore policy changes on topics such as taxes and trade, regulation, infrastructure and the future workforce. Joining them in the breakout sessions were administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence; Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council; Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin; and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.Campbell Soup (CPB) CEO Denise Morrison, Harris Corp. (HRS) CEO Bill Brown, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) CEO Alex Gorsky and David Farr, CEO of Emerson Electric (EMR), were among those who took part in the working group sessions with administration officials, who also included budget director Mick Mulvaney.  In a meeting with Cohn and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, business leaders including Corning (GLW) CEO Wendell Weeks and Nucor (NUE) President John Ferriola discussed indexing gasoline taxes to provide more money for transportation projects.Thursday's meeting grew out of Trump's December announcement of an advisory panel on manufacturing.Dow Chemical's Liveris, who is leading the panel, said afterward that he and the other executives were ""very encouraged"" by the pro-business approach being taken by the administration.Taking part in a session on the workforce of the future, Liveris said there must be a ""systemic fix"" to address the shortage of workers prepared for jobs requiring skills in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.""We have supply-side issues today,"" he said, ""half a million open STEM jobs that we can't fill. We need to fill them with Americans.""He also said community colleges need to provide more vocational training for ""the noble trades,"" which had been a priority of the Obama administration.Lockheed's Hewson told reporters that Trump is ready to take quick action on streamlining rules for businesses. ""It's very important that we reduce regulations, that we eliminate those that are burdensome that are unnecessary,"" she said.Ahead of the meeting, Business Roundtable, the lobbying group for U.S. corporate executives, sent a letter to Cohn laying out 16 regulations of top concern to its members. The letter touches on everything from the Affordable Care Act to net neutrality to environmental regulations — but also hints at CEO concerns about the economic impacts of Trump immigration and trade policy.Topping the Business Roundtable list is a 2015 move by the Environmental Protection Agency to tighten national ambient air quality standards for ground-level ozone, as well as EPA limits on new coal-fired power plants and expanded jurisdiction over state waters. The list also includes overtime regulations; Dodd-Frank provisions including CEO pay ratio disclosure, conflict minerals disclosure rules and margin requirements for uncleared swaps; and employer reporting and tax requirements under the Affordable Care Act. In addition, the group is seeking expedited export controls and tightening eligibility and increasing exclusions for shareholder proposals.""While some of the listed regulations in isolation may not appear significant to growth, their cumulative effect has drained resources from innovation and job creation and directed them to non-value adding administrative and bureaucratic activities,"" said the letter, signed by Mark Costa, the chairman and CEO for Eastman Chemical (EMN) who leads Business Roundtable's smart regulation committee.At the same time, the letter said that as the administration ""considers new policies with regard to immigration or the expansion of 'Buy America' requirements, Business Roundtable stands ready to assist to prevent unintended consequences that would inhibit the ability for U.S. companies to drive economic growth and be globally competitive.""Trump has used previous meetings with companies to encourage corporate leaders to build their products in the U.S., offering tax breaks and lower regulation to bring down costs — and warning that he wants to raise tariffs on products produced overseas. The heads of labor organizations, automotive firms, national retail chains, drug companies, and airlines are all among the groups who have met with Trump in the West Wing in recent weeks.Neither Trump nor the CEOs indicated they had a detailed discussion of his plans to overhaul the tax code, which he has said he will deliver within weeks, or a border-adjustment tax proposal under consideration by House Republicans, which would shift the tax burden from exporters to importers.Republican leaders in the House, including Speaker Paul Ryan, argue a border-adjustment tax would benefit American manufacturing while providing revenue to make up for losses from reducing corporate tax rates. Several manufacturers, including Dow Chemical, are actively lobbying for the plan, which Trump has called ""too complicated."" Opponents, including net importers like Wal-Mart (WMT), oppose it and warn it will raise taxes on American consumers.
"
15,HRS,"AT&T (T) appears likely to win the federal contract award for FirstNet, the federal government's plan to create a nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety, analysts say, a development that would have ramifications for Verizon Communications (VZ), T-Mobile US (TMUS), Comcast (CMCSA) and others taking part in a government auction of TV airwaves.As part of the FirstNet contract, AT&T would gain access to a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum, giving it less reason to bid aggressively in the TV spectrum auction, says Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research.And while it's unclear if that's what happened, the FCC on Monday, in its latest bidding stage in the auction, said total bids came to only $19.7 billion, where broadcasters had recently lowered the asking price to $40.3 billion. Now, broadcasters will need to decide by mid-December whether to lower their asking price yet again.""With AT&T gaining access to 20 MHz of low-band spectrum via FirstNet, we suspect that (AT&T's) interest in similar low-band spectrum in the 600 MHz (TV) auction will now be diminished,"" Chaplin wrote in a research report.While Chaplin says other registered spectrum bidders — such as Verizon, T-Mobile and Comcast — could step up and bid for more airwaves, another possibility is that TV broadcasters could walk away from the auction if they deem total bids as insufficient.IBD'S TAKE: A successful auction is important to T-Mobile, which analysts say is most in need of more airwaves. T-Mobile stock is up nearly 40 . Dish Network stock has been in a trading range since the auction started in March. Learn more about Comcast, another registered bidder, at IBD Stock CheckupThe National Association of Broadcasters had a cryptic initial response to Monday's event.""The results of the latest round of the TV auction leave us scratching our heads, given the decade-long refrain of a spectrum crunch,"" NAB CEO Gordon Smith said in a statement. ""We look forward to the next round.""As regards FirstNet, AT&T appears to have beat out Rivada Networks, a consortium that includes wireless network makers Nokia (NOK) and Ericsson (ERICY) as well as Intel Security, part of chipmaker Intel (INTC), and Harris (HRS), although Rivada has mounted a legal challenge, says Chaplin.""We now believe that FirstNet will delay the announcement until after the Rivada court case has run its course, likely around March of 2017,"" said Chaplin.Tim Long, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, agrees that AT&T is the FirstNet front-runner.""AT&T has disclosed a number of updates regarding the FirstNet bidding process,"" said Long in a report. ""The company believes it is the only bidder remaining in the 'competitive range' of the process, as rival Rivada was deemed outside this range for the contract.""""After pdvWireless (PDVW) dropped out of the FirstNet bidding process in October 2016, we believed AT&T and Rivada were the two remaining bidders,"" Long wrote. ""As Motorola Solutions (MSI) was not listed in the extensive list of partners to Rivada, we believed Motorola Solutions may be a likely partner to AT&T.""If AT&T wins the FirstNet contract, ""We believe it is unlikely the carrier would participate in the broadcaster auction in a meaningful way,"" said Mike McCormack, a Jefferies analyst, in a report Monday. ""As such, we see downside to our initial $30 billion carrier demand estimate, which could also delay the auction timing. We had anticipated around $9 billion in spend from AT&T, implying adjusted demand in the low-$20-billion range ex-AT&T, not far from the current $19.7 billion offered in stage 3.""Whoever wins the FirstNet contract would need to invest in network infrastructure. Congress has set aside 20 MHz of spectrum in the ""D block"" of the 700 MHz frequency band for the public safety network. While the FirstNet public safety network would be prioritized for emergency responders, the winning bidder would also be able to use the spectrum for commercial purposes and consumer services.According to an October Wells Fargo report, ""barring a national emergency, we estimate the spectrum will be less than 1 ted by public safety needs, which provides the (FirstNet) winner with access to that excess capacity.""In the TV airwaves auction, broadcasters just last week again reduced their asking price for prime wireless airwaves, this time to $40.3 billion. In two earlier rounds, TV broadcasters initially sought $86 billion for 100 megahertz of usable radio spectrum, then dropped their asking price to $54.6 billion for 90 MHz. If bidders agree to pay at least $40.3 billion combined, that would open up 80 MHz of airwaves for mobile video and other data services.If the TV spectrum is scuttled, that would be a plus for satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH), analysts say. Dish Network has some 77 MHz of airwaves and has been looking for a wireless partner.AT&T stock rose 2 cents in the stock market today to 38.63 and is trading just above the key 50-day moving average support line. Dish Network stock rose 2% to 56.66.

19,HRS,"So yesterday at about 3 pm EST the news hit the tape, the twitter sphere and the media outlets.....Headlines screamed:***BREAKING NEWS – SUNDAY APRIL 17, 2016 - ***Failure In Qatar - OPEC ministers unable to come to an agreement - oil mkts began to tremble - investors/traders now had to re-assess the reality of a fractured oil mkt......Oil which has rallied 18% from the early April lows and 30% off of the January lows and are now front and center as Asian mkts prepared to open - initial reactions saw oil plunge 6% as investors hit the sell button first only to ask questions later.....the headlines saturated the web.....who would be first to announce this failure and then the resulting mkt action? The headlines began...""Doha Summit Fails to Agree on Output Freeze""""Oil Freeze Talks End in Failure Amid Saud Demands Over Iran""""Oil Tumbles 5% on Doha Deal Disappointment""""Asia Stocks at Mercy of Post Doha Oil Moves""""Oil's Grand Bargain Falls Victim to Saudi Arabia's Iran Fixation""Futures around the globe plunged as day turned to night and the sun began to set in the US just as it began to rise across Asia….US futures were down 11 pts at 8 pm Sunday evening – while futures across Asia pointed in a similar direction as investors dealt with the fallout. News stories began detailing the talks that took place in Doha – the Qatari capital – which dragged on and on – going some 10 hrs past the original scheduled end time – as ""Howie Mandel"" shouted out –No Deal!Oil ministers from 16 nations, representing 50% of the world's production, gathered in the Qatari capital as they worked towards stabilizing the global mkt with artificial production quotas - the first real attempt at coordinating output among OPEC members and nations outside of the group since 2001. The barriers were numerous - would everyone fall into line? Would Iran come to the table? Could they really commit to restraining production? As we know - the Saudi's made it very clear from the beginning......they wouldn't restrain their production without commitments from other major producers including Iran, which had already made it clear that they had no such intention.The breaking story about a failure to agree on output or production quotas among the world's biggest oil producers now opens the flood gates to what many now expect to be a new retreat in oil prices.""Discussions stumbled after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations wouldn't agree to any deal unless all OPEC members joined including Iran, which wasn't present at the meeting…""Angus Nicholson – an analyst at IG Ltd in Melbourne, Australia had this to say:""The market has been so heavily positioned for a deal to go through, The change of tone from the Saudis, particularly driven over the last few weeks by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has been quite a surprise to the market. With Saudi Arabia fighting proxy wars with Iran in Yemen and Syria/Iraq, it is understandable that they had little inclination to freeze their own production and make way for newly sanctions-free Iran to increase their market share.""So then what happened? Was there really a change in tone from the Saudi's? Did investors get this all wrong? Once the idea of a freeze was floated (two months ago) – trader types started buying up oil – as it was assumed that any freeze would trim supply just as summer was about to begin and the driving season was about to take off… Oil rallied 30% off the lows as the excitement built…..but hey, buyer beware – remember it was the news sources that reported this ‘cease fire' all while the Saudi's and the Russians never really confirmed or denied the story - they let it play out in the media - they never explicitly committed. ….It all sounded good – but it did require that all members fall into line and Iran had said from the very beginning that they had no intention of ‘playing nice in the sandbox'.Overnight oil suffered a bit - with Brent down 4% and WTI (West Texas Intermediate) down about 4.5% - makes some sense - but equity mkts did NOT follow suit and implode the way many thought they might.....In fact - we have to ask: Is a ‘No-Deal' actually better for the mkts in the long run as it allows for supply and demand to find its ‘natural' level of equilibrium vs. ‘artificial production controls' which will only put off the inevitable? ( I mean look - we all know what artificial controls can do to mkts - think massive QE programs instituted by every central bank)As Asian mkts opened – the pressure came to bear - mkts sold off - but not to the extent that many were prepared for.....…..Japan was the outlier - falling some 3+% - but this had more to do with the major series of earthquakes in the past 3 days – vs. the oil story.... South Korea (Kospi) moved 0.28% lower, Australia stumbled by 0.4%, Hong Kong lost 0.9% and China was off 1.43% by the end of the day.As the sun sets on Asia it rises in Europe and as the clock ticked – European mkts were the next to react.....they too are under a bit of pressure – taking their cue from investor angst in Asia - but again - equities are not getting clobbered by any stretch.......Currently Brent North Sea Crude oil is off by 2% while WTI (West Texas Intermediate) is down by nearly 3% trading at $39/barrel. FTSE - 0.07%, CAC 40 - 0.04%, DAX +0.06%, EUROSTOXX - 0.18%, SPAIN -0.35% and ITALY +0.11%.US futures which were down 11 pts Sunday evening have recovered a bit from the initial ‘knee jerk' reaction trading last night – currently they are lower by 7 pts as the reality of this OPEC decision permeates the psyche. Since the equity mkts did not implode on this news (as many had expected) – we need to ask: Are investors trying to separate action in the oil/energy space from the rest of the mkt. Now while energy names will get hit today – think transports and manufacturers as beneficiaries of lower oil prices.Earnings will continue to ramp up this week as we enter the thick of it. Last week- the message was all about the banks….now while we saw trading revenues decrease and loan loss reserves increase and most reports miss revenue estimates - they all managed to beat the on the bottom line. Uncle Lloyd (Blankfein) released a strategic restructuring plan ahead of his earnings this week - Headlines read:""Goldman's Blankfein Demands Deepest Cost Cuts in Years"" -on the chopping block? Travel limits, Entertainment, deferring projects and Layoffs as he""has already adjusted his workforce, relying more on JUNIOR bankers, moving support staff to cheaper locations and investing in technology to improve productivity""(Junior bankers? I mean if you want a Jr banker there are so many other places to go - You don't go to GS for a Jr. Banker)The stock rallied on this news taking it to its down trending 100 dma at $163.... earnings are due tomorrow...so the clock is ticking....did he do a good enough job of acknowledging the disastrous industry environment for the sake of investors?Earnings today include Morgan Stanley (MS) - they beat the estimate - reported 0.55 cts/sh vs. exp 0.46 cts/sh, Pepsico (PEP) - beat reporting 0.89 cts/sh vs. the 0.81 cts/sh expected. HASBRO (HAS)toys also beat 0.38 vs. 0.23 cts/sh.....later in the week we will hear from American Express (AXP), McDonald's (MCD), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), IBM (IBM), Intel (INTC), Cocoa Cola (KO) and Microsoft (MSFT)There is not major economic data points today..so the chatter will be about earnings and oil.....and the 3 FED speakers today....Dudley at 8:30 am, Kashkari at 12:30 pm and Rosengren at 7 pm....Take Good Care

"
21,HRS,"T-10 hrs days until the official start of earnings season and T-5 days until Uncle Sam comes knocking on your door asking for money…..all while the big banks are working extra hard to hold prices nearer the recent highs as the tax deadline approaches….Stocks ended lower last week with the S&P and Dow finishing in positive territory for the day but about 1% lower for the week….energy tried to make a comeback while financials and tech came under continued pressure. In initial trading – stocks gapped UP on the open – continuing to reflect the inverse relationship between the weaker dollar and oil – you see - as the dollar weakens, oil, other commodities and stocks tend to strengthen – but the strength in stocks was short lived as sellers took advantage of the move ahead of the weekend and buyers grew weary.There was plenty of conflicting data to deal with during the week - First we had a bevy of Fed Presidents giving their views on the state of affairs – as they try to show that they are in control of both monetary policy and the dollar – Does the word 'conflicting' mean anything to anyone? (Yellen - FED Chair - says rates are not going anywhere while members of the Peanut Gallery suggest that rates are going up at the end of the month) So once again the conflicting speeches did nothing but cause confusion and frustration among investors as the reality of exhausted monetary policy initiatives begins to bubble to the surface.And speaking of an 'exhausted monetary policy' – Did you hear all of the chatter around how the Yen continues to advance in the face of NEGATIVE interest rates? Yes – ma'am – the BoJ (Bank of Japan) last month introduced negative rates - as another source of stimulus - to try and force the Yen to weaken – thereby helping their export economy – but in a perverse twist of fate – the Yen has only strengthened vs. the dollar which is sending PM Shinzo Abe, Finance Minister Taro Aso and BoJ Governor Hauhiko Kuroda into a rage….And not to be outdone - negative interest rates imposed by the ECB (European Central Bank) two months ago are also NOT accomplishing the stated goals as the Euro continues to strengthen as well – sending Uncle Mario (Draghi) and other members of the ECB closer to the edge.But this leaves us to ask – are the strength in these currencies due to the recent FED inaction over the future of US interest rates or due to healthier Asian and European economies? The smart money is betting the former....(Remember: The expectation of a rate rise in March caused the dollar to rally vs. these currencies - from early Feb thru Mid March....but then - a NO action move by the fed, coupled with a clear concern over the state of the global economy caused the dollar to weaken sending these other reserve currencies higher and this is causing angst and panic among the paparazzi).Next up – we got a range of macroeconomic data points – all showing continued weakness in the economy which did nothing to help investor psyche – add in the chatter from some of the Fed representatives who discount the data and tell us that we are all wrong and that the economy is firing on all 12 cylinders and you have a perfect recipe for paralysis…..How's that working for you?And this week – there is plenty of global macro data points to digest. Retail sales from the US, China and Brazil. PPI's from the US, UK, Japan and China. CPI's from the US, UK, Euro zone, China. Industrial Production numbers from the US, Euro zone, China, Japan. Capacity Utilization and Empire Manufacturing from the US. We will also here from the BoE and the PBoC on additional monetary policy initiatives.Next up - Earnings! and while they tell us that we are NOT in another recession - there is no argument that US Corporate earnings are......As we know - this qtr is set to be the WORST season in 6 yrs.....with earnings projected to FALL by 9% - but with all of the most recent downgrades to earnings - the joke begins again.....You see - In the end – analysts cut the estimates to the bone, lowering the bar and making it almost impossible for companies NOT to beat the expectations and then the street gets to celebrate and the conversation turns to how the season 'wasn't so bad'…… (Psychology 101)Tonight after the bell - we get Alcoa (AA) - no longer considered the bell weather that it was when it was a member of the DOW - but their results will set the tone for some of the large multi-nationals.....The real kicker is going to be the major banks - think JP Morgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) which begin their confessional period on Wednesday...…..so watch for much more stock specific activity in the days ahead as the reports hit the tape. In the next couple f weeks - we will get the regional banks, energy and oil companies, retailers, drugs, healthcare, home builders, industrials/conglomerates and technology. What will the multinationals say about the state of affairs in their respective industries and the impact of monetary policy on their businesses – (Think dollar) vs. what will US businesses say about the condition of the US economy and the health of the US consumer?Remember – earnings are now history – they are what they are – what investors and the mkts want to see are the seeds of real top line revenue growth and projections for a more vibrant, robust future vs. continued talk of layoffs and cost cutting to support the bottom line…A quick glance back at mkt action over the past half dozen years and beyond reveals a seasonal weakness right after the 15th….and I would not expect this year to be any different at all…..I mean – What has changed in 8 yrs? Nothing really –Oh yes….the Obama administration will tell us how the economy has created some 14 mil new jobs and that the unemployment rate is below 5% and wages have stabilized and the consumer has never been stronger – and to that I say BS! Because if that were really true then FED policy would be different……rates would have normalized long ago, GDP would not be the pathetic sub 2% that it is, inflation would be greater than the 2% target and we would be seeing strong upward pressure on wages as companies compete for employees – and that is NOT happening at all. In fact – wages continue to weaken because of the massive supply of underemployed and unemployed Americans, older workers are getting thrown out in favor of younger less experienced workers (think expensive senior level people), other jobs continue to get shifted overseas where the minimum wage is maybe $3.50 an hr…Take the banking and credit card industry as an example – every time you call the 800 number – you get someone in a third world country that wants you SS number, your physical address, your IP address and your DOB... and then we wonder how we get our identities stolen?Overnight – Asian mkts were mixed. Japan (-0.5%) continues to be assaulted by a rising Yen sending exporters deeper into negative territory. BoJ Governor Kuroda is keeping a close eye on how a rising Yen is creating instability in the Nikkei and is prepared to act if need be. He will be in NY on Thursday - so expect to hear more from him then. In China (+1.4%) – The gov't released their March inflation data – CPI rose by 2.3% y/y – in line with forecasts while the monthly read fell by 0.4% m/m. The PPI fell by 4.3% y/y marking the 49th consecutive month of lower readings and this news only suggests that we can expect more monetary easing.
"
22,HRS,"The World Bank also warned of slowing economic growth in East Asia and the Pacific Rim due to a weaker China.....(more of the same....but it is a reason for some of today's Asian weakness) .European mkts are all in positive territory now that oil reversed its course lower in early trading. The Euro is trading flat vs. the dollar and the expectation of additional monetary stimulus continues to support those mkts. so the focus for them is also the coming earnings season. FTSE +0.01%, CAC 40 + 0.59%, DAX + 1.19%, EUROSTOXX + 1%, SPAIN +1.42% and ITALY +1.74%US futures are higher by 9 pts this morning - in a continued game of 'cat and mouse' ....suggesting that the S&P will try to test the most recent highs of 2075 before the onslaught of earnings begins. Remember - the underlying tech tone of the mkts is suspect at best......Companies that are in buyback mode are effectively out of the mkt for now - so let's see how investors really feel about the quality of earnings and the quality of the global macro data. I continue to believe that we will remain in the 2040/2070 range until we get bank earnings beginning on Wednesday.....And then the real test begins.Take Good Care

"
24,HRS,"So with little else to go on…the mkt churned – moved back and forth in a very tight range to end the day slightly higher as it digested Friday's move in the face of what is sure to be a busy 'Central Bank' week........expect lots of information, monetary policy decisions and speculation on behalf of traders around the world.Oil came under new pressure as oil investors/traders focused on the noise coming out of Tehran…..You see - Iranian officials reminded the world that they would NOT be joining the other members of the oil producing nations in capping production – or at least not until they grow their exports to 4 million barrels/day. So the March OPEC meeting is now seen as a non-event as investors look towards the April meeting for any action. As a result – Oil backed off and energy names/oil service stocks were weak.Next up - Gold! Gold has been seeing some profit taking – after its 22% surge since late December......Over the past couple of days - we have seen the trader types take about 4% out of the commodity as they 'ring cash register' and put the cash on the sidelines ahead of what could be a volatile week.Now while the mkt did not 'fall out of bed' – the choppy trading does remind us that there are 4 central bank policy meetings/decisions/conversations happening this week. With the FED's monetary policy decision only hours away now….investors/traders/asset managers must also consider the impact of policy decisions coming out of the BoE (Bank of England), SNB ( Swiss National Bank) and the BoJ (Bank of Japan) this week. (This morning we found out that the BoJ as expected left rates unchanged AND downgraded their outlook on the Japanese economy - not good). Now while the majority of analysts/strategists/traders do not expect a move in US rates- they will be paying very close attention to the statement. Will we continue to see this 'central bank divergence'* or will the FED come to its senses at his time of continued global economic weakness?[*Central bank divergence - think US raising rates while the other major central banks are moving to negative rates.]As Bob Doll - Sr Portfolio Manager at Nuveen Asset Management points out:""They're going to be careful in how they say they're not done raising interest rates""So expect the rumors and speculation to heat up.....did she say 'definitely in June'? Did she tease and suggest that April or May are a possibility? Could she raise more than 1/4 of point - yes.....but did she intimate that she would? Is the recent run up in oil enough to change the course of the conversation? Is oil really expected to keep going up in light of all the supply that still exists?Now yesterday - we talked about how producers will come back on line as the price of oil moves higher....in fact - the WSJ ran with the article detailing the facts....and this morning - like clockwork they feature a headline article suggesting that:""Many Shale Producers are Unable to Ramp Up Oil Output""......And why?Well first - many of them are broke (I think they used the words 'financially strapped'), they have sent thousands of workers to the unemployment line (estimates suggest 110k+) and they have idled so much equipment (estimates say 60%+) that they can't very easily bring it back on line with no one to man the equipment.....and even IF prices should rally back to $50/barrel or greater - many of these companies are vowing to 'take it slow'......so there is your contra argument for the supply/demand argument.....after getting burned badly - do not expect the producers to run hog wild even if prices appear to be firming.....that being said - I do not see any reason for prices to move much higher than the low $40's at best.....although they will use the 'spring/summer driving season' as a reason for prices to move higher! I guess it just depends on who is screaming the loudest....Will it be Goldman Sachs (GS)? JP Morgan (JPM)? Citigroup (C)? Royal Bank of Canada (RY)? Morgan Stanley (MS)?......Now I have mentioned a number of times that the mkt has gone right to major resistance over the past month – helped by the move in Oil, the improving sense that maybe the US can weather the latest storm, the prospect of more stimulus coming from a range of central banks – think ECB, BoJ and PBoC – along with the renewed assumptions that the FED will hold steady……. All of this has helped to restore some sense of calm and confidence in the mkts.(Confidence about central bank policy - I remind you - can be short lived and we are about to find out just how US and global investors really feel about Janet's plan moving forward.)Many will look to tie yesterday's lack of action to the weakness in oil – I am not one of those…..now maybe you can tie the weakness in oil and the energy sector to the Iranians – but it is difficult to tie those statements to much else…I mean think about it.....do consumer staples, healthcare, housing, or financials really care about what the Iranians say or do when it comes to oil? Not so much.....I mean it's the Iranians - not the Saudi's......Let's not get carried away......Yes – inflammatory comments conveniently allow for some profit taking by traders in segments of the mkt that have enjoyed a recent run up off of the lows of February but if the mkt has really changed its tune – then we should continue to see the break between oil and the broader mkt as the focus returns to the health of the US & global economy and global monetary policy.Overnight saw global mkts back off on renewed commodity weakness and cautious central bank statements. Longer term investors now sitting back and traders turning a bit cautious after the recent run up in mkts and as the focus returns to global monetary policy....The BoJ as noted has started the conversation and it was NOT bullish.....Japan - 0.68%, Hong Kong - 0.72%, China +0.3% and ASX -1.43%European mkts are also under pressure as they react to the renewed commodity weakness...copper mining company - Antofagasta plunging 10% after reporting full yr pre-tax profits fell by 83% and cancelling their 4th qtr dividend. FTSE -0.69%, CAC 40 - 09.95%, DAX - 0.49%, Eurostoxx - 0.82%, Spain -1.27% and Italy - 0.94%US futures are down 10 pts in early trading - piercing S&P 2000.....Lots going on in the US today...... there are several key economic reports due this morning: Retail Sales, PPI and the Empire State Manufacturing Survey. In addition it is another 'Super Tuesday' in the political arena......Ohio and Florida are the Brass Rings and could well set the stage for what many now expect to be the tickets......Trump vs. Clinton.......Splinter far right and far left organizations continue to try and disrupt the process - but in the end democracy will prevail and Americans will get what they voted for - just as we have all endured 8 yrs of the Obama administration.....maybe it is time for a change..... I'm just sayin.......Let's discuss....But, the “main attraction ” is still the FOMC Rate Decision due out in 35 hrs.....and again it is not the decision (no hike) but rather the message that she delivers that will become the catalyst for the next move..... I continue to believe that our upper range will be confined to the 2020 area while the downside could see us test 1975 if we are not able to hold at S&P 2000. In the end though - no one should be surprised at all - UNLESS she completely backs off of any rate hike at all....(0% chance of that). So the trader types should get ready for the volatility while the long term investors should place their bets and line the book on the way down to scoop up any knee jerk reaction......Take Good Care

Because the message being sent by those global banks is - ""Houston? We've had a problem!"" ...suggesting that economies around the world are contracting -and that is not what Janet or the FED wants to hear.....so you ask - why doesn't she just block her ears? - Well - she and Cousin Stanley (Fischer - Vice Chair) have been doing that for quite some time now .....and now it's coming back to bite her in the ..... (fill in the blank)(And for those of you NOT old enough to remember that famous quotation - Those were the words uttered by Commander Jim Lovell - On April 13th, 1970 during the famed Apollo 13 spaceflight when an oxygen tank exploded and ripped off the side of the spacecraft service module while these men were in orbit approximately 205,000 miles from Earth on their way to the Moon -- the world was held in suspense as these men hobbled together duct tape, paper clips and straws in an attempt to 'repair' the spacecraft and return safely to Earth.....fearing that if they were unsuccessful - they would be lost forever - hurtling thru space going who knew where........In the end though those men succeeded using the duct tape and paper clips allowing them to keep it together and land the spacecraft in the vast Pacific Ocean near Samoa.)Sound somewhat familiar? Are we just hurtling thru space - seemingly out of control? Is the FED trying to hold it together with paper clips and duct tape...?Ok - back to the mkts.....Stocks soared on Friday on the news that Japan didn't just CUT interest rates - they have now gone NEGATIVE after 2 lost decades (joining a host of other nations)....sending global stocks into overdrive..... The rally was a knee jerk reaction to Japan's surprise decision to introduce negative interest rates for the first time in their history.Negative rates are a funny thing, right? They do succeed in driving down the currencies of those nations, which helps to boost inflation and exports....but this comes at the expense of other countries, which then causes those other countries to respond in kind with easier monetary policies of their own. (Remember the vicious circle?)I mean - take China......5 months ago - the PBoC's decision to devalue the Yuan was driven in part by their need to lower its own interest rates to stimulate growth. The lower Yuan, then put pressure on all of China's trading partners, including Japan, to ease monetary policy. And the result - investors swiftly repriced risk assets......setting off global turmoil as the game played out. On Friday - we saw that Citigroup economists are now predicting that many of the world's central banks would cut their rates even further into negative territory in coming months, ""should macroeconomic conditions turn out even weaker than currently expected.""This move by the BoJ sent Yogi (the Bear) running for cover as algorithms tripped over each other sending the Dow and S&P up 3.6% and 2.4% respectively as they attempted to cover short bets before the gains disappeared. And once again, we see that the catalyst that caught everyone by surprise was another temporary fix....more on that below....Ok - for Joe Q Public - what does that mean? Well, it means that if banks have reserve balances at the central bank (BoJ) then they will HAVE TO PAY the central bank for the privilege of having cash - they will no longer be paid interest on their deposits and potentially neither will depositors at local and regional banks. (Do you see where this is going?)The logic behind this thinking? Force people to take their money out of the bank and spend it - Forcing inflation to rear its UGLY head.....but here is the rub...... when an economy is booming and people are working and earning and spending money, then inflation is a NATURAL byproduct of too much money chasing too little supply. The stimulus is the expanding economy, But when they try to FORCE inflation using a form of 'artificial stimulus' in a contracting economy it usually spells disaster. (Think the 4 QE programs initiated by the FED).Nevertheless, this is apparently how all of these Ivy League central bankers think – if it doesn't happen naturally - then force it......this has become known as the 'Viagra effect'......take 'an economy' that is in contraction mode, give it a little 'blue pill' and force a 'short lived but pleasurable reaction' while ignoring the longer term cause. This has been proven many times to be a failed strategy - all it will do is force money out of the bank (safe haven) as it searches for yield temporarily causing stocks to move higher. It doesn't cause consumers to spend money - in fact it causes concern which only forces consumers to SAVE money.....as they expect tougher times ahead.Many analysts/strategists and long term asset managers do not suspect that this latest move will be the catalyst for an extended rally- unless of course it is accompanied by structural fiscal reforms that will boost investment and confidence - moves that our elected officials refuse to consider......Now artificial stimulus programs may cause the mkt to rally a bit more from here but this will only cause some to suggest that 'if it lasts longer than 4 hrs - see a doctor......'. In the end, we all know that the effects of this 'artificial stimulus' DO wear off and we find that the 'economy' returns to its contractionary mode. Look! the Kool Aid doesn't cut it anymore...
"
35,HRS,"Global growth forecasts are being cut and financial mkts are reeling as slowdowns in an array of economies raise the warning flag..... and this creates an even more difficult situation for central bankers who are already pushing the limits of the exhausted monetary policy debate.
"
36,HRS,"Ok...back to the charts....if you draw a trend line on the S&P - from the lows of Aug/ Sept/Oct and drag it across - you will find that Friday's action took us up and thru what should have been resistance at 1920......- but the hysteria on Friday caused the algo's to run wild breaking up and thru ending the day at 1940. This suggests a further move upwards to the 1975/2000 range is in short order if we hold. If we do not hold then a retest of 1875 would not surprise me....and if the macro data continues to weaken then a retest of the January lows of 1820 is a good bet.On the earnings front - Earnings continue to come in as expected...with 70% of the reports beating the estimate.- never mind that these estimates have all been slashed prior....and many companies have supported their earnings with healthy share buybacks. We have another big week of earnings ahead of us still and I fully expect more of the same...Trading this week will also be driven by investor and algorithmic reaction to some key U.S. economic data, especially Friday's NFP (Non Farm payroll Report) of +190k. Ahead of that report we will see reports on ISM manufacturing with two very different estimates: Markit is calling for 52.7 while the ISM is calling for 48.5 (one is expansionary while the other reflects contraction), The services component suggests expansion at 55.2. Personal income +0.2% and spending +0.1%, as well as the ADP Employment report of +190k jobs.And don't forget the Iowa Caucuses today.....Hopefully by tonight the field will be a little thinner....as those Americans do the hard work of culling the field for the rest of us......Overnight in Asia - Mkts mixed - Japan +1.98%, Hong Kong -0.45%, China - 1.78% and ASX +0.76%. In China - macro data shows continued weakness in the manufacturing sector - with PMI notching 49.4 (contractionary). But the overall impression is that this report is beginning to show some level of stabilization in China while maintaining that risks still remain. Which means what exactly? Maybe the mkt will go up or maybe it will go down?Evan Lucas - Mkt Strategist at Spreadbetter IG had this to say:""The BoJ's move is a net positive for risk, net positive for international trade and increases fund flows in Asia. All are seen as a macro positive""In Europe - Mkts are moving lower as the world continues to digest the latest BoJ move. HSBC announces 8k layoffs (plans to slash 1 out of 5 jobs), is freezing global pay for 2016 and shrinking it investment bank by 1/3rd in response to sluggish global growth and strangling regulation as they continue to cut costs to drive profitability............FTSE -0.39%, CAC 40 -0.56% , DAX - 0.51%, EURSTOXX -0.72%, SPAIN flat, and ITALY-0.37%US futures are DOWN 7 pts this morning as investors/traders settle in for another week and digest Friday's rally. Oil is a bit lower this morning - on what feels like profit taking after its surge as well. Look for the S&P to test what is now support at 1920, if it holds then we can breathe a sigh of relief - if not - strap in again.

41,HRS,"Yesterday - stocks staged a strong rally as traders and investors went 'post Christmas shopping' (when so much is on sale) .....and as investors scooped up some bargains they took the S&P right up and thru thru resistance at 2065, piercing both the 50 and 200 dma's.... clearly setting the stage for a run at 2100 + as we move into the hours leading up to the final closing bell of 2015.Gains in energy, tech, industrials and healthcare led the way higher as a clear rotation out of higher risk names into large cap, stable names suggests the 'safe haven' play......and while stocks did race higher - volumes remained quite low - and that is to be expected considering the time of year - Of particular note - Alphabet (Google Parent company) and Amazon both closed at new record highs.....As many of you know - I have been saying that I thought the mkt would end the year between the 2050/2100 range and lo and behold that is what it looks like...now do not be surprised if we get that last min push as they try to close the year out with a 2100 handle......giving us about a 4% move on the year.....(2.5% plus dividends....)Considering the year - I guess it's not so bad.....so with T- 33 hrs to go before we ring the final bell on 2015 — Let's look ahead...…What will 2016 bring for equity prices and interest rates? What will be the impact of possible multiple Fed moves in interest rates and what does that mean for investors? Recent commentary from Janet Yellen has suggested that we might see 4 more incremental rate rises of 25 bps each in 2016 — This as she tries to convince us that rising interest rates are a sure sign of the improving economy — and an improving economy is good for Americans, it is good for the job outlook, good for housing, good for wages and it is good for corporate profits, which in turn should support higher equity prices....makes perfect sense...if that were really the case......What many of us know is that our economy remains a bit weak - the job outlook is slowly improving, housing continues to be mixed - clearly strong in major cities but still weak in outlying suburbs, wages? Not where they should be, Manufacturing - clearly weak (note all the regional reports that suggest contraction) — so rising interest rates in a weak economy are potentially a big problem for the markets as higher rates increase the cost to borrow money, (raising monthly carrying charges), revolving credit will become even more expensive for consumers never mind what higher rates will do to a struggling housing market.Credit mkts -Hi- Yield - (formerly known as JUNK) are choking.....Never mind that Europe and parts of Asia are signaling recession.... But we realize that she has to try and normalize rates somewhat - so if rates rise at all in 2016 it will only happen because the FED is trying to move on after 7 years of near zero rates — it will not happen because of an strongly improving economy — so any talk of multiple rate rises has the ability to cause another year of increased volatility, apprehension and a re-pricing of equities.Now to be clear — I think we will see at most 2 hikes, but more likely just one in 2016. I do not think the job environment is what they say it is and I do not think that in a presidential election year- the Fed will move on rates after June — so that they are not accused of 'supporting any one of the parties’. Which means we have 6 months to move…. so how many rate rises could we get? So what’s ahead for 2016?First of all expectations from the FED and street economists are for the US economy to grow at about the 2% rate thru 2017… and as long as energy and other commodity prices are under pressure — then don’t expect inflation to rear her ugly head — keeping rates low, which should keep a floor under equity prices. Now at some point that will all change, energy and commodities will find a bottom and then return to higher price levels — which will then cause the conversation to return to worries about inflation - but I don’t expect that until sometime in late 2017/ early 2018. And even that is a bit optimistic — as the mkt does not believe that inflation will return to the 2% range until closer to 2020!So what does it mean for stocks? I think we could be in for a volatile 1st and 2nd Qtr......Jeremy Grantham of GMO — a Boston based asset manager or Mark Hulbert, of Marketwatch .com or Ken Moraif of Dallas based 'Money Matters’ — all want us to prepare for 'Armageddon' - as they are all suggesting that we could see a 50% retracement in the Dow and S&P….which means the Dow could trade back at 9000 while the S&P would revisit 1030. Reasons for concern? - 7 years of ultra-cheap money accompanied by massive stimulus programs enacted by every major global central bank as well as the delay in US rate normalization by the FED — all which have allowed the bubble to grow making the coming burst that much more powerful. Now while I agree that all of that is true - I do not see the Fed being irresponsible at all.....(or maybe that's just wishful thinking on my part...).On the other side of the fence we have predictions of a return to 'normal’…which would dictate about a 7% return on stocks — add in dividends and we should return about 10% - that does seem reasonable to me — since I DO believe that the global economy will improve — albeit slowly, but it will improve. I am not in the disaster camp at all. As a long term investor - it's all about the 'plan'......As usual it's time to re-visit your plan with your financial advisor and make sure that you have a broad understanding of both the negatives and positives for the year ahead.This morning US futures are down small - just 4 pts....oil is under a bit of pressure again - currently trading down $1 leaving WTI at $36.85....still above the 2008 low of $32.40 - so no reason to panic.....futures in my opinion are not reacting to oil at all.....But listen - energy is a hot button issue - is this disaster in oil prices really a gift ? Is the 62% drop in oil prices an opportunity for the long term investor? Well - that's the million dollar question...remember - psychology can change in a heartbeat.....and when it does - the sellers won't be anywhere in line as buyers trip over each other to try and buy stock...... and while some energy names have gotten absolutely slaughtered - their core businesses remain intact and at some point the market will recognize this and reward those investors that stuck with them. (Buy'em when you can, not when you have to.....)On the international front — people want to know what to do about China? Should I invest there? Or should I stay away......- What you need to know is that China is a 'developing market’ not a 'developed market' - the rules are different, the trading is different and the added risk is an unnecessary risk for the average investor.... — remember — you will get exposure to China via investments in global US and European blue chips — so you won’t be missing the boat at all. In the end - investing is dynamic not static......projections are hard to make - especially when there is so much uncertainty at home and abroad - a well thought out plan and a commitment to the long term is what will help you win in the end.Take good careKP""The market commentary is the opinion of the author and is based on decades of industry and market experience; however no guarantee is made or implied with respect to these opinions.

42,HRS,"Sales of Fitbit (FIT)activity trackers got off to a slow start over the Black Friday weekend but have picked up considerably as Christmas approaches, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson said in a report Sunday.""Checks indicate Fitbit's in-store demand came back in a big way since our Black Friday checks indicated disappointing sell-through a few weeks ago,"" Erickson said. ""We believe the company is tracking to Q4 upside with one-third of Best Buy (BBY)stores struggling to keep Charge HRs in stock.""Fitbit continues to dominate the wearable fitness tracker category and may have picked up market share this quarter, Erickson said. Other makers of wearable devices includingGarmin (GRMN) and Apple (AAPL) have discounted their devices this season, but not Fitbit, he said.""We were fairly well bombarded with emails on Cyber Monday and after from Best Buy and others noting holiday weekend discounts on wearables continuing throughout the week. Fitbit, however, was noticeably absent from this group, which we took as a good sign,"" he said.Erickson reiterated his overweight rating on Fitbit stock with a price target of 47. Fitbit stock was up nearly 3% to about 28.50 in afternoon trading on the stock market today.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy noted Monday that Fitbit products have moved up the Amazon.com (AMZN) sales ranks in recent weeks.""We remain positive on Fitbit and see strong conversion throughout the holiday season,"" Murphy said in a report. ""While pricing has been down (in the) 5-10% range over the past weeks, recall Fitbit doesn't fund discounting outside of Black Friday. More importantly, we have seen Fitbit materially rise in the rankings. The brand now makes up seven of the top 10 items in (the Amazon sports and fitness) category.""She rates Fitbit stock as overweight with a price target of 60. 
"
43,HRS,"Stocks closed mixed to lower on Friday — on what was the slowest trading day of the year…but did you really expect anything different?  With the US mkts only open for 3 ½ hrs and no real catalyst to push it higher - it would have been hard for it to do anything other than what it did.All the hype over Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, and Cyber Monday continue to cause a bit of concern as investors/traders began to wonder aloud — what it all means. Will the news on Saturday morning suggest that Black Friday was a dud?  Have all the ‘pre-Black Friday sales’ taken the luster off?  Are retailers sending the signal that they are nervous and if they are, then how will that translate to traders/investors on Monday morning? Well — in a bit of 'forewarning' consumer discretionary and retailers led the way lower on Friday.  Wal-Mart  (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), Tiffany's (TIF), GAP (GPS), JC Penny  (JCP), Macy's (M),Best Buy  (BBY) etc…..all putting in weak performances ahead of the big shopping weekend as traders placed their bets.On Saturday morning — the papers announced the news — No, not the fights to get into the stores, or the lines of people who camped out just to be first in line,  but rather :  'Black Friday — Not so Black', 'Black Friday Sales Slip from Year Prior', 'Black Friday Store Sales Fall as Americans Buy More Online' and 'Black Friday Was a Bust!' SunTrust Robinson Humphrey summed it up by saying:  ""We believe that Thanksgiving shopping was a bust""…. but is that really what happened?  Is it just that the shopping moved from physical to virtual?  Consumers no longer feeling the need to get up and go out.....but rather sit home in their 'skivvies', open up their computers and shop online...spending some $4.4 bil online over the weekend.......in fact this morning's WSJ lays it out clearly: ""Online Shopping Surges on Black Friday Weekend - online shopping, especially via mobile phones, surges, showing how buying habits have changed"" What a contrast to years past? I mean who remembers the look of terrorized sales clerks as throngs of crazed, almost hysterical,  shoppers pushed their way into the stores at midnight? So what’s the consensus? Seems to me that it was a lot of wasted time and talk about Black Friday..... and since all of these 'sales' were happening 'online' as well as in the store in the week's prior to Black Friday and will surely happen in the weeks following Black Friday — why then should anyone rush out and shop on Black Friday?  What is the advantage?  Apparently Zero! The question then becomes - What happens to the margins?  Yes - we are told that sales rose 14%  y/y but at what cost?   Will retailers crush margins in order to entice the consumer to part with their dollars?  And then what does that really mean for the investment thesis?  Is that Bullish?  What is important to remember though — is that the shopping season is not made up of any one day…..it is the culmination of shopping that takes place from early  October — right thru Christmas and then it is the shopping that takes place on Christmas day thru year end when retailers slash the prices of anything that remains to get it 'off the shelf'.  So before anyone goes and makes an investment decision based on Black Friday — remember — Black Friday was a day created by the industry to create hype and excitement — in the end — the results will be what they are…..I am just not sure it will be what the retailers want them to be - but we shall see.OK — back to the mkts…on Friday we saw China get slammed (again) — down some +5% as concern over the slide in industrial profits once again takes center stage causing some analysts to ring the alarm about a deteriorating Chinese economy.  Add in the newly announced probe into some of China's largest brokerages and you had the perfect backdrop for investors to hit the SELL button.   This morning we saw a repeat of that story.... Asian mkts continued to come under pressure overnight as this story builds....   At one point China was off another 3.5% in early trading only to recoup those losses and end the day marginally higher.  The volatility in the Chinese mkts illustrates the difficulty that Chinese officials face as they try to transform their economy and allow the mkts to price in real risk as the gov't attempts to withdraw support.    Japan -0.69%,  Hong Kong -0.33%,  China +0.26%  and ASX -0.69%.In Europe this morning we are seeing those mkts flat to slightly higher as investors there discount the negative moves out of Asia and begin the week anticipating more stimulus to be announced by the ECB on Thursday. The  Eurostoxx index - an index of 50 blue chip stocks that represent the 'super sector' leaders from 12  Eurozone countries -  is up 2% this month and it is up 17%  off  the September lows as optimism builds over the strength of the Eurozone economy as well as the potential for more Kool Aid offered up by the ECB.  ECB Pres Draghi is expected to announce even more stimulus by pushing the cost of parking money at the ECB even higher ( rates to go further into NEGATIVE territory) as he tries to force the banks to lend vs. hoard. FTSE -0.04%, CAC 40 +0.67%, DAX  +0.97%, Eurostoxx  +0.76%, Spain +0.98% and Italy +0.62%.  Now US futures have been all over the place, down nearly 9 pts in early pre-mkt trading and have now swung back to positive territory - currently up  3 pts at 2093 -  as traders/investors return from the long holiday weekend. Get ready for 'macro data overload' as US investors/traders get hit with a slew of data.In addition  we will hear from Fed Chair Yellen as she addresses the Economic Club of Washington on Wednesday and the Congressional Joint Economic Committee on Thursday -  Expect traders to listen intently to what she has to say. What does that mean for rates? By now — everyone should realize that it is NOT about the December 16/17th meeting any longer — it is now about what happens next year.Will she indicate that further rate hikes are in store in quick succession in the new year? Is she setting up to be more aggressive in the months ahead?   In addition - watch for the  'FED Bus Tour' featuring a range of FED officials as they pontificate over the state of the economy and monetary policy.Tomorrow we will get Chicago's Evans, and Fed Gov Brainard . Wednesday gives us Atlanta's Lockhart and San Fran's Williams. Thursday brings us Cleveland's Loretta Mester and Fed Vice Chair Fischer....and not to be outdone - Friday will play host to Philly's Harker, St. Louis's Bullard and Minneapolis's Kocherlatkota.Now this week brings a ton of macro data: Today brings us Chicago PMI - exp of 54, Dallas Fed Survey of -10  and Pending Home Sales  of 1%. Tomorrow we get Manf PMI of 52.6, Construction Spending of +0.6%, ISM Manf of 50.5. Wednesday - ADP Employment of +190k....But the KICKER is on Friday when we get the final NFP report before the next FED meeting — expectations are for +200k jobs to be created — which would be down significantly from last month — but strong enough for her to say:  ""And we’re OFF!""(We would have to see a number sub 100k for there to be any concern that she will go into another holding pattern - not happening....)Stay tuned - it is sure to be a week of volatility and excitement.

"
45,HRS,"Stocks should have celebrated that 'great news'.....yet - they showed a lack of direction for much of Friday as traders/investors digested the 'blow the roof off the house' monthly jobs report. The major averages spent the day bouncing back and forth across the unchanged line before closing mixed.
"
46,HRS,"U.S. employers supposedly added jobs in October at a pace unimagined while boosting wages at the fastest rate since 2009, giving the FED the all clear signal  that the economy is back and is strong enough to withstand an interest-rate increase next month.
"
47,HRS,"Nonfarm payrolls rose a seasonally adjusted 271,000 last month - beating the expectation by more than 100k jobs - causing the unemployment rate to fall  to 5%, a level Fed officials expected it to reach before the end of the yr.  [ Note that September was revised down to 135,000 and remember that last month August had been revised dramatically down as well.]  I would expect that October's numbers will also be 'revised' next month — or maybe in January, after the Fed has used these 'dramatically improved' numbers to justify  a rate hike in December.  I mean these numbers are just too good to be believed.  
"
48,HRS,"Economists and strategists are now convinced that  the likelihood of the first rate increase is now on the table - remember - 'Fed officials have said for months they would start lifting their benchmark rate, which has been near zero since late 2008, after they saw more improvement in the labor market and felt ""reasonably confident"" annual inflation would rise toward their 2% target'...Stephen Stanley - Chief Economist at Amhearst Pierpoint Securities had this to say:  ""This is the kind of employment report that even the most diehard doves on the Fed cannot ignore,""  I would say - ""That is if you believe it"".  
"
49,HRS,"What they buried deep in the report is that there are still some 8 mil people who want a job and can't find one..... and what they didn't tell you is that there are  2.2 mil LESS people in the work force vs. last year....so the drop in the unemployment rate is NOT because of some dramatic real increase in jobs as much as it is a function of less people in the workforce.  What they failed to explain is - How could the actual report be so different from Wednesday's ADP report and all the analysis by some of the street's smartest economists?   I mean not even GS had the number - I guess they didn't get the 'wink'
"
50,HRS,"Look the majority of the jobs created - as the story points out -  were in the ""domestically oriented service sectors that are largely immune to overseas turbulence, including retail, food services, health care and construction""   Retail jobs - (think - part time Holiday jobs) rose by 44k...those jobs disappear in late January after the rush of returns subsides.... and then they chimed in and told us that the retail sector wage growth rose to $14.90/hr..... that equates to $30k/ yr  - IF you work 40 hrs a week and have that job for the whole year.   (Which ain't happening...) - so why even use that stat?
"
51,HRS,"One thing is for sure - the FED needed a strong number and miraculously - they got it......and the overriding take away is that the hike is on!   And this is curious why?  Because all of the reasons for delay back in September including  - overseas economic weakness, a China implosion, weaker oil, stronger dollar - still exist....nothing has really changed other than this ONE report...... In fact - Oil has only gotten weaker the dollar has gotten stronger...... 
"
52,HRS,"In international news - Overnight - the OECD (Organization of Economic Cooperation & Development) cut global growth forecast to 2.9%  from 3% in Sept.....and down from 3.1% in June......and this morning a Bloomberg article points out that Maersk - the largest shipping company in the world suggests that   ""Global GDP is worse now than what the official forecasts show"".
"
53,HRS,"In his article - the CEO of  points out that the IMF is overly optimistic....saying that: ""We believe that global growth is slowing down, Trade is currently significantly weaker than it normally would be under the growth forecasts we see.  We conduct a string of our own macro-economic forecasts and we see less growth -- particularly in developing nations, but perhaps also in Europe -- than other people expect in 2015.""
"
54,HRS,"On Friday Maersk reported that 3Q profit fell by 61%...and trade from Asia to Europe is suffering the most.....blaming the weaker euro for exporters like China to remain competitive......So we must ask - How long before we see another China devaluation?  
"
55,HRS,"Overnight - Asian mkts were mixed....hopes for more Chinese stimulus helped China surge by 1.6%.  Look the Chinese macro data was mixed at best...Currency reserves rose for the first time in 5 months - that's good, but October exports fell by 6.9% vs. the exp of -3.2% and imports fell by 18.8% vs. exp of  -15.2%.  The data doesn’t really  change the conversation very much.....but it  does reinforce there’s still no real growth.  Japan +1.9%,  Hong Kong -0.6% and ASX -1.8%

If that is the case - then strap in - because the mkts will swiftly re-price asset values across the spectrum.  Why?  Because Janet has made it very clear that the pace and timing of any future rates increases will be measured and thoughtful......not swift and erratic....so stocks will get hit, housing prices will fall, emerging mkts will get clobbered - but hey - it has to happen at some point....and it should have happened months ago......

The major averages spent the day bouncing back and forth across the unchanged line before closing mixed.U.S. employers supposedly added jobs in October at a pace unimagined while boosting wages at the fastest rate since 2009, giving the FED the all clear signal  that the economy is back and is strong enough to withstand an interest-rate increase next month.Nonfarm payrolls rose a seasonally adjusted 271,000 last month - beating the expectation by more than 100k jobs - causing the unemployment rate to fall  to 5%, a level Fed officials expected it to reach before the end of the yr.  [ Note that September was revised down to 135,000 and remember that last month August had been revised dramatically down as well.]  I would expect that October's numbers will also be 'revised' next month — or maybe in January, after the Fed has used these 'dramatically improved' numbers to justify  a rate hike in December.  I mean these numbers are just too good to be believed.  Economists and strategists are now convinced that  the likelihood of the first rate increase is now on the table - remember - 'Fed officials have said for months they would start lifting their benchmark rate, which has been near zero since late 2008, after they saw more improvement in the labor market and felt ""reasonably confident"" annual inflation would rise toward their 2% target'...Stephen Stanley - Chief Economist at Amhearst Pierpoint Securities had this to say:  ""This is the kind of employment report that even the most diehard doves on the Fed cannot ignore,""  I would say - ""That is if you believe it"".  What they buried deep in the report is that there are still some 8 mil people who want a job and can't find one..... and what they didn't tell you is that there are  2.2 mil LESS people in the work force vs. last year....so the drop in the unemployment rate is NOT because of some dramatic real increase in jobs as much as it is a function of less people in the workforce.  What they failed to explain is - How could the actual report be so different from Wednesday's ADP report and all the analysis by some of the street's smartest economists?   I mean not even GS had the number - I guess they didn't get the 'wink'Look the majority of the jobs created - as the story points out -  were in the ""domestically oriented service sectors that are largely immune to overseas turbulence, including retail, food services, health care and construction""   Retail jobs - (think - part time Holiday jobs) rose by 44k...those jobs disappear in late January after the rush of returns subsides.... and then they chimed in and told us that the retail sector wage growth rose to $14.90/hr..... that equates to $30k/ yr  - IF you work 40 hrs a week and have that job for the whole year.   (Which ain't happening...) - so why even use that stat?One thing is for sure - the FED needed a strong number and miraculously - they got it......and the overriding take away is that the hike is on!   And this is curious why?  Because all of the reasons for delay back in September including  - overseas economic weakness, a China implosion, weaker oil, stronger dollar - still exist....nothing has really changed other than this ONE report...... In fact - Oil has only gotten weaker the dollar has gotten stronger...... In international news - Overnight - the OECD (Organization of Economic Cooperation & Development) cut global growth forecast to 2.9%  from 3% in Sept.....and down from 3.1% in June......and this morning a Bloomberg article points out that Maersk - the largest shipping company in the world suggests that   ""Global GDP is worse now than what the official forecasts show"".In his article - the CEO of  points out that the IMF is overly optimistic....saying that: ""We believe that global growth is slowing down, Trade is currently significantly weaker than it normally would be under the growth forecasts we see.  We conduct a string of our own macro-economic forecasts and we see less growth -- particularly in developing nations, but perhaps also in Europe -- than other people expect in 2015.""On Friday Maersk reported that 3Q profit fell by 61%...and trade from Asia to Europe is suffering the most.....blaming the weaker euro for exporters like China to remain competitive......So we must ask - How long before we see another China devaluation?  Overnight - Asian mkts were mixed....hopes for more Chinese stimulus helped China surge by 1.6%.  Look the Chinese macro data was mixed at best...Currency reserves rose for the first time in 5 months - that's good, but October exports fell by 6.9% vs. the exp of -3.2% and imports fell by 18.8% vs. exp of  -15.2%.  The data doesn’t really  change the conversation very much.....but it  does reinforce there’s still no real growth.  Japan +1.9%,  Hong Kong -0.6% and ASX -1.8%In Europe - mkts there are all lower.....German export data did beat the expectation - but that did nothing to ignite investor confidence today as the focus was on weaker China data and the stronger US jobs number - suggesting a rate hike.

"
60,HRS,"So there were a number of surprises last week......First the ECB leaves rates alone but hints at more stimulus coming in December. Then overnight on Thurs/Friday - China announces further loosening in monetary policy in another bid to boost a slowing economy. And then after the bell on Thursday the 3 big tech stalwarts surprised the markets with much better…
"
61,HRS,"If Rod Stewart was able to say something to Janet Yellen - would it go something like this: ""Have I told you lately that I love you?, Have I told you there's no one else above you? You fill my heart with gladness, take away ALL my sadness, Ease my troubles that's what you do.....You fill my heart with laughter,…
"
62,HRS,"History has a way of repeating itself....How many times do we need to hear this phrase? The phrase refers to the fact that we are creatures of habit and in short - events that have happened in past are bound to repeat themselves - because in the end - do we ever really learn? Think 1929, 1987, 1999, 2007-20012, and now 2015.....What do these years have in common? Stock mkt CRASHES - and if you look at each one - the common theme that runs through all of them is eerily similar.
"
63,HRS,"No matter what - the stock mkt crashes were (are) the result of a variety of economic factors (domestic & international)/structural (monetary and fiscal policy) and technological imbalances coupled with raging speculation, and new and exciting ""derivative products"" that promised to save everyone....How's that working for you?
"
64,HRS,"Recall the ""roaring Twenties"" (that is the 1920's) it was a time of wealth and excess.....Easy credit, high levels of debt, slowing economy and other signs of economic fissures, speculation and high margin debt all contributing factors to the crash of '29.
"
65,HRS,"In 1987 - after the roaring bull mkt that began in the summer of '82 - the mkt crashed - falling 22.5% in 6 hrs.....losing over $500 bil in one day..... The move higher was fueled by falling interest rates, hostile takeovers, leveraged buyouts and a surge in junk bonds. (Junk bonds, now known as 'High Yield' are bonds that pay high interest rates due to their HIGH RISK - you see - it is the risk/reward argument)....
"
66,HRS,"Portfolio Insurance (that first iteration of the coming derivative boom) that only accelerated the decline.....You see - in addition to the economic issues and structural imbalances created as a result - Portfolio Insurance was the new 'savior'. Global asset managers all bought into it - using this 'new brain child' as a way to protect against losses....(Portfolio insurance is a hedging strategy that uses stock index futures to cushion equity portfolios against broad stock market declines). As interest rates rose, many institutional money managers tried using this insurance to hedge their portfolios at the same time. As we moved through the week of Oct 14th, 1987 - the mkt got weaker and came under pressure closing on the lows on Friday Oct 16th in what was an unusually heavy volume day. On October 19th 1987, this portfolio insurance product issued a sell signal and any institution that had bought it was told to sell X% of their portfolio in order to protect it.....
"
67,HRS,"The signal was issued on Sunday night - just as Asian mkts were opening...and the bloodbath began....selling beget more selling and the bottom fell out of global mkts....stock index futures mkts was flooded with billions of dollars worth of sell orders and within minutes, both the futures and stock markets began to crash and as the sun set on Asia it rose in Europe and the process continued, the bloodletting unstoppable.....and then the sun rose over the Atlantic to warm the shores of the US and the perfect storm blew the windows out......by 4 pm global mkts had suffered inconceivable losses.....as analysts/strategists and everyone else tried to put it in perspective.....The FED came to the rescue and intervened trying to prevent a repeat performance. Remarkably - the mkt recovered fairly quickly and moved higher until the fall of 1999 and the Dot Com Crash.
"
68,HRS,"E-commerce and Dot Com - that was the new gold rush...any company that had either in its name helped to created another historic bubble...the Internet - was going to be the game changer. You see - the period from like 1993 - 2000 was marked by the explosion of the Internet and the founding and spectacular failures of these new companies - Investment banks hungry for product brought these companies public - selling the story of how the world was different now. Companies with zero history, revenues or any chance of ever making any revenues were brought to the mkt - investors could not get enough - IPO's and pricing boggled the mind - opening trades left you speechless and technology allowed anyone with a computer to play. Speculation and the herd mentality once again took hold. People margined their houses and their first-borns....a new type of investing was born - what came to be known as 'prefix investing' - And then it happened.....the Nasdaq peaked at 5132 on March 10, 200 only to find its low months later after losing better than 50%.
"
69,HRS,"Then came the housing boom - fueled in part by failed fiscal policies initiated under Pres Clinton and Fed Chairman Greenspan.....No income verifications loans, teaser rates, interest only loans anything to get 'every American' into a home of their own....investment banks packaged these 'loans' and securitized them and sold them to global investors as the new product! Ratings agencies marked them all AAA+++ rated....never really knowing what was in them. The gov't encouraged Wall St to play nice and help make these products successful. The global economy was humming along, global investors pumping all kinds of money into these products.....then new derivative products came to the mkts.....CDS's ABS' etc....it all worked until it didn't. The problem was that no one on Wall St - ran a model that provided for a global slowdown - no one knew what would happen if the music stopped...and the music stopped in March of 2008....and the world collapsed - everyone pointed the finger at someone else - proclaiming that it was 'not our fault'...it was lack of regulation or lack of insight, or just plain greed.
"
70,HRS,"The FED and every other central bank came to the rescue - artificially stimulating mkts.....many screamed about this intervention - but at the time it was the right thing to do, but then, as usual, it went on to long. Along the way - the mkts recovered, people started to feel good again....new products were designed - ETF's (exchange traded funds) gave the investor the sense that we somehow found the holy grail. You could now invest in one product and get instant access to a range of investment options....Sectors, developed countries, emerging countries, frontier countries, bonds, high yield, low yield, average yield...... different strategies, (long, short, super long and super short - leveraged products) built using 'synthetic equity'...... (a financial instrument that is artificially created) promising to offer all of the benefits of stocks (or bonds) while not being stocks (or bonds). Trade them easily...get in and get out with one product.....sounds too good to be true - right?
"
71,HRS,"Well it is....because when the global economy begins to convulse you can't really trade this crap as easily as you were told. And when panic ensues - and those mkts freeze - what happens - asset managers end up selling what they can vs. what they should....and this causes stocks to crash...because - the US capital mkts are the most liquid and deepest and when push comes to shove - you can always raise money in the developed global mkts.
"
72,HRS,"And today - what do we have - completely manipulated mkts - fueled by central banks around the world as elected officials shirked their responsibilities and failed to enact fiscal policy stimulus....policies that would have gone much farther in helping to solve so many issues. But that was not to happen....and today we find ourselves in another mess.....Global mkts coming unglued, monetary policies failing to make a difference after trillions of dollars and years of artificial stimulation. In fact - this global meltdown is NOT about the FED and a 25 bps hike in US rates at all. It is a realization that there has been a massive failure of leadership, a massive failure of real fiscal policy initiatives.... Couple that with unreal expectations of major global trading partners and you have a real mess.
"
73,HRS,"Overnight - Asian mkts led the crash - as they did in 1987....China losing 8.5% other Asian mkts following in kind Hong Kong -5.1%, ASX -4%, Japan -4.6%.... The reason...... a complete lack of any commentary or real economic data supporting any kind of growth from Chinese authorities, which is only re-enforcing the idea they ARE NOT in control. .As the Sun rises over Europe those mkts getting drawn in - (recall 1987)....FTSE -3%, DAX -3.29%, CAC 40 - 3.4%, SPAIN -3.25%, EUROSTOXX - 3.2%.....as the blood bath continues.....
"
74,HRS,"And now the sun is again washing the shores of America....US futures are showing down 47 pts...or 2.3%....as the day begins.....there is no rhyme or reason - no explanation for what will happen today....You can feel the 'panic mentality"" in the air....This just has to play out for now.....no commentary from Janet or anyone else will stop this train today.....the mood is set and the action will happen as investors try to make sense out of this mess. We have broken so many tech levels....there has been a lot of damage done to global mkts.....many will speculate on levels that should hold and support - but like a massive hurricane - we won't know the extent of the damage until global mkts can calm down. For now - strap in.

88,HRS,"TiVo (TIVO) stock rose nearly 6% Wednesday after the company late Tuesday reported fiscal Q4 EPS and revenue above views, as the DVR pioneer expands beyond patent licensing to new subscription-based TV service.TiVo rose as much as 5.9% in early trading but was up nearly 3%, near 11.50, in late-morning trading in the stock market today.TiVo acquired the trademark and mailing list of bankrupt Aereo in an auction last week. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2014 ruled that Aereo's TV-over-Internet service violated TV broadcasters' copyrights. TiVo in August rolled out a legal DVR for over-the-air (OTA) television broadcasts. The DVR requires users to own an in-home digital HD antenna.TiVo executives were upbeat on the prospects for OTA devices on the company earnings call. TiVo last week signed a deal to supply a set-top box with combined broadband-OTA capabilities to rural telecom service provider Frontier Communications (FTR). The set-top box is intended for cord cutters — consumers with high-speed Internet service who substitute online video for traditional pay TV.For its fiscal Q4 ended Jan. 31, TiVo said it earned 7 cents per share, up from a penny profit in the year-earlier period. Service and technology revenue rose 9% to $91.7 million. Analysts had modeled EPS of 4 cents on revenue of $89 million. The company forecast fiscal Q1 service and technology revenue of $91 million at the midpoint of its range, in line with consensus estimates.""It was another strong quarter for TiVo, with continued strength coming from the (cable TV) business, where management sees significant upside to current penetration levels across its North American deployments,"" said Brian Fitzgerald, a Jefferies analyst, in a research report.In fiscal 2015, TiVo repurchased $346 million of its stock, reducing basic shares outstanding by about 20%.IBD's Telecom-Cable/Satellite Equipment group ranks just No. 123 out of 197 industry groups. It includes Arris Group (ARRS) and Harris (HRS).

113,HRS,"Stocks in the telecommunication space had a dismal run in 2017. Intensifying competition in the wireless market and competitive threat from online streaming service providers acted as potential headwinds. The wireless market is almost saturated and spectrum crunch has become a major issue for the telcos.Further, entry of cable MSOs (multi service operators) like Comcast and Charter Communications has made it all the more difficult. Moreover, high costs, regulatory hurdles and union issues are other headwinds.Keeping aside all the adversities, telcos have bounced back with stellar fourth-quarter 2017 performances. Notably, all the major national wireless carriers have reported a massive gain of postpaid subscribers in the quarter. Despite cut-throat pricing competition in the industry resulting in unlimited data plans with several sweeteners, postpaid customer gain is a major positive. We believe this trend is likely to continue in 2018.Moreover, the rising demand for technologically superior products has always been a silver lining for the telecommunication companies. Comprehensive tax cuts, impeding launch of the upcoming next-generation 5G wireless network, product differentiation and offering of bundled service-packages are the major catalysts that bode well for this space.Given this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two major players in the telecommunication industry — Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) and AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) based on certain parameters. Both fall under the broader Computer and Technology sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). At present, Verizon has a market capitalization of $213.52 billion, while that of AT&T stands at $231.69 billion.Zacks Rank & Style ScoreCurrently, both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, with an attractive VGM Score of B, AT&T enjoys an edge over Verizon, which has a VGM Score of C. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Price PerformanceIn the past four months, shares of AT&T have returned 4.9%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 1.5%. The stock has performed better than Verizon, which has returned 3.2% in the said time frame. Valuation We have tried to evaluate AT&T and Verizon in terms of terms of three metrics. Let’s take a look at them.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E - TTM) multiple for AT&T and Verizon are 11.9 and 12.7, respectively, while the industry’s is 14.3. The trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B) multiple for AT&T is 1.6, compared with 4.4 for Verizon. The industry’s P/B is 1.8. Finally, the trailing 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) multiples for AT&T and Verizon are 1.4 and 1.5, respectively, compared with the industry’s 1.3. Based on the above metrics, we find AT&T to be comparatively cheaper than Verizon.ROE and ROCReturn on Capital (ROC) for Verizon and AT&T is 10.5% and 7.2%, respectively. While both the stocks have scored above the industry level of 7%, Verizon enjoys an edge over AT&T in this respect. Return on Equity (ROE) is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. ROE for the trailing 12 months looks impressive for Verizon in comparison to AT&T. The current ROE for Verizon is 49% while that for AT&T is 14.5% compared with the industry’s ROE of 17%.  Dividend YieldVerizon’s dividend yield over past year has been 4.95%, higher than the industry’s figure of 4.65%. With a dividend yield of 5.50%, AT&T shareholders earn significantly higher dividend yield than Verizon as well as the industry. Earnings Surprise History and ESPIn terms of earnings history, Verizon’s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, resulting in an average miss of 1.3%. However, AT&T has delivered positive surprise in two of the prior four quarters with an average beat of 6.4%.The situation remains same when considering Earnings ESP values for the current quarter. While Verizon’s Earnings ESP is -0.15%, AT&T’s stands at +1.86%.Earnings Estimate RevisionsBased on current-quarter earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days, AT&T appears to be more favorably placed. Though estimates for both Verizon and AT&T rose over the said time frame, AT&T   has an edge over Verizon.For Verizon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 earnings increased 0.9% to $1.12 per share. The same for AT&T increased 1.2% to 87 cents per share.  For full-year 2018, estimates have been stagnant at $4.52 for Verizon while the same has gone up 1.8% to $3.48 for AT&T.Sales Estimates We expect first-quarter 2018 revenue growth of 4.7% for Verizon, which is significantly higher than 0.2% for AT&T.The picture is quite similar for full-year 2018. We project 1.9% revenue growth for Verizon, better than AT&T’s loss of 0.1%.Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that AT&T scores over Verizon in terms of valuation, style score, price performance, dividend yield, earnings history, Earnings ESP and earnings estimate trends. Verizon enjoys an advantage only in terms of return on capital and equity and sales estimate trends.Both the companies are two of the nation’s major wireless carriers. They look strong on the back of their wireless opportunities in the industry – which is in a state of transition to the next-generation 5G network.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Computer and Technology sectorinclude United States Cellular (USM  -  Free Report), Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report) and Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report). While United States Cellular sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Harris and Intel carry a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).The projected earnings growth rate (3-5 years) for United States Cellular, Harris and Intel are 1%, 6% and 8.4%, respectively.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

114,HRS,"President Donald Trump is likely to impose tariffs on China by this weekend. Information technology, telecommunications and consumer electronics are the major Chinese industries that are expected to bear the brunt of U.S. tariffs.Notably, the implementation of these tariffs stems from the Trump administration’s concern that manufacturing by Chinese companies for these sectors is leaving the intellectual property of the American companies vulnerable to theft.Consequently, U.S. companies that rely on Chinese imports are unhappy about the move as it will raise prices of telecom equipment and several electronics products for the IT sector. However, a hike in product prices will certainly help U.S. wireless equipment manufacturers.Further, this move highlights the Trump administration’s aggressive efforts to safeguard next-generation innovative products of these blue-collar industries of the country. That is why investment in some of these stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should prove to be lucrative.National Security Concerns Dominate Telecom Space Trump administration is deeply concerned about China’s drive to unseat United States as the primary developer and supplier of state-of-the-art products in the fields of high-tech artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum computing and various other digital technology driven sectors.Notably, most of the big manufacturers of these products are fully patronized by the Chinese government. These companies have become serious threat to the U.S. economic and military supremacy.  China runs a massive $375 billion trade surplus against United States.On Mar 12, Trump ordered to immediately prohibit the proposed $117 billion takeover bid of Singapore-based Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) for Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), U.S. chipset giant and a global leader for setting wireless standards.The government argued that third party entities, especially, the Chinese tech giants like Huawei and ZTE may get access to Qualcomm’s precious patents from Broadcom or at least a stalled R&D activity may result in Qualcomm losing its competitive edge in the upcoming 5G wireless network standard to its Chinese counterparts. (Read More: Is the Broadcom-Qualcomm Deal in Jeopardy? Winners & Losers)In recent months, the U.S. Treasury's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has blocked takeover deals of U.S. companies MoneyGram International Inc. (MGI  -  Free Report) and Lattice Semiconductor Corp. (LSCC  -  Free Report) by Chinese counterparts. In fact, in January 2018, the security officials of Trump administration contemplated the prospect of the government building its own 5G network to combat China’s economic and cyber threat.Strong Domestic Wireless Infrastructure MarketA growing U.S. economy speeds up the demand for real-time voice, data, and video manifold. The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans. This in turn has provided a boost to the demand for telecom infrastructure developers, particularly wireless gear manufacturers.On Dec 21, SNS Research reported that the wireless network infrastructure industry is expected to grow at a rate of 2% over the next three years. Per projections, the market will witness an annual spending of $56 billion by 2020, up from $53 billion in 2017. Per the report, the next-generation 5G wireless network is anticipated to account for more than 40% of wireless infrastructure spending by the end of 2025.Our PicksTrump has given enough indication that his administration will take special interest in the functioning of the telecom industry. The safeguarding of the highly valuable patents of the American tech heavy companies from the Chinese dragon is of foremost importance to the American eagle.At this stage, investors will be better off to investing in U.S. wireless equipment manufacturing companies, which are expected to benefit the most from upcoming U.S. tariffs on China. At this stage, we have narrowed down our search to the following stocks with favourable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) with strong growth potential.Chart below shows the performance our five picks in the last three months. NETGEAR Inc.

115,HRS,"Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) recently partnered Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) to simplify its network and enhance user experience with improved mobility, storage and security. The two companies have successfully conducted test of Cisco’s hybrid open-source Information-Centric Networking (ICN) software at a Verizon lab located in Waltham, MA.The ICN technology simplifies network by using “named data” instead of location identifiers such as IP addresses. The trial showcased how ICN technology marks an improvement over traditional Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) networking. ICN offers dynamic adaptive streaming solutions and dynamic load balancing of video media. This is expected to enhance the viewing experience and reduce bandwidth requirements by reducing the distance traveled by the content.The technology uses a content-specific naming method instead of an IP address. This allows more efficient delivery of streaming content to a mobile network irrespective of the user’s location. A user may move between different cell sites or different network access methods like 5G or WiFi. Verizon also showed how ICN technology can be inserted into existing IP infrastructure, thus enabling coexistence with legacy IP traffic.The benefits of a virtualized Hybrid-ICN network implies how technology can simplify the way users access content in a mobile environment. The trial mostly focused on management of streaming video content. We remind investors that online video streaming has gained an advantage over pay-TV operators in the industry because of their cheap source of TV programming. Thus, operators are either launching Internet-TV services or inking deals with online video streaming service providers such as Netflix, Hulu.com and to retain customers.Hybrid networking seems to be gaining popularity. Verizon’s rival, AT&T also offers hybrid networking options through its AT&T SD-WAN to help businesses simplify their network management and reduce costs.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderVerizon is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

"
120,HRS,"ViaSat Inc.  reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted loss of 4 cents per share, down drastically from earnings of 29 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter. With only a marginal gain in quarterly revenues, ViaSat’s earnings plummeted as the company ramped up expenses ahead of offering subscribers service with its new high-speed satellite.Further, the company recorded an additional income-tax expense of approximately $12 million in relation to the recent tax reforms.On a GAAP basis, the company swung to a net loss of 42 cents per share, in stark contrast to earnings of 8 cents recorded in the year-ago period.Inside the HeadlinesThe company posted revenues of $381.8 million in the fiscal third quarter, which marginally lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $388.6 million. Revenues inched up 0.3% compared to the prior-year quarter tally. Strong growth in government business drove top-line performance, which was offset by contraction in Satellite Services revenues. Revenue growth was strained owing to the capacity constraints that the company is facing ahead of the ViaSat-2 commercial service launch.New contract awards (up 23.2% to $436 million) rose sharply in the quarter.Segment wise, Satellite Services revenues continued the downward trend and slipped sharply (down 9.7% year over year) to $144.5 million, due to a modest downtick in residential subscriber count. The decline was also attributable to the prior-year benefit of $6.8 million connected to proceeds under the Loral settlement. Notably, Average Revenue per User (ARPU) in ViaSat's residential broadband Internet business grew 8% year over yearto a new record high of $68.23.Commercial Networks’ performance turned around this quarter, as its revenues inched up 1.9% on a year-over-year basis to $55.5 million, driven byhigher airborne terminal sales.On the other hand, Government Systems continued the impressive growth trajectory and reported solid revenues of $181.8 million, up 9.5% year over year, driven by growth across the broad product service portfolio. Impressive growth in revenues drove solid operating profit (up 23% year over year) and Adjusted EBITDA (up 19.7% year over year) for the reported quarter.During the quarter, sales backlog grew 6.3% year over year to $1,128.7 million, led by record contribution from the Government Systems segment.Adjusted EBITDA plunged 33% from the comparable quarter last year to $56.2 million, hurt by elevated start-up costs associated with the ViaSat-2 service launch, higher R&D outlay and costs related to planned large-scale service ramp-up in commercial air. Also, completion of the Loral settlement affected the company’s EBITDA. Nevertheless, sequentially, R&D levels declined $6 million, as ViaSat begins transitioning to the ViaSat-3 payload construction phase.ViaSat, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise ViaSat, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ViaSat, Inc. QuoteOther HighlightsThe company’s ViaSat-2 satellite is ready for service and will likely be launched next week, with national coverage scheduled for February end. ViaSat-2, touted to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage, is a massive improvement over ViaSat-1. Some other features which make it more powerful than ViaSat-1 include high-capacity connectivity, smaller gateway antenna and twice as many gateways. ViaSat believes these advanced smaller gateways can help it place the latest satellites in proximity of popular Internet access points, delivering greater network reliability and security.Further, the ViaSat-3 payload program has begun its transition to the construction phase.Concurrent with the earnings release, the company announced signing a new direct contract with the United Airlines for more than 70 additional aircraft, including the new 737MAX fleet.In the fiscal third quarter, ViaSat entered production service with Qantas in Australia using its second-generation platform. The company inked contracts for 92 additional aircrafts from existing airline customers during the quarter, bringing its tally for total in-service and under contract airplanes to nearly 1,600.LiquidityViaSat exited the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $161.8 million compared with $130.1 million as of Mar 31, 2017. The company also generated strong operating cash flow in the fiscal year to date, which hit $283 million, despite the ramp-up of expenses and capacity constraints.To ConcludeThe company is about to roll out ViaSat-2 commercial services and is also beginning to transition to lower payload R&D expenses on the ViaSat-3 program. Both these factors will support profitability and capital-flow improvement.ViaSat-2 projects segment revenues to resume growth this year, even as ramp-up expenses beginning to moderate as a percentage of sales. Nonetheless, the company predicts much heavier advertising activity over the next several quarters, which will again raise costs and hurt margins. Further, the fiscal fourth quarter is expected to see higher commission expenses related to increased subscriber additions.Strong backlog levels, robust prospects of core government business and significant demand for higher speeds of broadband connectivity in residential, in-flight, and government markets are likely to accelerate the company’s growth momentum in the near term.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderWe have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on ViaSat currently.

121,HRS,"AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) is reportedly planning  to deploy Open Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop Multiplexer (ROADM) and optical SDN initiatives to its live network. The deployment will be done using multiple vendors and an optical SDN controller integrated into AT&T’s Enhanced Control, Orchestration, Management and Policy (ECOMP) virtualization platform, the first of which will be done in Dallas.The ROADM technology helps to automatically manage and adjust optical bandwidth on high capacity fiber optic lines. AT&T already uses ROADMs and SDN controller for its internal management purposes. Now, the telco is gearing up to apply the same to its live network, enabling its customers to detect and modify bandwidth automatically, depending on the network congestion in different locations. As of now, it will be extended across limited coverage of AT&T’s network.  Eventually, it will be standardized for use within and between metro areas.The Open ROADM concept was taken up by AT&T at the Optical Fiber Conference (OFC) held in March 2016. Therein, AT&T collaborated with Ciena, Fujitsu and Nokia to create a Multi-Source Agreement (MSA) for Open ROADMs. At present, the Open ROADM MSA is a 15-member association of operators and equipment developers. The team is currently working on third generation features, including higher rate wavelengths.Besides AT&T, Ciena, Fujitsu and Alcatel-Lucent USA (now a subsidiary of Nokia), other members of the association include SK Telecom, Orange S.A., Rostelecom, Cisco, Saudi Telecom Company, Coriant, Telecom Italia, Juniper Networks, Deutsche Telekom AG, Infinera Corporation and KDDI.We expect investor focus to remain on the outcome of the reported deployment, which should enhance the telco’s optical network operations. We further appreciate the fact that AT&T is turning its software-centric attention to its optical networks with such initiatives.We also look forward to seeing how far AT&T succeeds in simplifying optical network operations by deploying Open ROADM and optical SDN initiatives.AT&T Inc.

125,HRS,"Per a FierceWireless report, the United States’ government — through its Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) — has finally intervened into Broadcom’s (AVGO  -  Free Report) proposed $117 billion hostile takeover offer of Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report). CFIUS is an inter-agency committee of the U.S. government that reviews the national security implications of foreign investments in U.S. companies or operations.Per a recent CFIUS order, Qualcomm has postponed its 2018 annual shareholders’ meeting from Mar 6 to Apr 5. The delayed meeting gives each side a chance to present its case to Qualcomm shareholders. Meanwhile, CFIUS will also investigate and review the proposed takeover deal by Broadcom.The government has raised concerns that the proposed takeover is likely to raise national security issues and potentially affect the United States’ role in the development of 5G wireless network technology, as China is forging ahead to take a lead in the space.Broadcom’s Efforts and Threats from ChinaBroadcom has been trying for the past three-four months to takeover Qualcomm with its multiple bids. On Nov 6, 2017, Broadcom initially offered $70 per share, of which $60 was to be paid in cash and the rest in shares. The revised offer, which is Broadcom’s ""best and final offer,"" values each share at $82 ($60 a share in cash and the rest in shares).However, Broadcom’s attempts to acquire Qualcomm for creating a wireless powerhouse was thwarted again when its revised bid was rejected unanimously by Qualcomm’s board of directors, on grounds of inadequacy and potential antitrust hurdles.Since this is an unsolicited, hostile bid to take control of the company, Broadcom is also looking to replace the entire Qualcomm board with 11 people of its own choosing.Moreover, if Broadcom is successful in acquiring Qualcomm, it is expected to break up Qualcomm and sell the pieces to a Chinese firm. Thus, national wireless carriers would be left with no choice other than buying Chinese equipment.This could potentially affect the U.S. position in the emerging market for 5G services, thus paving the way for Chinese companies to gain an upper hand in the sector. The U.S. market will be left with only some of the small existing number of equipment suppliers.Consequently, if Broadcom succeeds in the takeover, it might be a major loss to the nation. On the other hand, Broadcom’s successful takeover of Qualcomm might also be the biggest tech deal. The proposed combination of Broadcom and Qualcomm may create the world's third-largest semiconductor company, lagging Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) and Samsung.The semiconductor industry is locked up in a race of mergers and acquisitions. We currently await updates on this front as to which side the CFIUS decision turns up.Price PerformanceIn the past six months, Qualcomm performed pretty well.

126,HRS,"Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) has partnered with Dialog Axiata PLC — Sri Lanka's largest telecommunications services provider — to launch the first commercial Massive IoT network in Southeast Asia that supports both Cat-M1 (Category M1) and NB-IoT (Narrow Band IoT) technologies.Ericsson is offering Cat-M1 (LTE-M) and NB-IoT support as a software activation to Dialog Axiata's existing LTE Radio Access Network.The advanced mobile network technology, which will be deployed across Dialog Axiata’s Sri Lankan network, will accelerate the proliferation of IoT devices. Further, features like long battery life, superior coverage and cost-effective enterprise solutions will help develop the country’s IoT ecosystem.Cat M1 and NB-IoT technologies are becoming increasingly popular, owing to the fact that these optimize devices to send data while utilizing battery life to the maximum. Ericsson's Massive IoT solutions for Cat-M1 and NB-IoT devices offer immense advantages such as low cost, massive connections, deep coverage, low power consumption as well as more secure and reliable transmission.The technologies are driving the IoT revolution on the technical side of things, which is not surprising considering the advantages they offer. The Cat-M1/NB-IoT network will multiply opportunities for solutions like Smart Metering for utilities, Smart Parking, smart environmental sensors for smart cities, logistic solutions and other applications in agriculture and farming.In spite of solid offerings, Ericsson is witnessing negative industry trends and adverse business mix in mobile broadband. Particularly, uncertainty in the financial markets, reduced consumer telecom spending and delayed auctions of spectrums pose significant threats for Ericsson. Operators have been cautious in making new investments, especially in the emerging markets, which has affected the company’s revenues and profits. Further, Europe and Latin America — the markets with the biggest impact — are expected to have an increasingly challenging investment environment.Ericsson Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ericsson Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ericsson QuoteAs far as earnings performance is concerned, Ericsson has had a dismal earnings surprise history over the trailing four quarters, missing estimates terribly all through. The company has lagged estimates by a whopping 552.5% on an average.Ericsson’s earnings estimates have moved south in the past couple of months, indicating bearish analyst sentiment for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has been revised downward from 17 cents to 3 cents over the past 60 days, driven by three downward estimate revisions versus just one upward.Over the past year, the company’s shares have returned 2.1%, significantly underperforming the industry's gain of 16.7%.Nevertheless, Ericsson expects to stabilize its operations amid a difficult market in 2018. Ekholm’s restructuring plan will help streamline the company’s focus areas, improve profitability and revitalize its technology and market leadership.Whether these steps will allow Ericsson to get back on the growth track, remains to be seen.

(MSI  -  Free Report) have gained 31.8% in a year’s time, outperforming the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry’s rally of 13.5%.Let’s take a look into the factors responsible for the impressive price performance and see if the company can add new feathers to its cap.Last month, Motorola reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017. The metrics also increased on a year-over-year basis. Results were driven by the strong performance of its land and mobile radio operations.In fact, the company's growth-by-acquisition strategy, which has broadened its product portfolio is encouraging. In sync with this objective, Motorola entered into an agreement with Avigilon to acquire the latter in an all-cash transaction. Per the agreement, Motorola will purchase all of Avigilon’s outstanding shares for CAD $27 per share.Motorola’s efforts to reward its investors through dividend payments and buybacks are also impressive. Evidently, the company bought back shares worth $125 million and paid $76 million in dividends in the fourth quarter of 2017.Moving ahead, we expect the company to perform well backed by its robust product portfolio and growth-oriented strategies. For example, the Avigilon buyout is expected to widen Motorola’s mission-critical communications technologies portfolio.Furthermore, Motorola’s robust projections for first-quarter and full-year 2018 reflects a healthy picture. While revenues are anticipated to grow approximately 7%, adjusted earnings per share are projected between 83 cents and 88 cents in the first quarter of 2018. For 2018, the company expects the top line to improve roughly 5% while the bottom line is envisioned in the $6.50-$6.65 range.The new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), which reduces corporate tax rate significantly, is also a positive for the company. For 2018, effective tax rate is expected to come down to around 25% from 32.8% and 31% in fourth-quarter and full-year 2017, respectively.Estimate Revisions & Style Score Upward estimate revisions reflect optimism in a stock’s prospects. Motorola scores impressively on this front too. In fact, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings being revised 14.7% and 15.2% upward, respectively, in the last 60 days.Additionally, the stock has a  VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Computer and Technology sector may also consider Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report).

128,HRS,"Ubiquiti Networks, Inc.’s (UBNT  -  Free Report) second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings fell short of estimates, putting an end to the three-quarter earnings beat streak. The company’s adjusted earnings came in at 76 cents, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents by 6.2%. Shares fell about 14.1% in the trading session following the results, indicating that investors were disappointed with the earnings miss.However, the figure was up 5.6% compared with year-ago quarterly figure of 72 cents. The year-over-year improvement can primarily be attributable to impressive top-line growth during the quarter. Inside the HeadlinesUbiquiti reported record revenues of $250.8 million, which crossed the higher end of the company’s projected range of $240-$250 million. Further, it grew 17.2% on a year-over-year basis, and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $220 million comfortably. Steady demand in all product lines across end markets proved conducive to top-line growth.Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. QuoteThe company’s Enterprise Technology segment continued to fare remarkably well, with revenues surging a whopping 33.7% year over year to $131 million. Continued adoption of the company’s UniFi AC technology platform fueled striking growth.The Service Provider Technology segment also achieved growth of 3.7% year over year, generating $119.9 million.In terms of geography, revenues in Asia Pacific remained steady, rising 48.6% year over year. EMEA regions (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) and South America increased 31.8% and 7.6% respectively, from the comparable period last year. North America also witnessed a growth on a year-over-year basis, with revenues growing 0.4% during the fiscal second quarter.GAAP gross margin for the quarter was down year over year to 38.6%.Significant DevelopmentsDuring the reported quarter, Ubiquiti initiated a new stock repurchase program. The stock repurchase program authorizes the company to repurchase up to $150 million of its common stock. Moreover, the company entered into a new credit facility, providing for a $400 million revolving credit facility as well as a $500 million term loan.Further, during the reported quarter, the company announced UNMS (Ubiquiti Network Management System), proprietary software, offering for the centralized control of Ubiquiti devices across multiple sites globally.Liquidity & Share RepurchasesUbiquiti ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $823.8 million, compared with $604.2 million as of Jun 30, 2017. Long-term debt was about $453 million, compared with $241.8 million as of Jun 30, 2017.OutlookConcurrent with the earnings release, the company provided guidance for third-quarter fiscal 2018. Management projects revenues for the fiscal third quarter in the range of $245-260 million, while non-GAAP earnings are expected within 92-99 cents per share.To ConcludeThough the end of the earnings beat streak may not go well with investors, the solid year-over-year revenue growth of Ubiquiti is a major positive. Going forward, the company believes traction of the recently launched products to drive top-line growth.However, in recent times, the company is experiencing adverse macroeconomic issues like currency risks, rising labor costs in key locations and natural disasters, which pose concerns. The extremely competitive environment, which includes big multinational wireless telecom players, service providers as well as newly established companies, poses a threat to the company.Additionally, the company faces issues with its sales channel and supply chain execution, which might affect operations and impact margins negatively.Ubiquiti currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the same space include Aspen Technology, Inc. (AZPN  -  Free Report), Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) and Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report).

In the year-ago period, the company had reported earnings of €0.12 (13 cents) per share.Net sales increased to €6.67 billion (approximately $7.9 billion) year over year . Moreover, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.32 billion. However, quarterly revenues were hurt by adverse foreign currency movements.Quarterly adjusted gross margin was 41.4% compared with 42.2% a year ago. Operating margin increased 110 basis points (bps) to 15.1% on a year-over-year basis. Markedly, strong performance in the Nokia Technologies division led to the upsurge.Segmental RevenuesIn the Nokia Networks segment, total revenues were approximately €5,827 million (around $6,863 million), down 4% year over year. However, on a constant currency basis, segmental revenues increased 2% year over year.Notably, the division includes three reportable sub-units — Ultra Broadband Networks (which includes Mobile Networks and Fixed Networks operations), Global Services (which covers network planning, implementation, system integration, managed services, care services and optimization), and IP Networks and Applications (which includes the IP/Optical Networks and Applications & Analytics operations).Net sales declined in all sub-units, apart from Greater China (up 7%) and Latin America (flat year over year), which led to the segment’s below-par performance. The same decreased by 10% in North America, 5% each in Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, and 1% in Europe. Segmental gross margin also declined 330 bps to 37.6% in the reported quarter. Quarterly operating margin was 11.1% compared with 14.1% a year ago.Net sales of the Ultra Broadband Networks’ sub-group declined 4% to €2,471 million (around $2,910 million) on adverse foreign exchange movements. Nevertheless, on a constant currency basis, revenues increased 2%.Meanwhile, the Global Services sub-group registered a 7% decline in net sales to €1,642 million (around $1,934 million). Sales decreased 1%, on a constant currency basis, primarily due to weakness pertaining to network implementation and care services. In the IP Networks and Applications sub-group, net sales were down 1% year over year to €1,714 million (around $2,019 million) due to IP/Optical Networks. On a constant currency basis, sales of this sub-group increased 5%.The Nokia Technologies segment’s quarterly total revenues were €554 million (approximately $652 million), up 79% year over year. On a constant currency basis, segmental revenues increased 80% year over year. Segmental gross margin was 94.6% compared with 92.9% in the year-ago quarter. Operating margin expanded significantly to 70.2%.Segmental results were aided by Nokia’s licencing agreement with Huawei. Moreover, Nokia received a favorable verdict in a payment-related dispute with BlackBerry (BB  -  Free Report) in the reported quarter.In the Group Common and Other segment, net sales decreased 11% to €302 million (approximately $356 million) mainly due to weakness in Alcatel Submarine Networks and Radio Frequency Systems. On a constant currency basis, segmental revenues decreased 12% year over year. Segmental gross margin was 14.9%, down 420 basis points. In fact, this division also incurred an operating loss in the quarter under review.Nokia Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Nokia Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nokia Corporation QuoteOutlookNokia officially took control of rival Alcatel-Lucent in January 2016. It continues to expect annual cost savings of €1.2 billion for 2018, excluding Nokia Technologies.For 2018, capital expenditure outlook for this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company is approximately €700 million. The figure is expected to be around €600 million, over the long term. Non-IFRS tax rate is expected to be roughly 30% in the current year and 25% over the longer term.The company anticipates net sales in its primary networks division to decline in the current year, which is in line with the primary addressable market. However, rate of decline in this key segment is projected to be lower than that expected previously, mainly due to “early signs of improved conditions in North America”.Rollouts of next-generation 5G networks are anticipated to improve market conditions significantly in 2019 and 2020.  In fact, Nokia’s Networks division is expected to grow faster than the primary addressable market over the long term.Additionally, segmental operating margin is expected between 6% and 9% for 2018. The measure is projected in the 9% to 12% range for 2020.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderNokia carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Wireless Equipment sector are Motorola Solutions (MSI  -  Free Report) and Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report).

131,HRS,"3D Systems Corporation (DDD  -  Free Report) released preliminary fourth-quarter 2017 and full-year  results and announced that it will delay filing its annual report on Form 10-K. The company rescheduled its earnings release to Mar 14 adding that the deferment was due to accounting for revenues and costs related to product warranties.Preliminary ResultsThe company expects revenues for the fourth quarter in the range of $176-$178 million, reflecting 6-7% growth compared with the prior-year period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric stands below at $164 million.The top-line rise is likely to be driven by robust a performance in healthcare, materials, software and on-demand manufacturing coupled with more balanced regional execution.Also, GAAP loss is expected in the band of 8-10 cents per share in contrast to earnings of 5 cents in the comparable period last year. Non-GAAP earnings are expected within 3-5 cents, down from 15 cents in fourth-quarter 2016. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly bottom line is pegged lower at a couple of cents.For 2017, the company projects revenues to grow about 2% year over year and come within $645-$647 million. GAAP loss for the year is anticipated in the range of 58-60 cents per share compared with a loss of 35 cents in the prior year. The company estimates non-GAAP loss to lie within 1-3 cents against non-GAAP earnings of 46 cents in 2016.Earnings HistoryThe company’s bleak earnings surprise history shows estimate misses by a huge margin in three of the trailing four quarters, the average negative surprise being a whopping 83.8%. Last quarter, the company reported an adjusted loss of 20 cents, lagging estimates by a massive 281.8%. The bottom line was dragged by top-line decline as well as a disproportionate rise in cost of sales.3D Systems Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise 3D Systems Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | 3D Systems Corporation Quote Also, 3D Systems’ earnings estimates have moved south in the past month, indicating a bearish analyst sentiment for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has been revised downward from a loss of 4 cents to a 5-cent loss over the past 30 days due to a downward estimate revision versus none upward.Over the last six months, shares of 3D Systems have underperformed the industry. The stock has plunged 26.1% against the industry's positive return of 9.9%. Factors at PlayIn the third quarter,the company had conducted a deep and extensive review of inventory based on year-to-date demand, customer data and market trends, and had also recorded a significant adjustment to the same. Moreover it implemented organizational changes to improve execution and increased investments as it shifts to a worldwide go-to-market structure.Despite a steady momentum of healthcare offerings, robust demand for production printers and materials plus higher efficiency in “demand manufacturing services”, 3D Systems is apprehensive of a rough ride in the near future. The industry is battling a widespread decline in demand for enterprise 3D printers over the past two years. Other headwinds including economic slowdown, inflation, currency fluctuations and commodity price vagaries also marred the performance of most players in the industry.Nonetheless, we still believe the acquisition of Vertex-Global Holding B.V to unlock multiple opportunities for the billion-dollar digital dentistry space. Also, the company’s efforts to streamline its cost structure by focusing on IT infrastructure, go-to-market and innovation are likely to stoke growth.Given the numerous challenges grappling 3D Systems, the company has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the same space are HP Inc.

132,HRS,"Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 non-GAAP earnings of 53 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.However, earnings decreased 22% year over year primarily due to lower revenues, which fell 11% year over year to $1.24 billion. The figure marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.23 billion. Earnings also declined 6% sequentially.The disappointing top-line performance can be attributed to weakness in Cloud and routing verticals.The stock has returned 5.6% in the last year, significantly underperforming the industry’s gain of 21.1%.Cloud Results DisappointingCloud revenues declined 37.1% from the year-ago quarter and more than 24% sequentially to almost $259 million. Management cited spending delay by cloud and hyper-scale customers as well as architectural transitions behind the decline. This factor is expected to hurt top-line growth in the ongoing quarter as well.Juniper stated that the transition by cloud customers from 10-gigabit to 40-gigabit and 100-gigabit was the primary cause behind lower revenues. Moreover, architectural shift from scale-up architectures to scale-out architectures (lean core architectures, per Juniper) also hurt growth.Nevertheless, Juniper’s cloud product innovations and customer base continue to expand in the quarter. Of the top 10 customers, four were cloud customers while five were Telecom/Cable customers.Telecom/Cable revenues increased after two consecutive quarters of year-over-year decline. Revenues declined4.4% year over year to roughly $608 million, while sequentially, the figure increased 5.4%.Top-Line DetailProduct revenues (66.9% of total revenue) decreased 15.7% on a year-over-year basis to $830.4 million. The networking solutions provider witnessed year-over-year revenue decline in the Switching product category, which fell 7.2% to $233 million, primarily due to spending delay.However, QFX sales increased at double-digit rates, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Management stated that the cloud data center provider’s ongoing transition to 100-gigabit infrastructure drove growth.Routing category revenues declined 22.2% year over year and 13% sequentially to $509.6 million. PTX product line achieved strong revenue growth in the reported quarter. Management noted that per the latest IHS Markit report, Juniper has achieved the #1 position with service providers globally in four of the five key selection areas.

The growth was primarily attributed to momentum in data center, telco, financial services and government sales.Contrail Security continued to grow in the quarter and won several new customers including major carriers in Asia and Europe. Moreover, AppFormix’s customer base continues to expand across SaaS, enterprises and telecom operators.Services revenues (32.9% of total revenue) climbed 2.2%year over year and 5.4% sequentially to $409.1 million. The year-over-year growth was driven by strong demand for professional services and strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts.Geographically, the company registered a year-on-year increase of 7.2% in revenues from Asia Pacific, primarily driven strong performance in Australia. Revenues from EMEA and America decreased 3.2% and 19.4%, respectively.Juniper Networks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Juniper Networks, Inc.

136,HRS,"U.S. telecommunications had a disappointing 2017. While the S&P 500 index gained 16.91% in 2017, the telecom service provider industry declined 0.73% and the telecom equipment manufacturer industry rallied 12.09%. However, the situation started showing signs of improvement from fourth-quarter 2017 and most of the major telecommunications stocks have been performing well since then. The momentum is likely to through the end of 2018, albeit at a slow pace.A growing U.S. economy speeds up the demand for real-time voice, data, and video manifold. The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions, while upgrading plans. The increasing demand for technologically superior products has been a silver lining for the telecommunication industry in an otherwise tough environment. This in turn has given a boost to the demand for telecom infrastructure developers, particularly wireless equipment manufacturers.Major PositivesSeveral positives appeared for the telecom industry in the last quarter of 2017. President Donald Trump’s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish. The two pro-growth agendas of Trump, namely significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the U.S. economy.  Trump has stated that he wants to do away with nearly 75% of all governmental regulations during his term as the President. We believe that the telecom industry will be one of the major beneficiaries of this policy change.On Dec 14, 2017, in a landmark decision, the U.S. telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission (FCC) repealed the Net Neutrality laws that it had imposed under the Obama regime. There is little doubt that the ISP industry will be the major beneficiary after FCC dismantling Net Neutrality. The current FCC's less-restrictive regulatory attitude may also pave the way for new merger and acquisition deals between ISPs and online digital media companies.The proposal to reduce corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% faced by telecom carriers would be immediately accretive to cash flow. Trump’s tax proposal will result in a huge windfall for telecom operators. The carriers can utilize this money for 5G network R&D and its deployment.  The telecom industry is highly capital-intensive in nature. Therefore, the immediate expensing of investment in all tangible, intangible and real property (other than land) would significantly benefit telecom carriers. This would encourage telecom operators to increase investment for capital expenditure. Major proposals such as a pledge to spend $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years coupled with the above-mentioned policy changes are likely to spur higher consumer spending.Upcoming 5G Wireless NetworkFifth-generation (5G) superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry. In September 2017, Moody's Investors Service stated in a report that the evolution towards 5G wireless networks will result in higher capital spending for the U.S. wireless carriers. Per a report by research firm iGR, U.S. telecom operators will spend around $104 billion between 2015 and 2025 to upgrade their existing 4G networks to the upcoming 5G standards and thereafter, execute full installation of 5G wireless services.We expect wireless networks to provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry. In this regard, Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to emerge the numero uno factor for future growth in the space. According to a report by research firm International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide spending on IoT will grow at 19.2% compound annual growth rate to nearly $1.7 trillion in 2020 from $698.6 billion in 2015.Growing Demand for Fiber Optic NetworkFiber optic cable is a vital infrastructure in order to meet the growing demand for cloud-based business data, along with more video-streaming services by individuals. Moreover, fiber-optic cable network is vital for backhaul and last mile local loop, which are needed by wireless service providers for their upcoming 5G network.Dark fiber provides abundant bandwidth, which is of utmost necessity for the smooth functioning of super-fast wireless networks such as 4G and 5G. Dark fiber based wireless backhaul provides scalability and efficiency to bandwidth management. This will eventually lead the company to significantly reduce its backhaul costs. Fiber networks are essential for the growing deployment of small cells. The increase in adoption of small cells is because of the inconvenience in installing large towers in inaccessible areas.Our Top PicksThe U.S. wireless equipment industry has lately emerged as an intensely contested space where success thrives largely on technical superiority, quality of services and scalability. In order to stay abreast of competition, existing players need to be constantly on their toes, introducing innovative products to gain from the industry’s growing momentum. At this stage, we believe investors should choose stocks which promise strong near-term growth and carry a favourable Zacks Rank. Taking into account these factors, we present four such stocks for investors to consider:InterDigital Inc. (IDCC  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Wilmington, DE, InterDigital develops fundamental wireless technologies that are at the core of wireless devices, networks and services worldwide. The company holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Comtech Telecommunications Corp.

The company has a diverse customer base in the global commercial and government communications markets. Comtech has a long-term (three-five years) EPS growth estimate of 5% and a dividend yield of 1.84%. The company holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Harris Corp. (HRS  -  Free Report): Based in Melbourne, FL, Harris has evolved from being a diversified electronics company to one that is focused on communications. The company is a global provider of communications equipment and services to government and commercial customers in more than 150 countries. Major operational areas are network broadcasting, network test and management equipment and software, mobile radio networks, and air traffic control systems. Harris has a long-term (three-five years) EPS growth estimate of 6% and a dividend yield of 1.56%. The company holds a Zacks Rank #2.Motorola Solutions Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report): Based in Schaumburg, IL, Motorola Solutions is a leading communications equipment manufacturer, and has a strong market position in bar code scanning, wireless infrastructure gear, and government communications. Motorola Solutions has a long-term (three-five years) EPS growth estimate of 4.4% and a dividend yield of 2.1%. The company holds a Zacks Rank #2.Solid ChartsThe chart below shows that all the above-mentioned stocks have performed well in the last six months.Bottom LineTelecommunications is one of the few industries to have witnessed rapid technological improvement even during the recession. Owing to the significance of this service as an infrastructure product, we expect the overall economic dynamics to shift in favor of the industry. At this stage, we believe that these four stocks with a favourable Zacks Rank are poised to capitalize on the growing opportunities.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

138,HRS,"Nokia Corporation (NOK  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Feb 1.Last quarter, the company reported earnings (non-IFRS) per share of €0.09 (approximately 11 cents) that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents. In the year-ago period, the company had reported earnings of €0.04 (5 cents) per share.Net sales declined year over year to €5.5 billion (approximately $6.5 billion). However, the top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.41 billion but fell short of the year-ago figure of approximately $6.57 billion. This was because revenues were hurt by the Nokia Networks’ disappointing performance.Let’s see how things shape up for this announcement.Factors Likely at PlayThe disappointing performance of Nokia’s primary division, the Networks unit, is likely to hurt results in the fourth quarter. Weakness in the Ultra Broadband Networks’ subgroup is likely to result in Nokia’s flagship division’s poor performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The company also expects segmental results in the final quarter of 2017 to be hurt primarily due to competition in the Chinese market.Furthermore, the top line in the fourth quarter might be hampered by adverse foreign currency movements since the company operates globally. However, Nokia’s revenues are likely to benefit from payments in the quarter, following a favorable verdict in a payment-related dispute with BlackBerry (BB  -  Free Report).Additionally, Nokia’s technology segment is likely to perform well in the soon-to-be reported quarter, thereby aiding results.Nokia Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Nokia Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Nokia Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Nokia is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

140,HRS,"The U.S. telecommunications industry had a disappointing 2017. Cut-throat pricing competition resulting in lower ARPU (average revenue per user) and margins, massive investment for upcoming 5G wireless network and fiber optic buildout resulting in low free cash flow and intense competitive pressure shifted investor’s focus toward other growth-oriented industries in an overall bull market in 2017.However, the situation has been showing signs of easing from fourth-quarter 2017 as most of the major telecommunications stocks have done well since then. The momentum is likely to continue in 2018 albeit at a slow pace. Several positives have appeared for this industry in the last quarter of 2017.Major PositivesPresident Donald Trump’s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish. The two pro-growth agendas of Trump, namely, significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the U.S. economy.  Trump has stated that he wants to do away with nearly 75% of all governmental regulations during his term as the President. We believe that the telecom industry will be one of the major beneficiaries of this policy change.On Dec 14, 2017, in a landmark decision, the U.S. telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission (FCC) repealed the Net Neutrality laws that it had imposed under the Obama regime.

This would encourage telecom operators to increase investment for capital expenditure. Major proposals such as a pledge to spend $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years coupled with the above-mentioned policy changes are likely to spur higher consumer spending.Performance So FarPer the latest Zacks Earnings Trend report, only 53 S&P 500 members have reported fourth-quarter earnings results as of Jan 19. Total earnings for these companies are up 11.7% from the same period last year on 7.5% higher revenues, with 81.1% beating EPS estimates and 75.5% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 62.3%.The Q4 earnings season is on track and is expected to be very good. Four important points can be inferred from the results thus far. First, the +11.7% earnings growth for the 53 index members compares is about the same as the +11.9% growth in Q3 and modestly below the 4-quarter average of +12.8%. Second, the +7.5% revenue growth for these 53 index members represents a notable acceleration in growth momentum. Third, the 81.1% proportion of the companies beating EPS estimates in Q4 is the highest we have seen from these 53 index members in other recent periods. Fourth, the 75.5% of the companies beating revenues is similarly the highest we have seen from this group of companies in recent periods. (Read More: Q4 Earnings Season: Strong Growth, But Weak Quality)In the telecom space, so far, national wireless behemoth Verizon Communications has reported Q4 results. The result was a mixed bag. While the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the bottom line lagged the same. Nevertheless, the carrier has witnessed significant net addition of postpaid wireless subscribers with reduced churn rate.How to Make a Selection?With the existence of a number of industry players, finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat earnings estimates could appear a difficult task, however, our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple for you. One way to narrow down the list of choices during the earnings season is to look at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Our ChoicesRelying on the above methodology, we have zeroed in on five telecom stocks that are likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this earnings season.Harris Corp. (HRS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.11% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank  stocks here. The company is scheduled to report results on Jan 30. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 2.80% in the last four quarters and a long-term (three-five years) earnings growth rate of 6.00%.Vocera Communications Inc. (VCRA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +15.32% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to report results on Feb 8. It has an average positive earnings surprise of a whopping 44.86% in the last four quarters and a substantial long-term (three-five years) earnings growth rate of 17.75%.Extreme Networks Inc. (EXTR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +7.69% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to report results on Feb 7.

(PLT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.69% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to report results on Jan 30. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 5.85% in the last four quarters and a substantial long-term (three-five years) earnings growth rate of 15.00%.Citrix Systems Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.52% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to report results on Jan 31. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 7.97% in the last four quarters and a long-term (three-five years) earnings growth rate of 5.33%.Bottom LineWhile the U.S. telecom industry offers several growth catalysts in the long term, buoyed by favourable economic and industry-related factors, we believe investor’s should also take care of any near-term fluctuations due to growing competition and increasing saturation of the U.S. wireless market. However, a number of companies in the space have fared well. Picking some outperformers from the space, backed by a solid Zacks Rank and a positive Earnings ESP, could lead investors to gain this earnings season.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

141,HRS,"TE Connectivity Ltd. (TEL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell on Jan 24.TE Connectivity has an excellent earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 9.7% in the trailing four quarters. The company recorded its eight consecutive earnings beat in the last reported quarter, surpassing estimates by 7.8%. In the quarter to be reported, the company is expected to report strong revenues in Transportation Solutions business, which constitutes more than half of its total revenues.We expect TE Connectivity to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that TE Connectivity has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: TE Connectivity has an Earnings ESP of +0.26%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.TE Connectivity Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise TE Connectivity Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise | TE Connectivity Ltd. QuoteZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors Driving the Better-than-Expected ResultsTE Connectivity is now poised to grow on the back of strong demand in end markets, along with its overarching business model and continued progress on strategic priorities. The company’s Commercial transportation business is showing remarkable signs of progress, driven by the content expansion in the heavy truck market, especially in China. Growth in electronic content and a rich pipeline of platform ramps from design wins bode well for its transportation business. Additionally, the sensor business is anticipated to see strong design win momentum, fueled by the growth of automotive space, which is likely to prove conductive to upcoming results.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Transportation Solutions segment in the to-be-reported quarter currently remains high at $1,867 million compared with fiscal fourth-quarter revenues of $1,844 million. However, revenues from Industrial Solutions segment are anticipated to be low sequentially, with an estimate of $869 million compared with reported revenues of $954 million in the prior quarter.Moreover, being a market leader in the connectivity and sensor business, the company is armed with a comprehensive portfolio that supplements its strength. About 80% of the company’s revenues are driven by harsh environment applications. Over the past five years, its harsh business applications have experienced mid-single digit growth, driving top-line growth. Going forward, we believe that this business will provide ample opportunities of margin expansion.This apart, the company’s ardent eye for acquisitions is anticipated to be conducive to core business, going forward. The company’s buyout of MicroGroup and agreement to acquire Hirschmann Car Communication enhanced its harsh environment portfolio and are expected to drive first-quarter fiscal sales as well.However, primarily dependent on end market dynamics the company’s business is subject to cyclical risks that the end markets suffer. Though the company has witnessed some stability in direct business with OEMs, poor sales through distribution channels are taking longer-than-expected recovery time, consequently hurting segmental performance. Additionally, the company’s weakness in commercial transportation market due to weak global construction and agriculture markets, along with weakness in the North America heavy truck markets, have been adding to woesFurther, sluggishness in oil and gas markets and its derivative impact on other industrial markets will likely act as strong headwinds for the company. Also, helicopter demand has also been impacted adversely, which can prove to be a drag on the company’s aerospace business. This apart, the company believes the supply chain inefficiencies can prove to be a drag on the earnings in the quarter under review.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Analog Devices, Inc.

143,HRS,"U.S. stock markets have remained highly volatile in 2018 so far. Inflationary expectations, concern of higher interest rate, imposition of tariffs resulting in a looming trade war along with several geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East and Asia are main factors behind the market instability.However, the wireless equipment manufacturing industry continued its bull run even under these foreboding circumstances, surprising many investors.Year to date, the wireless equipment industry gained 5.6%, slightly below 5.8% growth offered by the Computer and Technology sector, of which wireless equipment industry is part of. Moreover, growth of wireless equipment industry is far ahead of the 1.3% gain registered by the benchmark S&P 500 index. Notably, in the last one month, the wireless equipment industry gained 8.5%.Strong Wireless Infrastructure MarketA growing U.S. economy speeds up the demand for real-time voice, data, and video manifold. The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans. This in turn has provided a boost to the demand for telecom infrastructure developers, particularly wireless gear manufacturers.The LTE network has the highest penetration rate of 90.5% in the North American region. By the end of 2020, C-RAN, small cells, DAS and carrier Wi-Fi, together with their fronthaul and backhaul segments, will account for more than 45% of total wireless infrastructure spending.5G and IoT: Future DriversFifth-generation (5G) superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry. In September 2017, Moody's Investors Service stated in a report that the evolution toward 5G wireless networks will result in higher capital spending for the U.S. wireless carriers.In this regard, Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to emerge the numero uno factor for future growth in the space. Statista’s 2018 report on global telecom estimates that global telecom services revenues will reach around $1.5 trillion in 2019.Pro-Growth MeasuresThe two pro-growth agendas of President Trump, namely, significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the Telecom industry. The corporate tax rate was recently lowered from 35% to 21%., marking the rate’s lowest in 78 years. Trump’s tax proposal will result in a huge windfall for telecom operators. The carriers can utilize this money for 5G network R&D and its deployment. This will naturally bolster demand for wireless equipment.The telecom regulatory body, Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which was revamped by Trump, repealed the Net Neutrality laws in December 2017. Telecom industry will immensely benefit from this decision and will ramp up their project investment. Higher telecom expenditure will eventually benefit wireless equipment manufacturers.U.S. Tariffs on Chinese ImportsOn March 2018, the U.S. government imposed 25% tariffs targeting 1,300 Chinese imports for a total worth of $50 billion. Information technology, telecommunications and consumer electronics are the major Chinese industries which have faced the brunt of U.S. tariffs.U.S. companies that rely on Chinese imports are unhappy about the move as it will raise prices of telecom equipment and several electronics products for the IT sector. However, a hike in product prices will certainly help U.S. wireless equipment manufacturers.Trump administration is deeply concerned about China’s drive to unseat United States as the primary developer and supplier of products in the fields of high-tech artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum computing and various other digital technology driven sectors.Companies that are likely to gain most from the U.S. tariffs are Motorola Solutions Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report), Ubiquiti Networks Inc. (UBNT  -  Free Report), Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (CMTL  -  Free Report), Harris Corp. (HRS  -  Free Report) and InterDigital Inc. (IDCC  -  Free Report). Comtech, Harris and InterDigital carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Motorola and Ubiquiti Networks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The chart below shows price performance of the wireless equipment industry and S&P 500 year to date. Bottom LineThe U.S. wireless equipment industry has lately emerged as an intensely contested space where success thrives largely on technical superiority, quality of services and scalability. In order to stay abreast of competition, existing players need to be constantly on their toes, introducing innovative products to gain from the industry’s growing momentum.Massive government spending like U.S. broadband infrastructure development program and similar structural subsidies in China and India, have been a boon to telecom equipment makers.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

144,HRS,"Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report) recently secured a five-year contract from the U.S. Air Force worth $130 million. Per the contract, the company will manufacture Hand Held Video Data Link (HH-VDL) radios to improve situational awareness and connectivity for warfighters.The lightweight HH-VDL radios offer real-time aerial view of the battlespace to the ground forces through full-motion video and sensor data feeds from aircraft or unmanned aerial systems. By seamless transfer of highly sensitive data to and from multiple airborne assets through secure transmission facilities, Harris will extend the mobile communications network of the warfighters beyond conventional sources. This, in turn, will better equip the warfighters to effectively strategize moves to counter any active threat or neutralize potential enemy action.  The real-time intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) information will be utilized by the U.S. Air Force to disseminate data from the air to warfighters on ground level. Harris’ HH-VDL radios offer a tactical advantage to a mobile defense force and are therefore a better fit to replace the existing incumbent ground ISR terminals operating at the tactical edge of the battlespace. In addition to increased capability, the radios will leverage state-of-the-art technology via Bandwidth Efficient Common Data Link, a communications waveform that enables secure, real-time distribution of time-sensitive data and full-motion video.    The company has been a mission partner for the U.S. Air Force for over seven decades. The current contract reinforces Harris’ commitment to serve the Air Force in operations across any domain through the integration of air, space and cyber assets and is likely to augment its long-term revenues.  With diligent execution of operational plans, Harris’ shares have outperformed the industry over the past six months with an average return of 6.2% compared with a rise of 2.6% for the latter.Incidentally, the company tweaked its projection for fiscal 2018 owing to impressive performance in the fiscal third quarter. It expects fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share in the band of $6.45-$6.50, up from prior expectations of $6.30-$6.50. Fiscal 2018 revenues are expected to be approximately $6.14 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 4% from the earlier expectations of $6.08-6.14 billion. The company also anticipates adjusted free cash flow between $900 million and $925 million, up from the previous guidance of approximately $900 million.Harris currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include BlackBerry Limited (BB  -  Free Report) and Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (UBNT  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.BlackBerry has a healthy long-term earnings growth expectation of 18.6%.

145,HRS,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 4.1% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is HRS due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Harris Beats on Q3 Earnings & Revenues, Ups GuidanceHarris reported healthy third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both the top line and the bottom line surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Earnings from continuing operations increased to $1.67 per share from $1.31 in the year-ago quarter on top-line growth and tax benefit. Non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations were $1.67 per share compared with $1.38 in the year-earlier quarter, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62.Revenues for the quarter increased 5% year over year to $1,568 million, supported by growth across all three segments led by Electronic Systems and Communication Systems. The top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,548 million.Total operating income for the quarter was $256 million compared with $275 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating margin was 16.3% compared with 18.5% in the prior-year period, due to higher operating expenses in the reported quarter.Segmental PerformanceRevenues from Communication Systems segment came in at $481 million for the quarter, up 4% year over year, owing to growth in Tactical Communications and Night Vision. Operating income grew 5% to $147 million due to increased volume and operational efficiencies.Revenues from Electronic Systems unit were $609 million, up 10% year over year, due to higher volume in Avionics with growth in F-35 and other international platforms, growth in Electronic Warfare (EW) on F-16 and F/A-18 platforms and in C4ISR from the ramp of U.K. robotics and the UAE battle management system.Operating income for the segment was $112 million, down 3% year over year as the benefit of higher volume was more than offset by increased research and development investment and program revenue mix.Revenues from Space and Intelligence Systems unit improved 1% year over year to $482 million, owing to growth in Classified programs, driven by the ramp of small satellites, ground-based processing adjacency and space surveillance programs. Operating income increased 8% year over year to $82 million due to strong program execution and incremental pension income.  Balance Sheet & Cash FlowThe company generated $230 million as cash from operating activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared with $489 million in the year-ago period.At the end of the fiscal third quarter, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $443 million with net long-term debt of $3,391 million.FY18 View UpThe company tweaked its projection for fiscal 2018 owing to its impressive performance in the fiscal third quarter. It expects fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share in the band of $6.45-$6.50, up from prior expectations of $6.30-$6.50.Fiscal 2018 revenues are expected to be approximately $6.14 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 4% from the earlier expectations of $6.08-6.14 billion. The company also anticipates adjusted free cash flow between $900 million to $925 million, up from the previous guidance of approximately $900 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

146,HRS,"Viasat Inc.  rolled out the fastest satellite internet available in the United States, powered by the new ViaSat-2 satellite system. The company is offering streaming and download speeds of up to 100 Mbps to subscribers along with unlimited data plans for video streaming.The service is aimed at households that are outside the reach of cable systems (10-30 million households in the United States). These consumers have limited options for high-speed Internet service, with DSL being the most common choice. However, DSL speeds typically top out at 25 megabits per second.In essence, Viasat is offering its service as a higher-speed alternative to DSL. Viasat’s new plans start at 12 megabits per second, at an initial cost of $50 per month. Consumers can scale up to 25 megabits for $70 per month, 50 megabits for $100 per month and 100 megabits for $150 a month. Each of the plans offer unlimited data, which allows roughly 150 gigabits of video streaming and other consumption per month.If a user exceeds the data limits and the network is crowded, they may experience slower speeds. However, Viasat insisted that it will not charge overage fees.The new plans are powered by ViaSat-2, a $625-million high-capacity satellite launched by the company in June 2017. The satellite also powers fast in-flight Wi-Fi for JetBlue, American Airlines, United Airlines and other commercial carriers and government customers. ViaSat-2 satellite system provides service to North America, Central America, the Caribbean and a small part of northern South America.ViaSat-2 is expected to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage, and is a massive improvement over ViaSat-1. Some other features which make it more powerful than ViaSat-1 include high-capacity connectivity, smaller gateway antenna and twice as many gateways. Viasat believes that these advanced smaller gateways can help it place the latest satellites in proximity of popular Internet access points, delivering greater network reliability and security.Viasat is already building its next-generation high-capacity satellite system — ViaSat-3 — which is expected to expand its network worldwide.The satellite business is a burgeoning space and is one of the fastest growing segments of the $350-billion space industry. Significant demand for higher speeds of broadband connectivity in residential, in-flight and government markets are likely to accelerate Viasat’s growth momentum in the near term.In recent quarters, Viasat’s earnings have suffered due to R&D expenses. The primary dampeners are the ViaSat-3 payload, pre-flight development and testing, commercial in-flight connectivity, STCs and line-fit activity. This indicates that we can expect more pressure on profits in the upcoming quarters. Viasat’s shares have gained just 4% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 18.2%.Revenue growth in the fiscal third quarter was strained due to capacity constraints. Also, the costs related to the ViaSat-2 service launch activities and preparations for the large-scale in-flight Wi-Fi ramp are expected to burden the bottom line in the coming quarters. The company also predicts heavier advertising activity over the next several quarters, which will raise costs and hurt margins.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderViasat carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space include HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) and Harris Corp. (HRS  -  Free Report), each holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

148,HRS,"In the last five trading days, telecom stocks declined initially and traded flat thereafter only to decline further as concerns related to the U.S-China trade war resumed in a dramatic turn of events.Last week, President Trump revealed that the U.S. administration reached a settlement on ZTE as part of the ongoing trade talks between the two warring countries. This included a fine of $1.3 billion against ZTE, restructuring of its management and hiring of American compliance officers at the company. In return, the Commerce Department lifted the seven-year ban on the Chinese firm related to the purchase of components from U.S. manufacturers that threatened its survival and crippled operations.Just when it appeared that things were working toward reducing the United States’ negative balance of trade against China, President Donald Trump flip-flopped on his trade policy and renewed threats to impose 25% tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods to retaliate against unfair trade practices. Some industry observers believe that the tactic is part of Trump’s broader plan to gain leverage in the trade talks as Commerce department secretary Wilbur Ross is scheduled to visit China later this week. However, the volte-face could derail the trade negotiations as China vouched to counter the move with similar restrictions.  Regarding company-specific news, improved product launches for superior connectivity and high-quality content to subscribers at lower cost of ownership, and technology collaborations ruled the roost over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    CenturyLink, Inc.

149,HRS,"Ericsson’s(ERIC  -  Free Report) partnership with NBN Co to provide fixed wireless as well as satellite operational services across Australia’s regional and rural parts was recently extended to 2020 by the latter. Per the latest deal, Ericsson will continue to be in charge of operations for nbn fixed wireless network and ground systems operations for Sky Muster. The company will also handle customer connections and assurance for both technologies.NBN Co’s fixed wireless and Sky Muster services cater to over 980,000 homes in regional as well as remote Australia. Over 290,000 homes are linked to broadband services through NBN Co’s retail service providers. The presence of extensive broadband across Australia will facilitate the bridging of the digital divide, while supporting economic as well as community growth.Of late, soft mobile broadband demand and challenging macroeconomic conditions in the emerging markets are acting as a deterrent for major investments by telecom equipment behemoths, and this has hurt Ericsson’s operations severely in recent times.Persistently low investments in mobile broadband in certain markets and lower managed services sales have harmed the sales of the company’s Networks segment, while lower legacy product sales have hurt IT & Cloud revenues. Lower IPR licensing revenue and an unfavorable mix between coverage & capacity and services are adding to concerns. Notably, the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company has lost 4.4% in the past six months in contrast to the industry’s gain of 2.5%.Moreover, high restructuring charges are knocking on the company’s door, and we also have a subdued view of operator spending and investments in R&D. The company’s current savings plans and job reductions do not seem enough to counter macroeconomic miseries and swiftly waning product demand, further adding to the woes.This apart, spectrum crunch has become a major issue in the U.S. telecom industry that has a saturated wireless market. In addition, the company’s cash flow could be materially hurt by market and customer project adjustments. Though the company is working diligently to improve the situation, tangible results are yet to materialize.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the same space include Comtech Telecommunications Corp.

151,HRS,"AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) has recently revealed information regarding a tentative deal with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) in relation with AT&T Mobility Orange unit employees.Announced on Dec 13, the four-year contract covers more than 20,000 AT&T Mobility employees (in wireless retail, call center and tech segments) in 36 states and the District of Columbia. The proposed offer includes wage hikes, healthcare benefits, employment security for call center and retail sales employees and retirement benefits, including pension and savings plan. The proposed contract is likely to new industry standards for pay rates and job security.The contract follows after 11 months of negotiations and public disputes between the company and workers. In May, thousands of CWA members held a three-day strike at several locations in New Jersey, including East Brunswick, Toms River and Oakhurst.The telecom service provider awaits approval from the union members by Jan 12, 2018.If the proposed agreement goes through, AT&T will reach 32 different labor agreements since 2015, covering about 165,000 employees. This will help the service provider strengthen relationship with the union and encourage employees to continue working with the company.This is not the first time AT&T is trying to resolve issues with CWA.Per a FierceTelecom report, AT&T and CWA approved a labor agreement related to CWA-represented former DirecTV employees in four states, on Mar 6. The agreement covered 280 employees in Delaware, Maryland, New Mexico and Oregon.On Mar 3, AT&T and CWA reached a four-year (Apr 9, 2017 to Apr 10, 2021) tentative labor agreement with the company’s Southwest wireline workforce. This included 20,000 employees in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas.Till then, AT&T had a total of 19 different labor agreements for the 2016-2017 period, covering more than 81,000 employees. This included 10 agreements covering nearly 7,800 former DirecTV employees. Between 2015 and 2016, AT&T successfully negotiated 25 labor contracts covering a total of 102,000 workers. In December 2016, AT&T completed an agreement on a new contract covering 2,000 DirecTV call center workers.Such labor negotiations help to avoid long labor strikes which are common in the wireless industry.Similar Labor NegotiationsIn November 2017, Frontier Communications Corp’s (FTR  -  Free Report) workers represented by CWA union in West Virginia, Ashburn and Virginia, extended their current contract till Mar 3, 2018.  The contract covers 1,600 CWA members and was originally set to expire on Nov 4.In June 2017, CenturyLink Inc (CTL  -  Free Report) and CWA  agreed on an extension covering almost 25% of the company’s total workforce, spread across 13 states, including Oregon, Idaho, and Colorado.

152,HRS,"ViaSat Inc.’s  recently-reported quarterly earnings were, no doubt, hurt badly by escalating research and development costs, and ramped-up expenses, ahead of offering subscribers service with its new high-speed satellite. Despite the same, we believe the company has numerous growth drivers in place.The stock has appreciated 8.8% over the past six months, ahead of the industry’s average gain of 1.3%. Let’s discuss a few of those growth catalysts for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock and shed light on some of the risks it faces.ViaSat’s Government Systems business has been outstanding in recent times and has been gaining even greater momentum. The segment reported striking revenue growth of 15% fiscal year to date compared with the previous year’s comparable period. The growth was driven by an expanding service base and strong momentum in tactical data-link products, government mobility platforms, and secure networking products. It also recorded strong growth in cyber-security and information assurance products. Splendid growth in revenues drove strong year-to-date Adjusted EBITDA (up 30% year over year).The company recently launched the ViaSat-2 satellite. ViaSat-2, touted to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage, is a massive improvement over ViaSat-1 and has immense prospects. The company is ready for the service roll out of the ViaSat-2 satellite in February 2018. Per initial tests, the company anticipates to grow its distribution channel significantly, leading up to the ViaSat-2 service launch.In-flight connectivity is also sustaining robust growth momentum and remains another strong potential tailwind for ViaSat. The company also projects sound growth in in-flight connectivity, with a significant increase in shipments and installations projected early next fiscal. It anticipates significantly greater growth early in the next fiscal. In fact, it expects to witness a significant ramp with Gen-2 installs later this fiscal year, particularly on American Airlines and Qantas. The Commercial Air business will likely prove to be a key profit driver in the quarters to come.Last month, the company signed a new contract with JetBlue, for both aircraft connectivity and on-board Wi-Fi distribution. Under the contract, ViaSat will upgrade JetBlue’s fleet with its next-generation connectivity suite. The aircraft will then have improved access to the coverage and capacity offered by ViaSat's next-generation ViaSat-2 satellite platforms.ViaSat maintains a leading position in the satellite and wireless communications market. The company has garnered enough economics of scale and scope to serve the vast emerging markets in South America, Africa, the Middle East and Western Asia. This should be a key catalyst for the company’s operations in the quarters to come.ViaSat, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise ViaSat, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ViaSat, Inc. Quote Lately, ViaSat’s earnings have suffered quite a lot due to R&D expenses, but per the company, total R&D investments look set to peak this fiscal year. The primary drivers are the ViaSat-3 payload, pre-flight development and testing, and commercial in-flight connectivity, STCs and line-fit activity. This indicates that we can see more pressure on profits in the upcoming quarters. Also, the costs related to the ViaSat-2 service launch activities and preparations for the large-scale in-flight Wi-Fi ramp are estimated to further burden the bottom line.Also, stiff competition in the industry proves to be a major growth deterrent for the company, particularly for its satellite services segment. The satellite services business is also highly affected by seasonality of demand due to traditional retail selling periods.However, strong backlog levels, robust prospects of core government business and significant demand for higher speeds of broadband connectivity in residential, in-flight, and government markets are likely to accelerate the company’s growth momentum. In addition, the ViaSat-2 satellite is anticipated to help this company fortify its foothold in new geographic markets.Overall, while we acknowledge that ViaSat has a robust foothold in numerous markets and is enjoying strong growth momentum, we feel its earnings are set up for more pressure in the quarters ahead.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space include Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (CMTL  -  Free Report), Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) and Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report). While Comtech Telecommunications sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Motorola and Harris Corporation both hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.With four back-to-back, robust earnings beats, Comtech has a striking average positive surprise of 88.7%.Motorola Solutions has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company recorded an average positive surprise of 13.2% over the trailing four quarters, beating estimates all through.Harris Corporation has a decent earnings surprise history for the trailing four quarters, beating estimates thrice, with an average positive surprise of 2.8%.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

153,HRS,"Over the last five trading days, telecom stocks initially witnessed a V-shaped recovery on game-changing merger news but later witnessed a sharp fall as concerns over fresh restrictions against Chinese companies intensified fears of an escalating trade war in the telecom domain.The Trump administration is reportedly mulling to introduce an executive order that could raise the bar for federal agencies to buy or sell products from Chinese technology firms, citing national security issues. The bone of contention stems from an innate desire between the two warring nations to claim dominance in cutting-edge technologies and the next generation of wireless services. The Pentagon has also banned the sale of smartphones from ZTE and Huawei — two of China’s leading technology brands — from all military establishments.Regarding company-specific news, earnings of major telecom companies ruled the roost. The industry’s earnings in general appear to be on strong footing backed by healthy growth dynamics thanks to the existing secular trends in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and Big Data.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Nokia Corporation’s (NOK  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings (non-IFRS) per share of €0.02 or 2 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 cents.

154,HRS,"Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results before the opening bell on May 2.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 19.3%. Notably, Harris surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 6.7%.The company is likely to report higher revenues in the quarter backed by healthy growth dynamics. Whether this could result into an earnings beat for the quarter remains to be seen.Top-Line Expansion During the quarter, Harris was awarded a $161 million contract modification to supply the next production lot of electronic jammers to protect the U.S. Navy and Australian F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet aircraft against electronic threats.This award was in addition to the $133 million production lot award received in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The company has received more than $1 billion in awards to date from the Naval Air Systems Command for AN/ALQ-214 development and production.Also, Harris was selected as the prime systems integrator to modernize and upgrade an Asian nation’s military communications network, extending its role as the country’s incumbent radio provider.On Mar 1, Harris launched the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-S, its second Advanced Baseline Imager, which was built for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s weather-monitoring mission.These factors are expected to add to the top-line growth of the company. However, high dependency of sales revenues to the U.S. government and cost of operations could hamper Harris’ growth trajectory.For the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues stands at $1,548 million, up from $1,489 million reported in the year-earlier quarter. Adjusted earnings per share is pegged at $1.62, up from $1.38 reported a year ago.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Harris is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess any of the two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

155,HRS,"Over the last five trading days, telecom stocks took an initial beating before witnessing a sharp rise, as healthy earnings surprises seemed to propel the industry.The industry initially received a jolt when antitrust authorities made it clear that a competitive environment was of utmost importance. The Department of Justice initiated a probe related to the alleged collusion between AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) to hinder consumers from easily switching wireless carriers. The bone of contention refers to the ESIM technology that allows consumers to switch wireless providers without having to insert a new physical SIM card, thereby making their businesses more volatile.Regarding company-specific news, earnings of major telecom companies ruled the roost. The industry’s earnings in general appear to be on strong footing backed by healthy growth dynamics thanks to the existing secular trends in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and Big Data.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Verizon started 2018 on a positive note with a relatively healthy performance in the first quarter, primarily led by the wireless business. The bottom line also benefited from significant savings from the tax reform.GAAP earnings for the reported quarter were $4,666 million or $1.11 per share compared with $3,553 million or 84 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings were $1.17 per share compared with 95 cents in the year-earlier quarter, comfortably exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11. Consolidated GAAP revenues increased 6.6% year over year to $31,772 million on the back of solid performance in the wireless business. Excluding revenues from divested businesses, non-GAAP consolidated revenues were $29.9 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $31,157 million.

The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 3 cents.Net sales for the quarter fell 9% year over year to SEK 43.4 billion ($5.3 billion). The top line, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,547 million. This was mainly due to lower revenues in market areas North East Asia as well as in South East Asia, Oceania and India.

156,HRS,"Over the last five trading days, telecom stocks were initially slow off the blocks but gradually picked up pace, as protective measures by the U.S. government seemed to propel the industry to gain an upper hand over its Chinese counterparts.At a meeting held last week, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) came up with a concrete date to auction licenses of high-band spectrum so that wireless networks could roll out 5G technology by the end of the year. The FCC voted unanimously to auction off licenses for the 28GHz spectrum on Nov 14, followed by another round for 24GHz spectrum soon after. The FCC expects to sell about 6,000 individual licenses for different chunks of spectrum in different geographic locations.The FCC also voted unanimously to finalize a plan this year to prevent federally subsidized telecommunications carriers from using suppliers deemed to pose a risk to the U.S. national security. The decision takes a swipe at Chinese telecom companies like Huawei and ZTE and intensifies the murky trade war between the two superpowers. The strategic plan aims to thwart the U.S. companies to utilize the $8.5 billion FCC Universal Service Fund to procure goods or services from Chinese firms, limiting the latter’s ability to sell their products in the country.Regarding company-specific news, the earnings season started off with ADTRAN Inc. (ADTN  -  Free Report) reporting results, while continued product launches for superior connectivity and high-quality content to subscribers at lower cost of ownership gained momentum over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    ADTRAN reported lackluster first-quarter 2018 results with both the top line and bottom line missing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.

158,HRS,"With the March-quarter earnings drawing to a close, industry peers are doing various analysis and comparisons to gauge the underlying metrics and relative performance. Let us perform a similar comparative analysis between two stocks in the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry — Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) and Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report) — to pick the better investment option.  Earnings ScoresheetJuniper reported relatively healthy first-quarter 2018 results on the back of a solid performance from the cloud vertical and growth in enterprise business. Despite year-over-year decrease in earnings and revenues, the company was able to beat the respective estimates and remains confident of returning to a growth trajectory by the end of the year. Non-GAAP earnings for the reported quarter were $99.5 million or 28 cents per share compared with $178 million or 46 cents per share in the year-ago quarter owing to top-line woes. Non-GAAP earnings, however, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents. Net revenues for the quarter were $1,082.6 million compared with $1,221 million in the prior-year period. Also, the tally exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,049 million.Harris reported healthy third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both the top line and the bottom line surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations were $1.67 per share compared with $1.38 in the year-earlier quarter, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62. Revenues for the quarter increased 5% year over year to $1,568 million, supported by growth across all three segments led by Electronic Systems and Communication Systems. The top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,548 million.Based on recently-released earnings results, Juniper has a clear edge over Harris due to a better earnings and sales surprise percentage.Price PerformanceIn the past year, Harris has clearly outperformed Juniper with an average return of 41.7% against a loss of 9.6% for the latter while the industry gained 7.2%.  Estimate RevisionsPost earnings release, Juniper’s current-quarter estimates increased from 42 cents to 43 cents per share (up 2.4%) while that for the current year increased from $1.78 to $1.79 (up 0.6%).Harris’ current-quarter estimates decreased to $1.76 from $1.78 post earnings release (down 1.1%) while current-year estimates increased to $6.48 per share from $6.44 (up 0.6%). With positive estimate revisions, investor sentiments appear to be more bullish on Juniper than Harris with respect to current-quarter estimates but fairly balanced for current-year estimates.GuidanceJuniper anticipates recording sequential growth in the second quarter with margin improvement, driven by steady demand patterns, higher volumes and cost structure efficiencies. The company expects revenues of approximately $1,175 million (+/- $30 million) for second-quarter 2018. Non-GAAP gross margin is projected to be around 59% (+/- 1%). The company expects non-GAAP operating margin of 17.5%. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be 44 cents per share (+/- 3 cents).Harris tweaked its projection for fiscal 2018 owing to impressive performance in the fiscal third quarter. It expects fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share in the band of $6.45-$6.50, up from prior expectations of $6.30-$6.50. Fiscal 2018 revenues are expected to be approximately $6.14 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 4% from the earlier expectations of $6.08-6.14 billion. The company also anticipates adjusted free cash flow between $900 million to $925 million, up from the previous guidance of approximately $900 million.Zacks RankBoth Juniper and Harris currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

168,HRS,"The telecommunications industry is witnessing rapid technological improvement. Unprecedented growth in high-speed mobile Internet traffic, particularly with respect to wireless data and video, has transformed this industry into the most evolving, inventive and keenly contested space.A growing economy speeds up the demand for real-time voice, data and video manifold. The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans. The rising demand for technologically superior products has been a silver lining for the telecommunication industry in an otherwise tough environment. This in turn has given a boost to the demand for telecom infrastructure developers, particularly wireless equipment manufacturers.Wireless Is the KeyWireless networks are key to the growth of the overall telecom industry. Wireless network standards are continuously evolving worldwide in order to provide faster speed. Long-Term Evolution (LTE), the most sought after super-fast (4G) wireless communications technology, is gaining rapid momentum. Following significant deployment of 4G LTE networks, LTE-A (Long-Term Evolution Advanced) wireless networks are gradually finding a solid foothold.Per a report by research firm iGR, U.S. telecom operators will spend around $104 billion during 2015 - 2025 to upgrade their existing 4G networks to the upcoming 5G standards and thereafter, execute full installation of 5G wireless services. This bodes well for wireless equipment manufacturers with enormous opportunity to grow.We expect wireless networks to provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry. In this regard, Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to emerge the numero uno factor for future growth in the space. According to a report by research firm International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide spending on IoT will grow at 19.2% compound annual growth rate to nearly $1.7 trillion in 2020 from $698.6 billion in 2015. Exponential growth of Internet-connected devices will be a major boom for wireless equipment manufacturers.Massive Spectrum Deployment by CarriersAs wireless networks run on radio frequency, spectrums (airwaves) have become the most sought-after commodity in the industry. T-Mobile US has aggressively started deploying 600 MHz low-band airwaves. In 2018, AT&T will deploy 60 MHz of fallow spectrum and 600 MHz low-band spectrum coupled with its ongoing network densification project.Comcast, the new entrant in the wireless field, acquired 73 licenses in the band of 600 MHz auctioned by the FCC. We believe that in the future Comcast will deploy this spectrum for extensive wireless coverage.The market for U.S. public safety network for first responders and civil protection services is becoming intensely competitive. AT&T will install its FirstNet project to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to the country’s police, firefighters and emergency medical services.The company is expected to spend around $40 billion over the life of the contract to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network. Moreover, Verizon has announced plans of dedicating network capacity to emergency services providers. The company will make Band 14 devices available and ensure full interoperability with any Band 14 radio access networks (RANs) deployed by FirstNet.Strong Growth of Service Provider RoutersMassive growth in mobile device usage has heightened transportation of data traffic substantially. In order to manage this burgeoning demand for photo, video and online data services, telecom operators are required to install more routers to ensure smooth transfer of data packets.Routers are telecom infrastructure devices used to deliver data packets from one network to another. These are located at gateways, places where two or more networks connect. Per the IDC estimate, in 2017, the aggregate market size of the service provider router and carrier Ethernet switch will surpass the 2016 figure of over $13 billion.The success is primarily attributed to strong demand from cloud service providers and the digital transformation imperative. In the United States, the majority of demand for service provider router and carrier Ethernet switch are from large cloud service operators like Amazon Web Services of Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Azure of Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.Our Top PickThe U.S. wireless equipment industry has lately emerged as an intensely contested space where success thrives largely on technical superiority, quality of services and scalability. In order to stay abreast of competition, existing players need to be constantly on their toes, introducing innovative products to gain from the industry’s growing momentum.At this stage, we believe investors should choose stocks which promise strong near-term growth and carry a favorable Zacks Rank. Taking into account these factors, we present four such stocks for investors to consider:Sonus Networks Inc. : Headquartered in Westford, MA, Sonus Networks is a leading provider of voice infrastructure products for the new public network. Sonus' solutions enable service providers to deploy an integrated network capable of carrying both voice and data traffic, and to deliver a range of innovative, new services.Sonus has long-term (three-five years) earnings per share (EPS) growth estimate of 12%. The company currently holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Comtech Telecommunications Corp.

The company sells products to a diverse customer base in the global commercial and government communications markets.Comtech has long-term (three-five years) EPS growth estimate of 5% and a dividend yield of 2.04%.The company currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Harris Corp. (HRS  -  Free Report): Based in Melbourne, FL, Harris has evolved from being a diversified electronics company to one that is focused on communications.The company is a global provider of communications equipment and services to government and commercial customers in more than 150 countries. Major operational areas are network broadcasting, network test and management equipment and software; mobile radio networks; and air traffic control systems.Harris has long-term (three-five years) EPS growth estimate of 7% and a dividend yield of 1.64%. The company holds a Zacks Rank #2.Motorola Solutions Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report): Based in Schaumburg, IL, Motorola Solutions is a leading communications equipment manufacturer, and has strong market positions in bar code scanning, wireless infrastructure gear and government communications.Motorola Solutions has long-term (three-five years) EPS growth estimate of 4.4% and a dividend yield of 2.06%. The company holds a Zacks Rank #2.Solid ChartsThe chart below shows that all the above-mentioned stocks have outperformed the industry year-to-date.Bottom LineTelecommunications is one of the few industries to have seen rapid technological improvement even during the recession. Owing to the significance of this service as an infrastructure product, we expect the overall economic dynamics to shift in favor of the industry. At this stage, we believe that these four stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are poised to capitalize on the growing opportunities.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

170,HRS,"Designed to provide broad exposure to the Industrials ETFs category of the U.S. equity market, the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Industrials ETF (RGI  -  Free Report) is a smart beta exchange traded fund launched on 11/01/2006.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency.There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.Non-cap weighted indexes try to choose stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, which is based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a mix of other such characteristics.While this space offers a number of choices to investors, including simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies, not all these strategies have been able to deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor & IndexBecause the fund has amassed over $307.48 M, this makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Industrials ETFs. RGI is managed by Invesco Powershares. RGI seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 Equal Weight Industrials Index before fees and expenses.This index is an unmanaged equal weighted version of the S&P 500 Industrials Index that consists of the common stocks of the following industries: aerospace & defense, building products, construction & engineering, electrical equipment, conglomerates, machinery; commercial services & supplies, air freight & logistics, airlines, marine, road & rail transportation infrastructure.Cost & Other ExpensesExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.40% for this ETF, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.RGI's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.17%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Representing 100% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector.Taking into account individual holdings, Transdigm Group Inc (TDG  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.57% of the fund's total assets, followed by Ww Grainger Inc (GWW  -  Free Report) and Harris Corp (HRS  -  Free Report).RGI's top 10 holdings account for about 15.26% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskRGI has added roughly 0.21% so far this year, and as of 04/18/2018, is up about 18.09% in the last one year. In the past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $102.86 and $127.83.RGI has a beta of 1.09 and standard deviation of 14.80% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a medium choice in the space. With about 70 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesGuggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Industrials ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Industrials ETFs segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.Vanguard Industrials ETF (VIS  -  Free Report) tracks MSCI US Investable Market Industrials 25/50 Index and the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI  -  Free Report) tracks Industrial Select Sector Index. Vanguard Industrials ETF has $3.80 B in assets, Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund has $12.79 B. VIS has an expense ratio of 0.10% and XLI charges 0.13%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Industrials ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

171,HRS,"Nokia Corporation (NOK  -  Free Report) has decided to cut 353 jobs in its home market Finland this year due to a weak global network market. The strategic step is part of the company’s global cost-savings initiative. The retrenchment tally has, however, decreased from the company's initial plan to reduce up to 425 jobs.    Of 353 jobs scheduled to be trimmed, 283 will be cut from the company's mainstay networks business and 70 from the Technologies unit, which includes its licensing operations and digital health business. The company plans to save 1.2 billion euros (or $1.5 billion) annually following its 2016 acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent, and a weak network equipment market.  The company had reported strong fourth-quarter 2017 results, supported by growth and solid performance in Networks business and record net sales in Nokia Technologies.

The division is expected to grow faster than the primary addressable market over the long term. Further, the acquisition of Unium, completed in March 2018, is expected to have positive impact on Nokia’s results.Over the last three months, Nokia’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry with an average return of 13.3% against a decline of 5.4% for the latter.        Nokia carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Ericsson will provide a superior network performance and experience to Melita’s subscribers.Melita will leverage Ericsson’s flagship solution, the Ericsson Radio System (ERS). Ericsson will also help modernize and expand the virtual Evolved Packet Core. These features will offer Melita the flexibility required to meet the expanding demand for new 5G and IoT use cases.Earlier this week, Ericsson joined forces with Vertiv and NorthStar to drive cost-effective and sustainable network evolution toward 5G, within the Ericsson Radio Site System. The partnership will merge Vertiv's faculties in power, thermal and infrastructure site management solutions with NorthStar's leadership in battery as well as energy storage solutions and incorporate it into the Ericsson Radio Site System.ERS leverages a multi-standard, multi-band and multi-layer architecture to help mobile operators transform their radio networks. The system delivers industry-leading performance on the smallest site footprint with the least energy consumption.ERS supports 5G New Radio capability and enables quick and smooth migration to 5G in existing bands, in addition to rapid coverage expansion of such services for operators.In spite of solid offerings, Ericsson is witnessing negative industry trends and adverse business mix in mobile broadband. Particularly, uncertainty in the financial markets, reduced consumer telecom spending and delayed auctions of spectrums pose significant threats for the company.Operators have been cautious in making new investments, especially in the emerging markets, which has affected the company’s revenues and profits. Further, Europe and Latin America — the markets with the biggest impact — are expected to witness an increasingly challenging investment environment.Ericsson Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ericsson Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ericsson QuoteAs far as earnings performance is concerned, Ericsson has had a dismal earnings surprise history over the trailing four quarters, missing estimates terribly all through. The company has lagged estimates by a whopping 552.5% on an average.Ericsson’s earnings estimates have moved south in the past couple of months, indicating analyst’s bearish sentiment for the stock. For 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has been revised downward from 17 cents to 3 cents over the past 60 days, driven by three downward estimate revisions versus just one upward.Over the past year, the company’s shares have lost 1.6%, underperforming the industry's average gain of 5.9%.Nevertheless, Ericsson expects to stabilize its operations amid a difficult market in 2018. CEO Ekholm’s restructuring plan will streamline the company’s focus areas, improve profitability and revitalize its technology as well as market leadership.It is to be seen whether these steps will help Ericsson to get back on the growth track. Right now, we are apprehensive over the impact of the restructuring and tough market conditions on the company’s profits and share price in the near term.We have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) on the stock, at present. Investors who are looking for exposure to the upcoming 5G upgrade cycle or IoT might look at players like Nokia Corp. (NOK  -  Free Report) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report).Stock to ConsiderA better-ranked stock in the same space is Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report), holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Harris Corporation has a decent earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 6.7%, driven by three earnings beats over the trailing four quarters.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

173,HRS,"Windstream Holdings Inc. (WIN  -  Free Report) is seeking diversification from legacy telecom services to more business, enterprise, and wholesale opportunities. The company is also realigning its wireless network toward a software-centric model to meet increasing business demands and customer needs. Despite such positives, this leading rural local exchange carrier in the United States continues to suffer from losses in its wholesale business.Let’s take a sneak peek into the company’s performance.What’s Going in its Favor?Windstream is seeking diversification from legacy telecom services to more business, enterprise and wholesale opportunities. To meet this end, Windstream has made a significant financial investment to upgrade the company’s network and product portfolio, including significant advances in software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) capabilities and a new Cloud Core architecture. Additionally, the acquisitions of EarthLink and Broadview have also played a major role in boosting the company’s SD-WAN and cloud suite. Windstream has also inked a deal to acquire privately-held, New York-based competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) — MassComm, Inc.  The company is trying to reduce dependency on consumer-based revenues and become a business and broadband-focused company while serving mainly rural consumers.Windstream is also realigning its wireless network toward a software-centric model to meet increasing business demands and customer needs. The company is transforming its product portfolio and network in an attempt to enhance customer experience. Windstream did not reveal the contribution of SD-WAN to its total revenues. However, in December 2017, it announced 500 mid-sized enterprise market customers for SD-WAN.The company aims to focus on four aspects - providing cloud connectivity, elevating customer experience, enabling employee collaboration and enhancing security and compliance.We appreciate Windstream’s focus on improving sales, cutting costs and pricing initiatives, which are expected to boost profitability and check churn. Investments made in data center and fiber expansion will give impetus to revenue growth in the coming quarters. Expansion of its metro fiber network business in newer areas and its aim to extend the deployment of G.fast technologies over traditional copper telephone wires bode well. Windstream is also focusing on optimizing its last mile network and in turn cut costs.Estimate Revisions, Zacks Rank & Style ScoreCurrent quarter sales and earnings per share (EPS) for Windstream are projected to rise 7.1% and 10.1%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The upward estimate revisions reflect optimism over the prospects of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Additionally, the stock has an attractive VGM Score of B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Downsides Over the past three months, Windstream has not performed well.  The stock price has declined 12.1% compared with the industry’s decline of 12.6% in the said time frame. Windstream has been losing access lines, thanks to pricing pressure and fierce competition. The company is under pressure due to losses in the wholesale business. Being a local exchange carrier, Windstream is exposed to stringent regulatory measures by the Federal Communications Commission as well as state regulations.Further, continuous investments in technology and network upgrades may dent the company’s earnings. Outdated network equipment has been the primary reason for discontinuation of the DSL (digital subscriber line) service in CLEC (competitive local exchange carrier) territories across 25 states.Despite management’s efforts to modify the company’s financial profile, we are concerned about Windstream’s highly leveraged balance sheet.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Computer and Technology sector include United States Cellular (USM  -  Free Report), Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report) and Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report).

174,HRS,"Motorola Solutions Inc.’s (MSI  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.53 per share (excluding 28 cents from non-recurring items) surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40. Also, the bottom line improved 11.7% from the year-ago figure. This improvement was owing to an increase in sales driven by the strong performance of its land and mobile radio operations.Revenues increased 7.4% from the year-ago quarter to $1,645 million and also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,580.2 million.Markedly, the company is constantly looking to expand its operations. To this end, Motorola completed the acquisition of the privately held Kodiak Networks in August 2017, with the aim of broadening its software product portfolio. Operating margin (on an adjusted basis) in the third quarter of 2017 came in at 25.7% in the quarter compared with 25.8% in the year-ago quarter.Operating ResultsProduct segment revenues came in at $989 million in the reported quarter, up 7.5% on a year-over-year basis. Service revenues totaled to $656 million, up 7.2% year over year. The upside was driven by strong performance in the Americas region.Additionally, Motorola generated $270 million of cash from operations in the quarter, reflecting a substantial decrease from a year-ago. Free cash flow decreased 33.9% from the year-ago quarter to $185 million. Higher working capital requirement due to the implementation of a new ERP system contributed to the decline.In fact, the company exited the third quarter with $717 million in total cash & cash equivalents compared with $1,030 million at the end of 2016. Long-term debt was $4,423 million in the end of the quarter compared with $4,392 million at the end of 2016.Motorola Solutions, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Motorola Solutions, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Motorola Solutions, Inc. QuoteDividend HikedApart from announcing third-quarter results, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 11% to 52 cents a share (or $2.08 annually) from 47 cents (or $1.88 annually). The new dividend, which has been approved by the company’s board of directors, will be paid on Jan 12, 2017, to stockholders on record as of Dec 15.We believe that the raised dividend highlights Motorola’s commitment to create value for shareholders and underscores the company’s strong financial condition and bright prospects in the near term. Moreover, a look at past records reveals the company’s stable dividend payment history.Notably, this Schaumburg, IL-based company returned approximately $100 million to shareholders through buybacks and $76 million in dividends in the third quarter of 2017.OutlookMotorola anticipates revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 to improve around 3% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted earnings per share for the same period is projected between $2.00 and $2.05. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is pegged at $2.04.For 2017, Motorola now expects revenues to increase approximately 5% on a year-over-year basis (previous guidance had called for top-line growth in the band of 3% to 4%). Earnings (on an adjusted basis) are projected in the band of $5.35 to $5.40 per share (the earlier view had projected earnings in the range of $5.20 to $5.30 per share).

178,HRS,"In the last five trading days, telecom stocks flattered to deceive as the initial upturn was replaced by a persistent downturn for the most part of the past week as President Trump renewed fears of a fresh trade war with China.The on-again off-again trade war between the United States and China took a new turn when Trump imposed a fresh salvo of tariffs worth $50 billion on Chinese imports last week. This followed an immediate retaliation by China, which promised to impose 25% tariffs on 545 categories of U.S. products worth $34 billion including soyabeans, beef, whiskey and off-road vehicles. China also threatened to impose $16 billion worth of additional tariffs in subsequent stages, targeting U.S. energy exports such as coal and crude oil.Meanwhile, the Senate dealt a body blow to Trump when it defied his decision and voted to overrule the administration’s deal with ZTE. With a unanimous majority of 85-10 votes, the Senate nullified the ZTE settlement plans, which included a $1.4 billion penalty and overhaul of its leadership among other conditions, and proposed an outright ban on the government buying products and services from it. Although Trump could use his veto powers to prevail over this decision, the contentious issue could further strain the relations between the United States and China.      Regarding company-specific news, technology collaborations, acquisitions and investments for clean energy ruled the roost over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    According to a Bloomberg report, the South China Morning Post has claimed that regulators of China have approved Qualcomm Incorporated’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) $43 billion deal to acquire NXP Semiconductors N.V.China was the only nation opposing the buyout deal on issues relating to antitrust concerns.

Total earnings for these companies are up 25.1% year over year on 10% higher revenues, with 76.8% beating earnings estimates and 73.8% surpassing top-line expectations.

183,HRS,"Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 31, before the market opens.In the last quarter, the company posted in-line earnings per share. Notably, Harris Corporation has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of approximately 3%.The scenario appears to be rosy for Harris Corporation in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as well. Its strong product portfolio is likely to boost results. In fact, the positive sentiment surrounding this Melbourne, FL- based company ahead of its earnings release can be gauged from the fact that the stock has witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal first-quarter earnings being revised 1.5% upward over the last 60 days.Also, the stock has moved north in the last six months outperforming the Zacks Wireless- Equipment industry in the period. Shares of Harris rallied 21.4%, as against the industry’s loss of 3%. The possibility of greater military spending by the United States, owing to tensions with North Korea has boosted the stock.Lets delve deep to find out the factors likely to have a bearing on Harris Corporation’s fiscal first-quarter results.We expect the company’s Communication Systems unit to perform well in the to-be-reported quarter. Increased sales of legacy international tactical radios and operational efficiencies should buoy segmental results.The Electronic Systems unit is also anticipated to perform well driven by the strength in strength in electronic warfare, among others.  Of late, the company has also won multiple contracts, which is likely to boost the top line further in the quarter.Additionally, Harris Corporation announced a 8% dividend hike in the fiscal first quarter. We believe that the dividend hike not only indicates the company's commitment to create value for shareholders but also underlines its confidence regarding growth.Markedly, the company’s efforts to reduce its debt levels also raise optimism in the stock. We expect an update on the issue on the fiscal first-quarter conference call.On the flip side, the company’s Space and Intelligence Systems unit is anticipated to perform poorly in the quarter. Lower revenues from environmental and space programs might weigh on the segmental results as well.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too shows that Harris Corporation is likely to beat earnings in the soon-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise.Zacks ESP: Harris Corporation has an Earnings ESP of +0.50% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a penny above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Harris Corporation carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHarris Corporation is not the only company in the broader Computer and Technology sector that islooking up this earnings season. Here are some companies from the same space, which according to our model also have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:AMTEK, Inc. (AME  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.18% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3. The company will report third-quarter earnings numbers on Nov 2.Arrow Electronics, Inc.

185,HRS,"Nokia Corporation’s (NOK  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings (non-IFRS) per share of €0.09 (approximately 11 cents) surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents. In the year-ago period, the company had reported earnings of €0.04 (5 cents) per share.Net sales declined year over year to €5.5 billion (approximately $6.5 billion). However, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.41 billion but fell short of the year-ago figure of approximately $6.57 billion. This was because revenues were hurt by the Nokia Networks’ disappointing performance. Weakness in the Ultra Broadband Networks’ subgroup contributed to the soft results posted by Nokia’s flagship division.Quarterly adjusted gross margin was 42.7% in the reported quarter compared with 40% a year ago. Operating margin increased 280 basis points (bps) to 12.1% on a year-over-year basis. Markedly, strong performance in the Nokia Technologies division led to the upsurge.Segmental RevenuesIn the Nokia Networks segment, total revenue was approximately €4,823 million (around $5,667 million), down 9% year over year. The division includes three reportable sub-units - Ultra Broadband Networks (which includes Mobile Networks and Fixed Networks operations), Global Services and IP Networks and Applications (which includes the IP/Optical Networks and Applications & Analytics operations).In fact, net sales declined in all regions, apart from Asia Pacific (2%) and Middle East and Africa (2%), which led to the segment’s below-par performance. The same decreased by 10% in Latin America, 16% in North America, 20% in Greater China and 7% in Europe.However, segmental gross margin improved 110 bps to 38.6% in the reported quarter on the back of impressive operational discipline. Quarterly operating margin was 6.9% compared with 8.2% a year ago. Meanwhile, segmental operating margin was hurt by the below-par performance of the Ultra Broadband Networks sub-group.Notably, the decline in the net sales of the Ultra Broadband Networks’ sub-group by 17% to €2,099 million (around $2,466 million) hurt sales of the Nokia Networks segment. Also, the Global Services sub-group registered a 2% decline in net sales to €1,359 million (around $1,597 million) primarily due to weakness in the communication service provider market. Net sales in the IP Networks and Applications sub-group declined 4% year over year to €1,365 million (around $1,604 million).The Nokia Technologies segment’s quarterly total revenue was €483 million (approximately $567 million), up 37% year over year. Segmental gross margin was 97.9% compared with 96.6% in the year-ago quarter. Operating margin expanded significantly to 80.7%. Segmental results were aided by Nokia’s licencing agreement with LG Electronics. We remind investors that Nokia had received an upfront cash payment from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) in the second quarter of 2017 following Nokia’s licensing and business partnership deal with the latter in May 2017.In Group Common and Other segment, net sales decreased 15% to €251 million (approximately $295 million). Segmental gross margin was 12.7%, down 140 basis points. In fact, this division incurred an operating loss in the quarter under review.Nokia Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Nokia Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nokia Corporation Quote Dividend HikeNokiaannounced an increase of approximately 11.8% in its dividend to €0.19 per share for 2017.

Segmental operating margin is still forecasted to be in 8% to 10% range.Furthermore, Nokia added that segmental results in the final quarter of 2017 are likely to be hurt primarily due to competition in the Chinese market.Key Releases Coming UpInvestors interested in the Computer and Technology sector will now look forward to the earnings reports of Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report) and Motorola Solutions (MSI  -  Free Report).

187,HRS,"Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 non-GAAP earnings of 55 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.However, earnings decreased 5.2% year over year primarily due to lower revenues, which fell 2.1% to $1.26 billion. The figure also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28 billion.The disappointing top-line growth can be attributed to weak performance in both Cloud and Telecom/Cable verticals.Cloud revenues declined 4% from the year-ago quarter and more than 9% sequentially to almost $345 million. Management cited spending delay by cloud and hyper-scale customers behind the decline. This factor is again expected to hurt top-line growth in the current quarter.Juniper stated that the ongoing transition by cloud customers from 10-gigabit to 40-gigabit and 100-gigabit was the primary cause behind low revenues. Moreover, architectural shift from scale-up architectures to scale-out architectures (lean core architectures, per Juniper) also hurt growth.Nevertheless, Juniper’s cloud customer base continues to expand. Of the top 10 customers, five were cloud while four were Telecom/Cable.Telecom/Cable revenues declined for the second consecutive quarter, when compared on a year-over-year basis. Revenues declined 3.8% to roughly $577 million, while sequentially, the figure increased 2.6%.Juniper also announced a workforce realignment program, which is expected to drive profitability.Juniper’s shares have lost 6.5% in after-hours trading.

The networking solutions provider witnessed year-over-year revenue decline in the Switching product category, which fell 4.4% to $212.6 million, primarily due to spending delay.However, QFX sales increased at double-digit rates, year over year and also on a sequential basis. Management stated that the cloud data center provider’s ongoing transition to 100-gigabit infrastructure drove growth.However, EX product line declined year over year and sequentially.Routing category revenues declined 5.5% to $585.8 million. PTX product line achieved record revenues in the reported quarter. Management noted that per the latest IHS Markit report, Juniper has achieved the #1 position in terms of market share in the North America core Routing market, for the first time.

Moreover, AppFormix’s customer base continues to expand across SaaS, enterprises and telecom operators.During the quarter, Juniper completed the acquisition of Cyphort, a leader in automated malware analysis and detection.Services revenues (30.9% of total revenue) climbed 8.7% to $388.1 million.

188,HRS,"Windstream Holdings Inc. (WIN  -  Free Report) completed the acquisition of MASS Communications for approximately $37.5 million in an all-cash transaction. The deal was initially announced toward the end of December 2017 in a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) filing.MASS Communications will now operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Windstream under its newly launched enterprise business — Windstream Enterprise. MASS Communications CEO, Darren Mass is now the president-resale of the company’s enterprise and wholesale business unit.Prior to being acquired, MASS Communications was a privately-held, New York-based competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC).

The company is transforming its product portfolio and network in an attempt to enhance customer experience.Windstream is seeking diversification from legacy telecom services to more business, enterprise and wholesale opportunities. To meet this end, Windstream has made a significant financial investment to upgrade the company’s network and product portfolio, including significant advances in software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) capabilities and a new Cloud Core architecture. Additionally, the acquisitions of EarthLink and Broadview have also played a major role in boosting the company’s SD-WAN and cloud suite. We expect Windstream’s SD-WAN opportunities to drive its top line and subscriber statistics in 2018.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Windstream is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

189,HRS,"Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) joined forces with Vertiv and NorthStar to drive cost-effective and sustainable network evolution toward 5G, within the Ericsson Radio Site System.The partnership will merge Vertiv's faculties in power, thermal and infrastructure site management solutions with NorthStar's leadership in battery and energy storage solutions and incorporate it into the Ericsson Radio Site System.The collaboration will build on the combined global supply and service delivery footprints and local sales support of the companies. Also, the speed and flexibility, distinctive product competence along with access to engineering strengths of the members will raise competitiveness as well as cost efficiency in the combined portfolio.The companies intend to establish a competitive ecosystem and management interface, which will boost the market share of the Enclosure and Power parts of Ericsson’s portfolio.The alliance aims to build equipment which will reduce energy consumption, increase the use of renewable and hybrid energy resources and lower carbon footprint. They will also optimize energy and climate systems to use the minimum required energy to power an electronic trusted environment for Ericsson Radio System products. This will deliver environmental as well as cost-efficiency benefits for service providers.In spite of solid offerings, Ericsson is witnessing negative industry trends and adverse business mix in mobile broadband. Particularly, uncertainty in the financial markets, reduced consumer telecom spending and delayed auctions of spectrums pose significant threats for Ericsson. Operators have been cautious in making new investments, especially in the emerging markets, which has affected the company’s revenues and profits. Further, Europe and Latin America — the markets with the biggest impact — are expected to witness an increasingly challenging investment environment.Ericsson Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ericsson Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ericsson QuoteAs far as earnings performance is concerned, Ericsson has had a dismal earnings surprise history over the trailing four quarters, missing estimates terribly all through. The company has lagged estimates by a whopping 552.5% on average.Ericsson’s earnings estimates have moved south in the past couple of months, indicating analyst’s bearish sentiment for the stock. For 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has been revised downward from 17 cents to 3 cents over the past 60 days, driven by three downward estimate revisions versus just one upward.Over the past year, the company’s shares have lost 3.3%, underperforming the industry's average gain of 4.7%. Nevertheless, Ericsson expects to stabilize its operations amid a difficult market in 2018. Ekholm’s restructuring plan will streamline the company’s focus areas, improve profitability and revitalize its technology and market leadership.It is to be seen whether these steps will help Ericsson to get back on the growth track. Right now, we are apprehensive over the impact of the restructuring and tough market conditions on the company’s profits and share price in the near term.We have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) on the stock, at present. Investors who are looking for exposure to the upcoming 5G upgrade cycle or IoT might look at players like Nokia Corporation (NOK  -  Free Report) and Cisco Systems, Inc.

190,HRS,"I know a favorite trade of mine has been to fade volatility after an unwarranted spike. The spike last night happened after North Korea fired a missile over Japan. I thought, at the very least, that increased volatility would be present until at least tomorrow afternoon. Right at the opening bell, volatility sellers entered the fray and dumped the VIX from near 14 to 11.67.My initial reaction to the buying was that the VIX fade happened too quickly. The market didn’t even get a chance to fully price in the risk before volatility quickly unwound. I smell Bank of Japan intervention as the USD/JPY pair increased dramatically from the start of trading today.

The company’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters.Catalysts Behind the UpsurgeOne of the majorfactor that played a pivotal role in driving the share price of Harris to a new 52-week high is the company’s latest announcement on dividend hike. The move indicates the company’s commitment to create value for shareholders and underlines confidence in business growth.The company raised quarterly dividend by 8% to 57 cents per share (or $2.28 annually) from 53 cents (or $2.12 annually). Approved by the company’s board of directors, this new payout will be made on Sep 22, 2017, to stockholders of record as on Sep 8. This is the 16th such annual dividend increase by the company.Meanwhile, William M. Brown, Chairman, President and CEO of the company, anticipates 2018 to be a year of growth and is hopeful about its long-term outlook. The company expects earnings per share (on an adjusted basis) for fiscal 2018 in the band of $5.85 to $6.05. Revenues for the same are projected in the range of $6.02-$6.14 billion. As investors prefer an income generating stock, a high dividend-yielding firm is much coveted. Investors are always on the lookout for companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments to put their money on. The dividend rise is likely to further improve the stock.Moreover, being a leading technology innovator, Harris has been consistently focusing on business innovation in a bid to deliver some of the best technology and products in the industry. Notably, the company had been selected by Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) to upgrade mission system avionics for the F-35 Lightning II as part of the technology.Zacks Rank & Key PicksHarris currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the Computer and Technology sector are InterDigital, Inc.

192,HRS,"Markets ended in positive territory on Friday after speeches from Janet Yellen and Mario Draghi, at Jackson Hole failed to throw light on the future of global monetary policy. Consequently, economists concluded that there rate hikes were unlikely in the near future. Encouraging comments from the U.S. and global economy from Yellen and Draghi, respectively, also boosted investor sentiment. In an interview on Friday, Gary Cohn the Chief Economic Advisor announced that Trump would start campaigning for tax reforms from next week in Missouri. This added to gains for the markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,813.67, gaining 0.1% or 30.27 points.

None of the speakers revealed any details about the future of monetary policy. While Yellen spoke mostly about economic improvements in the US, Draghi spoke about the global recovery gaining pace. Yellen also said that the overall economy has become much safer now. This boosted investor sentiment, leading to gains for the market.Yellen’s speech was closely observed by financial markets as investors were expecting her to throw some light on possible rate hikes and other monetary policy moves. Instead, she chose to focus on the history of the global crisis and the way policymakers have responded to subsequent challenges. ""The events of the crisis demanded action, needed reforms were implemented, and these reforms have made the system safer,"" Yellen said.Industry watchers found the speeches to be defensive and also said they expect no rate hikes in the near future as the dollar remains weak and the rate of inflation is well below the target rate of 2%. However, Yellen did hint at risks related to excessive optimism. Economists concluded from this statement that there may a rate hike was likely around December.Trump To Begin Campaigning For Tax Reforms Next WeekIn an interview to Financial Times, Chief Economic Advisor to President Trump, Gary Cohn said Trump would begin campaigning for tax reforms from next week. Trump’s campaign would begin next Wednesday in Missouri.""Starting next week, the president's agenda and calendar is going to revolve around tax reform,"" said Cohn in an interview. ""He will start being on the road making major addresses justifying the reasoning for tax reform and why we need it in the U.S.,"" he added.Tax reforms have been the linchpin for Trump’s agenda, supported by all the members of the GOP.  Cohn also said the administration does not have a detailed plan for tax reforms. Instead it plans to leave such matters to the concerned Congressional committee. However, the Trump administration wants Congress to include one-time corporate tax repatriation on overseas profits in any new legislation.Weekly ResultsFor the week, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, gained 0.6%, 0.7% and 0.8% respectively. As geopolitical tensions between Pyongyang and Washington subsided, investor sentiment was boosted, leading to gains for the market. Also, investors were reluctant to place large bets markets as they awaited results of the Jackson Hole Symposium to be known.Moreover, the cornerstone of Trump’s presidential campaign, tax reforms, finally gained momentum and the members of the GOP showed faith in the administration’s ability to push through such reforms. However, Trump’s threat to shutdown the government in case $1.6 million for a physical wall along the US-Mexico border was not approved weighed on the markets.Stocks That Made HeadlinesCBS Corp.

193,HRS,"After a lukewarm first half of 2017, most of the major telecommunications stocks have done well in the third quarter. The new U.S. telecom regulatory body, Federal Communications Commission (FCC), has given enough indications of its leniency compared with the Obama administration. The FCC is most likely to roll back a slew of stringent regulations of the previous regime. The FCC’s stance of being less restrictive will aid mergers and acquisitions, which are likely to spur growth in the rest of 2017.2 Major Future Drivers of Telecom IndustryUpcoming 5G Wireless Networks: According to a study commissioned by Qualcomm, fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology could result in real global economic growth by $3 trillion cumulatively from 2020 to 2035. A number of industry researchers are of the opinion that 5G network will provide a download speed of 1 Gbps (gigabit per second), which is 200 times the throughput of the currently available standard 4G LTE network.Internet of Things (IoT): Internet of Things, which enables any physical electronic device with a valid IP-address to transfer data seamlessly over a wireless network, is fast gaining market traction and bringing about fundamental changes in business models. Next-generation superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry. In this context, IoT holds the potential of being the numero uno factor in driving growth in the space. Upcoming 5G mobile networks will be of utmost importance in the management of exponential growth in IoT.Additionally, a major characteristic of the telecommunications industry is that it is immune to international geo-political disturbances even when these lead to economic fluctuations. A growing economy speeds up the demand for real-time voice, data, and video manifold. The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans. The rising demand for technologically superior products has been a silver lining for the telecom industry in an otherwise tough environment.Performance So FarPer the latest Zacks Earnings Trend report, 87 S&P 500 members (accounting for 24.7% of the index’s total membership) have reported third-quarter earnings results as of Oct 20. Total earnings for these companies are up 9.4% from the same period last year on 7.3% higher revenues, with 71.3% beating EPS estimates and 70.1% beating revenue estimates.The results thus far provide a positive and reassuring view of corporate earnings, which will most likely get strengthened and reconfirmed through the remainder of this reporting cycle. The above-average proportion of positive surprises that we saw in the preceding period has continued this earnings season as well. (Read: Three Takeaways from the Q3 Earnings Season)In the telecom sector, two major national telecom carriers, Verizon Communications and T-Mobile US, have reported strong results in third-quarter 2017. Both carriers have witnessed significant net addition of post-paid wireless subscribers with reduced churn rate.President Donald Trump’s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish. Major proposals like a pledge to spend $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years, overhaul of the tax structure to reduce tax burden and easy regulatory policies, are likely to spur higher consumer spending that may create about 25 million new jobs over a decade. This in turn will fuel long-term economic growth.How to Make a Selection?With the existence of a number of industry players, finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat earnings estimates could appear a difficult task, however, our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple for you. One way to narrow down the list of choices during the earnings season is to look at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Our ChoicesRelying on the above methodology, we have zeroed in on seven telecom stocks that are likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this earnings season.Sonus Networks Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +16.28% and sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank  stocks here. The company is scheduled to report results on Oct 30. It has an average positive earnings surprise of a massive 55.46% in the last four quarters.Harris Corp. (HRS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.50% and sports a Zacks Rank #1. The company is scheduled to report results on Oct 31.

It has an average positive earnings surprise of 7.77% in the last four quarters and a long-term (three-five years) earnings growth rate of 9.50%.Bottom LineChallenges in the form of competitive product introduction and cut-throat pricing pressure will persist in the telecom sector. However, a number of companies in the space have fared well. Picking some outperformers from the space, backed by a solid Zacks Rank and a positive Earnings ESP, could lead investors to gain this earnings season.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

200,HRS,"Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 1, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.34%. Also, its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters with an average beat of 3.16%.Let’s see, how things shape up for this announcement.Factors Likely at PlayThe fact that Harris is a highly leveraged company might hurt results in the fourth quarter. The Communication Systems segment’s disappointing performance in the previous quarter is likely to continue in the reported quarter as well.Though positive on the company’s growth on the back of acquisition strategy, we note that all buyouts have integration risks associated with them. Failure to successfully integrate the newly acquired companies into its own business model may result in trouble for Harris. This might further affect results in the quarter to be reported. Also, weakness in international markets might lead to lower-than-expected sales of tactical radio products.However, the company’s efforts to reward shareholders are encouraging. In Apr 2017, the company’s board announced a quarterly cash dividend of 53 cents per share. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Harris is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Harris has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.49 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Harris has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

201,HRS,"Nokia Corporation’s (NOK  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings per share of €0.08 (approximately 9 cents) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 4 cents. In the year-ago period, the company had reported earnings of €0.03 (4 cents) per share.Net sales declined year over year (on a comparable combined company basis) to €5.6 billion (approximately $6.18 billion). The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.98 billion but fell short of the year-ago figure of approximately $6.31 billion. This was because revenues were hurt by the Nokia Networks’ disappointing performance. Also, weakness in the Ultra Broadband Networks subgroup contributed to the soft results posted by Nokia’s flagship division.Quarterly adjusted gross margin was 41.7% in the reported quarter compared with 38.9% a year ago. Operating margin increased 430 basis points (bps) to 10.2% on a year-over-year basis.In fact, at quarter-end, Nokia’s net cash from operating activities was €1,309 million against - €616 million at the end of the year-ago quarter.Segmental RevenuesIn the Nokia Networks segment, total revenue was approximately €4,971 million (around $5,467 million), down 5% year over year. The division includes three reportable sub-units like Ultra Broadband Networks (which includes Mobile Networks and Fixed Networks operations), Global Services (which includes the Global Services business group) and IP Networks and Applications (which includes the IP/Optical Networks and Applications & Analytics operations). Notably, the decline in the Ultra Broadband Networks’ sub-group by 8% to €2,165 million hurt the segmental sales.In fact, net sales declined in all regions, apart from Asia Pacific (5%) and Middle East and Africa (5%), which led to the segment’s below-par performance. The same declined by 16% in Latin America, 7% each in North America and Greater China, and 10% in Europe.However, segmental gross margin improved 150 bps to 39.1% in the reported quarter. Also, quarterly operating margin was 8.2% compared with 6% a year ago.The Nokia Technologies segment’s quarterly total revenue was €369 million (approximately $406 million), up 90% year over year. Segmental gross margin was 95.4% compared with 96.4% in the year-ago quarter. Operating margin expanded significantly to 62.3%.Segmental results were aided by Nokia’s licensing and business partnership deal with Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report). Following the deal, Nokia received an upfront cash payment from Apple in the reported quarter.In Group Common and Other segment, net sales increased 14% to €307 million (approximately $338 million). Segmental gross margin was 17.6%, down 170 basis points. In fact, this division incurred an operating loss in the quarter under review.Nokia Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Nokia Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nokia Corporation QuoteOutlookNokia officially took control of rival Alcatel-Lucent in Jan 2016, and continues to expect annual cost savings of €1.2 billion in full-year 2018, excluding Nokia Technologies.For 2017, capital expenditure outlook for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is approximately €500 million. Non-IFRS tax rate is now expected in the range of 25% to 30% in 2017 (old guidance: 30% to 35%). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The company anticipates net sales in its primary networks division to decline in 2017, which is in line with the primary addressable market. However, the market conditions are expected to be more challenging than expected earlier.Consequently, the primary addressable market for Nokia’s main unit is now expected to decline in the band of 3% to 5% as opposed to the earlier projection of a fall in the low-single digits.

202,HRS,"Shares of United States Cellular Corporation (USM  -  Free Report) have gained 14.5% in the past six months, significantly outperforming its industry’s decline of 8.4%. U.S. Cellular is the wireless subsidiary of Telephone & Data Systems Inc. (TDS  -  Free Report).  Catalysts Behind the UpsurgeLast month, U.S. Cellular reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues for fourth-quarter 2017. The metrics also improved on a year-over-year (y/y) basis. Growth was witnessed across all segments. Moreover, in the reported quarter, U.S. Cellular enjoyed a benefit of $269 million, due to the new tax law.Further, the results were aided by an impressive number of subscriber addition and churn management. The company exited the reported quarter with a subscriber base of 5,096,000 (up 1.3% y/y) which includes 4,518,000 postpaid subscribers (up 0.8% y/y) and 519,000 prepaid subscribers (up 7.2% y/y).  As of December 2017, postpaid ARPU (average revenue per user) decreased to $44.12 from $45.19 at the end of 2016. Postpaid churn declined to 1.27% from 1.41% registered at the end of 2016. Prepaid churn decreased to 5.09% in the reported quarter from 5.44% at 2016-end.We believe the company succeeded in adding subscribers and churn management on the back of strategic moves like introduction of a new billing system, continuous rollout of 4G LTE, enhancement of LTE handsets, completion of various spectrum transactions and monetization of non-strategic assets. The company’s focus on improving cost and profitability by managing data delivery cost also bode well.Additionally, the growing demand for smartphones, which enjoy significant market penetration, acted as a tailwind. Meanwhile, U.S. Cellular is gearing up for 5G wireless network deployment. It has completed joint testing of various 5G use cases at 28GHz in partnership with Ericsson. U.S. Cellular has teamed up with Nokia to enhance the wireless experience for business customers. The company is also focused on various cost-cutting initiatives.Estimate Revisions & Zacks RankOver the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings for current quarter has soared 162.5% to 21 cents per share.

203,HRS,"Shares of Altice USA, Inc. (ATUS  -  Free Report) have lost 28% in the past six months, significantly underperforming its industry’s gain of 2.8%.  Reasons Behind the Price PlungeAltice USA operates in a highly competitive industry against a variety of broadband communications companies, wireless data, pay television and telephony providers and video content providers. This is a matter of concern as such a market is highly dependent on consumer choices. Consumers’ selection of an alternate source of service, due to economic constraints, technological advances or preference, are hurting the demand for the company’s services.Further, higher programming costs and other operating expenses are likely to affect margins going forward. Altice USA’s programming costs increased 4.7% year over year in fourth-quarter 2017, primarily due to an increase in contractual programming rates, partially offset by a decrease in video customers.Moreover, since the acquisitions of Suddenlink and Optimum, Altice USA has renewed its programming contracts, which represents more than 70% of its annual programming expense. In the reported quarter, Optimum’s programming costs increased 3.3% to $476 million and Suddenlink’s programming costs increased 8.8% to $160 million, both on a year-over-year basis. We continue to expect programming costs per customer to increase in the upcoming quarters.Other Bearish ReadingsROC and ROEReturn on Capital (ROC) of Altice USA is 0.1% compared with 4.7% for the industry. This implies that the company generates a lower return on investment than its industry.Return on Equity (ROE) is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. Altice USA’s trailing 12-month ROE undercuts its growth potential. The stock’s current ROE stands at 0.3% compared with the industry’s ROE of 9.5%.Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company. To this end, Altice USA seems to be a highly leveraged stock with a reading of 388.4% compared with 109.5% for the industry.Furthermore, the stock has a VGM Score of C, which dampens its appeal. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAltice USA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
