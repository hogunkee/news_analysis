0,DVA,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH), the nation's largest health insurer, reported fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday that comfortably topped analyst estimates.X Estimates: Profit of $2.50 a share, up 18.5% from a year ago, on revenue growth of 8.4% to $51.5 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: EPS of $2.59, up 23%, on revenue of $52.1 billion, growing 9.5% from a year ago.Outlook: UnitedHealth offered guidance that was updated for GOP tax legislation, projecting EPS in range of $12.30 to $12.60 per share. The current analyst consensus was $11.37.Stock: Shares of UnitedHealth, which doubled the S&P 500's gain in 2017, closed up 1.9% at 232.90, clearing a flat base buy point at 231.87, on the stock market today.However, the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging in recent weeks. But on Tuesday, the Dow industrials component swung higher while the Dow reversed sharply lower after topping 26,000 for the first time.IBD'S TAKE: UnitedHealth is ranked No. 2 by IBD in the Medical-Managed Care industry group, based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see how other insurers stack up. The Medical-Managed Care group is ranked No. 81 of 197 industry groups based on stock performance. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.UnitedHealth has been the envy of the industry, as it expanded beyond managed care into prescription benefit management, health services and technology consulting via its Optum unit, becoming a leader in every category.UnitedHealth agreed in December to buy the medical unit of DaVita (DVA) unit for $4.9 billion, its fourth notable deal of 2017.Although the pending merger between CVS Health (CVS) and Aetna (AET) is often said to be a response to the looming threat from Amazon.com (AMZN) to enter the retail prescription drug business, analysts say CVS is really aiming to follow, as well as adapt, UnitedHealth's model for success. UnitedHealth management has expressed openness to a partnership with Amazon.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:These 4 Top Tech Stocks With Strong RS Lines Hit Buy PointsCitigroup Flirts With Breakout On Strong Earnings, But Chart Shows This FlawStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksHow To Find The Best Stocks Before They Break Out

1,DVA,"Despite its name and a big 41% weighting in tech stocks, AllianzGI Focused Growth Fund (PGWAX) does not aim to focus assets in any one sector. Its tech stock stake at its last count on Oct. 31 came by way of  stock-by-stock analysis at the $1.1 billion fund.X Focused Growth's next biggest sector weighting was 16% in consumer cyclical stocks. The concentration has worked well for the fund's investors. In the past year going into Thursday, the fund gained 33.11%, topping 78% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar. It outperformed 82% of its peers over the past three years with a 15.31% average annual gain. The S&P 500 averaged 23.57% and 12.70% in those time spans.The fund aims for long-term price gains by seeking stocks of what lead fund manager Karen Hiatt calls high-quality companies that she and co-manager Raphael Edelman believe can sustain growth and post earnings surprises as well as generate attractive cash flows. ""We look for companies with strong management, that have a track record of building shareholder value and delivering strong free cash flow,"" Hiatt said.To achieve that, Hiatt and Edelman invest in only their best ideas. The portfolio held just 39 stocks as of Nov. 30. The managers also focus on managing risk. One way they do that is by aiming to buy stocks they like when they are reasonably priced.The fund's focus on its managers' best ideas is reflected in the relatively big weightings for the fund's top positions. Top holdings Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Visa (V) each account for more than 5% of fund assets.Apple is up 46% in the past 12 months and FANG stocks Facebook and Amazon are up 51% and 58%. UnitedHealth is up 39% and Visa is up 46%.""The data points around Apple have been noisy recently,"" Hiatt said. ""But we think that's just from investors' fine-tuning their expectations of the run rate of the new iPhone X.""Also, she calls Apple attractively valued since its forward 12-month price-earnings multiple is trading at about a 25% discount to the S&P 500's.In addition, she says Apple should benefit from the recently enacted tax bill. It will get a lower tax rate, freedom to repatriate its overseas cash cache and more leeway in using that cash.IBD's TAKE: Tax reform should let Apple bring some of its $250 billion overseas money home at a tax rate of 15.5% vs. the old 35% rate. That could make billions of dollars available for stock buybacks, IBD has reported.With Facebook, Hiatt sees a chance of earnings declining as the company continues to invest in itself. But she likes the company's long-term outlook as Facebook finds news ways to monetize assets and as the number of users increases and advertising growth remains strong.Hiatt also sees Amazon's spending as an investment in its own future. Amazon's internal investments have tended to pay off in terms of market share gains, she says. Amazon's investments in its Prime program, for example, is paying off in the form of increased user spending. And Amazon's takeover of Whole Foods Market helps Amazon ""get closer to the customer, (capture) a high income customer base with relatively low merchandise overlap and gaining insights into fresh food distribution,"" she said.She especially likes Amazon's trends outside the U.S., where its revenue last quarter was more than $1 billion higher than expected. ""Add Prime penetration, Amazon's increased capability in video and in groceries, in India, in health care,"" she said. ""There's so much optionality that Amazon's moat grows deeper and wider.""Outside the technology sector, Hiatt likes prospects for UnitedHealth, one of the largest managed care companies. ""What's most exciting is its Optum business,"" she said.Optum provides pharmacy benefits management and technology services and also runs clinics and doctors' offices. ""This unit has significant amounts of data, which gives UnitedHealth a competitive advantage in being able to leverage that data to provide lower costs throughout its supply chain and lower costs to customers,"" she said. ""So it's an area of significant growth.""Hiatt also likes UnitedHealth's acquisition of dialysis center DaVita's (DVA) medical unit, its fourth big takeover since the start of 2017.And Visa benefits from refashioning the company's Visa Europe business, which it acquired in 2016. ""Visa Europe had been run like a co-op,"" Hiatt said. ""They've turned it into a profit-focused business, with a lot of upside.""Visa also gains from the shift to digital payments for transactions. ""They are a toll taker for global spending,"" Hiatt said. ""It's a really scalable business. There isn't much that they have to do for each incremental dollar they bring in.""RELATED:2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains, With A Foreign Tilt

2,DVA,"UnitedHealth (UNH) announced Wednesday that it would buy dialysis center DaVita's (DVA) medical unit for $4.9 billion in cash in the insurer's fourth major deal this year.X Under the deal, DaVita will join United's Optum Care unit that manages outpatient medical care. In January, UnitedHealth brought Surgical Care Affiliates, a chain of outpatient surgery centers, for $2.3 billion.""The combination of DaVita Medical Group and Optum should lead to even higher levels of performance,"" DaVita CEO Kent Thiry said.But the medical group has been the weaker spot in DaVita's recent earnings reports.UnitedHealth shares fell 12 cents to 219.97 on the stock market today. DaVita soared 13.6% to 69.20 as management plans to use proceeds from the sale for share repurchases.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The UnitedHealth deal comes after CVS Health (CVS) announced Sunday that it would buy Aetna (AET) for $60 billion, which could spark increased scrutiny of health insurer and medical mergers.RELATED:Top Merger Activity For Companies Not Named CVS Or AetnaStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

United Airlines (UAL) also raised its unit revenue outlook and announced a $3 billion buyback.

The after-hours report also showed net bookings rose during the quarter to $577 million, vs. expectations for $510 million, on the success of its ""Grand Theft Auto"" and ""NBA 2K18"" games. The gap up gain marked a rebound from support at the stock's 10-week moving average, but it is not a buy opportunity because shares are extended above a late-stage base.In the beaten-down fiber-optic telecom gear group, Applied OptoElectronics (AAOI) leapt 6% the open. The Sugar Land, Texas-based outfit report a 184% gain in per-share earnings and a 27% rise in sales.

5,DVA,"The U.S. economy added 235,000 jobs in February, as the jobless rate held dipped to 4.7%, and annual wage gains neared cycle highs, the Labor Department reported on Friday.Wall Street economists expected a 200,000 job gain and a 4.7% unemployment rate.Average hourly wages rose 2.8% vs. a year earlier, just below the best rise of the recovery. The 0.2% monthly rise was less than expected, but January's wage gain was revised slightly higher.December and January job gains were revised up a combined 9,000.February is the first full month under President Trump, who hailed the jobs report.Financial markets were bracing for an upside surprise after payroll processor ADP's monthly employment report showed that the private sector added 298,000 jobs last month, 108,000 more than expected and the biggest gain in nearly three years.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite opened with solid gains on the stock market today, but they largely erased that early advance by the afternoon. The major averages have drifted lower this week as oil prices tumbled and the Fed's March 14-15 meeting looms, though stocks did edge higher Thursday.Outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas said on Thursday that announced corporate layoffs in the first two months of the year were down 40% from a year earlier, while corporate hiring plans exploded, led by Amazon (AMZN), which said it will hire 100,000 full-time workers by mid-2018 as it builds out its distribution network. Retailers also have been the biggest job cutters, announcing 34,000 layoffs this year, thanks in no small part to competition from Amazon. Yet Dow component Wal-Mart (WMT) announced plans to add 10,000 jobs this year.The Federal Reserve is virtually certain to raise interest rates a quarter point on March 15 at the end of its two-day meeting, with two additional hikes priced in by the end of 2017. While the February report was solid, it wasn't the kind of blowout report that might have concerned markets about an accelerated timetable for rate hikes.The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.61% on Thursday, closing in on December's 2-1/2-year high. But after the report, the 10-year yield slipped to 2.58%.One reason markets took the report largely in stride is that job creation got a boost from the second warmest February on record, which should dampen reported job gains this spring. Construction employment surged by 58,000. Meanwhile, manufacturing added 28,000 jobs, health care 27,000, professional and business services 37,000, and leisure and hospitality 26,000.The Fed took a hawkish shift even as the Labor Department was reporting the weakest three-month rise in average hourly wages since mid-2015. January's year-over-year increase, before the upward revision on Friday, was initially reported to be just 2.5%. Recent comments from a range of companies suggest that the tame wage increases reported in recent months may give way to faster wage inflation in Friday's report.Jack in the Box (JACK) said it's ""looking at roughly 6% wage inflation"" at both its namesake and Qdoba brands, driven partly by minimum-wage increases, which are flowing through to higher-paid team leaders and assistant managers to avoid wage ""compression.""DaVita Healthcare Partners (DVA), which provides dialysis services through outpatient centers, said on a Feb. 16 call: ""We've been experiencing wage inflation and turnover that is higher than our historical rates.""Brookdale Senior Living (BKD) said on a Feb. 14 call that it is seeing higher wage costs for hiring and retention. It is forecasting that compensation costs will rise by 5.5% to 6% this year, ""driven by increased salary and wages, normalized bonus and increased health benefit costs.""IBD'S TAKE: The Federal Reserve is getting impatient to raise interest rates even though prospects for a near-term economic stimulus from President Trump are diminishing.In a speech last week, Fed Chair Janet Yellen noted that job growth of around 180,000 per month is ""notably above the level estimated to be consistent with the longer-run trend in labor force growth — between 75,000 and 125,000 per month.""Wage inflation of 3% or higher would be a signal to the Fed that the U.S. labor market is basically at full employment, meaning that above-trend job gains would continue to push wages, and likely inflation, higher.A big wild card is what happens with labor-force participation. ""If growth in the labor force and a rise in the participation rate continue to reflect disenfranchised workers coming back into the fold,"" wrote Jefferies economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons, ""it will be difficult for the unemployment rate to continue to decline.""In February, the household survey, which is separate from the establishment survey that yields payroll and wage gains, showed that the labor force participation rate ticked up to 63.0%. The rise in the participation rate came as 340,000 people joined the labor force. The household survey also showed that 447,000 more people were working and 107,000 fewer were unemployed.While the Fed seems to be worried about getting behind the curve in raising interest rates, there's also a risk that it could tighten too fast. The likely robust job gains to start the year have been supercharged by warm weather and by business enthusiasm for President Trump's agenda of deregulation, tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Yet the weather will return to seasonal norms before long and Trump's fiscal firepower faces plenty of obstacles. All of that raises the risk that another economic takeoff will turn out to be short-lived.RELATED:Yellen: March Rate Hike 'Appropriate,' Sees Three Hikes In 2017Infrastructure Stocks Rise On Trump's $1 Trillion 'National Rebuilding' Plan

6,DVA,"Dialysis providers Fresenius Medical Care, American Renal Associates and DaVita all fell Monday after saying they were subpoenaed in the U.S. over premium-assistance programs that support dialysis patients on private insurance plans that can be more lucrative for providers.The U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts is investigating connections to the American Kidney Fund, which manages a patient-assistance program for the private plans, German-based Fresenius (FMS) said Monday.Beverly, Mass.-based American Renal (ARA) also said its subpoena is in connection with the American Kidney Fund, while DaVita (DVA), headquartered in Denver, said it's been subpoenaed regarding ""charitable premium assistance.""Fresenius fell as much as 7.3%, the most since June 24, and its U.S.-traded shares ended the day down 6.7% to 39.70. The shares had gained 5% in the 12 months before Monday, including reinvested dividends, compared with a 17% increase in the benchmark DAX Index.American Renal's shares plunged as much as 8.5%, the biggest intraday drop since Nov. 21, and traded down 5.4% at the close to 21.80. DaVita finished the regular session down 3.7% to 63.38.Dialysis patients and providers including Fresenius and DaVita have sued to challenge new regulations that tighten rules governing patient aid for private plans, due to take effect Jan. 13.American Renal stands to lose the most profit due to the new restrictions, and Fresenius will be affected the least, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis. All three companies said they're cooperating with the investigation.Between 700 and 2,000 Fresenius patients with end-stage renal disease in the U.S. currently use the plans. By subsidizing premiums, which patients would otherwise have to pay themselves, the patient aid steers people into more expensive private coverage, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services argued.Private insurance pays dialysis providers like Fresenius $100,000 to $200,000 more per patient each year than would Medicare and Medicaid, which have worked to reduce costs in recent years, according to CMS.Separately, DaVita on Monday said it signed a six-year supply agreement with Amgen (AMGN) for anemia drugs used to treat dialysis patients. The deal replaces a 2011 pact that was due to expire next year.

8,DVA,"Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) continued to build its stock portfolio last year while shedding bond holdings.On Saturday, Berkshire released its list of stock holdings, along with full-year 2015 and fourth-quarter financial results.Buffett's top 15 stock holdings include what he calls the company's ""Big Four"" investments: American Express (AXP), Coca Cola (KO), IBM (IBM) and Wells Fargo (WFC).Berkshire purchased additional shares of IBM during the year, boosting its total ownership to 81.03 million shares, or an 8.4% ownership stake at the end of the year vs. 7.8% at the end of 2014. Wells Fargo grew to 500 million shares, or a 9.8% stake, up from 9.4%.At Coke and American Express, share buybacks raised Berkshire's percentage ownership. Its 400 million shares of Coke are a 9.3% stake, up from 9.2%. And it owns 151.6 million shares of American Express, or 15.6%, up from 14.8%.Buffett said a major Berkshire equity position that's not on the list of 15 is Bank of America (BAC).""We can buy 700 million shares of Bank of America at any time prior to September 2021 for $5 billion. At year-end, these shares were worth $11.8 billion,"" he said, adding that it's likely Berkshire will buy them just before the options expire.Buffett added: ""It is important for you to realize that Bank of America is, in effect, our fourth-largest equity investment.""Berkshire's class B shares closed up 1.7% in the stock market today, and they are up nearly 10% from a Feb. 3 intraday low. Although its position improved, its stock still traded below both its 50-day and 200-day averages.American Express rose 0.4%, Coke ended flat, IBM fell 0.8%, but Wells Fargo slid 2.4%.Among other Berkshire top stock holdings, it has 46.6 million shares of IBD Leaderboard stock AT&T (T) (0.8% ownership), 24.7 million shares of credit rating and research agency Moody's (MCO) (12.6%), 18.5 million shares of dialysis services company DaVita Healthcare Partners (DVA) (8.8%), and 22.16 million shares of heavy equipment maker Deere (DE) (7%).Berkshire has also been buying big blocks of oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX) since last summer, fueling speculation that it may be Buffett's next acquisition target. As of Dec. 31, Berkshire owned 55.38 million shares or 10.5% of the company, and its stake has since risen to around 15%. Phillips was up 1.5% at 80.27 Monday.Meanwhile, for a sixth year in a row, Buffett reduced his bond holdings amid continued low yields. Berkshire owned about $25 billion in aggregate, on an amortized cost basis as of Dec. 31, down from nearly $35 billion at the end of 2009, Bloomberg said. Buffett said bonds are such a poor investment tool that they ""should come with a warning label.""At the end of 2015, his biggest bond holdings were in foreign bonds, followed by corporate bonds, U.S. Treasuries, municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities.

9,DVA,"The medical world is vast and diverse with dozens of specialties and subspecialties that treat everything from sunburn to brain tumors. Some of these specialties attract numerous practitioners and, consequently, lots of competition for patients. Others are more narrow and much less competitive.
"
10,DVA,"Mednax (MD) operates in both worlds. Although its primary focus is the comparatively narrow specialty of neonatal care, it has also branched out into the more competitive sectors of anesthesiology and radiology.
"
11,DVA,"The company provides neonatal care, anesthesia and other physician group services via hospital-based neonatal intensive-care units in 34 states and Puerto Rico.
"
12,DVA,"Mednax's Pediatrix Medical Group offers maternal-fetal, newborn and pediatric subspecialty care and related services, while its American Anesthesiology physician group provides anesthesia services for hospital operating rooms, ambulatory surgery centers, pain-management clinics and office-based medical and dental practices.
"
13,DVA,"Steady demand for its services, combined with an aggressive acquisition strategy, have helped Mednax put together a yearslong streak of double-digit revenue and earnings growth. Meanwhile, its stock price is up about 16% since the beginning of the year — even after a recent dip — and currently trades near 80.
"
14,DVA,"Dominating The Niche
"
15,DVA,"With projected 2015 revenue of $2.8 billion, Mednax is ""definitely the big boy"" in U.S. neonatal care, says Robert Wasserman, analyst at Dawson James Securities.
"
16,DVA,"Mednax got that way by establishing itself as a leader in the specialty a couple of decades ago, Wasserman told IBD.
"
17,DVA,"At the time, a lot of other companies were buying up physician practices — ""rolling them up,"" in industry parlance — in more competitive specialties such as maternity care, general practice and orthopedics.
"
18,DVA,"The problem was, doctors at these practices would eventually break off and open their own, competing practices. Many of the roll-up companies went under as a result.
"
19,DVA,"Mednax succeeded in part because of its focus on neonatal care, which has more barriers to competition than other types of medicine.
"
20,DVA,"""In order to practice neonatal medicine, you have to be affiliated with an intensive-care neonatal hospital, and Mednax has contracts with the neonatal hospital units,"" Wasserman said. ""You can't just leave and open a competing practice across the street. You need a contract, and those are not available to everyone.""
"
21,DVA,"Mednax also benefited from a strategy of picking markets where there was little if any competition.
"
22,DVA,"""They built a really nice market share because in many cases they were the only show in town,"" Wasserman said. ""There are only so many hospitals with a neonatal ICU unit. As the years went by, they were able to build mass.""
"
23,DVA,"Mednax continues to build mass today. Its website lists 11 acquisitions so far this year and five since the beginning of July.
"
24,DVA,"The company looks to attain its growth objectives ""by completing strategic acquisitions that are accretive to earnings,"" Mednax said in a presentation during its recent Investor Day. Executives did not respond to requests for comment for this article.
"
25,DVA,"Averaging 13 Buyouts Yearly
"
26,DVA,"Mednax has completed 130 acquisitions over the past decade — a big reason that its yearly revenue has more than tripled in the same period.
"
27,DVA,"Mednax's most recent buyout came Sept. 28, when it acquired New Jersey Anesthesia Associates (NJAA), a private physician group practice based in Livingston, N.J. NJAA employs 90 full-time clinicians, including 70 anesthesiologists, 13 anesthetists, two nurse practitioners and five physician assistants. It provides anesthesia services at Saint Barnabas Medical Center and Newark Beth Israel Medical Center.
"
28,DVA,"Mednax has also acquired anesthesiology practices in Florida, Michigan and Virginia in recent months.
"
29,DVA,"Although anesthesiology is more competitive than neonatal care, it also offers more growth opportunity, Wasserman said. ""It's a larger market. They don't have as much market share, but there's still plenty of business.""
"
30,DVA,"Once Mednax acquires a practice, its first step is to implement its own billing system, which is usually more sophisticated and high-tech than systems already in place. Mednax's system is designed to maximize the practices' reimbursement rates.
"
31,DVA,"The company also looks for economies of scale for medical supplies, office equipment and insurance purchases.
"
32,DVA,"Restructured, But Not Material
"
33,DVA,"Meanwhile, Mednax has unveiled a new growth strategy that ""has evolved from an initial focus on specific practices/specialties to a more market-level approach that integrates across all service lines,"" JPMorgan analyst Gary Taylor noted in a report.
"
34,DVA,"One element of the plan: Mednax has split its operation into Eastern and Western U.S. divisions. It has also established a new clinical services division and a new shared services division.
"
35,DVA,"""Management does not see any significant changes coming to its capital structure or deployment (from) the realignment,"" Taylor said.
"
36,DVA,"14% Profit Growth Expected
"
37,DVA,"Mednax is due to report its third-quarter earnings Oct. 29. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS of 98 cents, up 14% from the prior year. Revenue is seen rising 17% to $730.6 million. Full-year earnings are expected to rise 14% in 2015 and another 13% in 2016.

"
42,DVA,"Not that long ago, IBD Leaderboard company Acadia Healthcare was a small player in behavioral health, with only a handful of facilities in the U.S.
"
43,DVA,"Then a new management team arrived on the scene with aggressive expansion in mind.
"
44,DVA,"Acadia's (ACHC) new boss was Joey Jacobs. He previously was chairman and CEO at Psychiatric Solutions, which had been folded into Universal Health Services (UHS) after a $3 billion merger in 2010.
"
45,DVA,"Jacobs and his management team, including other executives from his merged company, arrived in the first quarter of 2011.
"
46,DVA,"They quickly got to work.
"
47,DVA,"In April, Acadia made its first acquisition — Youth & Family Centered Services, based in Austin, Texas — amounting to 13 facilities with 1,300 beds. A short time later, the team went after PHC, which is also known as Pioneer Behavioral Health.
"
48,DVA,"PHC wasn't that big; it had just five facilities with 270 beds. But it was a publicly traded company, and by combining with it, Acadia became a public company.
"
49,DVA,"""By getting access to public capital, they were able to accelerate their consolidation strategy,"" said Whit Mayo, an analyst with Robert W. Baird.
"
50,DVA,"Acquisitions In Mind
"
51,DVA,"Today, after several other buyouts, Franklin, Tenn.-based Acadia runs 76 behavioral health care facilities with more than 5,600 beds in 24 states, the United Kingdom and Puerto Rico.
"
52,DVA,"It's going to get even bigger.
"
53,DVA,"A pending acquisition of CRC Health Group, expected to close in 2015's first quarter, will give Acadia another 120 facilities in the U.S. and a much stronger presence in substance abuse treatment.
"
54,DVA,"The deal, valued at $1.175 billion, was announced in a third-quarter earnings release after the market closed on October 29.
"
55,DVA,"The next day, Acadia's stock shot up nearly 12% and another 5% the day after. It didn't hurt that earnings per share in the quarter jumped 53% from a year earlier to 46 cents on revenue of $294.5 million, which was up 59.4%.
"
56,DVA,"CRC Health, based in Cupertino, Calif., is expected to generate $450 million this year. It operates 36 residential facilities and 84 other kinds of treatment units, which together serve 40,000 patients a day.
"
57,DVA,"CRC will be Acadia's largest deal so far. Analyst Jennifer Lynch of BMO Capital Markets estimated in a research note that CRC could add 40-50 cents in per-share earnings for Acadia in 2015.
"
58,DVA,"She also noted that CRC's treatment for addiction, gambling and other problems ""presents another arena for expansion and investment.""
"
59,DVA,"Universal Health is still bigger than Acadia in behavioral health. Universal also operates 24 acute-care hospitals, which is why Acadia likes to call itself a pure play in behavioral health.
"
60,DVA,"Until Acadia closes on CRC, its $662 million acquisition in July of U.K.-based Partnerships in Care, or PiC, remains its biggest deal to date. PiC gave Acadia 23 inpatient facilities with over 1,200 beds in the U.K.
"
61,DVA,"PiC is known as the second-largest operator of independent inpatient behavioral health services in the U.K., with revenue last year of $285 million.
"
62,DVA,"""The move into the U.K. was a savvy one,"" Mayo said. ""The National Health Service in the U.K. is outsourcing (behavioral health) at an accelerating rate, and there is a shortage of beds.""
"
63,DVA,"He says that PiC had been ""a little starved for capital,"" and now Acadia will be able to help fund organic growth and acquisitions.
"
64,DVA,"""I look at the U.K. deal as expanding the entire addressable market for Acadia in the U.K.,"" Mayo said.
"
65,DVA,"""I would say the same thing for the CRC transaction (in the U.S.),"" he added, referring mostly to the new substance-abuse business that will come with it.
"
66,DVA,"Reimbursement Trends
"
67,DVA,"Insurance coverage for substance abuse has greatly improved with passage of the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) and other legislation that puts mental health coverage at ""parity"" with other medical and surgical benefits, Mayo says.
"
68,DVA,"""The federal government is creating a whole new set of rules and mandates for the insurance industry to enhance the benefits they offer for mental health issues,"" he added.
"
69,DVA,"According to statements by Jacobs, who wasn't available for an interview, Acadia will keep looking for other acquisitions in the U.S. and the U.K., and will keep adding new beds to existing facilities.
"
70,DVA,"Acadia, Mayo says, indicated earlier this year that it would try to increase the number of beds at existing facilities by 16% over two years.
"
71,DVA,"""Each new patient that comes through will provide some level of incremental margin improvement,"" Mayo said. He compared it to a hotel: the more rooms filled, the better.
"
72,DVA,"In behavioral health, filling rooms isn't a big problem. ""One issue in the industry is that there are not enough beds to serve demand,"" Mayo said.
"
73,DVA,"The sector also has relatively low levels of uncollected payments.
"
74,DVA,"""We continue to favor the behavioral space within health care facilities as low levels of bad debt, unmet demand and a growing need for services lends to quality earnings growth,"" noted Lynch.
"
75,DVA,"Universal is Acadia's chief rival in the U.S. It's also a rival in the U.K., where it recently paid $335 million for Cygnet Health, which gave it 15 behavioral health units and two nursing homes.
"
76,DVA,"In the U.S., ""it's still a fragmented industry with a lot of single-facility operators out there,"" said Scott Brittain, an Acadia spokesman.
"
77,DVA,"Acadia's revenue growth in the third quarter reflected nearly 1,900 new beds added in the prior 12 months. More than 1,500 came through five acquisitions, including PiC and McCallum Place, which runs eating-disorder treatment centers in St. Louis and Austin, Texas.
"
78,DVA,"After reporting third-quarter results, Acadia raised its EPS guidance for the full year to $1.52-$1.53 from $1.44-$1.46 previously.
"
79,DVA,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings to come in at the high end — $1.53 — for a 43% gain over last year. They see earnings rising 34% in 2015.
"
80,DVA,"With a market cap around $3.8 billion, Acadia is the fourth-largest company in IBD's Medical-Outpatient/Home Care industry group, after Fresenius Medical (FMS), Davita Healthcare Partners (DVA) and Mednax (MD).

91,DVA,"Lyndsey and Sameer Lodha had their pick of cities after Sameer, a former equities trader who's now a hand surgeon, got several job offers upon completing his residency.
"
92,DVA,"They passed on New York, where Sameer lived when he worked at Goldman Sachs Group (GS), and San Francisco because both were too expensive. They chose Denver as their home base, moving into an apartment with their 16-month-old daughter in August.

94,DVA,"An influx of young families in search of alternatives to the most-expensive U.S. coastal markets is fueling a real estate boom in Denver, where commercial-property spending and home prices have jumped to records. Apartment and office developers seeking to capitalize on employment growth are creating an urban center that has ""started to compete very well against other higher-tier cities,"" said Steve Ferris, development services director for the city and county of Denver.

96,DVA,"New York and San Francisco remain far bigger commercial real estate markets that are unlikely to lose their allure as major cities any time soon.

97,DVA,"'A True Mix'
"
98,DVA,"""What's working for Denver is that it's less expensive than San Francisco and New York, but that at the same time it has a growing and diverse industry — mutual funds, natural gas, technology,"" Frampton said. ""Denver now has a vibrant downtown. It never used to. So now you have a true mix of city and sky.""

115,DVA,"Rising interest in Denver has created more competition and priced out some investors. The city's popularity also is making it harder for some families to buy.

126,DVA,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a roaring success in healthcare, taking the outpatient and home healthcare space by storm as well!These days, patients prefer bots for home-based medical services for easy, pocket friendly and faster recovery. Per a research report by the International Federation of Robotics, about 37,500 elderly-assistance medical robots will be sold worldwide by 2019 for home-based care.Apart from elderly care, AI has a role to play in United States’ fight against sexual offence, depression and cognitive-behavioral disorder. Such emergencies call for maintenance of privacy, anonymity and outpatient care.Further, the recent national epidemic of opioid abuse and President Trump’s fresh “tough on crime” policies are likely to drive the demand for outpatient rehab centers in the nation.Despite these factors, analysts apprehend that regulatory hurdles might slightly weigh on the global outpatient markets. Further, any slowdown in global economic growth, especially in the MedTech domain, might hurt demand for outpatient and home healthcare procedures.Industry Performance vs. S&P 500Despite the favorable socio-economic scenario, investors aren’t quite upbeat about the industry at the moment. Moreover, outpatient rehab centers do not provide assured cure for opioid abuse and drug overdose till now.This reflects in the underperformance of the Zacks Medical - Outpatient And Home Healthcare industry, which is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Medical Sector, with respect to both the S&P 500 and its sector over the past year.While stocks in this industry have collectively gained 3.1%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Medical Sector have rallied a respective 14.2% and 20.7%.One-Year Price Performance Outpatient and Home Healthcare Stocks Trading CheapGiven the industry’s underperformance so far this year, the valuation looks cheap now. Valuation is a tricky business for the Outpatient and Home Healthcare companies. Not to forget, these companies spend a lot on unplanned R&D and hence it is difficult to account for such high expenses.However, one might gain a fair idea of the industry’s relative valuation from its Price/Book ratio.The industry currently has a Price/Book TTM ratio of 2.14, which is toward the high end of the past year as well as the last five years. When compared to the high of 2.21 and median level of 1.95 over the past year, we believe investors should wait for a dip to enter the market.The space also looks inexpensive when compared to the Medical market at large, as the current Price/Book TTM ratio for the Medical sector is 2.56 and the median Price/Book TTM ratio is 2.39.Price-to-Book Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) Compared to the Zacks S&P 500 Composite, the space looks inexpensive. The current ratio for the S&P 500 of 3.92 and the median level is 3.75. So, both the figures are above the Medical - Outpatient And Home Healthcare industry’s respective ratios.Price-to-Book Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) Price Under Pressure Due to Bleak Earnings ViewThe ratio analysis shows that the industry has a solid value-oriented path ahead.The major factors driving this are mostly macroeconomic along with cost effectiveness. Middle-class Americans, i.e. more than 62% of the total population, generally avoid high service costs of expensive healthcare centers. They prefer treatments at home or at outpatient clinics to cut down on out-of-pocket expenses.One reliable metric that can give investors an idea of the industry’s future price performance is its earnings outlook. Empirical research shows that earnings outlook for the industry, showing the earnings revision trend for the constituent companies, has a direct bearing on its stock market performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations for it and the industry's aggregate stock market performance. The red line in the chart represents the Zacks measure of consensus earnings expectations for 2019, while the light blue line represents the same for 2018.Price and Consensus: Medical - Outpatient And Home Healthcare industry Please note that the $3.08 EPS estimate for the industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom-up EPS estimate for every company in the Zacks Medical - Outpatient And Home Healthcare industry, but rather an illustrative aggregate number created by our proprietary analytics model. The key factor to keep in mind is not the earnings per share of the industry for 2018, but how this estimate has been moving recently.This becomes clear by focusing on the aggregate EPS revisions trend. The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018.Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions As you can see, the $3.08 EPS estimate for 2018 has remained steady since May, declining from $3.11 at April-end. Looking at the earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings potential. This could possibly be due to the regulatory hurdles in the outpatient industry.However, earnings estimates have risen sharply since last December.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks.The Zacks Medical - Outpatient And Home Healthcare industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #116, which places it within the top 45% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Moreover, our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank was consistently in the top 50% for the past eight weeks.Outpatient And Home Healthcare Promises Long-Term GrowthThe long-term prospects for the industry indicate steady growth. When compared with the broader Zacks S&P 500 composite, the long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Medical - Outpatient And Home Healthcare industry of 13.4% appears promising. The corresponding figure for the Zacks S&P 500 composite is 9.8%.Though the group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has declined sharply from the high of 13.7% achieved in March and April 2018, it has been steady ever since and is above the low of 9.5% over a year.Mean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth Rate In fact, the basis of this long-term EPS growth could be a steady increase in top line that the Medical - Outpatient And Home Healthcare industry has seen since the end of 2016.  Bottom LineThe rapid adoption of outpatient services can be attributed to technological advancements, which have made procedures shorter and less complicated.A research report by the Transparency Market Research suggests that Americans are increasingly succumbing to drug addiction, which is affecting health and family life to a large extent. Outpatient rehabs have a major role to play since treatment is comparatively cheaper than inpatient and residential treatments. On the flip side, healthcare markets are facing innumerable regulations and interventions, which might mar the long-term prospects of the industry.However, keeping the long-term expectations in mind, investors could advantage from the cheap valuation and bet on a few outpatient and home healthcare stocks that have a strong earnings outlook.Here we pick two stocks from the Medical - Outpatient And Home Healthcare industry with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), out of which one has seen positive earnings estimate revision.DaVita Inc (DVA  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Denver, CO, DaVita is a leading provider of dialysis services in the United States to patients suffering from chronic kidney failure.

127,DVA,"On Mar 19, we issued an updated research report on DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).As an operating division of DaVita, DaVita Kidney Care focuses on setting global standards for clinical, social and operational practices in kidney care. However, the company has been grappling with labor-union issues in California and Ohio.Davita’s kidney care unit has been gaining prominence worldwide. Of the major services that it provides, the in-center hemodialysis, home hemodyalisis, peritoneal dialysis, kidney transplant, urology, diabetology and vascular access surgery deserve a mention.In the fourth quarter of 2017, net consolidated revenues in the kidney care unit were $2.78 billion, up 3% year over year. Adjusted operating income in the segment was $430 million, up 1.8% year over year.Further, DaVita is steadily expanding in the international markets. In the past few years, the company has strengthened its position in the emerging and developing markets of Brazil, China, Colombia, Germany, India, Malaysia, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Saudi Arabia through strategic alliances as well as acquisitions of dialysis centers.These are anticipated to help DaVita deliver more efficient patient care. Currently, DaVita is seeking to expand in major European and Asian countries via acquisitions and partnerships.Meanwhile, in California, labor unions proposed a ballot initiative that is likely to alter DaVita’s footprint in the state. If they proceed with the initiative, the company might have to incur significant one-time costs in 2018 to support their advocacy efforts. This is likely to dampen its top-line growth in the coming quarters.Per management, the situation is likely to render a large number of centers in California financially unsustainable, which would severely limit patient access to outpatient dialysis care.At the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, the company also announced that the unions are pursuing a similar initiative in Ohio. However, it has not included any potential advocacy costs in California and Ohio in its guidance range.Price PerformanceOver the last six months, DaVita has outperformed its industry. The company returned almost 13.2%, higher than the industry’s growth of 11%. The current level also compares favorably with the S&P 500’s gain of roughly 9.9%.DaVita Inc. Price  DaVita Inc.

129,DVA,"Health insurer Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) has signed an agreement to acquire Kindred-at-Home, a unit of Kindred Healthcare Inc.Details of the DealTPG Capital and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe and Humana have formed a joint venture to buy Kindred for nearly $4.1 billion including the acquired company’s debt. Humana will occupy a 40% stake for $800 million in Kindred-at-Home, which will be separated from the rest of the company after the deal. The transaction will see light by the summer of 2018 and will be slightly accretive to the company’s earnings per share in 2019 and beyond.Essence of the Deal for HumanaThe deal will provide a vertical integration for Humana and aligns with the company’s strategy to grow in the home healthcare arena. The deal will allow the company to provide an improved care to patients at low cost.This transaction will provide Humana with an extensive geographic coverage with approximately 65% overlap with Humana’s individual Medicare Advantage membership. The company will also have full access to extensive clinical capabilities to better serve its members.A deal of this kind comes as no surprise to us given that the company had kept its eyes wide open for such attractive acquisitions after its failed merger with Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) earlier in the year. The company’s balance sheet with strong financial flexibility also provides enough support for capital deployment activities.Last week, the company’s board of directors approved a new share repurchase program to buy back its common stock worth up to $3 billion.Share Price PerformanceYear to date, the stock has rallied 21%, significantly underperforming the industry’s growth of 43%. Nonetheless, the recent announcement, a well-poised Medicare business as its solid balance sheet should drive the shares higher.Industry TrendA spate of similar deals is witnessed in the industry of late, driven by the increasing trend of health insurers foraying into patient-care business. The mega merger of CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) with Aetna aims to dispense affordable cure to patients at their convenience closer home or at an outpatient location.Further competition is lent by UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), which is voraciously spreading its business in this space via its OptumCare unit by acquiring doctor clinics, urgent care facilities and surgery centers. Recently, UnitedHealth Group’s Optum unit announced that it would pay nearly $5 billion to buy DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc.’s (DVA  -  Free Report) Medical Group along with its clinics and urgent care centers.The central tenet for all these deals is to cut costs and improve care. These developments mark the coming forward of health insurers to play a more direct role in providing actual medical services and move beyond offering insurance.These deals seeking to reduce hospitalizations, lower emergency room visits and allowing physicians and clinicians to extend their care all the way to a patient’s home are, however, detrimental to hospital companies’ business and survival.Going ForwardThe ripple of shakeup in the health care industry started by CVS-Aetna deal continues to trend higher. One after another player continues to join the bandwagon of consolidation. Given the urgent need (in the rapidly-transforming health care industry) for increase in heft and size, restraint of sky-high medical costs plus diversification of business, we won’t be surprised if we hear more of deals along similar lines going forward.Humana carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

130,DVA,"Healthcare diagnostic majors and arch-rivals Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (DGX  -  Free Report) and Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) or LabCorp are on the same page regarding the much contentious topic of Protecting Access to Medicare Act (“PAMA”) on clinical lab fee schedule. Recently, both the companies as members of the American Clinical Laboratory Association (“ACLA”) have come forward to support a lawsuit filed by ACLA against the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). The lawsuit charged that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), operating under the purview of HHS, have failed to follow a congressional directive to implement a market-based laboratory payment system.Per the lawsuit claims, CMS ignored the Congress directives stated under PAMA and instituted a highly flawed data reporting process of setting market rates in advance.This prohibited the overwhelming majority of laboratories from reporting the private payer data used to determine Medicare rates for lab tests. The move has instead resulted in new Medicare lab rates, which are not market-specific. Hence, the entire process clearly demonstrates CMS’ failure to protect access to laboratory services for Medicare beneficiaries.Per the press release from LabCorp, if the new rates are allowed to come into effect, it will affect the Medicare beneficiaries as well as disrupt the healthcare system. Per Quest diagnostics, “this flawed process could cause serious financial harm to potentially thousands of hospitals, independent and physician office laboratories and make it harder for Medicare beneficiaries to get access to medical testing, particularly in remote rural areas and in nursing homes that depend on laboratory testing services”. Earlier during the third quarter earnings release, both LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics had issued certain objections in response to the Sep 22 publication by CMS on the proposed 2018 Medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory tests under the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (CLFS) mandated by PAMA. Per the companies, only 1% of all laboratories submitted data and over 99% of hospitals and physician office laboratories were prevented from reporting their rates.The above-mentioned 1% of laboratories majorly denoted independent labs. To convey the severity of the situation in clear terms, Quest Diagnostics stated that based on data submitted through CMS, the company alone represented nearly 40% of all the market data that CMS collected.Among other possibly badly hit clinical laboratories, thanks to the latest CMS mandate on clinical lab fee schedule, two names emerge as DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) and PerkinElmer, Inc. (PKI  -  Free Report). While Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp and PerkinElmer carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), DaVita has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

131,DVA,"The role of pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) in the U.S. healthcare sector has been evolving. From being just third-party administrators of prescription drug programs, PBMs have come a long way. PBMs currently play a major role in managing pharmaceutical spending and enhancing health benefits for end-users.Notably, PBMs are mainly accountable for the development of formularies, discussing discounts with major drug manufacturers and pharmacy contracts. These firms also play an important role in the settlement of prescription drug claims.As per Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, PBMs have the potential to save as much as 30% in total drug spending relative to unmanaged purchasing (data published in ‘The Economic Benefits of Pharmacy Benefit Managers’ by Orszag and Green).Undoubtedly, the PBM market is expected to continue the solid trend. Per a report by Market Research Reports.biz, the PBM market will see a CAGR of 7.16% between 2014 and 2019.Factors Driving PBMHistorically, there have been a number of factors supporting growth in the PBM market. Rising healthcare expenditures along with higher cost of drugs and other healthcare services have driven demand for PBMs who act as middlemen between the payer and other entities in the system.We are also encouraged by a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board on rising U.S. healthcare spending. Per the report, the U.S. healthcare spending is projected to rise to around $5.5 trillion by 2025, representing 19.9% of Gross Domestic Product (based on assumptions that the Affordable Care Act will continue through 2025).The PBM market largely benefits from an aging population which tends to depend on drugs and pharmacy benefit plans. Per a report by Technavio, nearly 14.4% of the U.S. population is aged 65 years and above which buoys optimism.Many analysts believe that rising expenditure on prescription drugs and growing demand for specialty drugs have also been strengthening the PBM market. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board predicts a continuation of this trend. Per the report, prescription drug spending is projected to grow roughly 7% between 2018 and 2019.Per a 2017 Economic Report on U.S. Pharmacies ad Pharmacy Benefit Managers, specialty drugs accounted for about one-third of the pharmacy industry’s revenues in 2016.Mergers & Acquisitions Change PBM LandscapeThe PBM market has always been dominated by a handful of large players. In 2007, CVS’ merger with Caremark Rx to form CVS Caremark, now CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report), had a huge impact on the functions and scope of PBMs. Again, CVS Health announced a historic decision to acquire health insurance giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report).People in support of the merger view it as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one which will lead to efficiency gain and solid cost cutting at CVS Health’s PBM business. Notably, a horizontal integration increases the chances of monopolistic practices in the market.Following the announcement of the CVS-Aetna deal, another leading health service company — Optum, part of the UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) — announced its decision to acquire DaVita Medical Group, a leading independent medical group and a subsidiary of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report).Moreover, it is being speculated that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) might soon announce the acquisition of health and well-being company, Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) to counter competition.3 Stocks to Scoop UpAs the PBM industry is constantly expanding, this industry is worth keeping an eye on. Here are three PBM companies with promising prospects.CVS Health: Headquartered in Woonsocket, RI, CVS Health, with its subsidiaries, provides integrated pharmacy health care services. This leading PBM company has a market cap of about $73.8 billion. Its earnings are estimated to grow 9.1% in the next three to five years.Apart from the Aetna deal earlier, CVS health has announced plans to set up a new 30,000-store performance-based pharmacy network fixed by CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report), as well as up to 10,000 community-based independently owned pharmacies across the United States. Through this initiative, the company intends to promote cost saving and enhance clinical outcomes which will eventually reduce costs for CVS’ PBM customers.CVS Health Corporation Price CVS Health Corporation Price | CVS Health Corporation QuoteExpress Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Saint Louis, MO, Express Scripts operates as a PBM company in the United States, Canada and Europe. The company has a market cap of about $38.83 billion. Its earnings are estimated to grow 9.7% in the next three to five years.Notably, the company’s PBM segment offers clinical solutions, specialized pharmacy care, home delivery and specialty pharmacy, retail network pharmacy administration, benefit design consultation, drug utilization review, drug formulary management, administration of a group purchasing organization, and consumer health and drug information services. Moreover, this segment provides Medicare, Medicaid, and health insurance marketplace products.The company recently announced plans to acquire privately-held and evidence-based medical benefit management services provider — eviCore healthcare. Notably, by integrating eviCore's medical benefits management (MBM) platform with its PBM offering, Express Scripts intends to combat rising healthcare costs.Express Scripts Holding Company Price Express Scripts Holding Company Price | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteRite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report): Operating through Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Services segments, Rite Aid owns a chain of retail drugstores in the United States. The company has a market cap of about $1.91 billion.Notably, the company’s Pharmacy Services segment provides PBM services and a range of pharmacy-related services. This segment also provides prescription adjudication services for other PBMs, offers integrated mail-order and specialty and compounding pharmacy services, and provides infertility treatment as well as drug benefits under the Medicare Part D program.Rite Aid Corporation Price Rite Aid Corporation Price | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteBottom LineAlthough these companies have solid prospects, they are exposed to challenges like legal regulations, reimbursement pressure and the speculated entry of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) in the PBM market.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

132,DVA,"The mega merger of CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) with Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) announced recently has sent jitters across the hospital sector, which is already suffering from low patient volumes, soaring costs, increasing bad debts, and an uncertain regulatory climate among other issues.Increasing EncroachmentThe deal between a health insurer, Aetna and a pharmacy benefit manager and a pharmacy store company, CVS Health, is expected to eat into the business of hospital companies. The companies aim to bring affordable cure to patients at increased convenience. This implies greater emphasis on value-based care rather than fee for service care.The players are structuring their offerings in a way that should keep patients away from hospitals. In this regard, they are being provided necessary services at home or an outpatient location. This should shift patient traffic for emergency rooms away from hospitals.“The overuse of emergency department adds an estimated $38 billion in wasteful spending every year, so tremendous savings can be realized by utilizing local care solutions in a more integrated fashion,” according to Aetna’s CEO Mark Bertolini.Further competition is being posed by UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), which is voraciously spreading its business in this space via its OptumCare unit by acquiring doctor clinics, urgent care facilities and surgery centers. Last week, UnitedHealth Group’s Optum unit announced that it would pay nearly $5 billion to buy DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc.’s (DVA  -  Free Report) Medical Group and its clinics and urgent care centers.The expansion of UnitedHealth and CVS Health in outpatient facilities is likely to create challenges for big names in the hospital industry such as Tenet Healthcare, HCA Holdings and Community Health Systems. The country’s nonprofit hospital industry may also not be spared.The industry underperformed the S&P 500 index last year, as evident by growth of just 2.8% compared with a rally of 20% by the former.Recourse Being TakenPlayers in the hospital industry are coming together to gain in scale and size to face growing invasion. According to a Wall Street Journal report, hospital operators Ascension Health and Providence St. Joseph Health are mulling to merge which should create the nation’s largest hospital chain.Two major Midwestern hospital operators, Advocate Health Care and Aurora Health Care, are combining to lead cost-effective operations. Catholic Health Initiatives and Dignity Health are merging, bringing together 139 hospitals and projecting combined revenues of $28.4 billion.Consolidation is the Name of the GameConsolidation in the hospital industry is already rampant, driven by the increased need by players to build scale and new capabilities, increase service offerings, and expand geographically to find a solid footing in an uncertain healthcare environment.According to the latest analysis by Kaufman Hall, a leading provider of strategic and financial consulting services, hospital and health system partnership transactions for 2017 were total 87 as of the end of the third quarter, implying that transactions may exceed 102 deals completed in 2016. Last quarter, 29 transactions were announced, slightly less than 31 deals announced in the second quarter.With the trend not likely to see any reversal anytime soon, we expect further deals down the line.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

133,DVA,"The Dow endured a volatile week even as Republicans tasted success on the tax legislation front. This development boosted bank stocks that eventually helped the Dow to touch new highs. Tech stocks had a good week, notching up gains over three successive trading sessions. Meanwhile, oil stocks remained volatile even as a spike in gasoline inventories led to losses for the sector on Wednesday.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow declined by 0.2% last Friday after news related to the former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn raised market uncertainty. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI regarding his interaction with the Russians and promised full cooperation to the investigating team.However, some of Friday’s losses were curbed following news that the U.S. Senate Republicans had made legislative progress on the tax cut Bill. For the week, the Dow and the S&P 500 closed in positive territory, while the Nasdaq ended with losses.The index gained 2.9% over last week, posting its best weekly increase since December 2016. During the week, Dow breached a fresh all-time high to surge past the psychological 24,000 milestone on rising optimism about the prospects of tax reforms after Senator McCain promised his support for the tax cut Bill.Further, Jerome Powell’s comments that he would follow Yellen’s path in terms of monetary policies also boosted investor sentiment. Also, key economic data like GDP registered the highest growth rate since 2014, while consumer confidence hit a 17-year high. However, Flynn-related news raised market uncertainty on Friday and curbed some of the week’s gains.The Dow This WeekThe index gained 0.2% on Monday. U.S. Senate Republicans finally approved the tax cut Bill over the last weekend which boosted bank stocks that eventually helped the Dow to touch new highs. Additionally, strong rate hike chances post Fed’s Dec 12-13 meeting had a positive impact on the broader financial sector.The index decreased 0.5% on Tuesday after investors speculated over the possible effects of retaining the alternate minimum tax provision in the final draft of the tax Bill. Meanwhile, the ISM Service Index for November declined from the 12-year high it had hit a month earlier.Shares of The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) declined 2.7% following reports from CNBC's David Faber that the company was in talks to buy some key assets of 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). This development was the biggest drag on the Dow.The index lost 0.2% on Wednesday after energy stocks declined following a sudden plunge in oil prices. Meanwhile, the technology sector posted its second straight day of gains. According to the EIA, U.S. commercial crude oil inventories slumped 5.6 million barrels to 448.1 million for the week ended Dec 1.However, the EIA reported that gasoline inventories jumped 6.8 million barrels, in contrast to analysts’ forecasts of a rise of only 1.145 million barrels. This led to a decline in oil prices. Both the two key oil behemoths, Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) decreased 0.7%.The index rebounded on Thursday, gaining 0.3%, after tech stocks notched up gains for the third consecutive day. Further, investors maintained a close watch on any developments related to the Republican Tax Bill. Also, markets waited for Friday’s jobs report to gauge the strength of the labor market as a Fed rate hike seems more or less certain.Components Moving the IndexApple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) has won the long-pending case against Chinese manufacturer, Xiaomi over the registration of “Mi Pad” as an European Union (EU) trademark, per Reuters. The tech giant had filed a complaint with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) in 2016 over Xiaomi’s application of Mi Pad as an European trademark in 2014. Apple stated that the name is similar to that of its iPad trademark.Following EUIPO’s support to Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Apple, Xiaomi appealed to the General Court, the second highest court of the European Union. The plea was rejected this Tuesday saying that the similarity of the signs might lead to confusion among users.Per the ruling, “additional letter ‘m’ at the beginning of ""Mi Pad"", is not sufficient to offset the high degree of visual and phonetic similarity between the two signs."" However, Xiaomi can still appeal at EU's highest court, European Court of Justice, against the ruling.

Budget for capital projects is reserved at $18.3 billion, lower than this year’s estimate of $19.8 billion. Per the company, capital spending for the next three years will be in the range of $17-$22 billion per annum. Of the total budget for 2018, $5.5 billion is meant for affiliated companies' expenses.The overall 2018 budget is 4% lower than the one provided for 2017. It has been declining for the last four years. Per the company, it is focusing on growth projects, which will add to the company's cash flow in the next two years, including the Permian Basin assets. Completion of several projects and enhanced efficiencies in the company’s operations were also responsible for the lowered budget for 2018.  The company however expects production to grow in the coming year driven by its Permian Basin play. To sustain the current producing assets, the company will bear costs of around $8.7 billion, of which $3.3 billion will be utilized for the Permian Basin. Per Zacks Rank #3 Chevron, $1.0 billion will be used for other shale and tight rock investments. The company's assets in the Tengiz field of Kazakhstan were allotted $3.7 billion while the downstream projects were allotted $2.2 billion.

134,DVA,"Following the recent announcement by UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) to buy DaVita Medical Group — a unit of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) — the rating agency A.M.Best has sprung into action.In fact, the credit ratings of UnitedHealth as well as its insurance and health maintenance organizations’ subsidiaries were kept intact by A.M.Best.The acquisition to be made by the company’s unit — OptumCare — is expected to enhance the number of its outpatient facilities in California, Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico and Washington.  Also, the buyout would strengthen Optum’s geographic presence of its primary and specialty providers, and care delivery locations.The latest deal is in sync with company’s goal of providing efficient care at affordable cost. UnitedHealth has also bought SurgicalCare and Advisory Board and seems to be on an acquisition spree in 2017.  From the point of view of financial leverage, the rating agency notes that the deal is likely to be financed by a combination of cash and debt that might raise the leverage ratio. However, the same is expected to be brought down to more manageable levels of approximately 40%, on repaying debt.UnitedHealth’s deleveraging action to bring its leverage ratio to nearly 40% level at the end of third-quarter 2017 from much higher levels in 2016 and 2015 raises A.M.Best’s optimism on the company’s debt management abilities.In fact, the rating agency views favorably the company’s interest coverage ratio which stands at north of 10 times. Additionally, A.M.Best’s significant financial flexibility backed by its sizeable commercial paper program, parent company cash, subsidiary dividends and credit facility is commendable.UnitedHealth is better placed than other companies in the same space with respect to access to unregulated earnings and cash flows from its Optum unit.However, the company’s goodwill which exceeds 180%, remains a concern.

137,DVA,"UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s (UNH  -  Free Report) Optum unit has announced the buyout of DaVita Medical Group, a unit of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report), for $4.9 billion in cash.This acquisition will be made by OptumCare — a sub-segment of Optum — the company’s health services segment. OptumCare provides primary and urgent care delivery services business.This is the company’s third deal this year to expand its medical services business. It is expected to close in 2018. In March, the unit bought Surgical Care Affiliates for about $2.3 billion. Last month, Optum also bought the health unit of Advisory Board Co., which advises hospital systems.The company is on an acquisition spree to build its Optum segment gradually. In this regard, the Catamaran and the MedExpress buyout in 2015 are worth mentioning.The expansion of this segment, which complements its core health benefits business under UnitedHealthcare, should poise the company strongly for growth in an increasingly regulated market.In the last year, shares of UnitedHealth have gained 38%, in line with the industry's growth it belongs to.UnitedHealth has been continuously adding related businesses to transform itself from just an insurance company to a comprehensive healthcare provider. The company will now offer a bouquet of services that include selling of health insurance coverage to pharmacy benefit management to improve physician practices.This transformation is also necessitated by the company’s need to control soaring medical costs to protect margins. Getting vertically integrated, better equips the company to provide superior healthcare services at reasonable costs by ruling out duplication of services and playing a more direct role in medical services.Meanwhile, an increasing trend of vertical consolidation is being witnessed across the industry, which is itself undergoing rapid transformation owing to heightened regulation, soaring medical costs, increased consumerism, shift to value based care.Another deal in the same vein is that of the buyout of Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report), which would enable the surviving company to sell a range of services and products from drug to insurance cover.We strongly believe consolidation in the sector to continue, which would lead to more deals of this kind going forward.UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

138,DVA,"On Wednesday, only a few days after the CVS (CVS  -  Free Report) and Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) deal helped shine a light on the quickly changing healthcare industry, UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) announced that it will buy a unit of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) for nearly $5 billion.UnitedHealth, the country’s biggest health insurer, announced that its Optum division reached an agreement to acquire DaVita Medical Group for roughly $4.9 billion in cash. This deal, which is expected to close in 2018, is aimed to help expand UnitedHealth’s primary and urgent care services.UnitedHealth hopes to pair DaVita Medical Group’s 300 medical clinics, 35 urgent-care centers, and six outpatient surgery centers—which reach around 1.7 million patients a year—with Optum’s massive insurance division.“Combining DaVita Medical Group and Optum advances our shared goal of supporting physicians in delivering exceptional patient care in innovative and efficient ways while working with more than 300 health care payers across Optum in ways that better meet the needs of their members,” Optum CEO Larry C. Renfro said in a statement.Optum also runs its own primary and urgent care centers, surgery centers, and senior and advanced care centers. Officials at both companies noted that the deal aims to help improve and streamline the ability to treat patients.This move is part of a growing shift for health insurers to play a more direct role in actual medical services. Many health insurers now want to be able to provide their own patient care as often as possible. The deal will hopefully cut costs and improve care, given the proximity and number of care centers—especially for people with non-life threatening, chronic conditions.The move comes after CVS announced its acquisition of healthcare benefits giant Aetna on Sunday. The $69 billion deal will allow the companies to offer more healthcare services at CVS stores.UnitedHealth's latest deal is its second acquisition in 2017 aimed at bolstering its offerings beyond insurance. In March, UnitedHealth purchased Surgical Care Affiliates for $2.3 billion.Shares of DaVita soared 12% premarket on the back of the announcement. Since then, the stock has cooled a bit and now hovers up around 10% at $67.20 per share, which is still $3 below its 52-week high.UnitedHealth saw its stock price dip in early morning trading, but shares have since gained around 0.80%. CVS stock dipped slightly on Wednesday following the UnitedHealth and DaVita deal.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

141,DVA,"Fresenius Medical Care (FMS  -  Free Report) has had a dismal run on the bourses of late. Over the last three months, the company has added 4.4%, underperforming the broader industry’s gain of 5.2%. The current level is also lower than the S&P 500’s return of 5.5%. A rapidly changing healthcare environment in the United States, a sluggish third quarter, tough regulatory environment, difficulties in collecting trade receivables in foreign legal paradigms and competition in the niche markets have been posing significant challenges to the company. The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Here we take a sneak peek at the major issues plaguing Fresenius at the moment:Q3 DebacleFresenius ended the third quarter on a dismal note, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the counts. The misses were led by lackluster performance of the renal pharmaceutical segment, which primarily marred Latin-American revenues. We note that the Health Care Services segment at the region declined 1% year over year.Stiff CompetitionFresenius has a number of competitors in the field of health care services as well as dialysis products. Tough competition from MedTech majors like DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) is likely to impede the company’s sales opportunities and dent market share.Unfavorable Regulatory EnvironmentFresenius has a solid hold in the markets of North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. Thus, the company faces the brunt of stringent regulations in almost every country in which it operates. Furthermore, Fresenius has to fulfill specific legal requirements that include tough antitrust regulations. Violating healthcare or other regulations under public law can result in serious legal repercussions. Fresenius Medical Care Corporation Price and Consensus  Fresenius Medical Care Corporation Price and Consensus | Fresenius Medical Care Corporation Quote Overall, the estimate revision trend for Fresenius has been declining. For the current quarter, one analyst moved south compared to no movement in the opposite direction over the last two months. For the full year, two analysts moved down compared to no upward movement. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings declined by 3.2% to 61 cents. Full-year earnings estimates dropped 1.3% to $2.36 per share.However, acquisitions have been a key catalyst for the company. In an initiative to boost its long-term strategy or the ‘Growth-Strategy 2020’, Fresenius Medical Care recently signed an agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of NxStage Medical (NXTM  -  Free Report) for $30 a share.Meanwhile, a better-ranked stock in the broader medical sector is PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

142,DVA,"DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted operating earnings of 81 cents per share that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents. Further, earnings declined from 14.7% on a year-over-year basis.Total revenues increased 5.1% year over year to $3.92 billion and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.89 billion. The year-over-year improvement was mainly attributable to a 3.8% rise in patient service revenues to $2.62 billion and 16.5% increase in capitated revenues to $1.02 billion from the year-ago quarter.DaVita carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Price and Consensus  DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Price and Consensus | DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Quote Segment UpdateDavita Medical Group (“DMG”)DMG, the nation's largest operator of medical groups and physician networks, provides integrated care management as an operating division of DaVita, focusing on delivering healthcare through a broad range of services.For the third quarter of 2017, DMG incurred adjusted operating loss of $5 million, which excludes $601 million non-cash goodwill impairment and other adjusted items. In the third quarter, DaVita announced the restructuring of the DMG segment that eliminated 350 non-clinical positions. Thus, management at DaVita expects annualized savings of around $40 million per year starting 2018.DaVita Kidney CareAs an operating division of DaVita, DaVita Kidney Care focuses on setting worldwide standards for clinical, social and operational practices in kidney care. DaVita saw solid results from the Kidney Care business.Adjusted operating income in the third quarter at the segment was $404 million, up 1% year over year, primarily driven by an extra treatment day in the quarter. Notably, the company saw a negative financial impact of Hurricane Harvey and Irma, which is estimated to be approximately $7 million for higher costs and approximately $7 million of lost contribution from missed treatment and uncollected revenues owing to disruption of the company’s billing process during the natural disasters.U.S.Dialysis and Related Lab ServicesRevenue per treatment for U.S. dialysis and lab business was essentially flat with the last quarter. In fact, management at DaVita expects revenue per treatment to essentially remain flat in the fourth quarter as well. The company’s patient care costs were up approximately $1.76 per treatment compared with the last quarter.Financial UpdateFor the twelve months ended Sep 30, 2017, DaVita had an operating cash flow of $2.08 billion and free cash flow of $1.49 billion. Operating cash flow was $553 million in the third quarter and $1.56 billion year to date.Share Repurchase UpdateDaVita bought back almost 2 million shares of the company’s common stock for approximately $117 million at an average price of $59.09 per share. In October, DaVita’s board of directors approved an additional share repurchase authorization worth approximately $1.253 billion.As of Nov 7, 2017, DaVita repurchased a total of 11.4 million shares of the company’s common stock for a total of $702 million at an average price of $61.30 a share.GuidanceDaVita expects adjusted consolidated operating income for 2017 in the range of $1.620 billion to $1.685 billion, lower than the previously issued range of $1.675 billion to $1.775 billion.The company estimates adjusted operating income at the Kidney Care segment in the band of $1.570 billion to $1.600 billion. Notably, the previously issued range was $1.565 billion to $1.625 billion.For the full year, DaVita expects adjusted consolidated operating income in the range of $50 million to $85 million, significantly lower than the previous guidance of $110 million to $150 million.Our TakeDaVita ended third-quarter fiscal 2017 on a mixed note. Strong growth in patient services is likely to boost the company’s growth trajectory in the coming quarters. DaVita’s continuous improvement in Kidney care is commendable as well. The company’s efforts to control expenses hold promise. A compelling inorganic growth story supported by its strong financial position is another positive. However, DaVita is challenged by adverse effects of healthcare reforms, rise in Medicare costs, and an increase in Medicare Advantage (MA) beneficiaries. Also, MA rate cuts are likely to hurt the bottom line in the near future. Lackluster performance by the company’s DMG segment and a slashed guidance for the full year indicate looming concerns ahead for the stock. Sluggishness in the dialysis and lab businesses adds to our concerns.Q3 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceThe Q3 earnings season is drawing to a close, with most of the S&P members having reported their numbers. Medical, one of the broader sectors among the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to put up an impressive show this quarter.PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report) reported earnings per share of 43 cents in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, up 79.2% on a year-over-year basis.

143,DVA,"DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 7, after market close.Last quarter, the company delivered earnings of 92 cents per share, which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents. Over the last four quarters, it delivered an average earnings beat of 1.83%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayDaVita is a leading provider of dialysis services to patients suffering from chronic kidney failure. The company’s Kidney Care business is expected to perform well in the quarter under review owing to its continuous investments in capital-efficient technologies.Steady overseas expansion through strategic alliances and acquisition of dialysis centers has played a key role in boosting the company’s growth. We believe that DaVita’s constant efforts to upgrade its quality of services, global expansion and active acquisitions are key positives.DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Price and EPS Surprise DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Quote Operating cash flow is expected to remain strong in the quarter on the back of an improved performance of the Kidney Care business as well as the capitated care business. Overall, management projected DaVita’s operating income for fiscal 2017 in the range of $1.675-$1.775 billion. Of this, the company expects operating income of $1.565-$1.625 billion for Kidney Care business. Operating cash flow projection for fiscal 2017 is expected at $1.750-$1.950 billion.On the flip side, the company expects to incur significant operating losses within its International business due to lower-than-anticipated clinic acquisitions and slower operating ramp of acquired clinics. This should get reflected in DaVita’s third-quarter performance.Additionally, the issue that may impact the company’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter is the ongoing cost inflation that has continued to outpace the rate increases the company received from its payers.  Also, uncertainties associated with the possibilities of a repeal of the Affordable Care Act under President Trump add to the company’s concerns.Coming to estimate revisions, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being stable at 94 cents per share over the last three months.Earnings WhispersDespite solid prospects, our quantitative model does not conclusively point to an earnings beat for the stock this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, this is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: DaVita has an Earnings ESP of +0.38%.

144,DVA,"On Oct 6, we issued an updated research report on Denver, CO-based DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report), a leading provider of dialysis services in the United States to patients suffering from chronic kidney failure, which is also known as end stage renal disease (ESRD).Over the past six months, shares of the company have been trading below the broader industry. The stock has lost 12.4% compared with the broader industry’s 5.4% declined. Acquiring dialysis centers and businesses that own and operate similar centers and other ancillary services has been DaVita’s preferred business strategy for long. This strategy has boosted the company’s top line to a large extent.Of the major acquisitions in the recent past, The Everett Clinic, a medical group within the DaVita Medical Group division, acquired Totem Lake Family Medicine which is a renowned medical group.Further, DaVita announced that HealthCare Partners has entered into a strategic partnership with Cigna, a global health insurance service company. Per the agreement, the duo will offer HMO (Health Maintenance Organization)  health plans and integrated health care options to employers in and around Los Angeles.Steady expansion in the overseas markets through strategic alliances and acquisition of dialysis centers has played a key role in boosting growth for DaVita. In the past few years, the company has strengthened its position in the emerging and developing markets of Columbia, Portugal, Malaysia, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, China, India and Germany. This is expected to help DaVita deliver more efficient patient care.However, the company expects a hike in its dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses in the upcoming quarters. DaVita’s plan to undertake initiatives to improve its information technology infrastructure is likely to result in higher costs. Investments to support regulatory compliance and legal matters as well as efforts to tap into new business opportunities will drive expenses.Zacks Rank & Key PicksDaVita HealthCare currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the medical sector are Orthofix International N.V. (OFIX  -  Free Report), Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc (IDXX  -  Free Report).

145,DVA,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, DaVita has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.3. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, DaVita’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five year.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at about 18. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that DaVita has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 17.3, which is higher than the current level. So it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near term.P/CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn’t take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business. This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company’s management and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company’s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. However, it is not commonly used for cross-industry comparison, as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry.In this case, DaVita’s P/CF ratio of 5.4 is significantly lower than the industry average of 9.1, which indicates that the stock is hugely undervalued in this respect.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, DaVita currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes DaVita a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, its P/S ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 0.9, which is somewhat better than the industry average of 1. Clearly, DVA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though DaVita might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of A. This gives DVA a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower, while the full year estimate has seen six up and two down in the same time period.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has increased by 1.1% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 1.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Price and Consensus DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Price and Consensus | DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. QuoteEven though DaVita has a better estimates trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). That is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineDaVita is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 18% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, over the past six months, the industry to which it belongs has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to become more favorable, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

The award has been conferred on DaVita’s CA-based facility, also known as Casa PacifiCA building.Notably, the LEED Gold certification is exclusively granted to buildings situated in sustainable sites with strong water, energy, atmosphere, materials and resource efficiencies. Additionally, these buildings should operate under a superior indoor environment and must show innovation in design and regional priority credits. Undoubtedly, DaVita’s Casa PacifiCA building is a solid choice based on the aforementioned criteria.In an initiative to bolster DaVita’s 2020 environmental goals, the company’s operations are conducted in a healthy environment and DaVita is solely committed to improve health care in the United States without violating the basic environmental norms. In this regard, 75% of Casa PacifiCA’s construction waste was diverted from landfills.Shares Lack LusterDaVita has had an unfavorable run on the bourse in the last six months. The stock has lost almost 13.4%, much wider than the broader industry’s decline of just 4.5%. The current level also substantially underperforms the S&P 500’s gain of roughly 4.8%. This deterioration is largely due to the ongoing political conundrum in the U.S. medical world that had initiated since the Presidential elections. High debt levels, adverse effects of healthcare reforms and escalating expenses are other major stock dampeners. Favorable Estimate Revision TrendThe estimate revision trend has been favorable for the company. In the current quarter, two estimates moved north compared with two movements in the opposite direction over the last two months. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the ongoing quarter has inched up 1.1% to 94 cents per share during the same time frame. DaVita carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).For the full year, six estimates moved upward compared with two downward movements. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the full year has increased 1.4% to $3.54 per share over the same period.Our TakeDaVita’s environment-friendly operations are likely to enhance the company’s sustainable growth in the long haul. In fact, DaVita’s Denver-based headquarters were awarded with the LEED Platinum Certification by the USGBC for operations and maintenance efficiencies only last year.Davita’s significant growth in recent times was reflected on the back of strong patient services. Last quarter the company saw solid improvement in Kidney care. DaVita also made crucial efforts to control expenses. The company’s strength basically lies in enhanced service offerings. A compelling inorganic growth story supported by a strong financial position is the key development catalyst at the moment.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

150,DVA,"Denver, CO-based DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc.

Over the last four quarters, the company witnessed an average earnings beat of 2.04%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this quarter.Factors at PlayDavita’s Kidney Care business is expected to perform well in the quarter under review due to its continuous investments in capital-efficient technologies. Steady overseas expansion through strategic alliances and acquisition of dialysis centers has played a key role in boosting DaVita’s growth. We believe that DaVita’s constant efforts to upgrade its quality of services, global expansion and active acquisitions are key positives.Operating cash flow is expected to remain strong in the quarter due to improved performance of the Kidney Care business and the capitated care business. Overall management projected DaVita’s operating income for fiscal 2017 in the range of $1.6–$1.8 billion. Of this, the company expects operating income of $1.5–$1.6 billion for Kidney Care business. Operating cash flow projection for fiscal 2017 is expected at $1.8–$2.0 billion.On the flipside, escalating expenses are a concern. Management expects significant decrease in operational income, especially in the pharmacy business, for fiscal 2017. DaVita expects a hike in its dialysis and related lab services in the quarter, indicating probabilities of an increase in its general and administrative expenses. The company’s plans to improve its information technology infrastructure and support certain regulatory compliance and legal matters are likely to drive expenses in the quarter.Furthermore, uncertainties associated with the possibilities of a repeal of the Affordable Care Act under President Trump add to the company’s concerns.Coming to estimate revisions, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings has been stable at 90 cents per share over the last two months.DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc.

152,DVA,"The price that the United States has to pay for being one of the most socially advanced nations is high-risk emergencies from sexual offence, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. The country relentlessly puts up a fight against these medical issues that call for privacy, anonymity and home-based or Outpatient care. That’s not all. The recent national epidemic of Opioid abuse and President Trump’s fresh “tough on crime” policies to curb it are likely to increase the need for Outpatient rehab centers.Per Future Market Insights, the global Outpatient clinics market is expected to witness a CAGR of 4.3% and reach $39,000 million by 2022, with America as a strong contributor.Here we discuss how Medical Outpatient and home healthcare have been creating opportunities for investors keen on parking their money in the healthcare space.What is Driving the Medical Outpatient Market?Growth of the global Outpatient clinics depends on various macroeconomic factors. A research report by Fierce Healthcare suggests that Outpatient care makes up at least 40% of the net U.S. health system spending.Cost Effectiveness of the Outpatient ServicesNotably, all the Outpatient and home-based care include immediate curative measures and do not require patients to stay for long hours at clinics or hospitals.The primary advantage of the Outpatient market is the huge service costs of the fancy healthcare organizations that are generally avoided by lower income groups. Middle-class Americans, i.e. more than 62% of the total population prefer visiting the Outpatient clinics to reduce out-of-pocket expenses.Technological AdvancementsThe rapid adoption of the Outpatient services can also be attributed to technological advances, which has made procedures quicker and less complicated.Outpatient Rehab & Treatment Centers A research report by the Transparency Market Research suggests that Americans are increasingly getting addicted to a variety of drugs, which are affecting health and family to a large extent. Outpatient rehabs have a major role to play, since treatment is comparatively cheaper than the inpatient and residential treatments.In this regard, MedTech behemoth DaVita Inc (DVA  -  Free Report) deserves a mention. In 2017, The Everett Clinic, a division of DaVita, received the Washington State Medical Association's (WSMA) highest award for patient safety in the category of excellence for their chronic opioid therapy work.DaVita’s internal efforts to curb unsafe opioid prescribing have been successful. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).So, here we take a look at three companies that are poised to gain from the rising influence of Outpatient services in healthcare.Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report)Chemed’s VITAS Healthcare segment provides hospice and palliative care services for patients with terminal illnesses. This type of care is aimed at making a terminally ill patient’s last days comfortable and painless.Hospice care is available for patients who have been initially certified or re-certified as terminally ill (a prognosis of six months or less) by their attending physician. VITAS offer all levels of hospice care in a given market, including routine home care, inpatient care and continuous care. More than 95% of the company’s revenues are derived through Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement programs.Chemed carries a Zacks Rank #3. Over the past three months, Chemed has been outperforming the industry. The stock has gained 16.9% compared with the industry’s 14.2% rise.  BioScrip, Inc (BIOS  -  Free Report)BioScrip has been recording persistent growth in the core Infusion Services business where it has a strong presence and enjoys competitive advantage. BioScrip witnessed consistent growth in this business primarily on account of strong organic growth particularly in chronic, nutrition and other therapies.To bolster the Infusion services business, BioScrip has taken a number of steps to focus on the core Infusion business.In the past three months, BioScrip has outperformed the industry it belongs to. The company’s shares have returned 14.3%. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3. Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (DGX  -  Free Report)We are upbeat about the long-term growth prospects that are expected to deliver positive outcomes in the upcoming period. With baby boomers moving into Medicare and living longer, the company is benefiting from population growth and favorable demographics.Esoteric testing business is growing rapidly as physician medicine drives demand for advanced esoteric tests. Per an analysis by Research and Market, the global clinical laboratory testing market is expected to reach $198.5 billion by 2024.Year to date, Quest Diagnostics has outperformed the industry it belongs to, with 11.7% returns.

But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

Lately, the company, in collaboration with Texas-based Methodist Specialty and Transplant Hospital, announced the launch of the Transplant Waitlist Support Program. The aim is to help keep waitlisted patients transplant-ready by deploying a technology-enabled solution.Developments like these are likely to help DaVita in registering solid quarterly results.In fourth-quarter 2017, DaVita acquired nine dialysis centers, opened 36 new centers and closed four in the United States. DaVita also acquired six dialysis centers, opened two centers and closed one center outside the United States. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the number of dialysis centers in the current quarter is pegged at 2.686, down 2.2% sequentially.Other Factors at PlayGuidanceFor 2018, the company projects Kidney Care consolidated operating income in the range of $1.5-$1.6 billion. Operating cash flow from continuing operations is estimated in the band of $1.4-$1.6 billion.The effective tax rate is expected in the range of 26.5-27.5%.A solid guidance such as this raises optimism in the company’s upcoming quarterly results.ReimbursementsCalcimimetics, a drug used to treat mineral bone disease, just moved into dialysis reimbursement with introduction of an injectable drug called Presibib.Though it is early to understand the full picture, the management is optimistic about its probable contributions to the quarterly results.Acquisition PerilsWith surging labor cost inflation, DaVita is likely to witness solid margin pressure in the traditional Medicare fee-for-service business.The series of acquisitions of dialysis centers by DaVita may affect operations, debt-to-capital ratio, capital expenditures or other aspects of the business.Further, joint ventures and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational and compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment.Our ModelOur quantitative model predicts an earnings beat for DaVIta in the upcoming quarterly results.This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.

155,DVA,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, DaVita has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.3. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, DaVita’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at about 21.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that DaVita has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 16.5, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too.P/CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn’t take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business. This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company’s management and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company’s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. However, it is not commonly used for cross-industry comparison, as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry.In this case, DaVita’s P/CF ratio of 8.8 is significantly lower than the industry average of 10.6, which indicates that the stock is undervalued in this respect.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, DaVita currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes DaVita a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for the stock is 8.9, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 13.3. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Also, its P/S ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 0.9, which is somewhat better than the industry average of 1.1. Clearly, DVA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though DaVita might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of A. This gives DVA a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower, while the full year estimate has seen four up and two down in the same time period.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has increased by 7.1% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched higher by 8.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:DaVita Inc. Price and Consensus DaVita Inc. Price and Consensus | DaVita Inc. QuoteEven though DaVita has a better estimates trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). That is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineDaVita is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 34% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. In fact, over the past three months, the industry to which it belongs has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

156,DVA,"Investors with an interest in Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare stocks have likely encountered both DaVita HealthCare (DVA  -  Free Report) and U.S. Physical Therapy (USPH  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.DaVita HealthCare and U.S. Physical Therapy are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #4 (Sell), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that DVA likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than USPH has recently. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.DVA currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.27, while USPH has a forward P/E of 41.27. We also note that DVA has a PEG ratio of 1.03. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. USPH currently has a PEG ratio of 3.67.Another notable valuation metric for DVA is its P/B ratio of 2.59. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, USPH has a P/B of 6.07.Based on these metrics and many more, DVA holds a Value grade of A, while USPH has a Value grade of C.DVA is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that DVA is likely the superior value option right now.

159,DVA,"McKesson Corporation’s (MCK  -  Free Report) first-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings are scheduled to release on Jul 26, before the market opens. While the quarterly results are likely to drive growth at the core Distribution Solutions segment, its strategic initiatives might boost the bottom line.However, McKesson’s performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 lacked luster, with adjusted earnings of $3.49 per share missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues came in at $51.63 billion, slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $51.64 billion but increased 4% at constant currency (cc).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues stands at $53 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 3.9%.

Despite weak pricing trends and customer consolidation, the company’s distribution solutions segment has consistently performed well in fiscal 2018. We expect the trend to continue in the quarter to be reported as well.Notably, this Distribution Solutions segment caters to a wide range of customers and businesses. It stands to benefit from increased generic utilization, inflation in generics driven by several patent expirations in the next few years, and an aging population.At the end of fiscal 2018, revenues at this unit grew significantly and contributed to the company’s total revenues. This upside was driven by increase in market share and strategic acquisitions.Upbeat View/GuidanceMcKesson declared preliminary results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 in June.

160,DVA,"It takes just one super deal to turn the odds in your favor. Did the clinical laboratory services market just spin the wheel of fortune? Let’s see what happened.On May 24, Quest Diagnostics announced an expanded long-term strategic partnership agreement with UnitedHealthcare, a business of UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report), to operate as a preferred national laboratory for all of the company’s members starting Jan 1, 2019. This expanded agreement will provide in-network access to Quest Diagnostics’ complete portfolio of laboratory services to more than 48 million eligible members.Under the expanded tie-up, the companies are going to join forces on a variety of value-based programs. At the same time, Laboratory Corporation of Americas Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), popularly known as LabCorp, has been hogging the spotlight on the news of the company losing its exclusive right to serve UnitedHealthcare post Jan 1. Meanwhile, LabCorp announced the extension of its partnership agreement with Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) the next day. Per the expanded agreement, LabCorp will serve as a preferred national laboratory for almost all of the company’s members starting next year. The extended agreement will provide in-network access to LabCorp’s complete portfolio of laboratory services to over 20 million eligible members.According to CNBC, Quest Diagnostics will lose its exclusivity to serve as a preferred laboratory partner to Aetna’s members.Notably, both the diagnostic testing lab stalwarts’ stocks have been trading higher than the S&P 500 index since May 24.Per Morgan Stanley’s analyst Ricky Goldwasser, these deals will result in the elimination of the long-time problem of contract overhang and will thereby result in a cognitive environment for pricing in the near term. He also commented ""... Labs are relative safe havens within the health care services sector.""Conforming to this idea, we believe that there are other factors which work as growth drivers for the clinical laboratory services market. Let’s delve deeper.Here we need to consider MarketsandMarkets data which shows that the global clinical laboratory services market is headed to reach a worth of $146.41 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 5.2% between 2017 and 2022.Most of the analysts believe an aging demography is primarily acting in favor of this. Per an article commissioned by the National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health, 8.5% of the global population is aged 65 years and above.Strengthening emerging markets are also going to provide impetus to the burgeoning global clinical laboratory services market. According to an article published in Report Buyer, the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region will be the largest market for the clinical laboratory services between 2017 and 2022. Growing disposable income among the middle-class people along with increasing access to state-of-the art clinical laboratory technologies will drive the upside.According to some analysts, technological advancements in the form of integrated workflow management systems and database management tools are helping the companies expand their sample processing ability every year. Meanwhile, enhancements in laboratory testing technology will continue to boost demand for laboratory services.Stocks to Watch Out ForHere we highlight three companies that are striving to cash in on the bountiful opportunities in the clinical laboratory services market.Genomic Health, Inc. (GHDX  -  Free Report): Based in Redwood City, CA, Genomic Health develops and markets genomic-based clinical laboratory services that analyze the underlying biology of cancer, enabling physicians and patients to make treatment-related decisions.This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has delivered a positive earnings surprise in two of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 226.4%.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Quest Diagnostics (DGX  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Secaucus, NJ, Quest Diagnostics is a leading provider of diagnostic testing information and services in the United States and globally.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, the average earnings beat being 3.4%.DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Denver, CO, DaVita is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services for patients suffering from chronic kidney failure or end stage renal disease. It also provides related lab services in outpatient dialysis centers.This Zacks Rank #3 company has delivered positive earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters, the average beat being 0.9%.PAMA: A DownerLike all other markets, the clinical lab space has its own issues to deal with.Changes in governmental regulations may have a significant impact on company operations. In the last couple of years, several reimbursement issues have been hurting revenues. Majority of the companies are concerned about the CMS' (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) latest Medicare reimbursement reduction as a result of the implementation of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA).This has been a major dampener for testing laboratories. As said by LabCorp earlier, the new PAMA rates published by CMS do not reflect the intent of Congress when it directed CMS to implement market-based Medicare rates for lab testing. The statement says, “The process CMS followed to determine these rates was fatally flawed and failed to account for significant segments of the lab market by excluding 99 percent of all U.S. labs from reporting data and limiting data collection to 1 percent of laboratories, dominated by independent labs.”However, per an article on GenomeWeb, companies like Myriad Genetics (MYGN  -  Free Report), Veracyte and Luminex Corporation among others, which have their own proprietary tests, will for obvious reasons enjoy an edge and more control over pricing.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

162,DVA,"Strong operating performance of health insurers for the past many years continued in the first quarter of 2018. Higher medical enrollment, surging revenues, medical cost management and an increasing share of revenues from complementary services helped results. Most of the major players raised their earnings guidance for 2018, reflecting solid operating environment down the road. Moreover, a strong U.S. economy has held the health insurance industry in good stead. A record-low unemployment rate and gradual wage increase bode well for the space. High employment and wage growth fuel demand for health insurance and various other health-related services provided by these insurers. The overall bullishness reinforces our sentiment that the growth cadence for the sector should continue. Despite being tied by a strict regulatory regime and a fast-changing industry backdrop, insurers have time and again emerged as winners. To put it into perspective, revenues and earnings of almost all dominant health insurers have shown a secular rise since 2010, when a sweeping and historical health care reform was put into effect by ex-president Obama.Ever since the enactment of the healthcare reform act, numerous changes have gone into effect, which have altered the traditional operating model of the health insurers. The ensuing changes were taken sportingly by health insurers, which then adapted themselves to the changed industry dynamics. A shift in business mix from commercial to government, the way care is delivered from fee for service to value for care, greater emphasis on medical cost management, growing consumerism and technical innovations have been the game changers. Rapid evolution is, however, continuing in the industry. Given the need of the hour, players in the industry are taking concerted efforts to transform themselves into comprehensive health care providers from their earlier role of being traditional payers. The same is being effectuated by a cross-sector collaboration wherein health insurers are foraying into another realm of the health care sector such as pharmacy benefit management, ambulatory care and physician services. Some of the deals that are underway in this vein are the merger of CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) with Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) take over od Express Script Holding Co. (ESRX  -  Free Report) as well as the UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) acquisition of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report). All said, the industry has remained an outperformer having generated returns higher than the S&P 500 index in each year since 2012. In the past five years, the health insurance industry has returned a whopping 257% compared with the S&P 500 index’s gain of 91%. Is Further Upside Potential Left? While the industry has outperformed the broader market, valuations remain at the same level as that of the industry.The Zacks HMO industry is currently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 16.95 which is near 17 for the S&P 500 index as a whole. Over the last five years, the industry has traded in a range of 10.6 to 20.1, with a median of 15.3. We therefore go a bit further and look at the PEG ratio which bakes in the growth rate of the industry. The industry’s PEG ratio is 1.3, which compares favorably with the industry’s PEG ratio of 1.8. This shows that the industry is undervalued and has room for upside. Zacks Industry Rank Within the Zacks Industry classification, health insurers are broadly grouped in the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). We rank 256 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We club our industries into two groups: the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

163,DVA,"DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 13, after the market closes.In the third quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of 81 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents. Earnings deteriorated 14.7% on a year-over-year basis. Further, revenues in the last quarter improved 5.1% year over year to $3.92 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.89 billion. However, the company reported an average negative earnings surprise of 1.9% in the trailing four quarters.Over the last year, shares of DaVita have outperformed the broader industry. The stock has returned 13.3% against the industry’s decline of 5.5%. DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Price and Consensus  DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Price and Consensus | DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Quote Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Factors to ConsiderAcquisition-driven Growth: Acquiring dialysis centers and businesses that own and operate similar centers as well as other ancillary services is DaVita’s preferred business strategy. These strategies have bolstered the company’s top line.In 2017, DaVita announced that HealthCare Partners, a unit within its medical group, has entered into a strategic partnership with Cigna, a global health insurance service company that offers health, dental, supplemental insurance and Medicare plans to individuals, families and businesses.While the acquisitions are expected to widen the company’s client base in the fourth quarter, the merger augmented its primary care and specialty physician services as well as hospital and other healthcare services.Overseas Growth: DaVita is steadily expanding in the international markets. In the past few years, the company has strengthened its position in the emerging and developing markets of Brazil, China, Colombia, Germany, India, Malaysia, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Saudi Arabia through strategic alliances as well as acquisitions of dialysis centers. These are expected to help DaVita deliver efficient patient care.View for Q4 and 2017: The company expects adjusted operating income in the Kidney Care segment in the range of $1.57-$1.6 billion compared with the previous range of $1.565-$1.625 billion. The range has been tightened as hurricanes are likely to have negative impact on earnings in the fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter is pinned at $3.9 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 4.9%. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 91 cents for adjusted earnings per share, shows year-over-year decline of 7.1% in growth.Consequently, management is not upbeat about earnings in the upcoming quarter.Labor Union Woes: In California, labor unions proposed a ballot initiative that is likely to alter DaVita’s footprint in the state. If they proceed with the initiative, the company might have to incur significant onetime costs in 2018 to support their advocacy efforts. This is likely to dampen the company’s top-line growth in the fourth quarter.Debt Dependence: Debt refinancing continues to keep DaVita’s financial leverage at high levels. The company depends upon future borrowings to pay debt and fund other liquidity requirements. Additional debts in connection with the HealthCare Partners’ transaction have elevated the outstanding debt levels and are expected to increase borrowing costs.Plagued by the above headwinds, DaVita is unlikely to deliver an earnings beat in fourth-quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not indicate earnings beat for DaVita HealthCare in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: DaVita has an earnings ESP of -2.2%%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: DaVita carries a Zacks Rank #2. Nevertheless, an unfavorable Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.AmerisourceBergen (ABC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.40% and a Zacks Rank #3.Centene (CNC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.92% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

Price and Consensus | DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. QuoteWhy EHR?EHR is an individual’s official health document that is shared among multiple facilities and agencies.CKD and end-stage renal diseases lead to expenses, wherein coordination becomes critical. Effectively managing patients with CKD is important to ensure healthy transition to dialysis, if the patient contracts end-stage renal disease. Unprepared transition to dialysis makes a patient prone to infection, which may become incurable. Poor transition management is also costly.Through this alliance with Epic, DaVita will provide the community, with information and insights to reduce costs and facilitate care.What’s Next?DaVita Physician Solutions will be taking the next step in its evolution with Epic over the next 18-24 months. Existing customers will be offered a migration path to the new solution software for office-based DaVita CKD EHR.Thriving Market ProspectsWith the number of ESRD patients on dialysis expected to double to 850,000 in the next decade, focusing on the use of technology for healthy transitions becomes important.According to a research conducted by MarketsAndMarkets, the healthcare IT market is projected to reach $208.25 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 15.9%.Growing demand to manage regulatory compliance through healthcare IT solutions, government support for the same and rising need to curtail escalating healthcare costs are key catalysts.Shares Look UpDaVita had an impressive run on the bourses over the last year.

165,DVA,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.’s (WBA  -  Free Report) Retail Pharmacy USA division continued to witness comparable prescription growth as well as strength in retail prescription market. Several planned developments, early benefits of new pharmacy contracts as well as an increase in volume owing to previously announced pharmacy partnerships have been driving growth in this space over the past few quarters. We expect this momentum to get reflected in fiscal first-quarter 2018 results, which are scheduled for release on Jan 4.Moreover, rising expenditure on prescription drugs and growing demand for specialty drugs have been strengthening the retail pharmacy market. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board expects this trend to continue. Per the report, prescription drug spending is projected to grow roughly 7% between 2018 and 2019.Challenges in the Retail Pharmacy USAPer management, the pharmacy business is affected by reimbursement pressure and a shift in pharmacy mix toward 90-day at retail (one prescription that is equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions) and Medicare Part D prescriptions. Moreover, the company expects these factors to affect first-quarter fiscal 2018 results.Moreover, collaborations among generic producers and a rise in generic dispensing rate (the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed) raise caution.The speculated entry of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) in the retail pharmacy market has aggravated matters. To counter competition, Walgreens Boots will have to add more digital and customer-friendly programs.Intensifying competition owing to mergers and acquisitions is also a matter of concern. In this regard, CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) announced a historic decision to acquire health insurance giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report). Following the announcement of the CVS-Aetna deal, another leading health service company — Optum, part of the UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) — announced plans to acquire DaVita Medical Group, a leading independent medical group and a subsidiary of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report). Moreover, it is being speculated that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) might soon announce the acquisition of health and well-being company, Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) to fend off competition.Steps to Counter ObstacleWalgreens Boots has been leaving no stone unturned to counter challenges.In this regard, the company has been developing and expanding relationships with commercial third-party payers to permit new and enhanced market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks. Notably, CVS health has announced plans to set up a new 30,000-store performance-based pharmacy network fixed by CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens Boots, as well as up to 10,000 community-based independently-owned pharmacies in the United States.Per management, the prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time. The company’s 90-day at retail prescription drug offering is a lower margin one in comparison to 30-day prescriptions. However, it helps the company tap into opportunities pertaining to patients with chronic prescription needs. It also offers increased convenience and cost efficiency. The company’s U.S. loyalty program, Balance Rewards, also bodes well. Notably, as of Aug 31, 2017, the number of active Balance Rewards members totaled 88.2 million.Rite Aid Deal a PositiveWe currently look forward to the company's agreement to purchase a limited number of Rite Aid Corporation (RAD) stores. While the transition process of these stores is underway, the company expects this phased acquisition to be completed by spring 2018. Notably, Walgreens Boots has purchased 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for a total transaction value of $4.375 billion.Although the deal is not going to impact the yet-to-be-reported quarter’s results, a number of aspects of it should prove beneficial in 2018. In this regard, the final Rite Aid deal agreement retained the clause to allow Rite Aid to buy generic drugs sourced through a Walgreens Boots’ affiliate at a cost equivalent to Walgreens Boots’ for about 10 years. Also, Rite Aid will provide Walgreens Boots with certain transition services for up to three years post deal closure.This apart, the deal’s financial value is quite attractive. Post the transaction’s initial closing, synergies of $300 million are expected to be realized within four years. This will be derived primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters.Per Walgreens Boots, this modified merger contract will extend its growth strategy and offer operational plus financial benefits. It will also help the company expand and optimize retail pharmacy network in key U.S. markets, including the Northeast. Notably, the stores to be purchased are located primarily in the Northeast and Southern United States, while the sites of three distribution centers to be bought are in Dayville, CT; Philadelphia, PA and Spartanburg, S.C. However, to achieve the desired results, the company will have to incur huge expenditures to fully integrate and rebrand the retained stores.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Walgreens Boots is likely to beat earnings in first quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Walgreens Boots has an Earnings ESP of +3.97%.

166,DVA,"A wholly owned subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) has signed a definitive purchase agreement and is set to launch a tender offer for Empresas Banmédica — an initial step toward acquiring the Chilean company.The deal, valued at nearly $2.8 billion, will enhance UnitedHealth’s footprint in South America. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018, subject to customary terms and conditions.UnitedHealth already has a presence in South America, backed by its acquisition of Amil Participacoes SA in 2012, which made the former an operator of hospitals and clinics in Brazil.The above-mentioned deal will likely be beneficial for UnitedHealth, given Banmedica’s 25-year expertise in Latin America with the largest private health groups in Chile, Colombia and Peru. Further, this acquisition will boost UnitedHealth’s international operations.Diversifying geographically is one of the crucial long-term growth strategies of the company at a time when stringent and uncertain regulations are adversely impacting the U.S. healthcare industry.  Pressure on profit margins in the U.S. market has compelled American health insurers to target foreign markets for continued growth and profitability, since these markets are less penetrated and offer more competition. Notably, Asia and Europe provide the best near-term opportunities for U.S. health insurers.Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group lead the private health insurance industry in terms of international deals, followed by Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and Humana Inc. (HUM). These deals are either mergers and acquisitions, or joint ventures with local insurance companies.Some of the deals made by the players in this field reflect the emerging trend of globalization.  Recently, Aetna acquired U.K.-based Bupa Group’s Thai business — Bupa Thailand — which will significantly fortify the presence of the former in Asia. Earlier, it had bought U.K.-based company, InterGlobal, which offers private medical insurance to groups and individuals in the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Europe.Another insurer, Cigna, operates in India through a joint venture with TTK Group.Notably, UnitedHealth seems focused on achieving fast-paced growth and mergers and acquisitions remain its top priority. In 2017, the company made a number of acquisitions in its health services segment — Optum. The latest deal includes the buyout of DaVita Medical Group — a unit of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) — which was announced early this month.Expansion of the Optum segment remains one of its primary goals, followed by growth of international operations.In last six months, the stock has gained 20%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 18%.UnitedHealth currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
