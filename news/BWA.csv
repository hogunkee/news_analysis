2,BWA,"After months of rhetorical tariff threats between Washington and Beijing, the world’s two largest economies have declared a trade war. This is especially true as Trump’s 25% tariff on $34 billion in Chinese goods, including auto, electric cars, aerospace, communications tech, new materials and robotics became reality at 12:01 A.M. on Jul 6 and another $16 billion is expected to go into effect in two weeks.China also hit back with the same scale and strength, slapping charges on American goods targeting heartland staples like soybeans, corn, pork and poultry. The United States has violated World Trade Organization rules and ignited the largest trade war in economic history,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement. With retaliation from Beijing, Trump has issued warnings of additional tariffs on $500 billion in Chinese goods.The latest move marked the escalation of the trade war from threat to reality and would result in a global recession. It would hurt global supply chains, increase costs for businesses and consumers and slow down investments. Canada, Mexico and Europe are also engaged in tit-for-tat tariff exchange with the United States. As a result, the ongoing development suggests that the worst, which could send shockwaves across stock markets, is yet to come.Against such a backdrop, there are a few places where investors can stash their cash in the stock world and a few that should be avoided.Best ZonesGoldIn difficult market environments, gold is considered a great store of value and hedge against market turmoil. Acting as a leveraged play on the underlying metal prices, metal miners tend to experience more gains than their bullion cousins in a rising metal market. Hence, mining stocks could outperform in the current trade turmoil. As such, Yamana Gold Inc. (AUY) seems a lucrative pick as it carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A. The stock has risen 8.1% over the past month.Consumer StaplesThe consumer staples sector is defensive as it includes a variety of items like food & beverages, non-durable household goods, hypermarkets and consumer supercenters that are every-day essentials. These products see steady demand even during an economic downturn due to their low level of correlation with economic cycles. As such, these generally act as a safe haven amid political and economic turmoil. Stocks in these sectors generally outperform during periods of low growth and high uncertainty. Among these, B&G Foods Inc. (BGS) has gained 12% over the past one month. It carries a Zacks Rank #2 and a Momentum Score of B.Small CapsSmall-cap stocks have been the winners amid trade and tariff threats, and are likely to continue their outperformance. This is because small-cap stocks have less international exposure and generate most of their revenues from the domestic market. These pint-sized stocks are less vulnerable to a trade war or any other political issue and could better insulate investors from Trump’s protectionist stance. Rent-A-Center Inc. (RCII) having a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A is among the biggest gainers in a month’s time, rising 42.5%.  High DividendThe dividend-paying securities are the major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk. These stocks offer the safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to the large swings in stock prices. The companies that offer dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis. While there are several top-ranked options available in the space, Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report) looks impressive given its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and one-month return of 13.5%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Worst ZonesFarm BeltU.S. farmers and food producers are in the crosshairs of a global trade conflict. Tariffs were already imposed by Canada on beef and by Mexico on pork and ham imports. Another round of tariff from China on soybeans and pork also come into effect in response to Trump’s latest tariff implementation. Soybean exporters like Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) and meat producers like Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) and Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) would be hit. ADM has a Zacks Rank #2 and added 3.6% in a month while the other two has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). TSN is down 2.3% and HRL is up 1.7%.AutoThe potential tariffs on cars and auto components are the greatest threats to the auto industry. Global Automakers President and CEO John Bozzella warned “tariff hikes would raise prices, make it more expensive to produce cars and trucks in the United States. He said the tariffs could cause a slowdown in sales and production, which would not be good for either American consumers or autoworkers.” BorgWarner Inc. (BWA  -  Free Report) shed 13.9% in a month and has a Zacks Rank #3.SemiconductorsTrump’s import tariff on Chinese products will compel American semiconductor companies to pay duties on their own products. This is because chips are manufactured in the United States but are shipped to the Asian nation for assembly, testing and packaging due to its favorable labor costs, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. Some of the worst-hit chip stocks include Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Micron (MU  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report). INTC, MU and TXN were down 12.9%, 12.9% and 5.9%, respectively. However, these stocks have a favorable Zacks rank.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

On Apr 24, PACCAR Inc. (PCAR  -  Free Report) and Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter earnings. Both the companies reported earnings beat for the quarter.Per the latest Earnings Preview, 87 companies from the S&P 500 category have already announced first-quarter results as of Apr 20, registering earnings and revenue beat ratios of 82.8% and 67.8%, respectively.However, on a year-over-year basis, the auto sector’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter is expected to record a decline of 9.6% while the top line is likely to fall 3.4%. However, the S&P 500 companies are estimated to record respective 18.3% and 7.7% year-over-year rise in earnings and revenues during the quarter.An improved economy and shift in consumer preferences toward trucks and sports utility vehicles (SUV) encouraged automakers to launch new models in the U.S. market with an aim to earn their share of profit. In Europe, automakers are witnessing a decline in vehicle sales. Per European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, vehicle registrations edged down 0.6% in first-quarter 2018. This decline is majorly due to slowing economic growth and uncertain trading regulations, once U.K. pulls itself out of European Union.Now, let’s evaluate how the four auto companies namely General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), BorgWarner Inc. (BWA  -  Free Report), LKQ Corporation (LKQ  -  Free Report) and Lear Corporation (LEA  -  Free Report) are placed ahead of reporting quarterly figures on Apr 26.We relied on the proven Zacks quantitative model, combining a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) with a positive Earnings ESP, to predict the chances of earnings beat this quarter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that with an ideal combination of the two key ingredients — Zacks Rank and ESP — chances of a positive surprise are as high as 70% for the stocks, which are lined up for an earnings release.Detroit, MI-based General Motors offers a complete range of vehicles to cater to the needs of customers. Its products range from electric cars to heavy-duty full-size trucks. The company offers products under eight distinctive automotive brands namely, Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Cadillac, Holden, Baojun, Wuling, and Jiefang. Our model does not predict that the company, with an Earnings ESP of -2.21% and a Zacks Rank #3, is likely to beat on earnings as the combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.In the last reported quarter, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. It also beat estimates in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 18.4%. General Motors has long-term earnings growth rate of 8.4%.

11,BWA,"Amid increasing volatility in the markets, it’s difficult to pick stocks that will provide solid returns. So, it’s better to take the help of an expert. In this case, by following broker recommendations, one can easily find investment worthy stocks.Brokers have deeper insight into what’s happening in a particular company as they directly communicate with management. Also, they have a comprehensive understanding of the overall industry.Brokers research on a company’s publicly available financial statements, listen to conference calls and engage in talks directly with top management. At times, they even talk with customers to gauge what they like or dislike about the products and services offered by the company.Further, brokers understand the company fundamentals and try to place them against the present economic background to figure out how it may fare as an investment. Hence, after thorough research, brokers decide to rate that particular company’s stock. So, when an analyst upgrades a stock, one can easily depend on it.However, solely depending on analysts’ upgrades is not the right way to build an investment portfolio.

12,BWA,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put BorgWarner Inc. (BWA  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, BorgWarner has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.5, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, BorgWarner’ current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Automotive - Original Equipment industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 13.3. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that BorgWarner has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 11.4. so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for BorgWarner stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, BorgWarner has a P/S ratio of about 1. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, BWA is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, BorgWarner currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes BorgWarner a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the P/CF ratio for BorgWarner is  7.9, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 8. Clearly, BWA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though BorgWarner might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of B. This gives BWA a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen one estimate to go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower, while the full year estimate has seen eight up and no down in the same time period.This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 2% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has gone up by 3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:BorgWarner Inc. Price and Consensus BorgWarner Inc. Price and Consensus | BorgWarner Inc. QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineBorgWarner is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 27% out of more than 250 industries) further strengthens its growth potential. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

13,BWA,"Genuine Parts Company (GPC  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 19.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 0.9%. Over the trailing four quarters, it topped estimates twice, while missing the same in the other two, with an average surprise of a negative of 1.79%.Shares of Genuine Parts have underperformed the industry it belongs to in the last three months. The stock has lost 13.5% compared with the industry’s 10.3% decline. Genuine Parts Company Price and EPS Surprise  Genuine Parts Company Price and EPS Surprise | Genuine Parts Company Quote Let’s see, how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.Factors Influencing This QuarterThe company regularly undertakes acquisitions to expand the business. In November 2017, Genuine Parts completed the acquisition of Alliance Automotive Group (""AAG""), the second largest parts distribution platform in Europe. This assisted the company to expand footprint in the European markets. This has also aided it to raise future expectations. The to-be-reported quarterly results are likely to be positively impacted by the contribution from AAG's operations.Further, to boost top-and bottom-line growth, the company is focusing to expand the product line to penetrate new markets.However, rising cost of labor and delivery, as well as ongoing planned IT spending, is resulting in a continuous rise of its Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses that are hampering the gross margin figure.Also, the company’s long-term debt increased to $2.6 billion in 2017 in comparison with $550 million in the prior year. High debt means that a huge share of Genuine Parts earnings will be given to the debt holders as interest, thereby lowering contributions for shareholders.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Genuine Parts is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Genuine Parts has an Earnings ESP of -0.38% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.31 and $1.32, respectively. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Genuine Parts carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, this combined with its Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few auto stocks worth considering, comprising the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat this time around:Cummins Inc. (CMI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.20% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company’s first-quarter 2018 financial results are expected to be released on May 1.

14,BWA,"Per Reuters, Volkswagen AG’s (VLKAY  -  Free Report) truck-and-bus unit, Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH agreed to form a strategic alliance with Hino Motors, Ltd., a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation (TM  -  Free Report), to develop self-driving capabilities and lower-emission vehicles.Intended to strengthen their market position as commercial-vehicle manufacturers, the two automakers will join forces to deal with rising investment costs related to the development of autonomous vehicles and new transportation services including ride sharing.The combined forces will work on research and development, technology and procurement of gasoline-electric and diesel hybrid engines as well as self-driving technologies. This will enable both the companies to benefit from economies of scale and come up with innovative products at a fast pace compared with the time required while working separately.Volkswagen AG Price and Consensus Volkswagen AG Price and Consensus | Volkswagen AG QuoteHowever, the partnership between the two subsidiary units won’t change the competition that Volkswagen and Toyota share in the passenger-car market.Volkswagen Truck & Bus is the third-largest commercial vehicle manufacturer in the world, which reportedly sold roughly 205,000 units in 2017 and caters Europe and South America under the brand names MAN, Scania and Volkswagen Caminhoes e Onibus.

15,BWA,"On Apr 11, we issued an updated research report on Penske Automotive Group, Inc. (PAG  -  Free Report).The automotive and commercial truck dealership company is expanding dealership network to boost earnings. At the end of 2017, it operated 20 medium and heavy-duty truck dealerships in the United States and Canada, which sold 2,294 units and generated $308.2 million revenues. The company also acquires other existing dealerships to increase dealership-count in regions where it has a limited presence.In order to expand international presence, in January, the company completed the acquisition of The Car People, a used-vehicle seller based in the United Kingdom. The acquisition is anticipated to generate annualized revenues of roughly $300 million. Prior to this, in February 2017, Penske Automotive bought another U.K.-based used-vehicle retailer, CarShop.Penske Automotive Group, Inc. Price and Consensus Penske Automotive Group, Inc. Price and Consensus | Penske Automotive Group, Inc. Quote These acquisitions will help the company to reinforce its position in the U.K. by developing the used-car business segment, which is the second-largest market for Penske Automotive. In 2017, its U.K. market contributed 33% in total revenues compared with 32% recorded in the year-ago period.In order to boost shareholders’ confidence, Penske Automotive engages in regular share repurchase programs and dividend payments.  In almost every quarter, the company increased the quarterly dividend from preceding payouts by roughly 1 cent. In January 2018, it hiked to 34 cents from the prior payout of 33 cents for fourth-quarter 2017.However, Penske Automotive is witnessing a gradual decline in volume growth. In fourth-quarter 2017, new and used-vehicle volume grew 7%, sequentially, compared with 10% and 13%, recorded in the second and third quarter of 2017. This might hamper its financials if the similar trend continues.Also, competition among peers and exposure to foreign currency fluctuations might slow down company’s growth.Price PerformanceIn the last six months, shares of Penske Automotive have underperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has lost 4.7%, wider than the industry’s decline of 0.9%. Zacks Rank & Key PicksPenske Automotive carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

19,BWA,"An earnings announcement is an important event and has a large impact on an investors’ opinion about the current and future value of a particular company. A positive earnings report can lead to price appreciation, which produces higher returns for its investors.That said, earnings releases for different sectors, including the Auto segment, are now pouring in. Per the latest Earnings Outlook, as of Jan 31, 185 companies from the S&P 500 index have already announced results for the quarter ending Dec 31, 2017, registering earnings and revenue beat ratios of 82.2% and 80%, respectively. Earnings and revenues beat ratios for the companies coming from the Auto sector are 66.7% and 100%, respectively.The auto sector’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter is expected to register 10.3% growth, while the top line is likely to witness a 2.5% year-over-year decline. However, the S&P 500 companies are estimated to register 11.9% and 7.6% year-over-year rise in earnings and revenues, respectively, during the quarter.Now, let’s take a look at the auto companies slated to report results in the next few weeks. After a record 2016, auto sales in the United States declined in 2017. This is the first time since the financial crisis that auto sales have declined from the previous-year figure.According to Autodata, in 2017, auto sales in the United States were 17.2 million, down from 17.85 million in the prior year. Despite the decline, 2017 overall was a robust year for the auto industry. Auto sales are likely to decline further in 2018 despite a strong economy. Rising interest rates and return of a huge number of late-model used cars are coming in the way of new vehicle sales.Auto Sales: On A Rough TrackAuto companies have come up with January 2018 sales figures. In January, Ford Motor Company (F) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. reported year-over-year sales decline, whereas General Motors Company (GM) and Toyota Motor Corporation reported an increase in sales.Major automakers expect auto sales in 2018 to remain weak. Dealing with consumers’ changing preferences; a shift from passenger cars to pickup trucks and SUVs will be a challenge for automakers.Also in the coming days, vehicle sales will depend not only on different conventional determinants such as the energy price and state of the economy, but also on some new factors, such as the progress made in the electric and autonomous vehicle driving front.Auto Stocks: Some Bright SpotsIn an otherwise gloomy environment, there are certainly some discernible bright spots. Healthy economic growth, better employment and record high consumer confidence are likely to give an impetus to auto demand. Also, the tax cuts should provide some extra advantage to profits and sales.Also, some investors are moving into auto stocks with the belief that the high-margin pickup trucks and SUVs will pull automakers through any downturn.The Zacks MethodologyIrrespective of the outlook of the auto sector, there are a few auto stocks which are likely to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the fourth quarter.Figuring out such prospective stocks could be quite tough unless one applies the proper method. The Zacks methodology makes the task simple, by combining a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP, shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

34,BWA,"Johnson Controls International plc (JCI  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell on Jan 31.Last quarter, the company reported in-line results. Per its earnings record, it beat estimates in only one of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 0.5%.Long-term earnings per share growth (three-five years) for the company is pegged at 13.3%.Johnson Controls International PLC Price and EPS Surprise Johnson Controls International PLC price-eps-surprise | Johnson Controls International PLC Quote Let’s see, how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.Factors Influencing This QuarterFor fiscal 2018, the company has provided outlook for adjusted EPS before special items within the range of $2.75-$2.85, reflecting an increase of 6-10% year over year.Further, to boost shareholders value, Johnson Controls has raised its share repurchase authorization to $1 billion in December 2017, which adds to the previously announced share buyback authorization of $200 million. Additionally, the company’s board has approved a hike in quarterly cash dividend to 26 cents per share from the earlier payout of 25 cents. This revised dividend was paid on Jan 12, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Dec 18, 2017.However, divesting its multiple businesses is adversely impacting the company’s profits and revenues. Notably, in October 2017, the company closed the divestiture of Scott Safety to 3M. Prior to this, in March 2017, the company had also completed the divestiture of its ADT South Africa business. Thus, these high separation costs associated with the divestitures are straining its revenues and profits.Johnson Controls is also vulnerable to volatility in commodity prices. Examples of highly volatile commodities used in the Building Efficiency business are steel, aluminum, copper and fuel while lead is used in the Power Solutions business.For the soon-to-be-released first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of Building Technologies & Solutions segment is pegged at $5.2 billion, down from the fourth quarter’s actual total revenues of $6 billion.Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of the company’s Power Solutions segment stands at $2 billion, down from the first quarter’s actual net revenues of $2.1 billion.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Johnson Controls is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Johnson Controls has an Earnings ESP is +2.76% because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 53 cents and 51 cents, respectively. A positive ESP always indicates a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Johnson Controls carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lowers the predictive power of ESP. Hence, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive. Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few auto stocks worth considering from the same space comprising the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this time around:BorgWarner, Inc.

39,BWA,"After a record 2016, auto sales in the United States declined in 2017. This is the first time since the financial crisis that auto sales have declined from the previous-year figure. According to Autodata, in 2017, auto sales in the United States were 17.2 million, down from the prior-year figure of 17.85 million. Despite the decline, 2017 overall was a robust year for the auto industry.Auto Sales: Uncertain RideIn December, domestic auto companies General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.

Robust economic growth, improving employment conditions, reasonable gasoline prices, sturdy consumer confidence, and rising income and wages. Also, a slew of measures, including proposed tax cuts should provide some extra advantage to profits and sales.Also, some investors are bidding up the auto stocks under the notion that the high-margin pickup trucks and SUVs will pull automakers through any downturn.The upcoming earnings announcements are a key events for the sector, with investors looking for earnings and revenue growth. Earnings growth leads to price rise, indicating more gains and assets for the investors.The Zacks MethodologyIrrespective of the outlook of the auto sector, there are a few auto stocks which are likely to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the fourth quarter.Figuring out such prospective stocks could be quite tough unless one applies the proper method.

40,BWA,"Investors in BorgWarner Inc. (BWA  -  Free Report)  need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 19th 2018 $30.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for BorgWarner, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, BorgWarner is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Automotive - Original Equipment industry that ranks in the Top 40% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none has dropped them. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.00 per share to $1.01 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about BorgWarner right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

45,BWA,"The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (GT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings numbers on Apr 25, before the market opens. Last quarter, the tire manufacturer witnessed a positive surprise of 30.3%. Of the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed estimates in three and missed in one, with an average beat of 12.7%.Over a year, shares of Goodyear have underperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has lost 23.8% compared with the industry’s decline of 25.1%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement. The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Price and EPS Surprise  The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Price and EPS Surprise | The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Quote Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Goodyear is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — an Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Goodyear has an Earnings ESP of +6.29% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 47 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents. A positive ESP indicates a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Goodyear carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. Thus, this combination raises the chances of an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.What’s Driving Better-Than-Expected Results?Goodyear invests in projects with a high rate of return. It is developing and launching a number of products and services to remain competitive in the market and boost sales. In March, the company offered a preview of its EfficientGrip Performance tire’s prototype. Developed to cater the electric vehicles segment, the tires are enabled with electric-drive technology and are sturdier than the regular ones. The specialized tires will be available in Europe by 2019.Further, the company also displayed the recent advances made in its intelligent tire prototype, developed for fleet operators. The prototype helps to manage tire issues, faced by the fleet operators that are important for the business model as well as customers.Based on these innovative product launches, the company anticipates achieving the segmental operating income target of $2-$2.4 billion in 2020. It aims to achieve profitable growth and reduce operating and structural costs by 2020.Also, Goodyear pays regular quarterly dividends and frequent share repurchases with an aim to boost shareholder value. In January 2018, it declared a dividend of 14 cents, to be paid on Mar 1, 2018. During 2017-2020, it plans to make a capital deployment of $3.5-$4 billion.However, competitive environment, increased raw-material costs and drop in worldwide volume sales are a few concerns for Goodyear.For the soon-to-be-released quarterly results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales of Americas, which is the company’s largest geographical segment (constituting almost 53.4% of total sales in 2017), is pegged at $2 billion in comparison with the fourth quarter’s actual sales of $2.18 billion.For the second-largest geographical segment, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) (32.1%), the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales stands at $1.24 billion. While the fourth quarter’s net sales were $1.26 billion for the EMEA segment.Further, the consensus mark for Asia-Pacific’s (14.5%) net sales in the first quarter stands at $514 million, a decline from $623 million recorded in the fourth quarter.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other stocks worth considering from the same space, with the right combination of elements to outpace earnings estimates this time around:BorgWarner Inc.

46,BWA,"Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) has done it again. After shutting down its Model 3 operations for four days in February, it closed down for another “planned” five days. The stock message from the company was also repeated, that shutdowns are “used to improve automation and systematically address bottlenecks in order to increase production rates.”Last time it was a question of battery module production that had fallen behind schedule. This time, it’s about excessive automation. “We had this crazy, complex network of conveyor belts… And it was not working, so we got rid of that whole thing,” Musk told CBS. “Humans are underrated” he tweeted for good measure.And yet, while struggling to sustain a weekly production rate of 2,000 units, Tesla’s goals remain ambitious: to do 5,000 units a week by the end of the second quarter.The “bottlenecks” are most likely because Tesla jumped into production before some of its advanced assembly line was ready. But one might argue that the company has taken a unique approach to manufacturing that doesn’t compare with others. And weeding out the excess while cranking up production was probably the fastest way to get to market.Moreover, it’s understandable that a highly automated production line will have to be closed down entirely if there’s an issue with any link. So introducing a human element may optimize output. Ironing out these details makes sense at this stage so it can churn out higher volumes in the future.  Setting public production targets is just a way to keep Musk excited and buyers interested. After all, Musk is a big part of the publicity for Tesla models. And the company has hundreds of thousands of units in back orders that it needs to fulfill. Some people have been waiting two years to take delivery of the first all-electric affordable car. If you can’t keep them interested, there could be defections.Which brings us to the question of competition. And in this respect, the Model 3 appears to be in a league of its own. The cars that come closest to it are entry-level luxury sedans like the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes C Class and Audi A4. Or, all-electric cars like the Nissan Leaf, Chevy Bolt, BMW i3 and BMW Mini E (Subaru and Volvo are also about to jump in).Since these automakers are foreign, there’s likely to be a lag until the new models launch in the U.S., allowing Tesla more time to consolidate its lead in the country. Tesla’s Model 3 sets a high standard in size, performance and design, but the company has less manufacturing experience, which is the reason that some people are skeptical about its ability to deliver.And deliver it must, because any delay brings the competition that much closer.But that isn’t the only concern. Tesla’s other models have been doing rather well, so it isn’t far from the 200,000 EV threshold. Once sales cross that point, the $7,500 federal tax incentive that the government gives to EV buyers on their Teslas will start phasing out, so the same car would appear more expensive. On the other hand, its competitors that have entered the market later will continue to enjoy the benefit. So for Tesla, which is touting the affordability of the Model S, there is a big need to sell more of these than its other cars to avail of the advantage and not turn customers off.Also, part of the excitement around Tesla is its ability to sell into China, where the government is focused on going green and where EV sales have soared in recent years. President Trump’s approach to China trade has raised a question on this front.But Beijing appears to be looking to alleviate the tension with the announcement yesterday that ownership caps on manufacturing operations for commercial vehicles, such as buses or delivery trucks, would be lifted by 2020, with passenger cars following in 2022.  Musk is likely to stick to his plan of a new plant in the country, but with the new rules, he may not have to go for a 50-50 JV with a Chinese company.Elon Musk seems as confident as ever. In response to The Economist, which projected that Tesla would have to raise more debt this year, he tweeted “Tesla will be profitable & cash flow+ in Q3 & Q4,” so there would be no need to raise more debt. RecommendationsTesla has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). So for exposure to the space, you might instead consider auto/truck original equipment stocks like Dana Inc. (DAN  -  Free Report), AB Volvo (VLVLY  -  Free Report), Allison Transmission Holdings (ALSN  -  Free Report), BorgWarner (BWA  -  Free Report) or Lear Corp.

49,BWA,"On Tuesday, China’s President Xi Jinping said that his government is committed to opening up its economy to foreign investors. U.S. markets welcomed his speech, which struck a conciliatory note, helping to reduce trade-related tensions. Among his many promises, Xi promised to provide better protection for intellectual property rights and reduce tariffs on imported cars.Stocks of major U.S. automakers gained on Xi’s comments since China is a major market for U.S. auto exports. Foreign automakers using the United States as a manufacturing and export base would also gain from this move. This is why it makes good sense to pick up stocks likely to benefit from China’s upcoming reforms related to trade and foreign investment.U.S. Auto Stocks Welcome Xi’s CommentsSpeaking at the Boao Forum for Asia, Xi said China would cut tariffs on imported automobiles. Further, the foreign ownership limit on automotive companies, among others, would be raised “as soon as possible.” Currently, foreign automakers cannot own more than 50% of the joint ventures they are mandated to establish with local firms when operating inside China.Consequently, they also have to share 50% of their profits with such Chinese partners. This is why Xi’s comments boosted U.S. auto stocks significantly. Shares of General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) gained 3.3%, 1.8% and 5.2%, respectively, on Tuesday.Tesla was possibly the largest gainer since it makes all of the autos it exports to China at its plant in California. Tesla’s chief executive Elon Musk has stated on earlier occasions that he wishes to retain complete ownership of any manufacturing facility it sets up in China. In a tweet after Li’s speech Xi said: “This is a very important action by China.”China a Crucial Market for U.S. AutomakersIn a tweet made less than a day before Xi’s speech Trump had criticized China’s 25% tariff on U.S. cars, emphasizing that the United States only levies 2.5% in return. Just hours after calling such a state of things “stupid trade”, Trump welcomed Xi’s comments. The President said he was “thankful” for Xi’s comments on tariffs and his “enlightenment” on intellectual property issues.The jump in shares of U.S. auto companies is understandable considering that China is a major market for its cars. In January, General Motors said that China had remained its largest retail market for the sixth consecutive year. For Tesla, China is the second largest market in terms of revenues after the United States.Even bigger winners of Xi’s proposed reforms could be German automakers who manufacture and export their vehicles to China from the United States. According to data from LMC Automotive, Mercedes, owned by Daimler AG (DDAIF  -  Free Report), sent 71,198 vehicles from the United States to China in 2017, while BMW, owned by Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BAMXF  -  Free Report), sent 106,971 vehicles.Our ChoicesMarkets have responded enthusiastically to President Xi’s comments, especially automotive stocks, which stand to benefit significantly from the reforms proposed by the Chinese president. Not only would they have to pay lower duties on imported vehicles, they would also be able to hold a larger stake in their Chinese joint ventures.U.S. auto companies, related organizations and foreign automakers exporting to China from the United States make for good investments at this point. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in.

50,BWA,"It was a week that saw major auto companies undertaking initiatives to enhance their position in the pickup segment as well as planning to lower sedan production. In fact, these two strategies are not conflicting at all. As conventional compact and mid-size cars have started to lose favor among customers and demand for SUVs and pickup trucks has increased, automakers have started to reorient their programs and strategies.In the past week, German vehicle behemoth Volkswagen AG reportedly showed interest to augment its position in the midsize pickup segment with a U.S.-made pickup, which is likely to be manufactured in Tennessee.

51,BWA,"CarMax Inc. (KMX  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Feb 28, 2018) results on Apr 4, before the opening bell. Last quarter, this specialty retailer of used vehicles delivered a negative earnings surprise of 1.2%.The company pulled off positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 5%. CarMax has expected long-term growth rate of 14.8%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for the forthcoming announcement.CarMax, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise CarMax, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | CarMax, Inc. QuoteFactors Influencing This QuarterCarMax aims at the used-car market and is one of the strongest among the peers. In fiscal 2017, used vehicle sales rose 6.7%, supported by an 8.3% year-over-year increase in used-car units sold. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, CarMax’s total used-vehicle unit sales rose 8.2%, which is likely to continue in the fiscal fourth quarter.The Richmond, VA-based company is also following an aggressive store expansion scheme in order to grow its presence in the existing and new markets. It opened total six stores during the first two quarters of fiscal 2018. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, CarMax opened five stores.A significant increase in cash outflows from operations and rising capital expenditures might affect CarMax’s revenues.For the soon-to-be-released quarterly results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales of used-vehicle retail is pegged at $3.6 billion, up from the fiscal third quarter’s net sales of $3.4 billion.Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales of the company’s wholesale vehicles stands at $499 million, down from the fiscal second quarter’s net sales of $552.8 million.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Other sales and revenues is expected to be $135 million, up from the fiscal third quarter’s figure of $129 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that CarMax is likely to beat earnings in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: CarMax has an Earnings ESP of -3.51% as the Most Accurate estimate of 86 cents is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 89 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CarMax carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies worth considering in the same space, with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this quarter:General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.52% and a Zacks Rank of 1. It is expected to report upcoming earnings results on Apr 27. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.BorgWarner Inc.

52,BWA,"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, is examining if Ford Motor Company’s (F  -  Free Report) recall cases can be extended to include additional vehicles. This has posed a challenge for the U.S. auto giant.Notably, in 2016, Ford recalled 153,000 vehicles because it feared that drivers could lose control of the vehicle due to unexpected shift of the automatic transmissions into first gear. The recalls included F-150 pickups, Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs and Ford Mustang sports cars between 2011 and 2012 model years.Currently, the Federal safety officials are investigating if Ford should have included more than a million additional vehicles, including F-150s, Navigators and Expeditions from the 2011, 2012 and 2013 model years.In December 2017, Ford announced that it is in process of issuing two safety recalls and two safety compliance recalls in North America. In October 2017, the company announced that it would recall 1.34 million units of 2015-17 Ford F-150 and 2017 Ford Super Duty trucks in North America to add water shields to side door latches in the trucks (read more: Ford to Issue Safety & Compliance Recalls in North America).In the last three months, shares of Ford have outperformed the industry it belongs to.

53,BWA,"With a major overhaul in tax laws in more than 30 years, U.S. corporates are expected to see a significant increase in their cash pile. While the slashing of the corporate tax from 35% to 21% will lead to a rise in profit after tax, a cash repatriation window will allow multinational corporations to bring in cash stashed in foreign countries. Boosted by the surge in domestic cash, many companies may opt for mergers & acquisitions (M&A), share buybacks or dividend pay-out next year or beyond.Here we will focus on stocks, which are expected to pay better dividends in 2018 than their industry peers and also have growth prospects. While the upside momentum of the market may continue amid strong manufacturing data, rising corporate profits and interest rates, risks of a downside remain. In such an environment, investors can add these stocks to their portfolio to enjoy a steady stream of cashGenerally, companies paying dividends are financially stable accruing profits in established markets. Share buyback programs and dividend payouts boost investor confidence in the company, thereby raising its market value. However, with interest rates rising in the United States, some amount of cash may flow to the debt market. However, this does not weaken the prospects of dividend investing. With investors getting worried about the Bull Run and many even expecting a correction, dividend paying companies are better bets for 2018.7 Amazing Dividend StocksIt is no easy task to select outperformers given the vast size of the market. Therefore, we are using the Zacks Rank to zero in on companies with strong fundamentals. In addition to a favorable Zacks Rank, we are also taking into account VGM Score. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. With our Style Score system, we have identified stocks that have potential to beat the market.The score allows one to streamline their search to select winners by eliminating the negative aspects. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score. Our research shows that stocks with an impressive  VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Apart from a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM score, we have chosen large-cap companies. This lowers the risk of the portfolio as these companies are less susceptible to market volatility. Moreover, the companies have seen EPS, sales and dividend payout increase in the last five years. Although, past growth is not an indicator of future movement, it helps to select companies that have a higher probability of paying dividends. The companies have also performed better than the S&P 500 this year. However, these have a low PEG ratio, which suggests room for upside.Here are seven of the 18 stocks that fit the bill:Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures, and sells computer, networking, and communications platforms worldwide. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings rose 6.1% in the last 90 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next years are 19.51% and 1%, respectively.

54,BWA,"The seven-year sales growth streak for the auto industry hit the brakes in 2017 as it suffered its first annual sales decline since the financial crisis. Though sales dropped 1.8% from the last year to 17.2 million vehicles, 2017 still marks the fourth-best sales year in U.S. history. This is because this is the first time that the industry has cleared the 17-million mark for three consecutive years.Of the six major American and Japanese automakers, Fiat Chrysler (FCAU  -  Free Report) posted the biggest sales decline of 8.2%, followed by modest declines of 1.3% for General Motors (GM  -  Free Report), 1.1% for Ford Motor (F  -  Free Report) and 0.6% for Toyota (TM  -  Free Report). Nissan Motor (NSANY  -  Free Report) and Honda (HMC  -  Free Report) sales were up 1.9% and 0.2%, respectively.A strong economy, low unemployment, increasing consumer confidence, higher spending, fuel-efficient and technologically enriched vehicles, and relatively low oil prices will continue to fuel the industry. Additionally, the tax reform will provide a lift to U.S. sales but at the same time also encourage rate hikes, which will make financing of new vehicles expensive (read: Bet on Trump Trade & Republicans with These New ETFs).The shift in consumers' preference from passenger cars to more profitable pickup trucks and SUVs, as well as longer usage of vehicles will be a drag on sales. The average age of vehicles on the road has climbed to 11.6 years, up from 8.8 years in 1998. Given this, 2018 might be the year of challenges for automakers with many market experts expect auto sales to fall below 17 million in 2018.Investors should note that the auto sector has a solid Zacks Rank in the top 38% and the valuation looks appealing at the current level with a P/E ratio of 12.23, the lowest of all the 16 Zacks sectors. This could provide an upside to the stocks this year.That said, we have highlighted three ETFs & stocks that will be in focus this year and could be attractive picks as well.First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto ETF (CARZ  -  Free Report)This fund offers pure play global exposure to 34 auto stocks by tracking the NASDAQ OMX Global Auto Index.

CARZ has a lower level of $21.2 million in AUM and trades in a small average daily trading volume of about 4,000 shares. The product charges 70 bps in fees per year and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a High risk outlook.iShares Global Consumer Discretionary ETF (RXI  -  Free Report)While RXI provides broad exposure to the consumer discretionary space around the world, investors could go for this product as it has about 21% allocation to the auto industry. Holding 175 stocks, the fund is skewed toward the top firm at 10.3% while the other firms hold less than 5% share. American firms make up for 61.5% of the portfolio while Japan takes the next spot at 14%. It has $231.7 million in AUM and charges 48 bps in annual fees.

There’s no reason to always get fancy.She searched for stocks that had Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) so that she would, presumably, get rising earnings estimates. She combined that with a P/E under 15, which is her usual level for value stocks.It gave her a portfolio with 165 results.As you might imagine, most of the semiconductor stocks, which continue to be cheap, such as Micron and Lam Research, were in this screen. She ignored those names because she’s already done several podcasts in 2017 on that industry.For 2018, it had to be some new names.

71,BWA,"Sales growth is an important measure for any company, as it is vital to growth projections and strategic decision making. By monitoring this key metric over multiple time periods, one can clearly understand a company’s growth trend.Sales growth is essential to justify the expenses incurred to operate a business. Low revenues lead to an unprofitable business and dismal financial performance. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit but cannot generate enough growth to attract new investors.Also, in a growing economy, lack of sales growth most likely denotes that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors. In simple terms, without impressive sales growth, the bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable over the longer term.Further, it's worth keeping in mind that when companies incur a loss, albeit transitorily, they are valued on their revenues, as sales growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company's future earnings performance.Hence, the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio can turn out to be an appropriate metric for stock valuation. This metric's importance lies in the fact that management has limited opportunities to manipulate sales unlike earnings.Focusing alone on sales growth is, however, not desirable. Considering a company's cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Picking the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.

The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in one of the trailing four quarters, with a negative average surprise of 2.3%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for the forthcoming announcement.Factors Influencing this QuarterO’Reilly’s stores are concentrated in certain locations in the U.S. Thus, its business is exposed to the economic and weather conditions of these regions. The company’s strategy of lowering the time-to-market for its products to meet the demand in the professional installer market, places it at a logistical disadvantage against competitors.Additionally, much of O’Reilly’s cash is locked in inventories, which can affect its short-term liquidity in periods of low sales.

96,BWA,"With several companies releasing their quarterly results in a row, a few automakers, namely Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report), General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and PACCAR, Inc. (PCAR  -  Free Report) also recently reported third-quarter figures. While Harley-Davidson’s earnings per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, both General Motors’ and PACCAR’s bottom lines beat the estimates.Three important auto and parts manufacturers, expected to come up with their earnings numbers on Oct 26 are, Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report), LKQ Corporation (LKQ  -  Free Report) and BorgWarner Inc. (BWA  -  Free Report).As of Oct 18, per the latest Earnings Outlook, 52 S&P 500 members have already revealed their quarterly earnings results. Of these companies, the beat ratios of earnings and revenues are 76.9% and 73.1%, respectively. From the Auto sector, 10% has reported quarterly earnings figures.For third-quarter 2017, earnings and revenue growth for the auto companies is expected to be more on the negative side. The sector is expected to record 17.4% and 5.6% year-over-year decline in earnings and revenues, respectively. However, companies under the S&P 500 category will come up with 3% and 4.9% year-over-year growth in earnings and revenues, respectively.In order to tackle air pollution problems, many countries are focusing on use of electric cars. This new paradigm shift has prompted many automakers to transfer their attention from gasoline and diesel-automobiles to electric cars. With this move, the companies have to balance current strategies as well as invest in future industrial trends and changes.Let’s take a look at the three auto companies, scheduled to announce results on Oct 26.We relied on the Zacks methodology, combining a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) with a positive Earnings ESP, to predict the chances of an earnings beat this quarter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Research shows that with this ideal combination of two key ingredients — Zacks Rank and ESP — chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70% for the stocks lined up for an earnings announcement.A multinational automaker, headquartered in Dearborn, MI, Ford manufactures and distributes automobiles in 200 markets across six continents. Our model predicts that the company is not likely to deliver an earnings beat as it currently has an Earnings ESP of -9.43% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Therefore, we caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.In 2017, the company expects the adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.65-$1.85. Also, the company’s frequent vehicle recalls to fix safety issues is increasing the capital expenditure.

Our model does not conclusively predict that the company is likely to beat estimates this quarter as it currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. Although the bullish rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s 0.00% ESP however, makes surprise prediction difficult.The company expects organic sales growth in the 4-5.25% range compared with the earlier guided range of 4-6%, in 2017. This is majorly due to the acquisition of Andrew Page that is affecting its gross margin. However, its effort to lower the operational costs as well as the capital expenditure within $200-$225 million range might drive its results.

Currently, the company carries an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.

100,BWA,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put BorgWarner Inc. (BWA  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, BorgWarner has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.5. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, BorgWarner’s current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 15.3. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that BorgWarner has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.9, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for BorgWarner stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, BorgWarner has a P/S ratio of about 1.2. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, BWA is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, BorgWarner currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes BorgWarner a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though BorgWarner might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of D. This gives BWA a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been somewhat favorable. The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower, while the full year estimate has seen ten up and no down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has remained unchanged at 86 cents in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up by 0.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:BorgWarner Inc. Price and Consensus BorgWarner Inc. Price and Consensus | BorgWarner Inc. QuoteDespite this somewhat bullish trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and that is why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineBorgWarner is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover a strong industry rank (Top 18% out of more than 250 industries) further strengthens its growth potential. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, despite carrying Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

Additionally, the automaker has been experiencing a high inventory level of passenger cars. It is working toward bringing the inventory down by cutting down on production.In fact, General Motors has lowered the U.S. sales outlook for new vehicle sales in 2017. This indicates that the industry might be heading toward an average downslide in 2017. A decline in new vehicle volume will also lead to a dip in company’s total sales.Also, the company has been forced to scale down or shut its manufacturing operations in a few regions due to production constraints such as high costs and unfavorable currency translation effects. Moreover, General Motors’ decision to undertake a wide range of restructuring initiatives globally, such as stopping sale of cars in India, sale of its South African business and streamlining its Singapore office, are likely to result into charges of $500 million in second-quarter 2017. Of this, $200 million is likely to be a cash charge.Earnings Whispers                                      Our proven model does not conclusively show that General Motors is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.
