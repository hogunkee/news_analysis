1,FLR,"Infrastructure stocks including equipment maker Caterpillar (CAT), U.S. Steel (X) and construction materials supplier Vulcan Materials (VMC) all were buoyed in early Wednesday trading by optimism over President Trump's speech to Congress last night.Trump didn't offer details but reiterated his plan to invest $1 trillion in new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways via a combination of public and private funds.Even as the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index surged to record highs on the stock market today, infrastructure stocks generally outperformed the major averages. Dow component Caterpillar closed 2% higher, U.S. Steel rallied 2.5%, Nucor (NUE) rose 2.3%, construction and engineering giant Fluor (FLR) added 2.2%, Vulcan Materials gained 3.1% and Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) rose 2.9%.Caterpillar, U.S. Steel and other infrastructure stocks were big winners after the presidential election, but have been up and down in recent weeks, looking for clarity about what Trump will do, and when.IBD'S TAKE: A big boost in federal infrastructure spending would be huge for infrastructure stocks, but here's why construction industry CEOs are bullish about their outlook even if President Trump doesn't come through.""The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding,"" Trump said, though exactly what ""time"" he has in mind for legislation is unclear. One report out last week said that passage of an infrastructure bill might wait until 2018, and it generally takes 18 months for new funds to start flowing in a major way.""There have been mixed signals from the White House about how big a priority infrastructure is for the administration,"" wrote Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Washington analyst Brian Gardner wrote on Wednesday. ""We think infrastructure spending could get squeezed out by competing agenda items such as health care and tax reform.""RELATED: 
"
2,FLR,"U.S. Steel (X), Dow industrials component Caterpillar (CAT), Vulcan Materials (VMC) and other infrastructure-related stocks rebounded Monday as President Trump promised ""big"" spending ahead of Tuesday's speech.Trump said Monday that there's ""no choice"" but to step up investment in roads, bridges and other infrastructure. Infrastructure stocks sold off last week on a report that the Trump administration could delay an infrastructure bill until 2018. Doing that would likely delay significant federal spending until 2019 at the earliest.U.S. Steel rose 3.2% to 38.19 on the stock market today after tumbling 7% last week. U.S. Steel climbed to about 39 in late trading after Cowen & Co. upgraded the stock to outperform with a raised price target of 60.Fellow steelmaker Nucor (NUE) climbed 2.9%. Heavy construction and mining equipment maker Caterpillar advanced 2%, rebounding off its 50-day line after finding support there last week. Construction materials firms also rallied, with Vulcan Materials up 2.4% and Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) 2.5%. Heavy construction firm Fluor (FLR) climbed 1.9%, rebounding from its 50-day line.Trump will give a prime time Tuesday speech to a joint session of Congress, where he's expected to lay out his ideas and priorities on taxes, health care, infrastructure and more.RELATED:Steel, Materials, Mining Stocks Dive As Trump Mulls Infrastructure Delay To 2018Trump: ObamaCare Repeal Before Tax Cuts, Vows 'Big' Infrastructure BoostLockheed, Northrop, Raytheon Rally As Trump Seeks Defense Budget Boost

3,FLR,"The reviews for President Trump's speech to Congress were strongly positive, from pundits, the public and, so far, investors. But does the speech really matter.The Dow Jones industrial average soared above 21,000 for the first time at Wednesday's opening bell, with the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite also jumping to record highs. On Tuesday, the Dow industrials slipped 0.1% to end a string of 12 straight gains, while the S&P 500 index dipped 0.3%, the Nasdaq composite 0.6% and the small-cap Russell 2000 1.5%.If Trump is right that the stock market's impressive rise since his election has been driven by his policies, then what he didn't say in his speech matters a whole lot more than anything he did say. (Some of Wednesday's early gains may reflect shifting views and Treasury yields regarding a possible Federal Reserve rate hike at the March 14-15 meeting.)He didn't say how he would pay for or when he would advance his trillion-dollar infrastructure plan, a potential boon to Caterpillar (CAT), steel makers like U.S. Steel (X) and Nucor (NUE), engineering and construction firms like Fluor (FLR) and construction aggregates suppliers like Vulcan Materials (VMC). Could last week's report that the plan will be delayed until 2018 be true? Not clear, but there's more reason to think so after Tuesday night.However, Nucor, U.S. Steel, Vulcan Materials, Caterpillar and Fluor were up 2%-3% in morning action.In any event, there appears to be a logjam of contentious issues blocking the road to more spending on highways and bridges. Trump managed to successfully turn the page after a rocky first five weeks in office in part because he stayed above the fray, declining to take any clear positions on the two issues that could largely determine whether his economic agenda rises or falls: ObamaCare and tax reform.Now he's about to enter a potentially hazardous stretch of his presidency in which he'll have to take firm policy stands that may divide his narrow governing majority in the Senate.On ObamaCare, the issue that Trump said must be addressed before tax reform, the clock is ticking for him to come up with a replacement that can unify Republicans, something that has proved impossible in the seven years since the law's passage. Humana (HUM) has already said it will exit the exchanges in 2018, while Aetna (AET) and Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH) have one foot out the door, and Anthem (ANTM) and Molina (MOH) won't commit to sticking around.Shares of UnitedHealth and other health insurers rose 1%-2% intraday.Come April, if Republicans haven't gotten their ducks in a row, insurers faced with setting premiums for 2018 will be in full panic mode and may start to pull the plug on their participation in the exchanges, leaving swaths of the country with no insurers for 2018.IBD'S TAKE: Despite growing doubts about the timing and size of President Trump's tax and spending stimulus plans, markets are pricing in higher odds of the Federal Reserve hiking rates again as early as this month. Tax reform doesn't look to be any easier. Trump wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% or 20%, but the House proposal for doing so depends on raising $1 trillion with a 20% tax on imports that's being fought by Wal-Mart (WMT) and the entire retail sector. Now General Motors (GM) is calling the tax ""problematic,"" and a growing number of GOP senators oppose the idea.Trump stuck to vague generalities in his speech, saying, ""We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers.""Who would oppose that? It's only when he arrives at a plan to pay for it — if not with a border tax then by taking away valued corporate tax subsidies — that the effort will turn into a mud fight.Trump is off to a slow start in clarifying how he will put his economic agenda into action. That's not surprising, because his agenda tackles major problems that have long defied solutions, but it should make investors nervous, regardless of what Trump said last night.RELATED: 
"
4,FLR,"President Trump on Monday called the effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare ""unbelievably complex"" and said that his tax cut plans will have to wait in line.But Trump sounded all fired up to begin making good on his campaign plans for a massive infrastructure spending boost. That may be the easiest lift because of the bipartisan appeal of creating more construction jobs while making investments in highways, bridges and other productivity-enhancing projects.Trump's comments on Monday lit a fire under infrastructure stocks. Caterpillar (CAT) rose about 2%, U.S. Steel (X) 3.2%, Fluor (FLR) 1.9% and Vulcan Materials (VMC) 2.4%. Those stocks got hammered last week when reports emerged that the White House was thinking of pushing an infrastructure bill to 2018.Yet there still might not be a green light for Trump's infrastructure plans. With the repeal-and-replace plan for President Obama's signature program running into trouble on multiple fronts, it's looking increasingly possible that Republicans will have to signal a retreat before the rest of their economic agenda can advance.According to Trump, everything is under control. He said on Monday that the White House has arrived at a ""really, really good"" solution to ObamaCare that he will discuss Tuesday night before a joint session of Congress.""I think you'll like what you hear,"" he told insurers at the White House on Monday, including UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM).Investor confidence in President Trump may be riding on his Tuesday speech. High hopes for tax cuts, a surge in infrastructure spending and regulatory reform have helped fuel an explosive postelection stock market rally, but doubts have been creeping in about his ability to deliver.Still, the Dow Jones industrial average has rallied for 11 straight sessions as of Friday, the longest winning streak in decades.Trump's vow to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% or 20% may hinge on the House GOP proposal for a 20% border tax that faces serious opposition in the Senate because it pits big importers like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Best Buy (BBY) against exporters like Boeing (BA) and General Electric (GE).No hint of a Plan B has emerged, and Trump signaled that he won't provide any details that might help investors gauge the prospects for tax reform advancing while ObamaCare is dominating the agenda. Trump's explanation was that tax reform would have to take into account the budget effect of repeal and replace.While there's good reason to expect regulatory reform to ease compliance costs across a wide array of industries, big banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) also have been lifted by hopes for a lower corporate tax rate and a steeper yield curve, which boosts net interest margins. Yet diminished confidence that a Trump economic package will do much for growth over the next year have led Treasury yields to sag in recent weeks.IBD'S TAKE: Backers of a 20% border tax say that the dollar would rise about 25%, effectively negating the higher tax bill faced by importers. Yet, if that were to happen, the stronger dollar would hurt the U.S. tourism industry — including Trump hotels.The White House seems to have gone back and forth on whether it will support a border tax, which would raise more than $1 trillion over a decade and offset the cost of a lower corporate tax rate. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox News that he has only just begun to study the border tax proposal. Last week, Mnuchin said the goal was to pass tax reform by August but acknowledged that the timetable could slip.Trump has made clear that figuring out what to do about ObamaCare is the top priority in the short term, but dissension among Republicans about how to replace the law raises the risk of a drawn-out effort, at best, with some risk of a quagmire. A preliminary Congressional Budget Office score of the House's approach to repeal and replace much of ObamaCare reportedly showed a big increase in the ranks of the uninsured, which runs counter to White House promises.Republicans are considering holding a vote to repeal big parts of ObamaCare, even if a victory is uncertain. That may be the best outcome for investors. Win or lose, ObamaCare would fall off the top of the agenda, clearing the way for more growth-oriented policies.RELATED:Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon Rally As Trump Seeks Defense Budget BoostInfrastructure Stocks Jump As President Trump Vows To Spend 'Big'Steel, Materials, Mining Stocks Dive As Trump Mulls Infrastructure Delay To 2018Will Heavy Construction's Rebound Receive A Trump Infrastructure Boost?If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May Collapse

5,FLR,"You might not have heard of or read much about the company Argan (AGX). This year, IBD's Stock Spotlight column featured it twice in August. But you probably know its bigger peers in the heavy construction industry.That said, Argan has taken the big dog role in the group this year.The stock perked up June 8, one day after the Rockville, Md., firm reported outstanding results for the fiscal first quarter ended in April. Profits leapt 62% to 81 cents a share, marking one of the biggest increases in recent years, as revenue bulged 52% to $130.3 million.That large top-line increase represented acceleration from a 14% increase in the prior quarter that ended in January. Revenue fell vs. year-ago levels in the two quarters before that.These numbers help explain Argan's sterling 98 Earnings Per Share Rating and an A grade for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity), both available at IBD Stock Checkup.Argan shares gapped up sharply on June 8, finishing up more than 16% in the heaviest volume in almost six months. That move ignited a run past 40, where the stock had been bumping its head for months. It then became an acceptable price area in which to buy the stock. If you traced a cuplike pattern going back to late November, then a valid buy point emerged at 40.20 — 10 cents above the Nov. 20 intraday high.That high served as the left-side lip of the cup base.Argan has since rallied nearly 49%. An investor at the breakout could have decided to take gains at 20% to 25% -- a key rule in IBD-style growth investing and could be called the ""platinum rule"" -- or simply held because shares have yet to test support at the key 50-day moving average.Argan plays an important role for electric power producers, providing engineering, infrastructure and construction services. It boasts expertise in not only helping to construct natural gas-powered plants but also biomass-powered energy facilities, solar farms, wind farms and biofuel plants.Argan's market cap of $896 million (share price of 59.74 multiplied by 15 million shares outstanding) is a fraction of the giants in the heavy construction group.Meanwhile, shares in Fluor (FLR) (No. 1 in market cap at $7.2 billion), have been dull this year. A nice rally in the first quarter of 2016 melted fast in early May, when the heavy construction giant posted disappointing first-quarter results (EPS down 11%, revenue down for the 11th quarter in a row).The second biggest name in the 22-company group, Jacobs Engineering (JEC) ($6.3 billion in market cap), has fared much better. In late April, the stock cleared a 44.87 handle buy point within a long choppy base and have rallied as much as 24.5%. Even then, Jacobs commands a mediocre Composite Rating of 69. Argan, Wildan Group (WLD), Goldfield (GV) and Sterling Construction (STRL) are the only stocks with a Composite of 90 or higher out of a maximum 99. The latter three are thinly traded or below 10 a share.Argan on Sept. 15 announced an annual cash dividend of 70 cents a share, payable Oct. 28 to shareholders of record as of Oct. 18. That gives the stock a modest dividend yield of 1.2%, below the 2% figure for the S&P 500. However, this time Argan is tossing an extra 30 cents per share to holders as a special one-time cash payout.CEO Rainer Bosselmann noted in a news release that success in completing the Panda power plant projects in Pennsylvania encouraged the company's board to approve the extra dividend.Keep in mind that in the heavy construction industry, results can be lumpy — especially for a smaller player. Argan has seen a decline in yearly sales in four of the past seven fiscal years. For now, revenue is seen climbing 55% to $176.7 million in the October-ending third quarter.RELATED:You Know The Golden Rule Of Selling; How About The Platinum Rule?Who Ranks Highest In Earnings Growth Among Engineering And Heavy Construction Firms?

Ex-Im's defenders argue that if buyers in Vietnam, Ethiopia or elsewhere can't go to Ex-Im for loans to buy Boeing jets, they'll buy an Airbus jet with the help of the French government, leaving Boeing — and the suppliers who depend on it — empty handed.Just last Thursday, a U.K. unit of Carlsbad, Calif.-based satellite maker ViaSat (VSAT) disclosed Ex-Im's latest big deal, a $525 million loan from Ex-Im to finance a satellite it's working on with Boeing.U.S. companies doing business in Mexico with Pemex, the state oil company, enjoyed the most guarantees from Ex-Im in 2013, $1.5 billion out of $1.76 billion.The single largest loan that year, $1 billion, went to Reliance Industries in India to finance generators for a petrochemical plant, a project of U.S. firms Fluor (FLR) and ConocoPhillips (COP).Ex-Im's friends note that comparisons of loan sizes and the number of loans are skewed because the cost of an aircraft or heavy equipment far outweighs the goods sold by small and midsize businesses.""It would take a lot of commercial refrigeration units to equal a jet plane or nuclear reactor,"" said Lauren Airey, director of foreign trade policy at the National Association of Manufacturers.With the U.S. home to some of the world's largest banks, why couldn't Boeing or other businesses bypass Ex-Im and head to private lenders for funding?""That's a fair question,"" Shenkar said. ""Why is it not happening? I suppose the risk-return equation is not there. There also is a limited number of banks that really have all the infrastructure, skill and expertise to deal with an international transaction.""President Obama, who supports reauthorization, in 2008 as a presidential candidate called the bank ""little more than a fund for corporate welfare.""His old criticism is still echoed by the bank's opponents.Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, chairs the House Financial Services Committee, which oversees Ex-Im's charter. He calls the bank's reauthorization ""a defining issue for our party and our movement. ..""There is probably no better poster child of the Washington insider economy and corporate welfare than the Export-Import Bank,"" he said. ""Its demise would be a resounding victory for the Main Street competitive economy.""The bank's critics argue that 0.01% of U.S. small businesses received help from Ex-Im to finance 1% of total U.S. exports in 2014.Hopefuls for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination also have chimed in. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said Ex-Im ""should be phased out."" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called it a ""corrupt crony-capitalist fiasco"" while Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker called for its elimination.Last month, Heritage Action for America launched an ""End Ex-Im"" campaign that will inform voters in 31 Republican-held House districts that their representative supports reauthorizing the bank.""The question here is a moral one,"" said Barney Keller of the Club for Growth. ""How can you say you want to reform social welfare when you're not in favor of reforming corporate welfare?""

48,FLR,"Tense, late-stage maneuvering at the White House and the Capitol kept markets on edge straight to Friday's close, with major indexes ending mixed and the Dow Jones industrial average chalking up its worst week since the Nov. 8 presidential election.The Dow lost 0.3% Friday and 1.3% for the week. Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) took what were far-and-away the Dow's worst losses for the week, down 6.5% and 4%, respectively.Also in the Dow 30, Apple (AAPL) and McDonald's (MCD) each managed modest gains for the week and Nike (NKE), which on Wednesday dived more than 7% after a weak earnings report, on Friday trimmed its decline for the week to less than 3%.The S&P 500 sagged 0.1%, ending the week with a 1.3% loss — also its worst week since just before the election. Heavy engineering, steel and suppliers of construction materials took the S&P 500's heaviest hits on Friday. Vulcan Materials (VMC), Martin Marietta (MLM), Fluor (FLR) and Nucor (NUE) each dumped more than 2% in Friday's session. It's well-worth noting that all of those losses occurred in light trade.Micron Technology (MU) and Under Armour (UA) pegged the S&P 500's best gains.Micron spiked 7% as earnings rose to 90 cents a share, up from a penny in the year-ago quarter. Revenue soared 58%. But the industry took particular heart in Micron's Q3 outlook, which placed the midpoint of earnings guidance 61% above consensus views. Micron shares ended the week up 11% and at a new high, extended from a February rebound from 10-week support.Under Armour popped 4% following an upgrade to buy, from hold, by Jefferies. The stock suffered a 63% sell-off over the past 11 months, but the Jefferies note diagnosed the correction as having formed a bottom and, given market circumstances, ""an inflection has formed and the buying (opportunity) is now.""

49,FLR,"The market for nonresidential construction in the U.S. may be heading for a sharp improvement over the next year based on trends ranging from architectural billings to steel demand, even though recent activity presents a mixed picture.The latest government data show that nonresidential construction spending dipped in August from a month earlier. Year-over-year it rose, though, and economists point to certain metrics that portend a further lift in spending in 2015.The expected increase applies not only to sectors that have already seen a rise in spending, such as retail and office, but also to sectors that have been in a slump, including education and health care.A variety of stocks could benefit from an uptick in nonresidential construction. These range from commercial/industrial construction companies such as Fluor (FLR) and KBR (KBR) to suppliers of construction equipment like United Rentals (URI), Terex (TEX) and Manitowoc (MTW) and steel producers like Nucor (NUE).One of the metrics analysts and economists are watching is the Architectural Billings Index, a measure of design activity and future construction that has reached multiyear highs in recent months.Architects Show OptimismOn Oct. 22, the American Institute of Architects reported that the September score was 55.2, up from 53.0 the month before and 53.8 a year earlier. It was the second-highest reading in over seven years, just behind July's reading of 55.8. A score above 50 indicates an increase in billings. This typically leads to a rise in construction of nonresidential projects.Kermit Baker, the AIA's chief economist, says the third-quarter numbers ""are the strongest we've seen since before the downturn.""""Design activity is very highly correlated with construction activity,"" he told IBD, adding that it usually takes nine to 12 months to translate into land-clearing for construction.The lag means ""you might not see an immediate impact on steel demand,"" Morningstar steel-stocks analyst Andrew Lane told IBD. ""But it's another bullish indicator for the industry.""In its third-quarter earnings release, Charlotte, N.C.-based steel maker Nucor said its fabricated construction products businesses (rebar fabrication, joist and decking and pre-engineered metal buildings) spurred ""much stronger profits"" than in the second quarter.""This performance reflects improving conditions in the nonresidential construction markets,"" Nucor said, though those markets ""remain at historically low levels.""Most recent government nonresidential construction numbers show a market still struggling to find its footing after a prolonged downturn.Census Bureau data show that nonresidential construction spending in August fell 1.2% monthly but rose 6% vs. a year ago. September data are due Nov. 3.Seven of 16 nonresidential construction sectors saw spending rise in August. These included office, up 1.1% sequentially and 18.9% year-over-year; manufacturing, up 1.7% and 14.5%, respectively; and lodging, up 0.9% and 10.2%, respectively. Commercial construction, including retail, fell 3.1% on a monthly basis but rose 9.4% year-over-year.The uptick in office-related construction ""comes as no surprise,"" said Anirban Basu, chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors, an industry trade group. That's because job growth ""has accelerated, particularly in office-type jobs"" such as professional services.""Over the past year we've seen solid growth in office space-related construction, measured in dollar volume,"" Basu told IBD.Houston, Seattle And San JoseHe calls Houston, Seattle and San Jose, Calif., ""standout performers"" in this segment, thanks mainly to growth in energy (Houston) and tech (Seattle, San Jose) industries. The retail sector has benefited from ""interaction between expanding consumer expenditures and the need to protect market share from online retailers,"" Basu said.""One way for shopping centers to compete with online retail is to improve the shopping experience and convince people to get off their computers and actually go out to shop,"" he added. ""So you see shopping centers investing in the construction of grocery stores or movie theaters to lure people in.""Among sectors that saw a slowdown in construction spending in August were health care, down 0.6% monthly and 6.6% year-over-year; and education, down 2% monthly but up 1.9% year-over-year. The numbers should improve in coming months, observers say.Why Education Is ImportantThe AIA's Baker notes that there have been four straight months of gains in institutional billings, a sector that is mostly made up of education and health care but also includes cultural, religious, correctional and sports facilities.""That was the sector that had not recovered much, but there's a lot more confidence that we will see an upturn in institutional next year,"" Baker said. ""We are encouraged that there have been four months of upturn, and that the numbers have been accelerating.""A rise in construction of education facilities would provide a particularly big boost to nonresidential construction because it's one of the industry's biggest sectors.Education was hit hard by the recession and housing crisis. As property values fell, so did property taxes that finance construction of public schools. But as property values go up there will be more money to spend on schools.Another trend that may help educational facility construction comes from colleges and universities.""Many universities are trying to improve the standard of living in the wake of lower enrollment,"" Basu said. ""This has led to plans to improve the quality of both on- and off-campus housing.""Meanwhile, the health care sector might see a rise in construction as hospital operators grow more comfortable with ObamaCare.""Hospitals took a time out on major construction because they wanted to see the impact of the Affordable Care Act,"" Basu said. ""One of the positive aspects of the ACA is that the level of uncompensated care has fallen. All other things being equal, this improves the finances at hospitals. And anything that improves the finances improves the construction outlook.""

55,FLR,"Every week the government and other entities release economic reports that cover all areas of the economy - from retail sales to housing, to international trade to consumer sentiment.In fact, on virtually any given day there could be anywhere from one to a handful of reports.And while the financial media does cover them, they usually focus on headline numbers without doing a deeper dive.This is unfortunate because within these reports often exists money-making details that can quickly be uncovered with just an extra few minutes of reading.For example, in the Employment Situation report, it details what sectors saw the most new jobs or labor force expansion, and which ones contracted.I can remember countless times where that report got me into the right sectors and industries at the right time before anybody else was talking about them.In fact, I still remember getting into housing in early 2012 while everybody else was staying as far away from it as possible. But, after seeing construction jobs continue to rise in report after report after report, I knew the housing market had turned. And that was one of the first alerts to the housing recovery - for those who knew where to look.But the headline number and the obligatory one-or-two-sentence write ups on many news sites missed the best part of the story by not going the extra mile (or paragraph).Well here we are again, with more stock-picking insight, straight from last week's Employment Situation report. Last week it showed that some of the biggest job creation came from these five industries:1) Construction: +61,000(up 185,000 over the last 12 months)2) Retail: +50,0003) Professional & Business Services: +50,000(up 495,000 over the last 12 months)4) Manufacturing: +31,000(up 224,000 over the last 12 months)5) Finance: +28,000(up 143,000 over the last 12 months)Once these reports point you in the right direction, you can then plug in the appropriate sectors and industries to capitalize on this information and find the best stocks within those groups.This is just one very specific way to do top down analysis. But you can go to any screener (like the one on Zacks.com or the Research Wizard) and locate the sector, then industry of interest.Then you should add in your favorite and most successful stock-picking criteria to drill down to the best ones, such as Zacks Rank 1s or 2s (Strong Buys or Buys); market-beating growth rates; below industry valuations; upward earnings estimate revisions, etc.Here are 5 stocks from some of the industries singled out as the biggest job creators in last week's Employment report:(FLR  -  Free Report) Fluor Corp.(Construction)(BBY  -  Free Report) Best Buy(Retail)(ACN  -  Free Report) Accenture(Professional & Business Services)(DOV  -  Free Report) Dover(Manufacturing)(EVR  -  Free Report) Evercore(Finance)Profitable stock ideas can come at any time and any place.

56,FLR,"ABB Ltd (ABB  -  Free Report) recently clinched a contract worth above $40 million from a consortium of Doosan Heavy Industries and state-owned construction firm PT Hutama Karya. Per the deal, ABB will be responsible for the upgrade and expansion of the Muara Tawar combined cycle power plant in West Java, Indonesia. The contract was booked in the fourth quarter of 2017.Under the contract, ABB has been assigned the task to design, engineer, install as well as commission supporting components and auxiliary systems of the plant, currently operated by PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara. The project will convert the present 1,150 MW gas-fueled generator into an 1,800 MW combined-cycle power plant, offering clean energy to the greater Jakarta area. As part of the project, the company will also supply a 500 kilovolt (kV) air Insulated Switchgear (AIS) substation. Major product supplies include medium and low-voltage switchgear, generator circuit breakers, transformers and protection equipment.Existing Business ScenarioABB has garnered a solid reputation for winning strategic awards and forging important partnerships. Going forward, broader market conditions represent selective opportunities that can supplement its growth momentum. The company has been successful in clinching major orders across all of its three segments. Last year, the company inked a deal with Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) to cater to growing needs of power grids worldwide for safe, dependable and state-of-the-art electrical substations. Moreover, the company is poised to benefit from investments made in upgradation of the power infrastructure. The company also expects utility customers to invest in transmission and distribution projects and renewable sources like solar and wind, which should boost ABB’s growth. Notably, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has returned 23.7% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 22.1%.Despite these positives, ABB’s exposure to oil and gas markets makes it susceptible to current price volatility. Lower capital spending for the upstream energy end-markets might also hurt financials. Moreover, sluggish industrial production and the projected slowdown are weighing on the financials. This apart, currently, the industrial slowdown in China is posing another threat to the company’s profitability, and might impact its performance in the upcoming quarters.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include Colfax Corporation (CFX  -  Free Report) and CIRCOR International, Inc.

57,FLR,"Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has clinched a contract from Shell for the engineering, procurement and fabrication of Shell’s Penguins floating production storage as well as offloading (FPSO) vessel in the North Sea. The company will book the contract value in fourth-quarter 2017.Per the deal, Fluor has been assigned the task to design, fabricate as well as deliver the pre-commissioned FPSO to the North Sea. The FPSO will be designed to carry a production capacity of 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with a storage capacity of 400,000 barrels. The FPSO is anticipated to operate 20 years uninterruptedly, without dry docking and would facilitate the extension of the life of the Penguins oil and gas fields. The project follows the company’s successful delivery of the Malampaya Phase 3 Project in Philippines and would be led by its Manila, Philippines office.Existing Business ScenarioFluor has an impressive track record of receiving awards, and management remains optimistic about continuation of this trend in future as well.  Going forward, Fluor anticipates an increase in front-end engineering awards, which should help boost growth.

59,FLR,"Engineering and construction company Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) recently secured a new contract with Ontario Power Generation (OPG), for the procurement and construction of redevelopment work at the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station in Canada.The undisclosed contract value will be booked in the fourth quarter of 2017.Contract DetailsSince early 1990s, the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station has generated roughly 20% of Ontario’s energy requirements, which caters to more than two million homes daily. The facility is going through a mid-life refurbishment to extend its life.Under the contract, Fluor will replace the emergency power generators for Units 1 and 2, to ensure site safety, and are part of the infrastructure projects in progress to revamp the power station.Late last month, Fluor secured another contract with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (“MBTA”). Fluor-led joint venture (consisting of Balfour Beatty Infrastructure, Herzog Contracting Group and The Middlesex Corp.) was chosen as the design-build team for the projected $2-billion Green Line Light Rail Extension in Boston.Fluor also completed a high priority 38kv power line close to San Juan in November.The contract called for power grid restoration, and repair and replacement of structures and equipment supporting the re-energization. It also involved recommissioning of electrical infrastructure in eastern Puerto Rico.Present Business ScenarioFluor has a solid track record of receiving awards. Management remains optimistic about continuation of this trend in the future as well, which is anticipated to drive growth. The company has encouraging long-term prospects in fields such as renewable energy, gas-fired combined cycle generation and air emissions compliance projects.Based on the current trends, Fluor remains confident that it will secure two major EPC mining projects over the next few quarters. The company’s healthy level of backlog in infrastructure, government, life sciences and advanced manufacturing has enabled it to offset multiyear declines in mining, metals, and oil & gas markets.Fluor has returned 25.4% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 15.3%. Despite such impressive growth drivers, volatility in commodity prices, and the cyclical nature of the company’s commodity-based business lines pose significant challenges for the coming quarters.Further, the company’s margins are under pressure as it is transitioning from higher-margin engineering to lower-margin construction activities, particularly related to the Energy & Chemicals and Mining segment. Slow backlog conversion is a persistent problem in this sector. Low capital spending, intermediate softness in key end markets and continuous erosion in the backlog levels are also other pressing issues.Nevertheless, we believe this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s streamlined business structure, and gradual improvement in energy and mining sectors will offer growth opportunities, going forward.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Boise Cascade, L.L.C.

60,FLR,"Construction sector stocks have performed well in the past six months, with the sector gaining 16.7% on average, more than double the S&P 500’s gain of 8.1%. We believe growth-conducive policies of the government and expectations of higher infrastructure spending drove the shares’ performance.Within the sector, the engineering and R&D services space has gained 15.8% in the same time frame, also outperforming the broader market comfortably.We shall focus on this space, particularly on a comparative analysis of three companies in the industry — Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report), Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report) and AECOM (ACM  -  Free Report). The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 70 (Top 26% in more than 250 industries).Price PerformanceBeginning with share price performance, Fluor rose 4.9% over the last six months. Fluor compares badly to Quanta Services as well as AECOM, which have charted an impressive trajectory of late, appreciating 20.8% and 14.2% during the same time frame. While AECOM still lags the industry’s average return of 15.8%, Quanta Services has soared past that as well.Earnings Trend Fluor has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the last four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 6.3%, while AECOM has managed to meet earnings estimates twice for as many beats. Quanta Services, however, has missed earnings estimates thrice, for an average negative surprise of 2.8% over the trailing four quarters.Recent Quarterly PerformanceIn the last reported quarter, all three companies witnessed revenue growth. Fluor’s revenue growth of 3.7% year over year helped it beat on the bottom line, driven by increased project execution activities for certain downstream, and mining and metal projects and several large multi-year decommissioning and cleanup projects.Quanta Services’ top line surged an impressive 27.8% year over year in its last quarterly report. Robust revenues generation at the Oil and Gas Infrastructure as well as Electric Power Infrastructure Services segments acted as the primary catalyst.AECOM’s revenues grew 12.3% year over year, driven primarily by Building Construction and Power business, and improvement in Oil & Gas business.Estimate Trend & Analyst OutlookFor 2017, Fluor has witnessed four upward estimate revisions in the last 30 days, which led to the Zacks Consensus Estimate rising 6.1% to $1.56. This signifies decidedly bullish analyst sentiment for the stock.On the other hand, Quanta Services’ Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has seen five downward estimate revisions and fell 2% over the last month to $1.97, underlining bearish analyst outlook. Analysts are not favouring AECOM either, as its Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved south from $2.75 to $2.66 over the last month, a fall of 3.3%.Growth ExpectationsFor the next year, we anticipate Fluor earnings to grow a whopping 46.4%, while Quanta Services’ and AECOM’s growth expectations are pegged at 23.7% and 10.5%, respectively.ValuationFluor’s stock is currently trading at a trailing-12-month P/E multiple of 17.4, which is cheaper than the industry’s P/E of 18. Quanta Services’ P/E is 19.8, while that of AECOM is 12.8. So we see that in terms of trailing-twelve-months P/E ratio, AECOM is the cheapest, while Fluor is also trading at a discount to the industry.VGM ScoreSince none of these engineering heavyweights are standing out particularly, let us review them using our VGM Score. This score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and pick the winners.Fluor and AECOM currently boast a VGM Score of A, while that of Quanta Services is F.Final CallEven though the three companies carry the same Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Fluor leads in terms of expected earnings growth, earnings surprise trend and estimate revisions. Its valuation is decent, and a top VGM Score further tilts the scales in favour of Fluor.A better-ranked stock in the same space is KBR, Inc. (KBR  -  Free Report), holding a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.KBR has beaten estimates twice in the trailing four quarters.

62,FLR,"Premium engineering and construction firm, Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 72 cents, reflecting a beat of 22%. Overall, Fluor has a decent earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 9.9% in the trailing four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayFluor’s market diversity remains a key strength that helps it mitigate the cyclicality of markets in which it operates. The company’s strategy of maintaining a good business portfolio mix permits it to focus on the more stable business markets as well as capitalize on developing the cyclical markets at suitable times. The long-term prospects of the company also remain strong with existing growth opportunities in renewable energy, gas-fired combined cycle generation and air emissions compliance projects for existing coal-fired power plants.The company is poised to grow on the back of its strong track record of receiving awards. The management remains optimistic about continuation of this trend in future as well, which is expected to prove conducive to bottom-line growth in the to-be reported quarter as well. The company continues to receive awards for FEED and pre-FEED work for gold, bauxite and copper projects. Based on the present trends, Fluor remains confident that it will secure two major EPC mining projects in the upcoming quarters.Moreover, the company’s continuous focus on cost controls enables it deliver the performance requirements specified by its clients as well as their budgetary needs. Fluor’s current focus on transforming its EPC model into one integrated solution is likely to expand its scope of work on a project, improve client satisfaction and provide an opportunity to generate greater returns.Despite these positives, the fact remains that the widespread macroeconomic challenges have severely restricted the company’s performance for the past several quarters. Sluggish backlog conversion problem has been a persistent crisis in this sector, mainly attributable to uncertain macroeconomic conditions. These conditions are likely to hinder growth to a large extent.This apart, the company bears significant cost overruns risk as the price of several of its contracts is fixed. It may experience reduced profits if costs increase above its estimates, which might reflect poorly on the upcoming quarterly results.Further, volatility in commodity prices and cyclical nature of the company’s commodity-based business lines, poses significant challenges for Fluor in the upcoming quarters. Other major headwinds include uncertain award timings, weak spending on the part of the clients, intense competition. Also, foreign currency volatility along with complex stick built and construction projects are likely to add to the company’s woes.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Fluor this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is +3.19% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Fluor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Fluor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Fluor Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: Fluor has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), which makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LPX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.90% and a Zacks Rank #1.

63,FLR,"ABB Ltd. (ABB  -  Free Report) reported operational earnings per share of 34 cents for third-quarter 2017, up 4% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents by 13.3%. Strong top-line growth and diligent cost-saving initiatives helped maintain earnings.Investors cheered the impressive earnings and revenue growth, taking ABB’s shares up 3.1% at one point in pre-market trading.Quarterly revenues were up 6% year over year in comparable terms, came in at $8,724 million, trumping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,499 million. Individually, revenues witnessed growth in three of the four segments of the company, with growth in Electrification Products, Robotics and Motion, and Industrial Automation, more than offsetting minor contraction in Power Grids growth.Revenue in SegmentsElectrification Products (up 5% year over year in comparable terms to $2,596 million): Orders were up 7% year over year to $2,547 million, driven by positive construction and utility demand, particularly in the AMEA region.Robotics and Motion (up 8% to $2,201 million): Sales grew steadily on solid demand trends in robotics and energy-efficient solutions in the automotive and general industry sectors. Orders of this segment moved up 4% year over year to $2,032 million on a year-over-year basis, backed by continued strong demand patterns in robotics and light industry.Industrial Automation (up 1% to $1,804 million): Orders continued to be steady after witnessing the recent negative trend, rising 14% year over year to $1,654 million, owing to selective capital expenditure investments in cruise and specialty vessels, and mining.Power Grids (flat at $2,533 million): Steady execution of a healthy order backlog and good project execution kept revenues steady. Orders declined 6% to $2,244 million mainly due to the timing of large contract awards and continued selectivity driven by change in business model.Total orders were up 8% year over year at $8,157 million and increased 5% on a comparable basis, reflecting solid base order development across most regions and divisions. Base orders grew 6% on a year-over-year basis, while large orders were down 5%, mirroring the change in the company’s business model. The order backlog at quarter end amounted to $23.4 billion (down 1% year over year).On a geographic basis, demand was positive in the European countries, with moderate overall growth and good timing of large capital investments. Orders displayed sound growth in the Americas as well, fueledby increased demand for automation and energy efficient solutions. The United States grew 6% in total orders. The Asia, Middle East and Africa (AMEA) region witnessed a mixed performance, with substantial order growth in UAE, South Africa and Australia, which were slightly offset by order declines in China.Book-to-bill ratio at the end of the reported quarter was 0.94, up from 0.91 recorded in the comparable quarter a year ago.Operational earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (“Operational EBITA”) in the quarter under review rose 3% year over year in comparable terms to $1,124 million. The figure was driven by the positive net savings effect and volume contribution, which was partially offset by commodity price escalation and investments in growth and business transformation.ABB Ltd Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  ABB Ltd Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ABB Ltd QuoteNext Level Strategy: Stage 3In third-quarter 2016, ABB had launched the third stage of the revamped version of its “Next Level Strategy” which focuses on three areas, namely profitable growth, relentless execution and business-led collaboration. This stage calls for restructuring the company’s divisions into four market-leading entrepreneurial businesses, unlocking its full digital potential, accelarating momentum in operational excellence and enhancing the company’s brand.ABB restructured its business into four segments: Electrification Products, Robotics and Motion, Industrial Automation and Power Grids, effective from Jan 1, 2017. This restructuring will help increase the company’s focus on higher growth segments, strengthening its competitiveness and de-risking the portfolio.Further, in order to unlock its digital capabilities, ABB had announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), to shore up its capabilities in the industrial internet market, by combining cloud technology with industrial digital technology. Together, the companies will develop next-generation digital solutions on an integrated open cloud platform.During the reported quarter, ABB continued the implementation of this strategy by shifting its core operations to higher growth segments, boosting its competitiveness and de-risking the portfolio.Moreover, ABB is optimistic about the White-Collar Productivity savings program, which has surpassed expectations since its inception. The company is on track to achieve the cost-reduction target under the program of $1.3 billion within the decided timeframe. Also, ABB now projects to incur about $240 million lower combined restructuring program and implementation costs than initially expected. The company is currently implementing its regular cost-saving programs to achieve savings equivalent to 3-5% of cost of sales each year.Liquidity & Cash FlowsABB’s cash and cash equivalents as of Sep 30, 2017, were $3,649 million compared with $3,644 million as of Dec 31, 2016. Total long-term debt rose to $7,061 million at the quarter end from $5,800 million as of Dec 31, 2016.ABB’s cash flow from operating activities came in at $954 million for the third quarter compared with $1,081 million in third-quarter 2016. The decline underlined higher current trade receivables related to additional revenues that were billed in the quarter, as well as the build-up of inventory to serve growth.Divestitures, Acquisitions and PartnershipsDuring third-quarter 2016, ABB decided to sell its global high-voltage cable system business to NKT Cables in a deal worth $934 million. ABB and NKT Cables also signed an agreement for a long-term strategic partnership, under which they will work together on future projects, in areas like sub-sea interconnections and direct current transmission links. At the heart of it, the cables deal is part of ABB’s active portfolio management and will make the core power grids business simpler, stronger, and more focused.Alongside, ABB also announced two important partnerships. The company signed a partnership deal with engineering and construction firm, Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report). Through the strategic partnership, ABB and Fluor will execute large turnkey engineering, procurement, construction (“EPC”) electrical substation projects. Furthermore, ABB formed an agreement to partner with Aibel to deliver offshore wind integration solutions.Per ABB, the two new alliances, in addition to greater focus on higher-margin consultancy services and software, will help elevate the Power Grids unit’s margin target to 10-14% (up from a previous target of 8-12%).During the quarter, ABB closed its acquisition of B&R — an independent provider dealing in product- and software-based, open-architecture solutions for machine and factory automation globally. This buyout will bridge the gap in machine and factory automation which ABB has been facing, and create an exclusive, comprehensive automation portfolio for clients across the world. ABB expects this acquisition to be accretive to earnings in the first year.In addition to this, ABB announced that it has agreed to acquire the data transmission business of the KEYMILE Group. This buyout will enable the company to expand its communication networks business footprint in the industrial, transportation and infrastructure domains. It will add reliable communications technology offerings to ABB’s diverse portfolio, helping it fortify its foothold in digital electrical grids.These buyouts will help accelerate ABB’s operational momentum.Share RepurchaseAt the end of third-quarter 2016, ABB announced completion of the $4-billion share buyback program introduced in September 2014. Under the program, the company repurchased approximately 171.3 million shares for about $3.5 billion. Consequently, ABB had announced a new share buyback program of up to $3 billion from 2017 through 2019, highlighting consistent strength in cash generation and financial position.As the GE Industrial Solutions transaction (discussed below) is in progress, ABB has decided to put its previously-announced planned share buyback program on hold.To ConcludeABB is facing a mixed macroeconomic and geopolitical climate, as the United States and China remain buoyant amid modest global growth and heightened uncertainties. Europe is also witnessing some positive trends. Nevertheless, lower capital spending for the company’s key upstream energy end-markets and foreign exchange volatility might continue to hurt its financials. The company is vulnerable to heightened uncertainty, stemming from the Brexit decision, as well as geopolitical tensions elsewhere in the world, which are overshadowing global markets.Despite the negatives, we believe the company’s long-term prospects are stable. The company’s three major customers in utilities, industry, and transport & infrastructure are likely to drive growth. Apart from this, encouraging development in electricity value chain, rapid progress of Internet of things, services and people, and a surge in energy-efficient transport and infrastructure bode well.Moreover, we look favourably upon ABB’s recent $2.6 billion deal to acquire General Electric Company’s (GE  -  Free Report) global electrification solutions business. This acquisition will enable the integration of ABB’s Electrification Products division into GE Industrial Solutions, resulting in a unique global portfolio and a complete offering for North American as well as global customers. The deal has significant value creation potential and will expand ABB’s installed base considerably.ABB currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

64,FLR,"U.S. homebuilders’ confidence slipped in September, as two devastating hurricanes — Harvey and Irma — brewed uncertainty for builders.The National Association of Home Builders or NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI), which measures confidence in the market for new single-family home, dropped to 64 this month, from a downwardly revised 67 in August.Hurricane Harvey hit Texas and Louisiana in late August, and Irma lashed Florida in early September. Economists are of the opinion that shortage of skilled construction labor is expected to worsen following the two devastating storms and rebuilding operations are likely to drive construction costs higher causing delays. The construction sector was already witnessing a labor shortage, which has worsened post the hurricanes.All three HMI components fell in September. A measure of current sales conditions for single-family homes dropped four points to 70, while the index depicting sales expectations over the next six months slid four points to 73. Meanwhile, the component measuring buyer traffic edged down one point to 47.Undoubtedly, sales tumbled this summer, reflecting the inventory shortage prevailing in the U.S. real estate market.  This has shot up average home prices nationwide. Investors should note that housing starts, permits and completions dropped 4.8%, 4.1% and 6.2%, respectively, in July. New U.S. single-family home sales also unexpectedly fell 9.4% in July, the lowest level since December 2016. August new-home sales readings are due out next week (Sep 26, 2017).Reaffirming Positive OutlookSeptember readings gauging builders' view on sales over the next six months slipped from August. However, homebuilders' overall vision of the new-home market remains positive.The housing market is expected to gradually recover throughout the rest of the year, banking on solid ongoing job market, economic growth and rising consumer confidence. New home sales figure has been higher compared with last year, reflecting strong demand for homes as the economy continues to create jobs.Against such a backdrop, homebuilders with strong fundamentals are cashing in on higher demand and favorable dynamics, partially offsetting the ongoing challenges of the industry comprising land and labor shortages and rising material prices.However, a number of companies have been losing grounds in recent times and it would be wise for investors to reshuffle their portfolio and get rid of stocks that may hurt returns.5 Names to Stay Away From  Selecting weak stocks and dumping them from your portfolio is a daunting task, as there are names aplenty.

65,FLR,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 12% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Fluor Q2 Earnings Beat on Estimates, Guidance CutFluor's second-quarter 2017 earnings (excluding non-recurring costs) came in at 72 cents per share, crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents by 22.0%.However, on a reported basis, the company’s loss came in at 17 cents a share, in stark contrast to the earnings per share of 72 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter.An after-tax charge of $124 million, related to estimated cost increases on three gas-fired power projects, pushed the bottom line into the red. Also, a drab revenue performance added to Fluor’s woes.Inside the HeadlinesSecond-quarter revenues came in at $4,716.1 million, falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,935 million by 4.4% and edging down 2.9% year over year. Two of the company’s four segments recorded revenue growth, which was more than offset by the decline recorded by the other two segments.Revenues from the Energy, Chemicals and Mining segment declined 7.0% year over year to $2,304.0 million on account of reduced activity on Gulf Coast chemicals projects.Industrial, Infrastructure and Power segment’s revenues inched up 1.6% year over year to $1,026.5 million. Sales at this segment largely benefited from increased project execution activities for several life sciences, advanced manufacturing and two nuclear projects for Westinghouse.Revenues at the Government segment were up 13.1% year over year to $744.2 million, on the back of higher project execution activities for the Idaho Cleanup Project Core Contract (“Idaho Core Project”) and construction services projects.Diversified Services revenues were down 9.9% to $641.4 million on a year-over-year basis. Completion of large Stork projects in Australia and delays in the seasonal upturn in European markets weighed down on the top-line performance of this segment.For the reported quarter, Fluor’s new awards were down 50.3% to $3.2 billion on a year-over-year basis. Orders at the Industrial, Infrastructure and Power segment were $672 million, including the Southern Gateway highway project in Texas. The orders in the government business came in at $1,109 million, including task orders for LOGCAP IV in Afghanistan, additional funding for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the Idaho Cleanup Project Core Contract.Orders at the Energy, Chemicals and Mining segment totaled $860 million. Orders at the Diversified Services segment grossed $554 million.Consolidated backlog at the end of the quarter was $37.6 billion, down from $47.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. The backlog erosion is attributable to adjustment for a liquefied natural gas project in Canada, cancellation of a nuclear power plant project for Westinghouse and adjustment made to limit the contractual term of the Magnox nuclear decommissioning project.Liquidity & Shares RepurchasesAs of Jun 30, 2017, Fluor had cash and marketable securities (including non-current) of $2,144.9 million, up from $2,105.0 million as on Dec 31, 2016. Long-term debt at the end of second-quarter 2017 rose to $1,560.5 million from $1,517.9 million as on Dec 31, 2016.2017 Guidance CutConcurrent with the second-quarter 2017 results, the company slashed its 2017 guidance for the second time in a row. The company currently projects earnings per share in the range of $1.40–$1.70 compared with the previous range of $2.25–$2.75.The downward guidance revision is mainly attributable to charges incurred in the Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment and the winding down of the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station project. In addition, slowdown of the pace of new awards and a waning revenue trajectory adds to the company’s grim sentiment. This apart, volatility in commodity prices is likely to play spoilsport.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been four revisions lower for the current quarter.Fluor Corporation Price and Consensus  Fluor Corporation Price and Consensus | Fluor Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, the stock has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for value investors than growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock. The magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift.  It's no surprise that the stock has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We are expecting a below average return from the stock in the next few months.

66,FLR,"Investors in Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the September 15th, 2017 $55.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Fluor Corporation shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Fluor Corporation is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Engineering - R and D Services industry that ranks in the Bottom 45% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while analysts have revised the estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 68 cents per shareto 59 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Fluor Corporation right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

68,FLR,"ABB Ltd. (ABB  -  Free Report) reported operational earnings per share of 30 cents, down 14.3% year over year, but beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents by 3.4%. Steady revenues and diligent cost-saving initiatives helped maintain earnings. However, this was more than offset by tough macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions which ultimately affected revenues.Investors were disappointed with the year-over-year earnings contraction and ABB’s shares were down 3.7% at one point in pre-market trading.Quarterly revenues were up 1% year over year and came in at $8,454 million. Individually, revenues witnessed growth in two of the four segments of the company, with growth in Electrification Products and Robotics and Motion, more than offsetting flat Power Grids growth and contraction in Industrial Automation revenues. However, revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,593 million.Revenue in SegmentsElectrification Products (up 2% year over year in comparable terms to $2,509 million): Orders were down 1% year over year to $2,512 million, as positive orders in Europe were more than offset by a decline in the Americas and AMEA.Robotics and Motion (up 5% to $2,087 million): Sales grew steadily on strong demand trends in robotics and the light industry. Orders of this segment moved up 14% year over year to $2,219 million on a year-over-year basis, driven by continued strong demand patterns in robotics and light industry.Industrial Automation (down 7% to $1,608 million): Revenues remained on a downtrend in this segment, particularly due to declines in discretionary spending in oil & gas, and related sectors. Orders reversed the recent negative trend, rising 8% year over year to $1,499 million, owing to selective capital expenditure investments in oil & gas and in mining. Lower capital spending in process industries and constrained discretionary spending in process industries continue to harm this segment.Power Grids (flat at $2,647 million): Steady execution of a healthy order backlog and solid project execution kept revenues steady. However, orders declined 6% to $2,484 million mainly due to the timing of large contract awards.Total orders were flat year over year at $8,349 million and increased 3% on a comparable basis, as the noteworthy increase in Robotics and Motion and Industrial Automation more than offset the decline in Electrification Products and Power Grids. A stronger U.S. dollar resulted in a negative currency translation impact of 3%. Base orders grew 3% on a year-over-year basis, while large orders grew 5%. The order backlog at quarter end amounted to $23.6 billion (down 1% year over year).On a geographic basis, demand was positive in the European countries, with moderate overall growth and good timing of large capital investments. Orders displayed sound growth in the Americas as well, driven by increased demand for automation and energy efficient solutions. The U.S. grew 7% in total orders, offsetting decline in Canada. The Asia, Middle East and Africa (AMEA) witnessed mixed performance, with substantial order growth in India, Saudi Arabia and South Africa, which were offset by order declines in China.Book-to-bill ratio at the end of the second quarter was 0.99, up from 0.96 in the comparable quarter a year ago.Operational earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (“Operational EBITA”) in the quarter under review fell 5% year over year in comparable terms to $1,042 million. The figure was hurt by commodity price increases and overcapacity in some businesses.Next Level Strategy: Stage 3In third-quarter 2016, ABB had launched the third stage of the revamped version of its “Next Level Strategy” which focuses on three areas, namely profitable growth, relentless execution and business-led collaboration. This stage calls for restructuring the company’s divisions into four market-leading entrepreneurial businesses, unlocking its full digital potential, increasing momentum in operational excellence and enhancing the company’s brand.ABB restructured its business into four segments: Electrification Products, Robotics and Motion, Industrial Automation and Power Grids, effective from Jan 1, 2017. This restructuring will help in increasing its focus on higher growth segments, strengthening its competitiveness and de-risking the portfolio. Further, in order to unlock its digital capabilities, ABB had announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), to shore up its capabilities in the industrial internet market, by combining cloud technology with industrial digital technology. Together, the companies will develop next-generation digital solutions on an integrated open cloud platform.During the reported quarter, ABB continued the implementation of this strategy by shifting its core operations to higher growth segments, boosting its competitiveness and de-risking the portfolio.Moreover, ABB is optimistic about the White-Collar Productivity savings program, which has surpassed expectations since its launch. The company is on track to achieve the cost-reduction target under the program of $1.3 billion within the decided timeframe. Also, ABB now expects to incur about $200 million lower combined restructuring program and implementation costs than initially expected. The company is currently implementing its regular cost-savings programs to achieve savings equivalent to 3–5% of cost of sales each year.ABB Ltd Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise ABB Ltd Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ABB Ltd QuoteLiquidity & Cash FlowsABB’s cash and cash equivalents as of Jun 30, 2017 were $5,018 million compared with $3,644 million as of Dec 31, 2016. Total long-term debt rose to $6,909 million at the quarter end from $5,800 million as of Dec 31, 2016.ABB’s cash flow from operating activities came in at just $467 million for the second quarter compared with $1,082 million in second-quarter 2016. The decline reflected the delay of short-term incentive payments, timing of tax payments and delays in payment from the Middle Eastern customers.Divestitures and PartnershipsDuring third-quarter 2016, ABB decided to sell its global high-voltage cable system business to NKT Cables in a deal worth $934 million. ABB and NKT Cables also signed an agreement for a long-term strategic partnership, under which they will work together on future projects, in areas like sub-sea interconnections and direct current transmission links.ABB considered the offloaded unit as a niche business, which had been improving in recent times. However, the company is facing what will likely be the end to Europe's offshore wind-power boom years, as the industry grapples with shrinking investments and uncertainty over future subsidies. At the heart of it, the cables deal is part of ABB’s active portfolio management and will make the core power grids business simpler, stronger, and more focused.Alongside, ABB also announced two important partnerships. The company signed a partnership deal with engineering and construction firm, Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report). Through the strategic partnership, ABB and Fluor will execute large turnkey engineering, procurement, construction (“EPC”) electrical substation projects. Further, ABB formed an agreement to partner with Aibel to deliver offshore wind integration solutions.Per ABB, the two new alliances, in addition to greater focus on higher-margin consultancy services and software, will help elevate the Power Grids unit’s margin target to 10–14% (up from a previous target of 8–12%).On Jul 6, ABB closed its acquisition of B&R — an independent provider dealing in product- and software-based, open-architecture solutions for machine and factory automation globally. This buyout will bridge the gap in machine and factory automation which ABB has been facing, and will create an exclusive, comprehensive automation portfolio for clients across the world. ABB expects this acquisition to be accretive to earnings in the first year.Further, on Jul 3, ABB announced that it has agreed to acquire data transmission business of the KEYMILE Group. This buyout will enable the company to expand its communication networks business footprint in the industrial, transportation and infrastructure domains. It will add reliable communications technology offerings to ABB’s diverse portfolio, helping it fortify its foothold in digital electrical grids.These buyouts will help accelerate ABB’s operational momentum.Share RepurchaseAt the end of third-quarter 2016, ABB declared the completion of the $4-billion share buyback program introduced in Sep 2014. Under the program, the company repurchased approximately 171.3 million shares for about $3.5 billion. Consequently, ABB had announced a new share buyback program of up to $3 billion from 2017 through 2019, highlighting consistent strength in cash generation and financial position. The company also cancelled 46.6 million shares this month, which will be reflected in the third quarter.To ConcludeABB is facing a mixed macroeconomic and geopolitical climate, as the U.S. and China remain buoyant amid modest global growth and heightened uncertainties. Lower capital spending for the company’s key upstream energy end-markets and foreign exchange volatility will likely continue to hurt its financials. The company is vulnerable to increased uncertainty, stemming from the Brexit decision, as well as geopolitical tensions elsewhere in the world, which are overshadowing global markets.Despite the negatives, we believe that the company’s long-term prospects are stable. The company’s three major customers in utilities, industry, and transport & infrastructure are likely to drive growth. Apart from this, positive development in electricity value chain, rapid progress of Internet of things, services and people and a surge in energy-efficient transport and infrastructure bode well.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderABB currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

71,FLR,"Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) recently awarded Subsea 7 S.A. (SUBCY  -  Free Report) with an engineering, procurement, construction and installation (“EPCI”) contract for the Penguins redevelopment project, located in the North Sea. In mid-January, Shell announced its plan to redevelop the Penguins oil and gas field, located around 150 miles northeast of the Shetland Islands.Subsea 7’s RoleThe contract requires the oil field service provider to deliver two Pipeline Bundles, which will include pipe-in-pipe production flowlines as well as gas lift flowlines, and control systems.

72,FLR,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 17.4% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is FLR due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Fluor Misses on Q1 Earnings & Revenues, Cuts ViewFluor reported a net loss of 13 cents per share in first-quarter 2018 comparing unfavourably with net earnings of 43 cents per share in the year ago period. The bottom-line plunge can primarily be attributed to after-tax charge for forecast revisions on a gas-fired power project.Excluding the charges, the company’s earnings came in at 56 cents, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents by 30.9%.Inside the HeadlinesFirst-quarter revenues came in at $4,823.8 million, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,838 million and were relatively flat year over year. Decline in revenues from Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power and Energy & Chemicals more than offset the revenue gain at the Government and Diversified Services segments.Revenues at the Government segment soared 73.5% year over year to $1,327.2 million. The improvement in revenues were supported by the execution and substantial completion of task order awards for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Puerto Rico. New awards in the quarter totalled $43 million.Diversified Services revenues increased 13% to $643.3 million on a year-over-year basis, reflecting growth in revenues from Stork operations in Latin America and North America.

73,FLR,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Fluor Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.6, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 19.9. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Fluor Corporation’s current PE ratio somewhat above its midpoint (which is 14.9) over the past five years.However, the stock’s PE compares unfavorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 15.3. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now, compared to its peers.Also, we should also point out that Fluor Corporation has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 22.3, so it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near future.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Fluor Corporation has a P/S ratio of about 0.4. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Fluor Corporation currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes FLR a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Fluor Corporation is just 0.9, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1.9. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, FLR is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Fluor Corporation might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of F. This gives FLR a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of D. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter has seen four estimates go lower in the past sixty days, compared to none higher, while the full year estimate has seen four downward and one upward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined nearly 14.8% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has decreased about 27.7%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Fluor Corporation Price and Consensus  Fluor Corporation Price and Consensus | Fluor Corporation QuoteThis bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineFluor Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a good industry rank (top 22% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

74,FLR,"Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.

Notably, Jacobs’ fiscal first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 77 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents.Our proven model shows that the company will likely beat estimates in the quarter under review.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Jacobs has the right combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Jacobs currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.34%. This is because the stock’s Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents is a penny lower than the Most Accurate estimate.Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. QuoteYou can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Jacobs’ favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), when combined with a positive Earnings ESP, predicts a likely earnings beat.Per our proven model, a stock needs to have a combination of a positive Earnings ESP, and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 or at least 3 (Hold), for a likely earnings beat.However, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.What’s Driving the Stellar Earnings?Elevated infrastructure spending in the United States and some major emerging economies, like China, is expected to spur demand for Jacobs’ premium engineering and construction management services over the long run.Though no specific financial guidance has been provided for the fiscal second quarter, Jacobs’ expectation for the fiscal will give a rough idea of the factors that might have influenced results in the to-be-reported quarter.The company expects that elevated defense spending in major economies like the United States, new organic investments, bolt-on acquisitions, superior customer relationships and sturdier demand for state-of-the-art technology solutions will boost revenues of Aerospace & Technology line of business (LOB).Additionally, increasing public investments in worldwide transportation and water infrastructure, as well as business prospects in the healthcare market are anticipated to drive top-line performance of the company’s Buildings & Infrastructure LOB in the near term.Moreover, the company believes revenues of its Industrial LOB will go up in the upcoming quarters, on the back of improved life science, semiconductor, and mining & minerals businesses.Furthermore, amid the lackluster energy market, Jacobs expects that efforts to strengthen its downstream chemicals and refining business will likely drive revenues of the company's Petroleum & Chemicals LOB.Stellar top-line performance of the aforementioned segments, greater cost management, restructuring moves, reduced corporate taxes and timely project delivery are expected to have reinforced the company’s bottom-line performance in the quarter.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks in the Zacks Construction sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.63%.

75,FLR,"The first-quarter earnings season is well past the halfway mark, with earnings and revenue growth on track to reach its highest level in the last seven years.Around 267 S&P 500 companies have reported first-quarter 2018 financial numbers as of Apr 27, reflecting a decent performance across the earnings season. Total earnings for these companies increased 25.1% year over year on 10% higher revenues, with 76.8% beating earnings estimates and 73.8% surpassing top-line expectations. Based on the hitherto observed pattern, the first quarter is anticipated to register an impressive double-digit percentage earnings growth year over year.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for S&P 500 companies are now expected to rise 22.6% on 8.4% increase in revenues. This represents an improved growth projection from the previous quarter, driven by a corporate tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data. Also, experts believe that the bottom line is likely to grow steadily in 2018 and beyond. Notably, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to rise 18.5% on a year-over-year basis owing to 5.5% improvement in revenues, which if realized will mark the highest annual growth pace for the index since 2010.Given this healthy backdrop, most sectors are anticipated to deliver an impressive performance in this reporting cycle. For instance, per the above report, 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors are projected to deliver double-digit earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. Only the Auto sector is expected to end the quarter with earnings decline.Of these high-flying sectors, Construction appears to be quite strong. For the sector, earnings are likely to increase 46.7% year over year, while revenues are anticipated to rise 17.3%. Moreover, factors such as a rise in GDP, low unemployment level, strong job additions and positive consumer confidence work in favor of the sector. Additionally, President Trump’s business-friendly policies, including tax cuts and repeal of regulations, are expected to mitigate some of the risks arising from the recent imposition of tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.Notably, per the latest U.S. Census Bureau report, construction spending during March dropped 1.7% from the previous month. However, for the first three months of 2018, the metric increased 5.5% compared with the same period last year. Amid this backdrop, it will be interesting to wait and see how some of the Construction stocks fare when the companies release their results on May 3.Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report), a premium engineering and construction firm is scheduled to report results for the first quarter of 2018. The company has surpassed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 8.4%. In the last reported quarter, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.1%. Notably, the company’s long-term prospects remain strong backed by existing growth opportunities in renewable energy, gas-fired combined cycle generation and air emissions compliance projects for current coal-fired power plants.Fluor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Fluor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Fluor Corporation QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $4,838 million, relatively flat compared with its reported value in the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for earnings per share stands at 81 cents, indicating an improvement of 42.1% from the prior-year quarter.Our quantitative model hints at an earnings beat for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company in the upcoming quarterly results.

76,FLR,"Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings came in at 70 cents per share, reflecting a beat of 11.1%.We expect Fluor to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Fluor is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because the stock has the right combination of two ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Fluor has an Earnings ESP of +2.28% as the Most Accurate estimate of 82 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Fluor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Fluor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Fluor Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors Driving Better-Than-Expected ResultsOver the past few quarters, Fluor’s market diversity has remained a key strength and has allowed the company to mitigate the cyclicality of markets in which it operates. In addition, this premium engineering and construction firm’s long-term prospects remain strong backed by existing growth opportunities in renewable energy, gas-fired combined cycle generation and air emissions compliance projects for current coal-fired power plants. Fluor also continues to be optimistic about its investment projects, particularly the LNG projects in North America.Furthermore, the company has a strong track record of receiving awards, which is anticipated to prove conducive to bottom-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter as well. Meanwhile, Fluor continues to receive awards for FEED and pre-FEED work for gold, bauxite and copper projects. Based on these present trends, the company expects to secure two major EPC mining projects in the next few quarters.Fluor also remains optimistic about its end markets, including mining. Within the Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment relative stability in commodity prices are likely to boost investments in downstream, petrochemicals and mining. Additionally, commercial markets, including life sciences and infrastructure, are likely to improve going forward. Robust pipeline of work in North America and Europe are expected to be favourable for the company’s Diversified Services business. Further, the company has grown its maintenance, fabrication and construction capabilities as well as invested in its systems and processes that are expected to improve its project delivery.Given this backdrop, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues from the company’s Industrial, Infrastructure and Power segment remains high at $1,050 million, reflecting growth of 4.7% sequentially. Also, the company’s healthy level of backlog in infrastructure, government, life sciences and advanced manufacturing should continue driving profitable growth.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LPX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.37% and a Zacks Rank #1.

80,FLR,"Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on May 3.The company's earnings surprise history is decent, with two beats and two misses in the trailing four quarters. In the last reported quarter, the company reported earnings of 45 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.3%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Consider  Quanta Services remains optimistic about the prospects of its end markets in both of its segments namely, Electric Power and Oil & Gas segments, over the next couple of years. Particularly, the company’s communications infrastructure services business seems to be performing brilliantly. Of late, the company is actively pursuing opportunities with various U.S. telecom and cable MSOs. With the larger diameter pipeline market expanding, and a multi-year cycle ahead of it, the company remains optimistic about its communications infrastructure services operations.Moreover, Quanta Services’ oil and gas segment outlook looks promising primarily owing to the improving mainline and natural gas distribution and integrity markets. Moving ahead, the company continues to expect healthy levels of base load work, including supporting midstream infrastructure, downstream support services and natural gas distribution. Additionally, it anticipates strong performance from pipeline projects driven by a considerable increase in large pipeline revenue contributions amid an active bidding and negotiating environment.Further, the company’s decentralized and entrepreneurial business model allows it to combat challenges that arise from a bleak macroeconomic scenario. Also, Quanta Services enjoys strong prospects in end markets supported by key growth drivers like an aging grid, shifting generation mix and grid modernization. These factors are expected to prove conducive to the company’s top line going ahead.Meanwhile, the company remains optimistic about its solid backlog levels, which are likely to grow further. This apart, its recent bolt-on acquisitions are anticipated to boost top-line growth in the quarter under review and beyond.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Quanta Services in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Quanta Services has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 32 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Quanta Services, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Quanta Services, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Quanta Services, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of the ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.28% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.85% and a Zacks Rank of 2.AECOM (ACM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.46% and a Zacks Rank #3.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

81,FLR,"KBR, Inc. (KBR  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings of 34 cents per share in first-quarter 2018, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents by 36%.Notably, the company’s shares increased 3.8% at the close of market on Apr 26, following the company’s earnings release.The improvement in the company’s bottom line is attributable to strong performances at the company’s Government Services business segment as well as progress on the company’s Ichthys project.Inside the HeadlinesIn the quarter under review, revenues were down 6.1% year over year to $ 1,038 million. Completion of various projects in the company’s Hydrocarbons Services segment resulted in decrease in the top line. However, the reported figure surpassed the consensus mark of $937 million.KBR, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise KBR, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | KBR, Inc. QuoteSegment-wise, Government Services revenues rose an impressive 31.5% year over year to $677 million. The uptrend was mainly backed by new award wins from the U.K. Ministry of Defence, the U.S. Air Force and the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division.However, Hydrocarbons Services revenues were down 40.1% year over year to $299 million. Reduced activity on several projects across the sector played spoilsport for the segment.Also, Technology revenues recorded a decline of 6% year over year to $62 million.KBR is changing the name of the Engineering & Construction segment to the Hydrocarbons Services segment. Moreover, the company has shifted the Consulting division, previously reported in the Technology and Consulting segment, to the Hydrocarbons Services segment. We believe that the company’s’ strategic restructuring activities and solid backlog levels should help it sail through difficult economic times and drive growth.As of Mar 31, 2018, the company’s total backlog was $13.2 billion compared with $10.6 billion as of Dec 31, 2017. Of the total backlog, about $11.1 billion is booked under the Government Services segment (up 32.1% on a year-over-year basis) and around $1.6 billion under the Hydrocarbons Services segment (down 11.1% on a year-over-year basis). While Technology accounted for $423 million of the backlog (up 9.3% on a year-over-year basis), Non-strategic Business totaled $5 million in backlog (down 16.7%).Major Contract WinsIn the quarter under review, KBR clinched some prestigious awards in its Government Services segment. These include a $42 million contract from the U.K. Ministry of Defence, a task order from the U.S. Air Force as well as an engineering and technical services contract from the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division.Liquidity & Cash FlowAs of Mar 31, 2018, KBR’s cash and equivalents were $486 million, up from $410 million as of Mar 31, 2017.For the quarter, cash flow used in operating activities totaled $130 million, up from cash use of $115 million in the year-ago quarter.2018 GuidanceConcurrent with the earnings release, KBR provided full-year 2018 outlook. The company currently expects adjusted earnings per share in the band of $1.35-$1.45 per share.This guidance excludes legal costs associated with legacy U.S. Government contracts and acquisition & integration-related expenses related with the Aspire and SGT acquisitions. The estimated legacy legal fees exclude any future cost reimbursement from U.S. Government.KBR currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks in the same space include Willdan Group, Inc. (WLDN  -  Free Report), Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) and Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report). While Willdan Group sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Fluor and Jacobs Engineering carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

82,FLR,"This week, I'm going to focus on the Price to Sales ratio for finding great stocks at great values.The Price to Sales ratio is a great valuation metric. And given the recent run-up in stocks, value, to me, is becoming more and more important.In fact, aside from the Zacks Rank, if I could only use one item to screen and pick stocks with, this item would be the one.DefinitionLet's first start with a definition.The Price to Sales ratio is simply: Price divided by SalesIf the Price to Sales ratio is 1, that means you're paying $1 for every $1 of sales the company makes.A price to sales ratio of 2 means you're paying $2 for every $1 of sales the company makes.As you might have guessed, the lower the Price the Sales ratio, the better.A price to Sales ratio of .5 means you're paying 50 cents for every $1 of sales the company makes.And paying less than a dollar for a dollar's worth of something is a good bargain.One of the reasons I like the Price to Sales ratio is because it looks at sales rather than earnings, like the P/E ratio does.And sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement than earnings.Secondly, I'd be hard pressed to find a screen where adding the Price to Sales ratio didn't improve it.Price to Sales StudyFor me, I prefer to look for stocks with a Price to Sales ratio under 1. Although, I'm willing to go up to 4, depending on the industry.But in my testing, as the illustration below shows, those with a Price to Sales ratio of 1 or less produced the best returns. Between 1 and 2 also outperformed pretty significantly. But once you got over 4, the odds were against you.P/S range greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1:Average Annual Return: 17.8% P/S range greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2: Average Annual Return: 11.1% P/S range greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3: Average Annual Return: 7.3% P/S range greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4: Average Annual Return: 3.8% P/S range greater than 4: Average Annual Return: -7.9% But the best way to use it, I've found, is to find stocks with a Price to Sales ratio below the median for its Industry.And that's what we'll be focusing on in this week's screen.Screen Parameters• Projected Growth Rate greater than or equal to Projected Growth Rate for the S&P(Above market growth rates.)• Last Earnings Surprise greater than 0(Positive EPS Surprise)• Last Sales Surprise greater than 0(Positive Sales Surprise)• Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2(Only stocks with a Zacks Rank of a Strong Buy or Buy get through.)• Price to Sales less than or equal to Median Price to Sales for its Industry(Valuations that are lower than their Industry.)• Price greater than or equal to $5• Avg. 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000Stock SelectionsHere are 5 stocks from this week's list:(CACI  -  Free Report) CACI International(HCLP  -  Free Report) Hi-Crush Partners(ATI  -  Free Report) Allegheny Technologies(FLR  -  Free Report) Fluor Corp(NRG  -  Free Report) NRG EnergySign up now for your 2 week free trial to the Research Wizard and get the rest of the stocks on this list.

83,FLR,"KBR, Inc. (KBR  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has secured a license and engineering (LBED) contract from ENAP Refinerías SA to offer its ROSE solvent deasphalting technology at the latter’s Bío Bío refinery located in Concepcion, Chile.Per the deal, KBR will be responsible for providing technology licensing and basic engineering design for ENAP's forthcoming refinery upgrading project, based at Concepcion. KBR's leading ROSE solvent deasphalting technology at ENAP’s 30,000 BPSD plant should enable the refinery to upgrade a greater proportion of its oil intake into high-grade products. Without changing the refinery’s total processing capacity, the new unit is expected to enable a different product mix. Also, the ROSE unit is likely to provide the refinery with more flexibility, in a bid to reduce its products’ environmental footprint and quickly respond to market developments.Our TakeKBR expects growth across all its key markets driven by continued opportunities across the lifecycle of projects. Moreover, the company foresees decent opportunities in ammonia, petrochemical and refining. Notably, selective opportunities in downstream petrochemical and ethylene projects and a growing number of small-scale LNG projects in North America are expected to boost growth of hydrocarbons. Also, LNG activity is rising on the back of increased demand from China and India for environmental reasons. The company believes that healthy balance between hydrocarbons and government projects positions it well for future growth.Furthermore, KBR’s penchant for acquisitions and strategic alliances is allowing it to bolster the company’s inorganic growth and expand market share. Some notable acquisitions made by the company include Honeywell Technology Solutions and Wyle. Also, it remains optimistic about backlog growth in the early 2018 due to the pipeline of opportunities. In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have returned 16.5% against the industry’s decline of 3.1%.Despite these tailwinds, volatility in the oil and gas markets with oversupply are likely to strain the prices and spending levels, which in turn might affect the company’s projects and orders. Also, prolonged softness in the Engineering & Construction sector along with volatility in material & equipment pricing poses threat to the company's growth.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report), Willdan Group, Inc. (WLDN  -  Free Report) and Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report). While Fluor sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Willdan Group and Jacobs Engineering Group carry Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Fluor surpassed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 8.4%.Willdan Group outpaced estimates in the preceding four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 45.4%.Jacobs Engineering Group surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 11.4%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

84,FLR,"AECOM (ACM  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has signed a five-year partnership agreement with SitScape, Inc. Notably, SitScape is the leader in collaborative User-Defined-Operating-Picture (UDOP) solutions, with its well recognized Digital Enterprise Enablement Platform (DEEP) software.The partnership will see rollout of SitScape’s software in AECOM’s Management Services group, which in turn is likely to enhance the latter’s internal operations. AECOM will leverage SitScape’s award-winning, DEEP software, with integrated data analytics, machine learning, process automation and collaboration capabilities to optimize the mission-critical operations of its customers worldwide.Our TakeAECOM is witnessing robust prospects in all of its segments. Evidently, the Construction Services and the Management Services segments continue to benefit from higher margin work in the building construction and power businesses. Also, the company’s solid backlog levels, which are a key indicator of future revenue growth, reflect significant opportunities in the forthcoming quarters. Moreover, the company’s solid level of backlog of large commercial, stadia and power projects is expected to drive revenue growth and margins going ahead.Additionally, AECOM’s diversified portfolio comprises both designing and construction services. The company is also efficient in dealing with cyclical market volatility, which helps it capitalize on upside of its business during downturns. Notably, more than 70% of the company’s profits are generated from the infrastructure and defense markets that are likely to benefit from the favorable political climate in the United States and abroad. In the past six months, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has returned 0.6% against the industry’s decline of 8%. Also, the Trump administration's focus on investing in defense and cyber security is expected to prove conducive to the company’s growth.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the same space include Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report), Willdan Group, Inc. (WLDN  -  Free Report) and Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report). While Fluor and Willdan Group sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Jacobs Engineering Group carries a Zacks Rank of 2.

85,FLR,"A stock at a 52-week high level is considered a winner. The level works as an indicator for many investors for buying or selling the stock.More often than not, investors wonder if the high price range has made the stock overpriced. While the apprehensions are not completely groundless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily high-priced.In fact, in an attempt to avoid stocks that are trading near their 52-week high levels, an investor might miss out on top gainers.A stock can continue the momentum and keep scaling new highs with time. So, one should take a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks:Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on the catchphrase “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors, who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors’ particular attention (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them reach the level. But that doesn’t always mean an impending decline. The factors — such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions — that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Setting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring continuation of their rally for some time.Current Price/52 Week High >= .80This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.% Change Price – 4 Weeks > 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks > 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales <= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate <= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) >= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank <=2No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price >= 5This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $5 or higher.Volume – 20 days (shares) >= 100000Inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are five of the 16 stocks that made it through the screen:Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) is one of the leading food processing companies in the world. It procures, transports, stores, processes, and merchandises agricultural commodities and products. The company has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 1.7%.AMN Healthcare Services Inc (AMN  -  Free Report) provides physician and nursing recruitment and placement services for hospitals, clinics, medical centers, government facilities, and other healthcare organizations in travel or permanent assignments.

86,FLR,"KBR, Inc. (KBR  -  Free Report) recently announced that the Australian Government has selected the NSI (Aust) Pty Ltd (NSI), a joint-venture company of Kellogg Brown & Root Pty Ltd (KBR  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries Australia Pty Ltd (HII  -  Free Report), for setting up and managing the country’s Naval Shipbuilding College (NSC). Estimated revenues related to this project will be booked as unfilled orders in the Government Services business segment.About the DealAs joint venture partners, KBR and Huntington will provide NSC with a complementary combination of attributes and industry workforce training experience. This will enable NSC to deliver the right workforce armed with efficient skills for the Naval Shipbuilding Program.Also, NSI has brought together a team from various organizations across Australia. These organizations, which belong to education, academic, training and business sectors, are likely to complement KBR's and Huntington's industry and shipbuilding workforce development expertise. Notably, Australian Maritime College, PwC, Manpower Group, vocational education and training providers, Defence Teaming Centre as well as the Defence Industry Educational Skills Consortium are a part of this team.Growth DriversKBR is banking on the strength of its Government Services business segment to optimize the company’s growth potential. We note that KBR’s optimism stems from healthy backlog levels that are expected to grow further. For instance, in the fourth quarter of 2017, this segment delivered impressive performance backed by organic growth and expansion of task orders on existing U.S. Government contracts. Going ahead, KBR expects all its key markets in the United States, the UK and Australia to perform exceedingly well driven by continued opportunities across the lifecycle of projects. Meanwhile, its long-term prospects remain strong, with an increasing portfolio of smaller and OpEx-facing projects, services, program management and maintenance contracts.Furthermore, the company seems to be improving its growth potential and expanding market share through acquisition of companies or assets. In this context, KBR’s acquisition of Honeywell Technology Solutions and Wyle are the notable ones. KBR’s consulting business is also experiencing increased activity, indicating lucrative opportunities in future Engineering and Construction project. In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s shares have rallied 11.9% compared with the industry’s gain of 7.7%.HeadwindsProlonged softness in the Engineering and Construction segments over the past few quarters have been a pressing concern for the company. Also, volatility in the oil and gas markets along with oversupply might strain the prices and spending levels, consequently, affecting KBR’s projects and orders in the quarters ahead.Key PicksTwo better-ranked stocks from the same space are Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) and Willdan Group, Inc.

87,FLR,"Spending on construction projects in the United States inched up marginally in February from the previous month, after a flat January. Does this mean that though the economy is improving, it is failing to provide an impetus toward spending on the construction of highways, schools, hospitals or homes?Incidentally, U.S. stocks suffered heavy losses on Monday, following new Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods and the growing difficulties among the domestic technology companies. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1.9%, and the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq sank 2.2% and 2.7%, each. The volatility mainly stemmed from investors’ fear related to the impact of an intensifying trade war between the United States and China. Per Bloomberg, the S&P 500’s fall of 2.2% is the widest decline to begin April 2018 since 1929.Drab February Construction Spending  In February 2018, construction spending improved 0.1%, falling shy of market expectations. The figure came in at $1.27 trillion (seasonally adjusted), logging an annual growth rate of 3% but depicting month-over-month increase of just 0.1%, as revealed by the Commerce Department on Monday. The solid labor market along with robust consumer confidence has supported an increase in non-residential (lodging and office) construction. However, spending on highways suffered a decline.Spending on public construction projects tumbled 2.1% last month, marking the widest decline since June 2017 and almost reversing January’s 2.3% rise. Under the public construction umbrella, educational construction was measured at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $74.6 billion, 0.5% down from the prior month. Highway construction was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $88.5 billion, 0.2% down on a monthly basis and 5.1% year over year.Meanwhile, private outlays grew 0.7% in February, with spending up 0.1% for residential projects and 1.5% for non-residential projects. Of the total private outlay, residential construction inched up 0.1% from January. On the other hand, the non-residential construction for February was up 1.5%, suggesting stronger growth in real investment in non-residential structures in Q1.Again, private spending on health care facilities dropped 2.2% in February from the preceding month. Spending on the power grid rose 0.9% on a monthly basis but dropped 8.5% year over year. On the positive note, spending on manufacturing jumped 1.2% last month after months of annual declines. However, it plunged 5.6% from February 2017.Homebuilding Remains StrongAlthough public sector outlay took a downturn in February, residential construction was up 0.1% and especially new single-family construction grew 0.9% on a monthly basis. Compared to February 2017, new single-family construction increased 9.5%.Apart from concerns over chances of a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, homebuilders continue to struggle with growing labor shortage, limited land availability, higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment. These are restricting homebuilders from responding to growing demand.The implications of the metal tariffs and mortgage hike are yet to be felt in the sector that has been in the top 25% (4 out of 16 sectors) of the Zacks Industry Rank since last week, which hints at further growth. Currently, top-performing construction stocks, i.e. stocks sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which are cashing in on positive fundamentals include Boise Cascade Company (BCC  -  Free Report), Beazer Homes USA, Inc. (BZH  -  Free Report), EMCOR Group, Inc. (EME  -  Free Report), Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report), Kb Home (KBH  -  Free Report), Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LPX  -  Free Report) and Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. (WMS  -  Free Report).

Evidently, the employment index slipped to 57.3 in March from 59.7 in February. The new orders index also slid to 61.9 in the month from 64.2 in February, while the production index dipped to 61 from 62.Prices paid rose 3.9 points to 78.1, the highest since April 2011. The survey pointed out rising commodity prices across industry sectors, particularly in metals, corrugates, and parts made from plastics. Electronics manufacturers are also suffering from component shortages.Before becoming bearish, investors should note that 17 out of the total 18 industries, including fabricated metal products, computer and electronic products, machinery and chemical products, witnessed growth last month. Apparel, leather and allied products was the only industry that suffered a decline.Notably, though the figures in March suffered a decline, any reading above 50 indicates growth in the manufacturing sector. Although domestic manufacturers still remained strong in March, several executives have raised concerns about bottlenecks getting supplies or transporting their goods to customers, according to the latest survey by ISM. They are also worried of the recent tariffs on steel and Chinese goods whose long-term implications still remain uncertain.Despite the skepticism stemming from the impact of tariff and the subsequent trade war, executives showed faith on global demand that can spur growth.Atlanta Fed Raises Q1 GDP Growth ForecastMeanwhile following the latest release of construction spending data by the U.S. Census Bureau and the manufacturing ISM report, the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow forecast model expects the economy to grow at a 2.8% annualized rate in the first quarter compared with the Mar 29 prediction of 2.4%.The upbeat outlook mainly reflects improved forecasts for real consumer spending and private fixed-investment growth that increased to 1.6% and 5.6% from 1.3% and 3.9%, respectively.What’s Ahead?Although shortage of components and labor have started to create production and shipping delays, the growth forecast and pricing pressure suggest that demand for U.S. manufactured goods remains strong. However, concerns remain regarding the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. administration on steel and aluminum along with aerospace, information and communication and machinery imported from China. These tariffs could deal a blow to business confidence both domestically and abroad. Nevertheless, the tax reform and fiscal stimulus are expected to boost the economy.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

93,FLR,"On Mar 21, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell commenced his stewardship of the central bank by raising the benchmark lending rate by a quarter point post the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) latest policy meeting. Further, the central bank has raised the economic outlook for 2018 and provided robust estimates of several key economic metrics.Powell stated that the U.S. economy is in the best of health compared with the last 10 years. A set of stimulative policies led by the massive tax cuts in December 2017, a healthy labor market operating near full employment, firmness in overseas growth and accommodative financial conditions have improved consumers income and confidence. Consequently, the blooming economic picture persuaded the central bank to raise the benchmark lending rate.A strong U.S. economy supported by a robust labor market, low inflationary expectations and anticipation of sustained earnings momentum are likely to uplift investors’ confidence significantly. Considering these positives, momentum stocks with favourable Zacks Rank are lucrative investment options.Fed Raises GDP EstimatesThe Fed also raised its forecast for 2018 GDP growth from 2.5% in December 2017 to 2.7%. Likewise 2019 GDP estimate has been hiked from 2.1% in December 2017 to 2.4%. Economic growth is likely to cool down in 2020 at 2% while the longer-run measures will remain stable at 1.8%.Trump administration’s decision to cut tax rate from 35% to 21% has been a shot in the arm for the U.S. economy. The new tax bill’s method of dealing with capital expenditure (companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from the taxable income immediately) is likely to result in additional investments bolstering productivity. Consequently, economic growth will remain strong for a long period.Healthy Labor MarketThe U.S. jobless rate currently stands at a 17-year low of 4.1%. On Mar 12, the U.S. Labor Department Data revealed that the economy added 313,000 jobs in February 2018, exceeding the consensus estimate of 208,000. Moreover, the total labor force increased by 806,000 and is now pegged slightly below 162 million. This is the highest since September 2003. (Read More: Asia Stocks Gain on Upbeat U.S. Jobs Data: 5 Top Picks)Fed’s latest projection for the labor market has added a little extra sweetness to the economic scenario. The central bank has reduced its 2018 unemployment rate estimate to 3.8% from 3.9% in December 2017. Unemployment rate is likely to remain stable at 3.6% in 2019 and 2020 better than the central bank’s December projection of 3.9% and 4%, respectively. This indicates that the U.S. labor market will maintain near full employment levels over 2018-2020.High Inflationary Expectation OverblownEstimates of inflation remain mostly unchanged by the Fed. This indicates that recent hyper-sensitiveness over inflationary expectation is overblown. PCE inflation and core PCE inflation for 2018 are both projected at 1.9%, at par with December’s projection. This figure is lower than the central bank’s longer-run estimate of 2%. Fed’s projected PCE inflation rates for 2019 and 2020 currently stands at 2% and 2.1%, respectively compared with 2% for both the years estimate during December 2017.Our Top PicksThe Fed has raised 2018 U.S. GDP growth estimate from 2.5% in December 2017 to 2.7%. Solid macro-economic fundamentals, government’s tax reform and deregulation proposals along with sustained strong earnings performance are major tailwinds for the U.S. economy. Such factors are unlikely to disappear in the near term.At this stage, investment in stocks with strong earnings momentum will lucrative.

95,FLR,"The length of the current U.S. economic expansion cycle is nearing a record, which makes it tricky for investors to choose stocks for their portfolio. Ideally, we need companies that will perform well even when the economic cycle takes a turn for the worse. For instance, companies that are less dependent on discretionary spending will fare better when the economy treads downward.Also, companies with lower debt burdens will be more resistant to recessionary shocks. Recently, a fair bit of volatility has been witnessed in the market. This, coupled with hawkishness on the part of the Federal Reserve, indicate that the best course of action for investors right now is to play safe. For a portfolio, market anxiety can easily be balanced by investing in a less volatile industry.So which industry can guarantee stability during a recession?Screening Industries for SafetyLet’s get the obvious out of the way. In a recession, retailers rarely have the benefit of a floor on sales. Industries that deal in consumer staples witness lower margins as customers cut corners and shift habits.Focusing on infrastructure companies, their growth is likely to be hampered as new projects are delayed in a recessionary environment. However, infrastructure must be maintained, which grants such companies a steady, stable revenue base. Infrastructure companies have long-term master agreements with utilities to maintain and service pipelines, electrical grids or telecom equipment.The replacement of outdated and risky infrastructure is as essential. Doubtless these companies benefit from economic expansion. But this revenue base makes them a good choice in bad times too.Likewise, renewable energy calls for the improvement of existing electrical grids and construction of new power sources. Transmission and distribution spending are reaching new highs and are set to sustain the trend in the upcoming days. Innovative technologies like fracking require new infrastructure in under-developed regions, which gives another boost to infrastructure companies.Stocks that FitThere is one American company that stands out as a leading provider of infrastructure solutions — Quanta Services Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report). Other companies in the same space include Fluor Corp. (FLR  -  Free Report), Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report), KBR, Inc. (KBR  -  Free Report), and AECOM (ACM  -  Free Report). While all these companies provide exposure to the industry we discussed, it will be prudent to assess these companies comparatively as well.Assessing Stocks Under Different MetricsIn terms of earnings history, Quanta Services beat estimates just twice in the trailing four quarters, while Jacobs Engineering managed to generate four healthy beats with an average of 11.4%. Fluor has generated three strong beats in the trailing four quarters with an average of 8.4%.Quanta Services’ forward PE multiple stands at 13.4 right now, lower than the industry’s PE of 17.8. Jacobs Engineering is undervalued as well, with its PE of 15.  Fluor is priced almost at par with the industry, as its PE multiple currently stands at 17.7.In the past year, Quanta Services’ shares have lost 6.4%, which indicates that the company is trading at a discount right now relative to its growth prospects.

96,FLR,"In the past three months, shares of Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) have appreciated 14.6% against the industry’s decline of 11.1%.The company has managed to impress investors with its recent earnings streak, beating estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters. We believe Fluor’s dominant position in nuclear remediation at government facilities, with its market diversity and strong focus on streamlining business structure might continue to be growth drivers, going ahead.Given this backdrop, let’s delve deeper to find out the key factors that make this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company an attractive proposition for investors right now. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Factors at PlayFluor is an industry leader in nuclear remediation at government facilities throughout the United States. The company is likely to benefit from the rising demand for energy across the world. Notably, with global electricity demand on a steady rise, nuclear energy seems to be emerging as one of the best alternatives to the world’s dependence on a finite oil supply and subsequent environmental degradation.Moreover, the company’s strategy of maintaining a good business portfolio mix enables it to focus on more stable business markets and capitalize on developing the cyclical markets at suitable times.Meanwhile, the company remains optimistic about its end markets, including mining. This is because the leading indicators for future capital spending like industrial production and capacity utilization are improving in several industries, which signal higher capital spending, moving ahead. Fluor also anticipates an increase in front-end engineering awards, which should boost future growth. Fluor’s investment projects are encouraging, particularly on LNG projects in North America, including the LNG Canada project for Shell, chemical facilities as well as pipeline projects in the United States. Further, commercial markets, comprising life sciences and infrastructure, are likely to improve going forward. This, in turn, might secure multiple awards for these industries over the next several quarters.Furthermore, the company maintains a strong focus on enhancing its competitive position in the market through prudent leadership initiatives and strategic alliances. In this regard, Fluor has undertaken a restructuring initiative under its construction and fabrication operations to improve control and delivery of projects. This apart, the company plans to implement data analytics to projects that will help it in minimizing risks and maximizing returns. These initiatives are expected to give Fluor a distinct competitive advantage.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering from the same spaceinclude Potlatch Corporation (PCH  -  Free Report), Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LPX  -  Free Report) and Rayonier Inc.

97,FLR,"Investors are always on the lookout for companies that consistently yield good returns over a considerable time frame. Currently, the Construction space is one of the sectors that is enjoying multiple growth drivers. Per the U.S. Census Bureau’s data for January, the sector experienced positive year-over-year growth in terms of spending.Moreover, recovery in the housing market has led to an increase in property and other forms of real estate tax collections in recent quarters. This, in turn, is expected to allow a number of public agencies to boost spending, ultimately boosting construction activities further. Comprehensive tax cuts, pro-growth regulatory environment and sustained increases in defense spending are other major catalysts that bode well for this space.Given this backdrop, let’s focus on the comparative analysis on some key metrics of two companies in the Engineering - R&D Services industry falling under the broader Construction space — Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report) and AECOM (ACM  -  Free Report). At present, Quanta Services has a market capitalization of $5.55 billion, while that of AECOM stands at $5.79 billion.ValuationAECOM’s stock is presently trading at a forward P/E multiple of 12.2, while Quanta Services is trading at a multiple of 20.1. Relative to the industry’s PE multiple of 15, we see that Quanta Services is richly valued while AECOM is trading at a discount.Past One-Month Share Price PerformanceIn the past month, Quanta Services’ stock has gained 5.4%, compared with AECOM’s return of 4.3%.However, both companies trumped the industry’s modest increase of 0.3%. Zacks Rank While both Quanta Services and AECOM carrya Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), the industry is ranked #101 out of the 265 industries in Zacks coverage.Favorable infrastructure spending as well as strong US job demand has been driving the performance of the engineering, procurement and construction services providers from the Construction space. Notably, the Engineering - R&D Services industry currently falls within the top 38% of the 265 different industries tracked by Zacks. Thus, any positive industry developments should benefit both companies.Earnings TrendAs far as earnings history is concerned, Quanta Services has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the trailingfour quarters, with an average negative surprise of 1.4%. AECOM has delivered positive earnings surprises thrice in the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 17.4%. So in terms of earnings trends, AECOM clearly comes out as the better play.Estimate RevisionsFor 2018, Quanta Services witnessed four upward estimate revisions versus two downward in the last 60 days. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate moved north from $2.47 to $2.63, depicting bullish analyst sentiment surrounding the stock. AECOM’s consensus mark for 2018 also climbed from $2.66 to $2.69 on three upward estimate revisions versus none downward, reflecting bullish analyst outlook.Other Key FactorsQuanta Services is enjoying strong prospects in its electric power segment, fuelled by the need to maintain and replace aging infrastructure, generation mix shifting to more renewable and natural gas, grid modernization and regulation aimed at improving grid reliability. Also, the company’s oil and gas segment outlook looks promising, courtesy of the improving mainline and natural gas distribution, and integrity markets.Moving ahead, the company is expected to benefit from healthy levels of base load work, including supporting midstream infrastructure, downstream support services and natural gas distribution. However, Quanta Services' operations remain vulnerable to unpredictable weather, the timing of projects and customer budget releases.In the meantime, AECOM is witnessing robust prospects in all of its segments. Its Construction Services and Management Services businesses continue to benefit from higher margin work in the building construction and power businesses. This apart, the company’s solid backlog levels, which are a key indicator of future revenue growth, indicate significant opportunities in the forthcoming quarters.Bottom LineEven though Quanta Services and AECOM carry the same rank, the latter enjoys a lead in terms estimate revisions, valuation and earnings trend.Key PicksInvestors interested in the same sector may consider also Fluor Corp. (FLR  -  Free Report) and Owens Corning Inc (OC  -  Free Report). While Fluor sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Owens Corning carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

98,FLR,"Premium engineering and construction firm Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 20.Last quarter, the company reported an earnings beat of 15.5%. Fluor beat estimates thrice and missed once over the trailing four quarters, for an average positive surprise of 6.3%Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayFluor’s market diversity remains a key strength that helps it mitigate the cyclicality of markets in which it operates. The company’s strategy of maintaining a good business portfolio mix enables it to focus on the more stable business markets as well as capitalize on developing the cyclical markets at suitable times. The engineering and construction space is enjoying a good momentum right now, with the best net backlog and earnings growth in years. This bodes well for the company’s performance.The company is poised to grow on the back of its strong track record of receiving awards, which is anticipated to prove conducive to bottom-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter as well. During the quarter under review, Fluor won an engineering, procurement and construction management (EPC) contract by Vopak Terminal Durban to deliver the Vopak Growth 4 Project in Durban, South Africa.Further, it won a contract with Ontario Power Generation for the procurement and construction of refurbishment work at the Darlington nuclear generating station. Also, its joint venture was chosen by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority as the design-build team for the $2-billion Green Line Light Rail Extension in Boston.These awards are expected to boost Fluor’s top line in the quarter to be reported.Fluor Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Fluor Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fluor Corporation QuoteMoreover, the company’s continued focus on cost controls enables it to deliver the performance requirements specified by its clients as well as their budgetary needs. Fluor’s current focus on transforming its EPC model into one integrated solution is likely to expand the company’s scope of work on a project, improve client satisfaction and provide an opportunity to generate greater returns, which will likely boost profits.Despite these positives, the fact remains that the widespread macroeconomic challenges have severely restricted the company’s performance for the past several quarters. Sluggish backlog conversion problem has been a persistent crisis in this sector, mainly attributable to uncertain macroeconomic conditions. These conditions are likely to impede growth to some extent.Also, we expect the company's margins to suffer, as it transitions from higher-margin engineering to lower-margin construction activities. Volatility in commodity prices and cyclical nature of the company’s commodity-based business lines pose significant challenges for Fluor in the upcoming quarters.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Fluor is likely to beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at 63 cents.

102,FLR,"Fluor Corporation's (FLR  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings came in at 67 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents by 15.5%. The figures also reflected a massive increase from the prior-year quarter’s earnings of a meager 3 cents. Top-line expansion and improved margins drove the bottom-line growth.Inside the HeadlinesThe company’s third-quarter revenues came in at $4,941.6 million, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,793 million by 3.1% and moving up 3.7% year over year. Three of the company's segments recorded revenue growth, which was somewhat offset by decline in the Diversified Services segment.Growth was primarily driven by the Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment, led by the mining and metals business line as we start to execute on recent awards.Revenues from the Energy, Chemicals and Mining segment rose 3.8% year over year to $2,412.8 million backed by increased project execution activities for certain downstream, and mining and metal projects.Industrial, Infrastructure and Powersegment's revenues inched up 0.9% year over year to $1,138.8 million. Sales at this segment largely benefited from increased project execution activities for several life sciences and advanced manufacturing projects, which was offset to a large extent by lower levels of project execution for certain power and infrastructure projects.Revenues at the Government segment were up 12.4% year over year to $766 million, on the back of higher project execution activities for several large multi-year decommissioning and cleanup projects.Diversified Services revenues were down 1.3% to $624 million on a year-over-year basis. Revenue growth from the equipment business in North America was more than offset by declines resulting from the completion of certain large Stork projects in Australia.For the reported quarter, Fluor's new awards plummeted 45.6% to $3.8 billion on a year-over-year basis. Orders at the Industrial, Infrastructure and Power segment were $628 million, while orders in the government business came in at $234 million.Orders at the Energy, Chemicals and Mining segment totaled $2,623 million, including a copper project in Chile, and several petrochemical projects in Malaysia, the Philippines and the United States. Orders at the Diversified Services segment grossed $338 million, including new contracts to provide operation support services in Colombia, and asset integrity services in the North Sea.Consolidated backlog at the end of the third quarter was $32.9 billion, down from $44.3 billion recorded in the year-ago quarter. The backlog erosion is attributable to exclusion of two large reimbursable nuclear projects.Fluor Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Fluor Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fluor Corporation QuoteLiquidity & Shares RepurchasesAs of Sep 30, 2017, Fluor had cash and marketable securities (including non-current) of $2,135.7 million, up from $2,105 million as on Dec 31, 2016. Long-term debt at the end of third-quarter 2017 rose to $1,581 million from $1,517.9 million as of Dec 31, 2016.2017 Guidance Concurrent with the third-quarter results, the company tightened its 2017 guidance and now projects earnings per share in the range of $1.50-$1.60 compared with the previous range of $1.40-$1.70.Our TakeAfter a downbeat second quarter, Fluor seems to have turned around with decent top- and bottom-line beats. However, low capital spending, intermediate softness in key end markets and continuous erosion in the backlog levels are also pressing issues for the company.Going forward, we expect the company's margins to suffer, as it transitions from higher-margin engineering to lower-margin construction activities. Slow backlog conversion is a persistent problem in this sector. Hence, slow burn on some projects is likely to hinder this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company's growth.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader construction sector include NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) and KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report). While NVR sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Toll Brothers and KB Home carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

103,FLR,"A few industrial companies are gearing up to report quarterly numbers later this week. The Q3 earnings season is in full swing, with about 272 S&P 500 companies having already reported results, reconfirming broad-based expectations of impressive earnings (as on Oct 27).Earnings of these companies (accounting for 64.2% of the index’s total market capitalization) are up 8.7% on 6.7% higher revenues. Of these companies, 75.7% have surpassed earnings estimates, with 66.2% coming ahead of revenue estimates.As per the latest Earnings Preview, dated Oct 27, data projects that total earnings for the S&P 500 companies are now on track to be up an impressive 5.4% from the year-ago period, on 5.5% higher revenues.The Industrial Products space (which accounts for about 2% of the S&P 500 index’s total market capitalization) is anticipated to chart the highest earnings growth rate this quarter amongst all Zacks sectors. In fact, its earnings are on track to be up 18% in the quarter, on 4.2% higher sales compared with last year.The Industrial Products stocks have performed well in the past six months, with the sector gaining roughly 10.4%, outperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 7.6%. We believe growth-conducive policies of the government and expectations of higher infrastructure spending drove the shares’ performance.Further, there are economic indicators which point toward a strong operating environment for the industry. Industrial production — which measures the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors — grew at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter, led by robust growth in mining and utilities. Other tailwinds are the strengthening housing, automotive and commercial construction markets, as well as steady growth in new job additions. These indicators bode well for the industry.Let’s have a look at how some industrial companies are positioned, ahead of their scheduled announcements this week:Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) offers engineering, procurement, construction and maintenance services through a number of subsidiaries. The company also provides its operations and maintenance services to major industrial clients. It has a decent earnings surprise history, having beaten estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 9.9%. In the last reported quarter, the company surpassed estimates by 22%.Fluor is unlikely to beat expectations this quarter. Though the company has a positive Earnings ESP, its Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) makes surprise prediction difficult. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 58 cents. (For more details, read: Fluor to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)For a possible earnings beat, the company should have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold). It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.

104,FLR,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in FLR.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen six estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $2.39 a share a month ago to its current level of $1.48.Also, for the current quarter, Fluor Corporation has seen four downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 59 cents a share from 67 cents over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 16.4% in the past month.Fluor Corporation Price and Consensus Fluor Corporation Price and Consensus | Fluor Corporation QuoteSo it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Engineering - R and D Services industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Fenner PLC .

105,FLR,"The year 2017 continues to be a drab one for Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report), which has been grappling with a host of issues for a couple of years now. During the second quarter of 2017, the multinational engineering and construction firm, which has been witnessing precipitous decline in sales, slashed its 2017 guidance for the second time in a row.Over the past six months, Fluor’s shares have lost 31.9%, steeper than the industry’s average decline of 16.2%. Also, the company’s earnings estimates have moved south in the past couple of months, which indicates bearish analyst sentiment for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2017 earnings went from $2.40 to $1.48 over the past 60 days, on the back of six downward estimate revisions versus none upward.Given its array of problems, we believe Flour’s investors are in for a bumpier ride. Let’s take a deeper look at the headwinds, which has significantly thwarted the company’s growth drive.Factors Weighing DownFluor has been facing a dearth of engineering and new awards which has hurt its growth prospects significantly. Currently, the company’s margins are under pressure as it is transitioning from higher margin engineering to lower margin construction activities, particularly related to Energy & Chemicals and Mining segment. This migration is a result of the natural maturing of EPC projects as well as the low level of new awards over the past several quarters.This is also the most prominent reason which causes year-over-year variance in results. In addition, slow burn on a couple of key projects and absence of new awards at a reasonable pace are making matters worse for the company. Fluor has been witnessing continious backlog erosion over the past few quarters. At the end of the second quarter of 2017, consolidated backlog stood at $37.6 billion, down from $47.3 billion in the year-ago quarter.Fluor has been facing a host of issues in its major projects in the Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment, which has proven to be a drag on its top line. For instance, cost of three of its gas-fired projects has not met original baseline assumptions due to improper estimating. Fluor is currently assessing whether the opportunities for return in the power market are consistent with its expectations.Furthermore, the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company faces intense competition in the global engineering, procurement and construction industry, which can pressurize its contract prices and profit margins. In addition, the increasing competition, coupled with the inclination toward globalization, has triggered a trend of consolidation across all industries especially in the engineering and construction sector.We believe prolonged softness in end markets, absence of any significant awards and executional challenges will keep the stock from making a comeback anytime soon.Key PicksSome stocks in the broader sector include KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), TopBuild Corp. (BLD  -  Free Report) and EMCOR Group (EME  -  Free Report). While KB Home and TopBuild sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), EMCOR Group holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).KB Home has an average positive earnings surprise of 12.5% for the past four quarters, having beaten estimates all through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.TopBuild has a positive average earnings surprise of 10.4% for the last four quarters, having beaten estimates each time.EMCOR has a decent earnings beat history, having surpassed estimates thrice over the trailing four quarters.

106,FLR,"Fluor Corporation’s (FLR  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings (excluding non-recurring costs) came in at 72 cents per share, crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents by 22.0%.However, on a reported basis, the company’s loss came in at 17 cents a share, in stark contrast to the earnings per share of 72 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter. An after-tax charge of $124 million, related to estimated cost increases on three gas-fired power projects, pushed the bottom line into the red. Also, a drab revenue performance added to Fluor’s woes.Inside the HeadlinesSecond-quarter revenues came in at $4,716.1 million, falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,935 million by 4.4% and edging down 2.9% year over year. Two of the company’s four segments recorded revenue growth, which was more than offset by the decline recorded by the other two segments.Revenues from the Energy, Chemicals and Mining segment declined 7.0% year over year to $2,304.0 million on account of reduced activity on Gulf Coast chemicals projects.Industrial, Infrastructure and Power segment’s revenues inched up 1.6% year over year to $1,026.5 million. Sales at this segment largely benefited from increased project execution activities for several life sciences, advanced manufacturing and two nuclear projects for Westinghouse.Revenues at the Government segment were up 13.1% year over year to $744.2 million, on the back of higher project execution activities for the Idaho Cleanup Project Core Contract (“Idaho Core Project”) and construction services projects.Diversified Services revenues were down 9.9% to $641.4 million on a year-over-year basis. Completion of large Stork projects in Australia and delays in the seasonal upturn in European markets weighed down on the top-line performance of this segment.For the reported quarter, Fluor’s new awards were down 50.3% to $3.2 billion on a year-over-year basis. Orders at the Industrial, Infrastructure and Power segment were $672 million, including the Southern Gateway highway project in Texas. The orders in the government business came in at $1,109 million, including task orders for LOGCAP IV in Afghanistan, additional funding for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the Idaho Cleanup Project Core Contract.Orders at the Energy, Chemicals and Mining segment totaled $860 million. Orders at the Diversified Services segment grossed $554 million.Consolidated backlog at the end of the quarter was $37.6 billion, down from $47.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. The backlog erosion is attributable to adjustment for a liquefied natural gas project in Canada, cancellation of a nuclear power plant project for Westinghouse and adjustment made to limit the contractual term of the Magnox nuclear decommissioning project.Fluor Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Fluor Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fluor Corporation QuoteLiquidity & Shares RepurchasesAs of Jun 30, 2017, Fluor had cash and marketable securities (including non-current) of $2,144.9 million, up from $2,105.0 million as on Dec 31, 2016. Long-term debt at the end of second-quarter 2017 rose to $1,560.5 million from $1,517.9 million as on Dec 31, 2016.2017 Guidance CutConcurrent with the second-quarter 2017 results, the company slashed its 2017 guidance for the second time in a row. The company currently projects earnings per share in the range of $1.40–$1.70 compared with the previous range of $2.25–$2.75.The downward guidance revision is mainly attributable to charges incurred in the Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment and the winding down of the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station project. In addition, slowdown of the pace of new awards and a waning revenue trajectory adds to the company’s grim sentiment. This apart, volatility in commodity prices is likely to play spoilsport.Our TakeFluor’s second-quarter results mainly took a beating on account of the pre-tax project expenses. Despite the company’s second-quarter earnings beat, precipitous decline in sales and two back-to-back guidance cuts signals tough times ahead. An unimpressive revenue trajectory is a major risk for the company. Relatively fewer award opportunities in industrial and infrastructure pose a threat to the company’s growth prospects. Also, low capital spending, intermediate softness in key end markets and continuous erosion in the backlog levels are also pressing issues for the company. Going forward, we expect the company’s margins to suffer, as it transitions from higher-margin engineering to lower-margin construction activities. Slow backlog conversion is a persistent problem in this sector. Hence, slow burn on some projects is likely to hinder this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s growth.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks in the broader sector include KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), NCI Building Systems, Inc. (NCS  -  Free Report) and EMCOR Group (EME  -  Free Report). While KB Home and NCI Building Systems sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), EMCOR Group holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).KB Home has an average positive earnings surprise of 12.5% for the past four quarters, having beaten estimates all through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NCI Building has an average earnings surprise of 11.3% for the last four quarters, beating estimates thrice.EMCOR has a decent earnings beat history, having surpassed estimates thrice over the trailing four quarters. The company has an average positive surprise of 11.7% over the same time frame.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

107,FLR,"Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Aug 3.In the last reported quarter, Fluor missed estimates by 14.9%. Overall, the company has a choppy earnings surprise history. It has an average positive surprise of 0.06% over the trailing four quarters, with two beats for as many misses.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderOver the past six months, relative stability in oil prices have led to increased activity and bidding prospects for Fluor. For instance, within the Energy & Chemicals & Mining segment, relative stability in commodity prices looks promising. Especially, contracts for FEED and pre-FEED work for gold, bauxite and copper projects are expected to raise the top line for the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Project execution after a period of sustained market weakness is expected to benefit Energy & Chemicals segments results through the remainder of 2017. Moreover, buyout of Dutch engineering and construction company – Stork Holding B.V. – has significantly boosted the company’s inorganic growth. We believe Global Services unit’s top line rise will be supplemented by this acquisition.This apart, Fluor’s proven business model and overarching “One Fluor” initiative are likely to boost second-quarter margin expression. Moreover, the company’s cash-rich balance sheet, restructuring initiatives and industry-leading franchise within the U.S. are other major strengths. A host of restructuring initiatives has helped Fluor to improve control and delivery of projects. Cost savings associated with such efforts is likely to boost second-quarter financials.Despite these positives, dearth of large engineering and new awards, which has hurt Fluor’s growth prospects for quite some time now, is likely to remain an overhang. We expect the company’s margins to suffer during the second quarter, as it transitions from higher-margin engineering to lower-margin construction activities. Slow backlog conversion problem is a persistent problem in this sector. Hence, slow burn on a couple of projects is also adding to the company’s concerns.Additionally, currency fluctuation is likely to play a major spoilsport the upcoming results. During first-quarter 2017, the company witnessed significant foreign exchange expense due to strengthening of the Mexican Peso. This trend is likely to continue for the soon-to-be-reported quarter. This apart, significant cost overruns and stringent competition are likely to make matters worse for Fluor.Fluor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Fluor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Fluor Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Fluor is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Fluor has an Earnings ESP of +1.70%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 60 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Fluor carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lowers the predictive power of ESP. We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.JELD-WEN Holding, Inc. (JELD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +7.69% and a Zacks Rank #2.CACI International Inc (CACI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.83% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Arrow Electronics, Inc. (ARW  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.13% and a Zacks Rank #2.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.
