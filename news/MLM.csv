5,MLM,"Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) stock rose Tuesday after the building supplies giant outperformed earnings expectations, lifting other stocks in the sector.X The sand, granite, limestone, and gravel merchant reported earnings per share of $1.88, up 21% vs. a year earlier. That crushed Wall Street estimates by 46 cents according to Zacks Investment Research. Martin Marietta Materials sales rose 2.5% vs. a year earlier to $911 million, but that failed to meet expectations for $913 million.The fourth-quarter results included a one-time, noncash benefit of $258.1 million related to the Trump administration's tax reform.Martin Marietta rose 2.6% to 218.35 on the stock market today, near session lows after hitting 229.66 intraday. The stock did close above its 200-day moving average but ended just below its 50-day after vaulting above that key level. The stock has a composite rating of 55, however its EPS rating of 84 is more impressive. The firm is ranked third in the Building-Cement, Concrete And Aggregates Group, which is led by Loma Negra (LOMA).Martin Marietta's performance was hit by delays in Texas Department of Transportation projects and a slow down in railroad ballast shipments. In addition abnormally wet weather conditions, the Hurricane Matthew and a slower energy-related marketplace.IBD'S TAKE: By learning to use call options, investors can significantly reduce risk and capitalize on basing stocks that are making breakaway gains caused by earnings reports.However the firm, which has a $14 billion market cap, has improved cost management and operational efficiency.For 2018 it expects full-year revenue of $4.16 billion to $4.36 billion, above Wall Street forecasts for $4.078 billion.Ward Nye, chairman and CEO of Martin Marietta, was bullish.""Our ability to post record results despite these external factors, among them extraordinary weather events, contractor labor constraints, and a slower-than-expected pace of public contract lettings, validates the successful execution of our strategic plan and underpins our optimism for a steady and extended cyclical recovery as we begin 2018,"" Nye said. ""Our confidence in our 2018 outlook is particularly strengthened by positive fourth-quarter trends.""The Building-Cement, Concrete And Aggregates Group is ranked 143 out of all the 197 groups monitored by IBD.The Trump administration this week proposed for a huge jump in infrastructure spending, though it's unclear if Congress will approve the planVulcan Materials (VMC) rose 1.7% and U.S. Concrete (USCR) 1.8%.Loma Negra climbed 0.6%.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Trump Seeks Mulligan On Fiscal Restraint, Starting With Infrastructure Homebuilder Stocks To Watch And Housing Market NewsEarnings Calendar, Analyst Estimates And Stocks To Watch

6,MLM,"The federal deficit is getting so unwieldy that not even fake math can make it disappear.The White House's budget proposal released Monday projects a $984 billion deficit in 2019 under President Trump's preferred policies, nearly double its $526 billion projection a year ago. For the full 10-year budget window, cumulative deficits are now seen totaling $7.1 trillion, well more than double last year's projection that magically ended in a budget surplus by 2027.Even those upwardly revised totals may be too optimistic. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget last week said that the new budget deal will raise the 2019 deficit to $1.2 trillion. Assuming that individual tax cuts don't phase out and programmatic spending stays on the same trajectory, that would put the U.S. on track to run up deficits of roughly $15 trillion over the coming decade.""The country is facing a massive fiscal challenge, and the President's budget doesn't own up to these realities and fails to call for a suite of credible policies that would help change course. The budget has too many gimmicks, exaggerated savings, and rosy assumptions,"" Maya MacGuineas, president of the committee, said in a written statement. ""Most troubling, it doesn't make the credible hard choices necessary to help bring the debt back to more manageable levels.""She did say, however, that ""the budget does include a number of thoughtful and serious policies to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Medicare program — along with a number of other smart policies to reduce government spending. We encourage the administration to pursue these ideas.""Yet Wall Street may find some good news in President Trump's budget proposal, as traders now are worried about too much fiscal stimulus and trillion-dollar deficits: Trump's big infrastructure funding plan looks like a nonstarter for Democrats and is likely a bridge to nowhere.""This is not a real infrastructure plan — it's simply another scam, an attempt by this administration to privatize critical government functions, and create windfalls for their buddies on Wall Street,"" Rep. Peter DeFazio, the top Democrat on the House Transportation Committee, said Sunday in the Democratic weekly address.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite rallied for a second day on Monday, with the major indexes all up at least 1.2% at midday.The emergence of better wage growth and the explosion of the federal deficit, even as the Federal Reserve gradually reverses government bond purchases made to aid recovery from the financial crisis, had sent the 10-year Treasury yield to a four-year high in a wake-up call for stock market investors.The White House budget calls for a $1.5 trillion boost to infrastructure spending, but only $200 billion of that would come from the federal government, with state and local governments and private investors ponying up the rest in a competition to secure federal grants. What makes it an especially hard sell for Democrats is that the $200 billion federal contribution would come from cost savings in the rest of the budget, including the Department of Transportation spending plan.After last week's budget deal that will hike deficits by $320 billion over two years, and after passing tax cuts that are expected to add more than $1 trillion to the deficit over a decade, the White House is signaling that it's drawing a line on further fiscal laxity — just in time for the infrastructure debate. The new budget plan calls for $3 trillion in savings, including discretionary domestic program cuts of 2% a year after 2019.IBD'S TAKE: Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The political calculation for Democrats is whether they're better off settling for less than half a loaf and giving the White House a victory, or campaigning on a much bigger building plan and blaming the GOP for prioritizing corporate tax cuts over infrastructure. There's little doubt that the more combative approach will win out in this critical election year.The White House said it isn't making a take-it-or-leave-it offer, so it's possible Trump will try to make a deal Democrats can't refuse, but it's not clear if the rest of the GOP would be willing to further increase the deficit.Investors seem to have reined in expectations for Trump's infrastructure push. Shares of big cement maker Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), which reports earnings on Tuesday morning, were off 0.8% on the stock market today.After missing out on 2017's big stock market gains, Martin and Vulcan Materials (VMC) both cleared buy points as the stock market was peaking in late January, but both stocks sunk back below their 200-day moving averages and are basically back where they were in the week Trump was elected. IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates industry group is ranked a lowly 144 out of 197 industry groups based on stock-price performance and momentum.Still, shares of Vulcan rose 1.35% on Monday, while Summit Materials (SUM) gained 1% and Eagle Materials (EXP) 1.2%.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why The Stock Market Sold Off, And What You Should Do NowThis Shock Economic Outlook May Keep Stock Market On EdgeHow Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

7,MLM,"President Trump will bask in the glow of a strong economy, record stock market and the coming boost to take-home pay from tax cuts, as he delivers his State of the Union address Tuesday night.X But what investors really want to hear about are the agenda items that could kick the economy into still-higher gear, undercut its momentum or alter the fortunes of various industry groups. Steel tariffs, infrastructure funding, dealmaking over immigration to avoid a government shutdown, and the future of Nafta all could feature in Tuesday's speech.Ahead of the speech — in which Trump could announce whether he'll impose new restrictions on steel imports — steel stocks were among the better-performing groups on the stock market today, though most of the early gains faded. Steel Dynamics (STLD) rose 0.1%, U.S. Steel (X) 0.5% and AK Steel (AKS) 0.7%, while the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite traded modestly lower.The theme of Trump's speech is a ""safe, strong and proud America,"" so it wouldn't be surprising for him to preach a hard line on trade disputes. The real question is whether he'll announce new trade measures, double-down on his threat to walk away from Nafta, or whether he'll be satisfied to tout his recent actions slapping tariffs on solar cells and big washing machines.The Commerce Department on Jan. 11 announced that it has completed its national security investigation into the impact of steel mill product imports, giving President Trump 90 days to decide whether to impose any remedies. CNBC reported last week that Commerce recommended a wide range of options to deal with aluminum and steel dumping in the U.S., including potentially higher tariffs.Yet Monday's stock gains may have been fueled by an announcement from AK Steel that it was hiking current spot-market base prices for all carbon flat-rolled steel products by a minimum of $30 per ton — its second announced price hike this year.""Domestic steel inventory levels have moderated,"" Steel Dynamics CEO Mark Millett said last week in an earnings statement. ""World steel demand and pricing have structurally improved and domestic steel demand remains healthy.""IBD'S TAKE: Martin Marietta Materials is ranked No. 4 by IBD in the Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see the leaders in each category. Cement makers have been laggards, ranked No. 135 out of 197 groups. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks in leading groups that break above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.The steel industry has tried to keep pressure on the White House to come to its aid, but given the improving fundamentals, it's not clear how far Trump will want to go in risking what could be a messy trade dispute and likely hike prices for domestic steel customers.Meanwhile, the latest round of Nafta negotiations appears to be ending on a concerning note, with Reuters reporting that the countries won't issue a joint statement about the path forward for settling their differences. Wall Street remains concerned that Trump could start a six-month clock to a unilateral withdrawal from the trading pact, but Trump may secretly be satisfied with the status quo. We'll probably have a better idea after Tuesday night.The other two big agenda items revolve around how Trump will work Democrats, both on immigration and infrastructure, since there's not much he can do with the slimmest of majorities in the Senate.On infrastructure, the White House has reportedly embraced a strategy to lure more than $1 trillion in private, state and local funding with the hook of $200 billion in federal funds. Prospects for such a deal passing Congress appear slim, though, in part because Democrats want more federal funding, and Republicans are expected to demand spending cuts to offset any new spending commitments.Yet IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates industry group is finally showing signs of life after mostly missing out on 2017's big stock market gains. Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC) both cleared buy points in the past week and remain within the 5% chase zone. Martin Marietta shares slipped 1.4% on Monday, while Vulcan Materials was off 1.7%.An unexpected boost to federal infrastructure spending would be gravy on top of lower corporate tax rates and a strengthening economy, so investors will be listening to see if Trump offers a deal Democrats can't refuse.As long as Trump doesn't pull the plug on Nafta, and it seems unlikely that he will, then the clearest risk to economy and stock market comes from the potential for a prolonged government shutdown. While Democrats backed down after a 3-day shutdown last week, the reprieve was only temporary, with government funding extended through Feb. 8.Trump's words on Tuesday about what kind of immigration changes he'll demand in exchange for preserving legal status for Dreamers, which is set to lapse starting March 5, will set the tone for the negotiation ahead, but the signals so far look ominous. Democrats denounced the White House's proposal last week to end family unification immigration, also known as chain migration, beyond spouses and children.The key unknowns are whether there are 41 Democrats who will refuse to take ""no"" for an answer when it comes to Dreamers and whether Trump will give them any deal they'll accept. The potential for politics to drag down the economy seems real — especially because the government is set to hit its borrowing limit in late March, raising the risk of a debt default.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Will The Trump Tax Cuts Make Wages, Growth Sizzle?

8,MLM,"The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite continued to rebound, despite rising inflation pressures and Treasury yields, triggering a shift from market correction to confirmed uptrend. Cisco Systems (CSCO) reported strong earnings, along with Weibo (WB) and other China internets as well as several other top-rated tech stocks. Top-rated hotels were mixed after their reports. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) hired Taco's chief to be its next CEO. Facebook (FB) showed signs of losing more young users to Snap (SNAP)-owned.X After plunging in the prior two weeks, the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite surged in the latest week, shrugging off rising prices and the continued rise in Treasury yields. The market is back in an uptrend. Cisco hit a 17-year high on a bevy of good news. Shopify (SHOP), Hubspot (HUBS) and Weibo (WB) also had good results. But Arista Networks (ANET) and LogMeIn (LOGM) fell Friday on guidance.Cisco Systems (CSCO) announced a $25 billion stock buyback, topped earnings forecasts, reported its first revenue gain in eight quarters and guided March quarter views higher. Aside from the new $25 billion buyback, Cisco plans to use some of the $67 billion in repatriated cash for a dividend hike. Cisco would have around $30 billion, including domestic cash on hand, for acquisitions. Cisco shares rose to a 17-year high.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersArista Networks handily beat Q4 earnings views with a 64% jump but revenue only edged estimates and its sales outlook for the March quarter and 2018 disappointed. Shares dived 19% Friday after a 200% run-up the past year. Management forecast a sequential revenue decline in the March quarter, with the mid-point of revenue guidance implying 37% growth to $459 million, just above estimates of $457 million. Analysts said Arista set the expectation for ""mid-20s"" revenue growth in 2018 which is below the Street's 27.5%. The guidance could reflect stiffer competition from Cisco.Shopify (SHOP) earned 15 cents a share in Q4, up from no profit a year earlier, vs. estimates of 5 cents. Revenue jumped 71% to $222.8 million, topping consensus estimates of $208 million. The e-commerce software firm forecast Q1 and 2018 revenue above expectations. Shares edged up Thursday after surging to a record high ahead of earnings. Shopify surged 15% through Thursday.RELATED:New America: Shopify Is Killing It By Making Businesses Win OnlineFacebook (FB) is losing younger users to Snap (SNAP)-owned Snapchat at an even faster pace than previously expected, said research firm eMarketer. It said Facebook is still adding monthly users overall, but older age groups are mainly responsible for the increase. Facebook will lose 2 million users under 25 in the U.S. this year while Snapchat will add 1.9 million, eMarketer predicts. Facebook's Instagram will still add teens and young adults.Shares of China internet companies Weibo (WB) and parent Sina (SINA) both reported fourth-quarter results that largely topped estimates. Weibo is a social media company that has a Twitter (TWTR)-like platform, while Sina offers a popular internet portal. Internet search leader Baidu (BIDU) also jumped on a fourth-quarter report that topped views, thanks to upside from online video and news feed advertising.RELATED:These Top China Names Are Trying To Form BasesDiamondback Energy (FANG) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) reported Q4 results above Wall Street estimates and plan to boost production this year as the International Energy Agency said U.S. crude output will overtake Saudi Arabia ""soon"" and ""catch up to Russia by the end of the year."" The Energy Information Administration said domestic oil production edged up to 10.27 million barrels per day from 10.25 million the prior week. OPEC sees global demand growth increasing by 60,000 bpd to 1.59 million, but expects U.S. production growth to outpace demand growth. Saudi Arabia called for production cuts by OPEC and Russia to continue through 2018. That, along with a stock market revival and a weak dollar, helped lift crude by 4.2% to $61.68 a barrel.The consumer price index and core CPI rose more than expected, pushing the 10-year Treasury above 2.9%, hitting fresh four-year highs. But core inflation is still just 1.8%. Markets priced in greater certainty of three Federal Reserve rate hikes in 2018, but still only about a 25% chance of a fourth hike. Meanwhile, January retail sales fell 0.3%, leading economists to mark down expectations for first-quarter GDP growth.Bitcoin continued on its upward trajectory, moving just above $10,000 afterfter briefly undercutting the $6,000 mark in the prior week. Meanwhile, Litecoin vaulted  as anticipation builds for the launch of payment processor LitePay and an upcoming fork of its blockchain. Meanwhile IBM (IBM) warned Congress about overregulating digital currencies in case it has ""unintended consequences"" on blockchain technology.LogMeIn (LOGM) reported adjusted Q4 earnings that beat estimates while pro forma revenue topped views. For 2018, LogMeIn forecast profit of $5.48 a share, well above estimates of $4.90 a share but its March quarter and full-year revenue outlooks were a bit light. LogMeIn sold Xively, its Internet of Things business for web-connected devices, to Google for $50 million. LogMeIn completed a reverse merger with the GoToMeeting business of Citrix (CTXS) on Feb. 1, 2017. Shares, which had broken out earlier in the week, fell 8.5% on Friday, undercutting its buy point.Chipotle Mexican Grill said Brian Niccol, CEO of Taco Bell, would become the fast-casual chain's chief executive in March. Shares sprinted higher on hopes Niccol — known for helping bring hits like Nacho Fries and Doritos Locos Tacos to Taco Bell's menu — might revive Chipotle's sales and traffic following food-safety issues.Meanwhile, Restaurant Brands International (QSR) said Burger King turned out strong Q4 sales, and the company more than doubled its dividend. Shake Shack (SHAK) said that by 2020, it planned to more than double its store count from last year's levels, while Q4 results beat views. But Shake Shack tumbled Friday on its guidance.Wyndham Worldwide (WYN), Marriott International (MAR), Hilton (HLT) and Hyatt (H) all reported quarterly results that topped expectations.HubSpot (HUBS) swung to a fourth-quarter profit as revenue jumped 39% to $106.5 million.. The Web marketing softward firm gave March quarter and full-year guidance above estimates. CFO John Kinzer will leave at the end of 2018.

The cloud-based business communications software maker forecast 2018 adjusted earnings well above expectations. RingCentral leapt 21%.General Dynamics (GD) will buy defense IT contractor CSRA (CSRA) for $6.8 billion plus $2.8 billion in assumed debt as the military contractor looks to increase its IT services for the Defense Department in the wake of increased defense spending.SolarEdge (SEDG) shares vaulted 43% after reporting fourth-quarter earnings that beat and guided materially above the consensus estimate, while SunPower shares fell on disappointing earnings with a first-quarter revenue outlook below expectations.NetApp (NTAP) beat quarterly earnings that beat views but gave commentary that implied a reduction in gross margins. NetApp fell 5% Thursday and 2% Friday, but closed the week up a fraction.Shares in cybersecurity firms Qualys (QLYS) and Mimecast (MIME) climbed on better-than-expected earnings. Qualys forecast March quarter profit above views. The company is investing in product marketing and sales capacity. Mimecast, an email security specialist, upped fiscal 2018 revenue guidance. CyberArk (CYBR) topped Q4 revenue and EPS views as it closed larger deals. CyberArk forecast in-line March quarter sales but EPS below estimates.Chip-gear maker Applied Materials (AMAT) delivered better-than-expected fiscal first quarter sales and earnings, guided estimates higher for the current quarter, doubled its quarterly dividend and announced a new $6 billion share repurchase plan.

9,MLM,"U.S. stock indexes retreated midday Tuesday, despite optimism in a small business gauge and strength in the concrete group.X The Dow Jones industrial average stepped down 0.4%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.2%. The Nasdaq dipped less than 0.1%, but the small-cap Russell 2000 faded 0.2%.Volume fell on both major exchanges in the stock market today compared with the same time Monday.The optimism gauge of the National Federation of Independent Business rose to 106.9 in January, topping the consensus view for 105.5.

11,MLM,"Stocks punched higher at Monday's open, launching a spirited rebound from what was the Dow's worst week in eight years.X The Dow Jones industrial average opened up 1.1%, with the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 ahead 0.9% each.The market last week slipped into a technical correction, down more than 10% from recent highs, as the Dow booked its worst weekly loss since February 2009. The S&P 500's drop was its largest since May 2010.  The last time the Nasdaq took this large a loss was at the end of January 2016.On global markets, China's markets were mixed as they prepared to head into their weeklong Lunar New Year holiday later this week. The Shanghai Composite jumped 0.8%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slipped 0.2%. In Japan, the Tokyo Stock Exchange was closed for a national holiday.In Europe, stocks hammered out considerable gains in afternoon trade. Frankfurt's DAX led with a 1.4% advance.A quiet day of economic news and a slow start to the week's earnings calendar leaves Monday's unveiling of President Trump's infrastructure in sharp focus. Trump has previously said he aims to leverage $200 billion in federal funds into a $1.5 trillion building program.Infrastructure stocks likely to move on the news could include a wide array of construction names and materials suppliers. Among the most pure-play infrastructure stocks are the big engineering names such as Jacobs Engineering (JEC), Mastec (MTZ) and Quanta Services (PWR), as well as aggregates suppliers including Martin Marietta (MLM), Vulcan (VMC) and Summit Materials (SUM).Oil and commodities could also factor into Monday's trade. Crude posted an early rebound, as U.S. benchmark oil jumped 1.2% to trade just below the $60 per barrel mark. Silver and copper both rose more than 1% in early action.IBD'S TAKE: A correcting market is not a time to buy growth stocks, but it is the perfect time to build a watch list of leading stocks, near buy points in valid bases. The market will eventually post a follow-through day and launch a fresh uptrend. When it does, you want to have your shopping list of well-vetted stocks ready to go.Nearly all 30 Dow components rose at the start of trade. Cisco Systems (CSCO) led, up 3%. The company received a price target increase to 46, from 33, and an upgrade to buy from neutral, from Instinet. RBC Capital raised the stock's price target to 44, from 40.American Express (AXP) advanced 1.7% after an upgrade to buy, from neutral, by Nomura.Earnings news stirred some action early Monday, as payment solutions provider First Data (FDC) bolted 4.7% higher after its fourth-quarter earnings met analysts' views, and revenue was slightly higher than expected. The stock took an 8% loss last week and broke support, killing a three-month basing effort.Restaurant Brands International (QSR) popped 6.9% following mixed fourth-quarter results. The owner of the Burger King and Tim Horton's chains as well as Popeye's, the company's smallest chain, reported a surprise 11% gain in revenue, and the company announced a $742 million deferred tax benefit.China-based Vipshop Holdings (VIPS) jumped 2.9% before the open, and ahead of its fourth-quarter report which is due after the close. The online retail leader has pulled back 13% from its Jan. 26 high, leaving its Relative Strength line a notch off its high.Other China-based names were also positive, with Weibo (WB), TAL Education (TAL) and Sina (SINA) all posted early gains near 2%. Sina and Weibo report earnings this week.Apple (AAPL) pounded out a 1.4% advance and Netflix (NFLX) led the FANG stock tech leaders with a 2.3% gain.Computer tech services contractor CSRA (CSRA) spiked 31% after General Dynamics (GD) agreed to buy the Falls Church, Va., company in a $6.8 billion deal.  The deal allows General Dynamics to better tap a pending surge in federal upgrade of IT security and cloud-computing operations. General Dynamics was down 1%, and just below a 211.85 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.21st Century Fox (FOX) climbed 2.9% following news reports that Comcast (CMCSA) was contemplating a refreshed bid for the company's film and television assets. Fox accepted a $52.4 billion takeover bid from Walt Disney (DIS) in December, after rejecting Comcast's offer of more than $60 billion, on grounds that regulators would block the combination. Comcast shares rose 1.1%.Disney shares rose 1.5% after the company announced it was raising the admission price to its Disney World and Disneyland theme parks. Theme park revenues provided the bulwark gains that led to the company's fourth-quarter earning beat. Disney shares ended Friday down 9% below their Jan. 3 high, but still in a valid cup-with-handle base.Oracle (ORCL) climbed more than 1%, after announcing plans for 12 new massive data centers in a move to better compete with Amazon.com, Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) in the cloud-computing market.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Don't Panic, It's Just A Correction: Here's What You Do NowThese 5 Defense Stocks Stand Out In Market CorrectionThe Big Picture: S&P 500 Leads Rebound; Now Watch For This SignalThese 4 Dow Stocks Reclaimed Key Support In Tough MarketThis Shock Economic Outlook May Keep Stock Market On Edge

12,MLM,"Stock fought to a positive finish on Wednesday, as health care and construction stocks booked some of the day's widest losses, while video-game stocks notched a bevy of breakouts.X The Dow Jones industrial average led, ending up 0.3%, boosted by Boeing's (BA) monster 5% advance, on the heels of its glowing Q4 results. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1%, while the S&P 500 struggled to a fractional gain.Markets dropped sharply after the Fed's 2 p.m. ET announcement. The committee held its target interest rate unchanged, but offered a slightly more wary tone on inflation. The day's other economic news was positive, with early data from ADP showing January hiring slipped less than expected, while December pending home sales and a Chicago-region manufacturing for January gauge easily topped expectations.The Dow was held back some by medical components Merck (MRK), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Pfizer (PFE), which all dropped more than 2%. Drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY) tumbled 5%, following a generally positive fourth-quarter report. But drug sector investors were apparently still reacting to Tuesday's news of an innovative health care partnership between Amazon.com (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan (JPM).Amazon advanced 1.5%, putting it 20% past its 1213.10 buy point and in a profit-taking zone. The other three FANG stock tech leaders lost ground. Netflix (NFLX) fell furthest, down nearly 3%, but still extended after its early January breakout.Tesla (TSLA) rose 2.5% in average trade, for its third gain in four sessions. Shares are now up more than 20% from their November low and back above support at their 10- and 40-week moving averages, climbing the right side of a possible four-month base pattern.The video game trade was among the day's winners, with Ninetendo (NTDOY), Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) and Electronic Arts (EA) all clearing buy points or adding to entries. Ninetendo trimmed gains in afternoon trade, but remained just beyond buy range above a cup-base buy point at 54.06. Electronic Arts pared its advance and held in its buy range, after topping a 122.89 buy point, also from a cup base.Take-Two chalked up a 7% surge to end at the very top of a buy range above a 120.72 cup base buy point.Concrete and aggregates suppliers took the session's worst performance among industries, with U.S. Concrete (USCR) tumbling more than 6%, Eagle Materials (EXP) down 5% and Martin Marietta (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC) falling 3% apiece. Eagle materials posted a mixed fourth quarter report before the open, but the reaction could also have been linked to public-private infrastructure cost-sharing questions raised in President Trump's State Of The Union address.Among IBD 50 names, telecom software developer Casa Systems (CASA) gained more than 6% in soft trade. The stock is attempting to start the right side of its first base, ending about 10% below its Jan. 16 high and 46% above its December IPO price.Argentina-based bank Grupo Servielle (SUPV), also an IBD 50 name, jumped almost 5% in nearly average trade. The move technically placed the stock in a buy range on a rebound from support at its 10-week moving average. But volume would need to kick in over the next day or so in order to confirm the buying opportunity.At the bottom of the IBD 50 list, MiMedx Group (MDXG) and Daqo New Energy (DQ) each shed about 5%.Other Important Market News For Wednesday:Bring Your Game As Apple, Amazon, Alphabet Report: Action PlanBiggest U.S. Homebuilder Hits Resistance, Despite 40% Earnings GainHow To Sell: Don't Freeze If Double-Digit Gain In A Stock Shrinks FastLooking For Breakout Stocks Like Nvidia?

13,MLM,"With the celebration over his tax-cut victory still in full swing, President Trump tweeted last week that his big infrastructure plans are coming up next on the agenda. Yet the chances of passing any major building program look slim, at best, now that the Trump tax cuts have tapped a key potential source of infrastructure funding and arguably maxed out the federal government's borrowing commitments.X To seal their $1.5 trillion tax-cut victory, Republicans had to take a $339 billion bite out of the overseas cash holdings of Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and other U.S. multinationals.The final version of the tax legislation imposed a 15.5% tax on cash held overseas by those tech titans and other companies to avoid being taxed at the current 35% corporate rate, along with an 8% tax on illiquid assets such as real estate. Apple has $252 billion parked overseas, while Microsoft holds $128 billion and Alphabet $52 billion.The move, which taxed away $150 billion more from multinationals' foreign cash stashes than an initial Senate plan released one month earlier, took away the prime source of funds eyed by a bipartisan group of lawmakers and considered by President Trump to fund a national infrastructure investment plan in the U.S.One sign that Wall Street may have low expectations for Trump's infrastructure push is that IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates group ranks a lowly 171 of 197 industry groups by IBD based on stock performance trends. Shares of the group's heavyweights, Vulcan Materials (VMC) and Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), haven't made any headway since the week of Trump's election. Several midsize players, Eagle Materials (EXP), Summit Materials (SUM) and U.S. Concrete (USCR) fared better in 2017.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.The tax legislation, which is expected to mark a generational turning point in fiscal policy as the federal government heads for a $1 trillion annual budget deficit by 2019, already has congressional Republicans talking about shifting their focus to cutting spending.That leaves little room for compromise with Democrats, who have pushed for far bigger increases in infrastructure spending than the GOP is prepared to consider and who are sure to fight any spending curbs as the byproduct of tax cuts. Expect a replay of the aftermath of President George W. Bush's tax cuts, when Democrats refused to consider any spending cuts unless upper-income tax cuts were repealed.At a time when the Federal Reserve is gradually reversing its financial-crisis era asset purchases by letting maturing mortgage and Treasury holdings run off the balance sheet, a burgeoning federal deficit could begin to put upward pressure on Treasury yields.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget figures that the tax cuts could end up increasing federal deficits by $2 trillion or more over a decade, assuming that individual tax cuts don't sunset after 2025. The Congressional Budget Office said earlier in 2017 that legislation boosting deficits by $2 trillion would contribute to a near doubling of debt as a share of the economy over 20 years, from 77% in 2017 to 150% by 2047.If there's a wild card for the economic outlook in 2018, it's fiscal policy. If a government shutdown can be avoided, then fiscal policy could provide an added boost to growth, thanks to emergency spending on rebuilding from the damaging hurricanes that hit at the end of last summer.Nomura Chief U.S. Economist Lewis Alexander expects tax and fiscal policy to boost 2018 GDP by a half percentage point to 2.7%, but he sees potential for upside, if Republicans agree to Democratic demands to match an increase in military spending with additional outlays for domestic programs.Yet there's also a risk that Democrats will lay out demands that Republicans refuse to meet, including an extension of President Obama's program that deferred deportation and provided work authorization for so-called Dreamers. While a prolonged government shutdown might not provide a major hit to growth, it would create uncertainty about the path of tax and spending policy ahead, dampening the enthusiasm created by the tax cuts.RELATED:Congress OKs Trump Tax Cuts; These Companies Are Celebrating The Most6 Big Rule Changes For Individuals In The New Tax BillHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For Beginners

17,MLM,"CRH's (CRH) $3.5 billion deal to buy privately held Ash Grove Cement may be giving a boost Thursday to some moderate-size players that might benefit from further consolidation in the building materials industry.XNews of the CRH deal, which represents a big expansion of the Ireland-based company's U.S. capacity, sent shares 2.7% higher on the stock market today. Summit Materials (SUM) rose 2.1% to a new high, while U.S. Concrete (USCR) gained 1.1%.On Wednesday, shares of Eagle Materials (EXP) cleared a cup-with-handle base, cresting a buy point of 104.28, which is often a precursor of further near-term gains. Eagle Materials shares rose 0.2% to 105.29 on Thursday, staying in a buy zone.IBD'S TAKE: CRH is ranked No. 3 by IBD in the Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates industry group, based on earnings, sales and margin trends, as well as stock performance. Check out the pacesetters at IBD Stock Checkup. The industry group is ranked just 126 of 197 based on price performance, getting a ""fail"" grade from IBD. Breakout stock candidates are more likely to be successful if their industry group ranks among the top 40.But bigger industry players didn't rally from the news of consolidation, with shares of Vulcan Materials (VMC) and Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) off 1% and 1.2%, respectively.The Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates group initially surged after the November election, partly due to expectations that President Trump would push for a $1 trillion infrastructure program. But the group has mostly lagged since then, with Summit being among the exceptions. Prospects for a big infrastructure bill remain uncertain.While Trump has been making deals with Democrats recently, potentially a positive sign for cooperation on infrastructure, efforts at ObamaCare repeal and tax reform are likely to keep infrastructure on the back burner for a while.RELATED:Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

18,MLM,"Stocks lodged gains Wednesday, as buyers maintained control while markets struggled to value in the effects of rising storm damage in Texas and Louisiana.XThe Nasdaq Composite easily led, soaring 1.1% in above-average trade. Preliminary data showed volume weaker on the NYSE, with the S&P 500 cranking out a 0.5% gain and the Dow Jones industrial average limping to a narrowly positive finish, up 0.1%.Oil and gas drillers and airlines were two of the day's hardest hit industries.Exxon Mobil (XOM) announced it had shut down its 362,000 barrel per day refinery in Beaumont, Texas, following the shutdown Monday of its 560,000 barrels-per-day facility in Baytown. All told, 22% of U.S. refining capacity is now offline, according to estimates from S&P Global Platt's. As a result, gasoline futures rocketed 6% higher Wednesday, putting prices ahead more than 13% for the week. Oil dropped 1%, to below $46 a barrel, down 4% for the week.Houston's two airports and its port, the second busiest shipping hub in the country, remain closed until further notice. The country's busiest port, the Port of South Louisiana, was still reporting status normal as Harvey settled over Louisiana and North Texas.Concrete stocks posted the largest gains among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, as shipping lanes backed up outside Houston interrupted the normally steady supply of cement being imported into the U.S., suggesting at least brief shortages and price spikes due to the storm. U.S. Concrete (USCR) spiked 11%, narrowly clearing an 80.55 buy point in a flat base. Eagle Materials (EXP) and Martin Marietta (MLM) rose 6% each.Trucking stocks also bolted higher as retailers and industries scrambled to reroute supplies of consumer goods and raw materials stalled outside of Houston.  ArcBest (ARCB) surged 6% and broke out above a cup-with-handle buy point of  28.18. Landstar (LSTR) throttled up 5%, topping a 90.55 buy point in a flat base.Property and casualty insurers continued to take a beating. Traveler's Insurance (TRV) took the hardest hit among Dow names, down more than 1%. Non-Dow stock Progressive (PGR) dropped 2%.Cisco Systems (CSCO) topped the Dow with a 1.8% gain. That lifted shares almost 6% above their mid-August low and back above their 10-week moving average. The stock is attempting to start up the right side of a three-month consolidation.Among stocks reporting earnings, drone maker Aerovironment (AVAV) lofted an 18% advance. Its fiscal first quarter report late Tuesday neatly dispatched analysts targets. The surge left the thinly traded shares extended above a 40.20 buy point in a seven week flat base.Chipmaker Analog Devices (ADI) rattled off a 5% gain after a 54% EPS gain and a 65% rise in revenue handily beat expectations.  The gain moved shares up the right side of a 13-week basing effort.Other chipmakers basked in the afterglow: ON Semiconductor (ON) jumped 5%, Qorvo (QRVO) and Silicon Motion (SIMO) each nailed 4% gains.On the downside of the day's earnings news, H&R Block (HRB) tanked 8%, killing a month-long basing effort.

That good news was followed up by more good news from ADP that showed private payroll growth of 237,000 in August, well above the consensus estimate of 185,000. The market on Friday is looking for nonfarm payrolls to increase by 180,000, a little below July's increase of 209,000.Concrete, cement and aggregates makers made some of the biggest moves. U.S. Concrete (USCR), Martin Marietta (MLM) and Eagle Materials (EXP) soared anywhere from 7% to 10%.Big movers in the stock market today  included AeroVironment (AVAV). The aerospace company trades on the thin side, with an average daily dollar volume of around $14 million, but the stock broke out powerfully from a flat base, surging 18% to 46.55 on strong earnings. When a stock gaps up more than 5% past a buy point, it's OK to buy as close to the open price as possible. The open price here was 42.77.Gilead Sciences (GILD) soared another 5%, helped by news that Novartis (NVS) received FDA approval for Kymirah, a cell-based gene therapy known as a CAR-T drug.Shares of Gilead are up nearly 8% so far this week after the company announced plans to acquire biotech Kite Pharma for $11.9 billion. Kite is also closing in on approval of a CAR-T therapy, in which immune cells are extracted from a patient and reprogrammed to fight cancer.Shares of Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) were down early but pared losses as Wall Street reacted to its earnings report. Shares eased 0.5% after dropping 4% intraday.Analog Devices (ADI) gapped up and rose 3% after the chipmaker reported its fifth straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. Wednesday's gap above the 50-day line is a positive, but the stock is still 9% off its high after a failed breakout over an 84.34 buy point.After the close, watch for earnings from Workday (WDAY), a provider of workforce management software that's been showing big sales growth in recent quarters. In fiscal 2017, the company turned in its first annual profit, with growth expected to ramp up in fiscal 2018-19.

21,MLM,"Hurricane Harvey recovery hopes triggered a huge move by IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates group, which surged 5.4%, Wednesday's best-performing industry by far.XWet weather helped sink second-quarter results for Vulcan Materials (VMC) and Martin Marietta (MLM), so the initial concern about Harvey may have been business delays hurting third-quarter results. But the devastation has been so severe that materials makers' longer-term outlook looks sure to be more demand and higher prices.On Wednesday, shares of Vulcan surged 4.6% on the stock market today. Martin Marietta leapt 5.4%, Eagle Materials (EXP) 6.6%. Summit Materials (SUM) 5.4%, clearing its 50-day line in volume, making it buyable.The biggest winner was U.S. Concrete (USCR), based in Euless, Texas, which vaulted 9.9% to 81.40. U.S. Concrete cleared a buy point at 80.55, but remained within the 5% range before a stock is extended and riskier to buy.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important for maximizing your chance of profiting from a stock. Here's a good place to start looking for leading stocks that may be primed for breakouts.Texas is huge for these companies. Eagle is based in Dallas. Citi analyst Scott Schrier noted in a Tuesday note that the Texas market makes up roughly 35% of business for Martin Marietta, 25% for Summit and 17% for Vulcan.It's far from clear just how much extra business Hurricane Harvey will create, but on site reports suggest the damage is extensive. On Tuesday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said that the Texas Department of Transportation received $25 million in federal funds to start rehabilitating the state's transportation network.""The historic flooding has downed traffic lights, damaged roadway signs and caused highway asphalt to buckle or, worse, be swept away in some areas,"" the governor's office said.RELATED:Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

24,MLM,"Here's one of the biggest problems with President Trump taking credit for the Dow Jones industrial average's rise close to 22,000, as he did on Tuesday.X""Stock Market could hit all-time high (again) 22,000 today. Was 18,000 only 6 months ago on Election Day. Mainstream media seldom mentions!"" Trump tweeted.While there's no question that Trump has presided over a great period for the stock market, many of the so-called Trump stocks that were supposed to thrive on his watch have been laggards, such as Vulcan Materials (VMC), U.S. Steel (X) and Goldman Sachs (GS).At the same time, what might be called non-Trump stocks, have done pretty nicely. If there was any group for which Trump's election looked like a setback, it was the solar power industry. Yet IBD's Energy-Solar industry group ranks No. 1 among 197 industry groups based on stock performance. Since Trump announced his plan to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, stocks like First Solar (FSLR) and SunPower (SPWR) have been surging. (SunPower crashed 19% Wednesday on weak revenue guidance. First Solar, which reported strong results last week, dipped 2% but held onto most of its recent gains.)IBD'S TAKE: The No. 1 ranked insurer in IBD's Medical-Managed Care group isn't Dow stalwart UnitedHealth Group, which exited most ObamaCare markets early in 2017, but an insurer whose prospects are closely tied to the fate of the Affordable Care Act. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see which insurer is setting the pace, based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance.The latest Trump stock to divee was Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), a supplier of concrete, asphalt and other building materials that stood to benefit from Trump's trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. On Tuesday, Martin Marietta came up 10 cents shy of earnings estimates and shares tumbled 6.4%, closing below where they finished on Nov. 9.Vulcan Materials, the nation's largest supplier of construction aggregates, fell 3.2% on Tuesday to close below its Election Day, Nov. 8 level. Vulcan Materials did rebound 3.3% on the stock market today despite reporting its own weak earnings.Infrastructure plans have been on the back burner while Trump prioritized the seemingly failed effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare.The steel sector was supposed to soar on Trump steel tariffs that looked like a sure bet, but no longer look so certain after pushback from foreign trading partners. Trump told the Wall Street Journal last week that action to curtail steel imports may wait until after tax reform and infrastructure. U.S. Steel briefly surged on positive earnings news last week, but was quickly undercut by the disappointment over tariffs. U.S. Steel and Nucor (NUE) both closed lower on Tuesday than they did on Nov. 9.Bank stocks were supposed to be another triple-threat group under Trump, poised to gain from regulatory relief, tax cuts and rising interest rates prompted in part by Trump's big fiscal plans. Here the record is somewhat better. Regulators did sign off on bigger capital return plans for big banks that passed their stress tests. But Wall Street has been scaling back expectations for corporate-tax cuts and the Federal Reserve has tabled its rate-hiking plans as inflation pressures fail to materialize. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) shares surged in the weeks after Trump's election, but they've been Dow laggards since the start of 2017, with Goldman down 5% and JPMorgan up 8%, compared to the Dow's 11% gain and the Nasdaq's 18%.Many banks have reported weak trading revenue in early 2017, but Goldman reported a stunning 40% plunge in fixed income, commodity and currency trading revenue in the second quarter.While bank stocks have been mostly range-bound in recent months, Morgan Stanley (MS) has cleared a buy point and Bank of America (BAC) is near a buy zone above 25.21. But even those two bank leaders have slightly lagged the general market over the past four months.The expectations were that Trump would fuel growth and the Fed would be more proactive about raising interest rates, but with doubts creeping higher about the scope and timing of any fiscal fuel, some economists have marked down their growth expectations. The International Monetary Fund said last week that it now expects GDP growth of 2.1% this year and next, down from prior forecasts of 2.3% growth this year and 2.5% in 2018.RELATED:The Fed Just Gave A Green Light To Wall StreetSolar Stocks Shine As South Miami Passes Groundbreaking LawWhy There's No Trump Bump For Infrastructure StocksCheck Out These 4 Energy Plays Near Buy Zones

25,MLM,"Apple (AAPL) earnings helped lift the Dow Jones industrial average above 22,000 but didn't help the Nasdaq composite or S&P 500 index. Tesla (TSLA) topped forecasts while General Motors (GM) and other U.S. automakers reported weak domestic sales. Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) crashed as it and other fiber-optic plays had weak guidance or results. The U.S. economy continued to grow and hire at a moderate pace.The major market averages continued to split. The Dow Jones industrial average continued to rack up small gains, climbing 1.2% and topping 22,000 for the first time. The S&P 500 edged up 0.2% while the Nasdaq composite fell 0.4%. Apple, Tesla had well-received June quarter results, while many stocks had big double-digit percentage gains or losses. Optical stocks were losers on Applied Optoelectronics and others.Consumer electronics giant Apple beat Wall Street's sales and earnings targets in the June quarter and guided higher for the September quarter, easing concerns about a late iPhone 8 launch. Earnings rose 18% while sales climbed 7% to $45.4 billion. Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Qorvo (QRVO) also topped estimates, implying healthy business from Apple. Apple advanced 4.6%, but closed below a buy point after clearing it on Wednesday. Apple chipmakers struggled.RELATED:This Is Why Apple Is Bullish On Q4 Sales (It's Not The iPhone 8)Tesla (TSLA) reported a smaller-than-expected adjusted loss, while second-quarter revenue more than doubled from the year-ago quarter to reaching $2.79 billion. Tesla received several price-target hikes following its quarterly earnings report that beat views, though analysts expressed concern about the electric car company's ability to execute on its ambitious production schedule for the new Model 3. Analysts also are concerned about Tesla's cash burn. But the stock rose 6.55%, clearing its 50-day moving average.Here's What Analysts Like And Don't Like About Tesla EarningsBefore Ordering A Tesla Model 3 Or Chevy Bolt, Look At This ChartApplied Optoelectronics sees weak revenue for the current quarter, shocker given that the optical stock had raised or beaten guidance several times this year. It cited some slower demand from a large customer, which could be Amazon. Applied Opto, the No. 1 stock in the No. 1-rated Telecom-Fiber Optics group, crashed 34% Friday. Acacia Communications (ACIA) and Infinera (INFN) also had bad news late Thursday. Earlier in the week, Macom Technology Solutions Holdings (MTSI), an optical-related chipmaker, sees weak China demand. However, Oclaro (OCLR) reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter profit and revenue and sees strong demand in the current fiscal year. But Oclaro shares still plunged for the week.RELATED:Applied Optoelectronics Plunges On Weak Guidance; Opticals HitJuly was a rout for U.S. auto sales, marking the biggest monthly decline since August 2010. General Motors (GM) saw sales plunge 15% vs. the expected 9% to 11%. Ford Motor (F) sales declined nearly 8% vs. an expected 5% to 6%. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) sales declined 11% vs. an expected 7%. Industrywide U.S. auto sales rang in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 16.77 million in July, Autodata reported, marking the third straight month below 17 million. The auto giants pointed to planned fleet sales cutbacks, but their retail sales also retreated. Toyota (TM) saw U.S. sales unexpectedly rise, while Japanese peers Nissan (NSANY) and Honda (HMC) had smaller-than-expected declines.RELATED:U.S. Auto Sales Tumble 7%, Worst Drop In Nearly 7 YearsThe U.S. economy added 209,000 jobs in July, slightly more than expected. The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.3% while average hourly wages rose a solid 0.3%. The report is more evidence of tighter labor markets, though it likely won't shift the Federal Reserve's policy path in the near future. Meanwhile, ISM surveys signaled still-strong manufacturing growth while some decelerating growth in the service sector.Grubhub (GRUB) and Yelp (Yelp) both topped second-quarter earnings and revenue estimates late Thursday. As part of a long-term partnership, Grubhub will pay $287.5 million in cash to acquire Yelp's online food ordering and delivery business, Eat24. The partnership comes as Amazon (AMZN) is getting more aggressive in the food delivery market. Grubhub rose 9.2% on Friday while Yelp shot up nearly 28%.Symantec (SYMC), Qualys (QYLS) and FireEye (FEYE) reported better-than-expected June-quarter results, following computer security peer Proofpoint (PFPT) last week. Symantec's adjusted fiscal first-quarter earnings rose 14% as revenue climbed 39% to $1.23 billion. Symantec agreed to sell its website security business to DigiCert for about $950 million cash. But Symantec shares fell 6%. Qualys EPS climbed 30% as revenue rose 14% to $55.3 million, sending shares 13.8% for the week. FireEye narrowed its Q2 loss to just 4 cents a share as revenue grew 6% to $185.5 million, amid strong demand for its new Helix security platform. Shares fell 6%.Video game publishers Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) reported better-than-expected June-quarter results, while mobile and online games publisher Zynga (ZNGA) delivered a mixed report. Activision climbed 4% through Thursday to fresh highs, but retreated 3.1% Friday on its mixed guidance. Take-Two spiked 9.5%, breaking out past a buy point to its own high. Zynga was little changed, in a consolidation at 3-year highs.RELATED:Activision Blizzard Beats Second-Quarter Views, Offers Mixed OutlookVideo Game Publisher Take-Two Rockets On June-Quarter BeatBoeing (BA) announced that it would get into the avionics business, to make controls and electronics for aircraft and spacecraft.

Analysts worried that would hurt suppliers like Rockwell Collins (COL) and Honeywell (HON). Boeing also announced a pricing deal with Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) on supplies for its 787 Dreamliner. Spirit has a similar deal with Airbus (EADSY) for its A350. Spirit Aero, which also announced strong earnings, soared 17.2%.The ObamaCare exchanges are still perilous for insurers' earnings health, but Medicare is a cash cow. Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM), which will both complete their exit from the individual insurance markets at year end, both sailed past earnings estimates thanks to momentum in their Medicare Advantage businesses, and their shares vaulted to record highs. Aetna earnings ballooned by 55% and Humana earnings grew 6%, both smashing views. Cigna (CI) and WellCare Health Plans (WCG) also reported strong earnings. But Molina Healthcare (MOH), which saw the exchanges as a big growth opportunity, reported a loss of $4.10 a share in Q2, largely blaming its ObamaCare exchange business. Molina will pull out of the Wisconsin and Utah markets and scale back its presence in Washington state. In its remaining markets, Molina said it will hike premiums at least 30% in 2018. Molina shares tumbled.RELATED:Aetna Trounces Expectations As Big ObamaCare Insurer CrashesVulcan Materials (VMC) and Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), huge suppliers of construction aggregates, both reported earnings below views.

43,MLM,"The only apparent news during President Trump's big infrastructure week is that the door has fully closed on the possibility of a massive bipartisan infrastructure bill, and that likely means a legislative push will slip to 2018.The Associated Press reported on Tuesday that the White House is now making clear that it plans to seek approval of infrastructure funding via budget reconciliation, requiring a simple majority in the Senate, to avoid the possibility of a Democratic filibuster. Because Senate rules limit the GOP to just one use of budget reconciliation per year — this year's is reserved for ObamaCare repeal — that means infrastructure spending and tax cuts will have to be paired together.That's not music to the ears of investors. On Tuesday, shares of construction material suppliers lagging the broader market. Vulcan Materials (VMC) slipped 0.6%, Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) 0.9%, and Eagle Materials (EXP) 1.5%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index lost 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, on the stock market today, while the Nasdaq turned slightly higher. Shares of construction equipment maker Caterpillar (CAT), a Dow component, eased 0.6% but were still close to a 30-month high, though the company is more of a play on global growth and less a proxy for U.S. infrastructure than cement makers.Trump's determination to get infrastructure done through reconciliation will tie his national building program ambitions to prospects for overhauling the nation's tax code, which look uncertain at the moment given the inability of Republican leaders to agree on how to offset the cost of tax cuts, or even if the cost should be offset. The legislative undertaking will be extremely contentious and complex, and it can't even get underway until the GOP ends its effort to repeal ObamaCare (win or lose), raises the debt ceiling and passes a budget.IBD'S TAKE: Construction stocks soared after the November election, but it wasn't only because of Donald Trump's surprise election. Voters also approved a host of big infrastructure-related ballot initiatives. Then in April, California's legislature approved a gas-tax hike to fund more than $50 billion in road fixes and highway projects. Only a couple of months ago, Trump was discussing the possibility of a gas-tax hike to fund infrastructure spending, but that idea seems unlikely to fly in a bill that will need the votes of 50 of 52 GOP senators to pass and will most likely occur during an election year. Trump also had flirted with the idea of working with Democrats after the first House ObamaCare repeal bill went down in flames in late March. That may well have been just a ruse to break down GOP obstruction, but cooperation with Democrats has seemed increasingly unlikely as the Russia investigation has heated up.After pushing a plan to privatize the nation's air traffic control system on Monday, Trump will head to Cincinnati, on the Ohio River, on Wednesday to discuss the necessity of investing in the nation's highways, bridges and inland waterways. Then he'll host mayors and governors at the White House on Thursday and attend a Friday forum on expediting regulatory approval for road and rail projects.The White House plan is to seek $200 billion in federal funding for infrastructure that it hopes to leverage into $1 trillion in building projects by attracting private capital. There certainly appears to be private capital lining up to participate, with Blackstone Group (BX) recently announcing a $40 billion infrastructure fund, part of the $100 billion it expects to invest in infrastructure in coming years.Democrats have criticized Trump's focus on public-private partnerships, which they say may draw investment to booming metropolitan areas where investors might reap profits from toll roads, but will shortchange rural areas and won't help rebuild schools.The White House has floated another idea to attract capital called ""asset recycling"" based on Australia's experience leasing a state-owned electrical grid to private investors to pay for improvements to the Sydney Metro. The idea would be to encourage state and local governments to transfer public assets such as bridges or highway rest stops to private investors to free up infrastructure funds, with the federal government providing matching funds as an incentive. The idea may have potential but reinforces the takeaway that Trump's infrastructure plans, assuming they pass, may not have much of an economic impact before 2019.RELATED:Today's Words That Could Doom Trump's Tax Cuts5 Big Ways That Trump's Budget Doesn't Add Up Markets Are 'Too Negative' On Trump Tax-Cut Odds: Goldman

45,MLM,"Steel stocks got some of their old Trump magic back for a day, as one of the best-performing groups in the month after the November election, led the market on Thursday.As Washington was transfixed by ex-FBI Director James Comey's testimony, Wall Street was fired up by word from the Trump administration that it's getting ready to tilt the balance of trade more in favor of U.S. steel producers.Investors picked beaten-down shares of AK Steel (AKS) out of the scrap heap, as it led the way with a 5.5% advance on the stock market today. Steel Dynamics (STLD) climbed 5.2%, US Steel (X) 4.7% and Nucor (NUE) 3.4%.The steel rally was sparked by the tag-team of President Trump, speaking Wednesday afternoon in Cincinnati, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, appearing before a Senate panel on Thursday. Still, investors may have felt some sense of relief that Comey's testimony wasn't more damaging.Trump, while touting his still-developing plan for a $1 trillion infrastructure boost, added that ""steel folks are going to be very happy"" with coming actions to stop the dumping of foreign steel.On Thursday, Ross said that the Trump administration is very close to wrapping up its investigation into whether imports of steel are hurting national security, which could pave the way for protectionist measures under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.There doesn't seem to be much doubt about the outcome, with Ross calling steel imports ""a genuine national security issue"" and laying out possible recommendations for stemming the flow. Ross said a combination of a tariff and quota would protect domestic steel producers while also protecting steel fabricators that are consumers of foreign steel.""The overall impact on inflation, were that to be the route, should be relatively modest,"" Ross said.Meanwhile, cement and asphalt makers, which have much to gain from Trump's infrastructure plans, finally got a boost on day four of the White House's big infrastructure week.

47,MLM,"Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings Tuesday, sending shares of the Trump infrastructure play surging.Martin Marietta earned 67 cents per share on revenue of $791.7 million. Analysts expected the Raleigh, N.C., provider of construction materials to earn 66 cents a share, down from 69 cents a year ago. Revenue was seen slipping to $724.7 million from $734.0 million. Year-earlier results were lifted by weather delays in late 2015 that lumped more activity in the first quarter of 2016.Outlook: Martin Marietta maintained the same full-year guidance it offered in February: $3.75 billion to $3.95 billion in revenue and an EBITDA range of $1.05 billion to $1.13 billion.Stock: Shares of Martin Marietta shot up 7.6% to 239.85 on the stock market today, the highest since late January and approaching a 244.08 buy point. Vulcan Materials (VMC), which reports earnings on May 10, popped 4.1% to 128.45.IBD'S TAKE: Markets may no longer be banking on President Trump's trillion-dollar national building program, at least in the near term, but infrastructure investors are excited about big state spending plans.Prior to the report, shares of Martin Marietta have climbed back above their 50-day moving average. The shares initially vaulted into a buy zone on Nov. 9, after the surprise election of Donald Trump. A follow-on breakout attempt in late January, after the inauguration, failed. The stock drifted lower after disappointing first-quarter earnings and lack of progress on Trump's big infrastructure plans.On Monday, IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates group rose 2%, sixth best among 197 industry groups. President Trump's comments that he would support a gas tax to fund infrastructure investment likely contributed to the gain. Summit Materials (SUM) hit a nearly two-year high on Monday.Monday's gains came despite news that a five-month budget deal in Congress won't include any funding for Trump's border wall, once seen as a potential boon to cement makers with facilities near the border.Martin Marietta noted that it saw ""broad-based pricing improvements"" across its aggregates product line, led by the Southeast group's 10.3% increase. The company's revenue gain was padded by acquisitions that added $27 million, with modest margin contribution. Management noted that it ramped up investment in the quarter on operations and staffing, adding that the investment should result in better operating leverage as growth continues.RELATED: Stock Futures: These 10 Big-Cap Earnings Are On Tap TuesdayHere's Why U.S. Concrete Shares Sank Like A StoneMartin Marietta 'Encouraged' By Trump Infrastructure Talk, But Earnings, Guidance Light

"
49,MLM,"X U.S. stocks looked to be set to take a well-deserved breather, posting minor losses early Tuesday following two weeks of strong gains. Yet key indexes still closed ahead as money flowed sharply into a select group of underperforming industries.The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average all staged gains of around 0.1% to 0.2%. But small caps failed to take advantage of the late-hour rebound. The small-cap S&P 600 sank 0.4%, but it was down as much as 0.7% during intraday lows. The Russell 2000 slumped almost 0.6%.Volume rose sharply on both main exchanges. Tuesday's action on the Nasdaq appeared to be stalling, but it doesn't affect the overall distribution day count for that major index. Read more on this technicality in today's Big Picture column.At 1399, the Russell 2000 is clearly lagging the S&P 500, which finished Tuesday at 2391. The former is up 3% year to date, the latter up 6.8%.At least eight industry groups, many of them dwelling at or near the bottom of IBD's 197 group and subgroup rankings, belied the flat action of the major market benchmarks with gains of 2% or more.They included the hospitals (up 3.8%), cement and concrete (up 3.2%), department stores (up 2.7%), consumer loans (up 2.2%), coal (up 2.1%), and long-term medical care (up 2.1%). Meanwhile, two more struggling groups — discount and variety retail and clothing manufacturing — saw gains of  1.6%.Is it bargain-hunting? That may help explain part of it. But quarterly results are likely another major factor.Take Coach (COH), part of the apparel makers group. The stock shot more than 11% higher to 43.03. Shares leapt past a 41.80 buy point within a long saucer-with-handle pattern. That pattern is part of a long bottoming base. The buy point is derived from adding 10 cents to the March 30 intraday high of the four-week handle, or 41.79.Early Tuesday, the maker of luxury handbags, accessories and fashion clothing reported a 5% rise in fiscal third-quarter earnings to 46 cents a share, edging the consensus view by 2 cents. Revenue slipped 4% to $995 million. Coach has been focused on store closures and developing new products to promote the exclusive character of its products. Sales in the Stuart Weitzman designer-shoe business edged up 1% and gross margin improved to 62.1%, up 390 basis points. Coach had been reportedly pursuing a potential acquisition of rival Kate Spade (KATE), but is now said to be aiming at adding the Jimmy Choo collection of luxury-category women's shoes to its brand portfolio.As seen in a weekly chart, Coach shares have been in a deep freeze ever since topping at 79.70 in March 2012. Yet since the stock has carved out a nearly 10-month saucer base that features a stingy decline of 22% from the 43.71 peak, a good sign.Also, notice how since January of this year, Coach has logged seven up weeks in above-average weekly turnover and only one down week in heavy trade.Coach's Apparel-Clothing Manufacturing industry group is ranked a lowly 146th out of 197 industry groups for six-month relative price performance. That's slightly up from 164th six weeks ago. Yet the 28-member group shows just two companies with an RS Rating of 80 or higher, and both trade below 10 a share.When a stock has emerged out of a bottoming base pattern, it's not a surprise to see a low Relative Price Strength Rating. Prior to Tuesday's big gain, Coach showed a thin RS Rating of just 30, well off its nine-week high of 60 on a scale of 1 to 99.Among the other beaten-down groups that rebounded nicely Tuesday, Community Health Systems (CYH) of the Medical-Hospital industry group surged nearly 20% to 10.32, closing above the critical 10 level for the first time since late October. The Franklin, Tenn., firm reported a 70% drop in Q1 earnings to 7 cents a share. Revenue fell 10%. However, it beat profit views by 14%, and Q2 profit is seen rebounding 56% to 14 cents a share.Due to Tuesday's big gains, Community Health saw its RS Rating catapult from 70 to 92. Watch to see if that rating continues to rise or stay high in the near term. A 92 means Community Health now bests 92% of all stocks in IBD's database over the past six months.In the cement, concrete and aggregates industry group, Martin Marietta (MLM) gapped up and powered nearly 8% higher to 239.85 in volume that jumped 152% above average. The stock is now just 1% below a recent 52-week peak of 243.98. The stock has been basing for 14 weeks and has formed a saucerlike base with a 244.08 new entry.Martin Marietta's Q1 earnings fell 3% to 67 cents a share, but that followed an 886% leap in adjusted profit in the year-ago quarter. It crushed Wall Street's consensus view of 40 cents. Revenue rose 7% to $844 million.Martin Marietta was formerly part of Leaderboard, but its Jan. 25 breakout past a 236.51 entry failed to bear fruit. Leaderboard currently shows nine long growth-stock plays and features annotations on daily and weekly charts to identify proper buy points and signals of heavy institutional buying or selling.In economic news, April U.S. car sales disappointed the Street at an annualized rate of 16.9 million units, well below the Econoday forecast of 17.2 million. Some automakers got drilled. General Motors (GM) slid 3% to 33.20, diving well below its long-term 200-day moving average. Volume shot 60% above its 50-day average. With a 40 RS Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, GM is outrunning only 40% of all publicly traded companies over the past 12 months.The car sales data followed a lower-than-expected reading on the U.S. manufacturing landscape.

57,MLM,"Stocks slid into a weak finish Friday as mixed consumer spending and income data, and an unexpected bump up in Midwest manufacturing helped confuse the end-of-quarter trade.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3%. The S&P 500 backed off 0.2% and the Nasdaq gave up its earlier gains to close flat. Small caps kept their chin up, leaving the Russell 2000 with a 0.3% gain.Volume ran lower both on the NYSE and the Nasdaq, according to preliminary data.For the month, the Nasdaq rose 1.7%, its fifth straight advance — leaving it up more than 21% over the past 12 months.

Intel (INTC) topped that group with a 0.9% gain.Cement and construction aggregates stocks posted Friday's strongest move among industries. Martin Marietta (MLM) jumped 3% after receiving an upgrade to buy, from neutral, from Cleveland Research. Citigroup had initiated coverage on Thursday on Martin Marietta and Vulcan Materials (VMC), with buy ratings on both stocks.  Vulcan rose nearly 3% Friday. The day's gains left both stocks poised for a test of resistance at their 10-week moving averages.The alternative energy group posted a strong session, helped by TPI Composites' (TPIC) 4% advance. Barclays initiated coverage on the stock with a buy ranting and a 24 price target. The thinly-traded stock is in the sixth week of a possible base pattern, trading 73% above its July IPO price.Herbicide and insecticide maker FMC (FMC) easily topped the S&P 500, spiking 13% after DuPont (DD) announced FMC would acquire DuPont's crop protection products business for $1.2 billion in cash, as well as an exchange for FMC's health and nutrition unit. The gain put shares well above a a 62.13 buy point in a cup-with-handle base, but the gap up breakout established a new buy range, starting at 69.72.The FMC sale was the first divestiture aimed at meeting regulatory requirements for the planned $77 billion merger between DuPont and Dow Chemical (DOW). The two companies today said they expect to close the deal in August. DuPont ended down 1.2% and Dow shares were off 0.5%.Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) grabbed the second hottest slot among S&P 500 stocks, up more than 4% after Macquarie launched coverage on the stock, although at a neutral rating.

58,MLM,"U.S. Concrete (USCR) is tumbling well past its key 50-day moving average following a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that announced the resignation of the company's chief financial officer.Shares plunged 8.85% to 60.80 in the stock market today, finding support near their 200-day line. The stock had been enjoying an upward, if choppy, climb in the months following the election amid optimism about potential infrastructure investments.According to the filing, CFO Joseph C. ""Jody"" Tusa, Jr. is stepping down for ""personal reasons,"" effective July 1. His role as principal accounting officer will come to a halt on April 1; he will be replaced by Kevin Kohutek.""Mr. Tusa's anticipated departure is not as a result of any disagreement with the Company,"" said the filing.The filing also said that the board's audit committee had hired Ernst & Young as its new independent registered public accounting firm and dismissed its previous firm, Grant Thornton, which took effect on Wednesday.Martin Marietta (MLM) fell 2.9%.

60,MLM,"Steel stocks rebounded Tuesday after sliding Monday with the broader market on news of falling scrap prices. The catalyst may have been news reports that the White House is considering quicker action on President Trump's trillion-dollar national infrastructure plan.While markets were higher across the board, with the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite all up modestly on the stock market today, Trump-related infrastructure stocks were outperforming.Among steel makers, Tenaris (TS) jumped 4.9%, AK Steel (AKS) rose 3.2%, Nucor (NUE) 1.2%, Steel Dynamics (STLD) 2.8% and U.S. Steel (X) 2.8%.Materials and construction equipment stocks also got a lift, with Vulcan Materials (VMC) up 1.9%, Martin Marietta (MLM) 1.4% and Caterpillar (CAT) 1.6%.The outsize gain for AK Steel, whose shares had sunk 36% from a multiyear high set in early January, came amid speculation that the slumping steel maker may be a takeover target.Last week, JPMorgan analyst Mike Gambardella raised his price targets on AK Steel, Nucor, Steel Dynamics and U.S. Steel amid expectations of stronger earnings growth and earnings preannouncements from Nucor and Steel Dynamics. His thesis: Steel-sheet imports are headed lower thanks to trade enforcement. Along with ""continued domestic producer supply discipline,"" that will help support steel prices in the U.S.But Morgan Stanley analyst Evan Kurtz said in Monday research note that East Coast steel-scrap prices had fallen $30 a ton, a negative sign for demand. IBD'S TAKE: The quick and sudden flop of RyanCare proved that President Trump knows how to cut losses. Expect him to do the same with deficit-neutral tax reform and quickly shift to old-fashioned, deficit-increasing tax cuts.M&A could be a positive for the entire sector if it reinforces supply discipline, and the Trump administration might be more amenable to steel industry mergers than the Obama administration.While prospects for Trump's infrastructure plan remain unclear, Axios reported that the White House is thinking about packaging its building program with tax cuts this year. There had been talk that infrastructure funding legislation could slip to 2018.RELATED:A Second Top Steel Maker In 2 Days Just Gave Blowout Earnings GuidanceThis Top Steel Stock Is Near A Buy Point On Huge Earnings GuidanceTrump's Big Speech Leaves Investors With Hope, Not Much Else

61,MLM,"Tense, late-stage maneuvering at the White House and the Capitol kept markets on edge straight to Friday's close, with major indexes ending mixed and the Dow Jones industrial average chalking up its worst week since the Nov. 8 presidential election.The Dow lost 0.3% Friday and 1.3% for the week. Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) took what were far-and-away the Dow's worst losses for the week, down 6.5% and 4%, respectively.Also in the Dow 30, Apple (AAPL) and McDonald's (MCD) each managed modest gains for the week and Nike (NKE), which on Wednesday dived more than 7% after a weak earnings report, on Friday trimmed its decline for the week to less than 3%.The S&P 500 sagged 0.1%, ending the week with a 1.3% loss — also its worst week since just before the election. Heavy engineering, steel and suppliers of construction materials took the S&P 500's heaviest hits on Friday. Vulcan Materials (VMC), Martin Marietta (MLM), Fluor (FLR) and Nucor (NUE) each dumped more than 2% in Friday's session. It's well-worth noting that all of those losses occurred in light trade.Micron Technology (MU) and Under Armour (UA) pegged the S&P 500's best gains.Micron spiked 7% as earnings rose to 90 cents a share, up from a penny in the year-ago quarter. Revenue soared 58%. But the industry took particular heart in Micron's Q3 outlook, which placed the midpoint of earnings guidance 61% above consensus views. Micron shares ended the week up 11% and at a new high, extended from a February rebound from 10-week support.Under Armour popped 4% following an upgrade to buy, from hold, by Jefferies. The stock suffered a 63% sell-off over the past 11 months, but the Jefferies note diagnosed the correction as having formed a bottom and, given market circumstances, ""an inflection has formed and the buying (opportunity) is now."" CAN SLIM investors can minimize risk by waiting for a proper base to form.The Nasdaq composite held its loss Friday to less than 0.1%, ending off 1.2% in its sharpest weekly slip since December. Micron topped the Nasdaq 100, with Western Digital (WDC), Tesla (TSLA), Cerner (CERN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) all advancing 2% or more.Tesla chairman Elon Musk teased investors with tweets revealing new details regarding the company's upcoming Model 3, and more distant Model Y and Roadster vehicles. Tesla shares are five weeks into a consolidation — holding nice support at the stock's 10-week moving average, but it's slightly too deep to qualify as a flat base.Among IBD 50 stocks, China's TAL Education Group (TAL) jumped 3% Friday in its eighth straight daily advance. Shares are taking out new highs and are well-extended above a three-weeks-tight buy point of 83.97.BioTelemetry (BEAT) also gained 2%, narrowing its loss for the week to less than 3%. The stock bounced off its 10-week moving average on Thursday, but week volume nullified the move as a buying opportunity.RELATED:ObamaCare Repeal Vote Failure Threatens Tax Cuts — And Stock RallyChip Gear Makers Rise On Upbeat Micron OutlookStock Market Today: Do These 6 Chip Names Have A Shot At Big Gains In 2017?

The stock found support at its 200-day line last week.IBD'S TAKE: From President Trump's tweets to administration leaks regarding specific stocks and broader economic policy, IBD is keeping track of the Trump Economy.Group peers Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC) fell fractionally. Martin Marietta and Vulcan Materials both reported weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings earlier this month.All three stocks rose on Monday, when Trump said Monday that there is ""no choice"" but to step up infrastructure spending. Trump will lay out his policy ideas before Congress tonight, He said that ObamaCare repeal will come before tax reform, so it's unclear how high a priority infrastructure will be for the administration and Congress.Steel, concrete and construction stocks sold off last week on a report that the Trump administration could delay an infrastructure bill until 2018.U.S. Steel (X) rose 1.4% to finish at 38.72, well off morning highs of 40.10, after climbing 3.2% on Monday.

One upside, GOP strategists say, is that debating the bill in the 2018 election year will make it easier to pass, as Democrats won't want to be seen opposing major projects and jobs in their districts and unions giving their support.Passing an infrastructure bill in 2018 would likely mean that spending starts in 2019, ramping up over time.

78,MLM,"Federal Reserve policymakers caught markets off-guard in December when a number of them built President Trump's planned fiscal stimulus into their hawkish forecast for three rate hikes in 2017.Fed members may have taken their cue from investors, who lit a fire under the shares of companies that stand to benefit from a big infrastructure push: equipment maker Caterpillar (CAT), cement makers Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC), and copper miner Freeport McMoRan (FCX). Meanwhile shares of Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) flew on prospects for higher rates and a steepening yield curve, as well as deregulation hopes.But after a tumultuous first week and a half of his presidency, Fed policymakers are likely done trying to predict what Trump will do and how his policies will affect the economy.

I love John Deere, too.""Trump's inaugural vow to ""buy American and hire American"" suggest Caterpillar and Deere can still count on a big role in constructing the wall.IBD'S TAKE: Martin Marietta and Vulcan aren't the only materials companies breaking out on the Trump trade. IBD's top market writers are tracking these and other Leaderboard stocks to help readers spot buying opportunities when they emerge and sell signals to lock in profits.Among the big uncertainties about the wall is whether it will really be made of concrete, as Trump has said, or if it will be a fence; whether it will cover most, all, or just a fraction of the nearly 2,000-mile border; how much funding Congress will appropriate; and whether Mexico will ultimately pay the cost.In a July analysis, Bernstein analysts wrote, ""Concrete is by far the best material to meet Trump's goal of building an imposing and effective barrier, while also offering the most cost-effective solution.""The analysts believe that Trump's wall could resemble the 420-mile Israeli West Bank barrier, large parts of which were built using precast concrete panels. Bernstein's base case of a 1,000-mile wall would require over $700 million in concrete and $240 million in cement.Further, they note that it's not economically feasible to transport heavy building materials over long distances, but Martin Marietta and Vulcan ""have significant aggregate operations in the area.""RELATED:Will Trump Spending Plan Boost Martin Marietta In 2017?Eagle In Buy Range; Vulcan, Martin Marietta Approach Buy PointsApple, GM, Boeing Are China's Top Hostages In A Trump Trade War

85,MLM,"U.S. stock indexes sailed to new highs in late afternoon trade Wednesday as volume picked up for a second straight day and the building sector stirred.The Dow Jones industrial average popped 0.8%, clearing the 20,000 mark for the first time in history. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 rose 1% and 0.8% respectively. Small caps moved in like form as the Russell 2000 added 1%.Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking higher than Tuesday's levels in the stock market today.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, building-related stocks — such as homebuilders, heavy construction, wood products and cement — were leading the way up. The day's biggest losers included steel makers and gold miners.While the Dow's outlandish sounding number may have little meaning in itself, the mileage marker did complement the market's bullish mood.Most stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average were up, and eight scored gains of 1% or more. Boeing (BA) led with a 4.2% gain and Caterpillar (CAT) was second with a 2% gain. Both attracted heavy volume, which suggested that institutional buying was behind the move.Caterpillar broke out of a flat base, clearing a 97.50 buy point. Caterpillar will release Q4 results Thursday morning.Boeing reported quarterly results before the open that beat the Street's consensus estimates on sales and earnings.IBD'S TAKE: David Ryan, a William O'Neil protege, comments on the current stock market.In the S&P 500, breakouts included data storage firm Seagate Technology (STX), electronic parts provider Te Connectivity (TEL), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Martin Marietta (MLM) and Parker-Hannifin (PH).In the Nasdaq 100, breakouts included chip designer Marvell Technology (MRVL) and contract manufacturer Flex (FLEX).IBD's proprietary growth-stock screens also featured some breakouts.

Both are in buy range, about 1%-2% above their entries.Trump stocks — construction and materials — were some of the prime movers in the stock market today.After Tuesday's surge, MasTec (MTZ) tacked on an additional 1.4% as it tries to break out past a 41 entry of a short, cup-shaped base. The stock closed just beneath that buy point.Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), a Leaderboard member, rose 3% and broke out of a flat base with a 236.51 entry as the stock's volume swelled to about 90% above average.Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) gapped down over 3% but rallied off its lows, after a disappointing quarter in which the copper miner missed both earnings and sales estimates. The stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base on Tuesday.Following up on Tuesday's strength, the IBD 50 gained steam throughout the trading day.Eagle Materials (EXP) added to Tuesday's breakout, rising another 4%.

89,MLM,"Stock funds seemed only slightly less frenetic than President Trump setting policy in his first 100 days, as the average domestic stock fund rose 1.83% in January, padding gains of 1.46% in December and 10.81% in 2016.World equity funds did even better in January, advancing 3.86%, according to Lipper Inc.Taxable bond funds rose 0.76%, while municipal bond funds rose 0.46%.The S&P 500 rose 1.90% last month.Not all of the young year's gains are attributable to the new president and new Congress, say stock fund managers and strategists.""Regardless of who was elected, the economy was already improving,"" said Kimberly Scott, lead manager of $2.4 billion Ivy Mid Cap Growth (WMGAX) and co-manager of $288 million Ivy Mid Cap Income Opportunities (IVOAX) funds. ""The trajectory of corporate profits had already turned up. The outlook for corporate profits for the end of 2017 into 2018 was already quite strong. The policy changes concerning taxes, repatriation of overseas corporate cash (and) unwinding some onerous regulations that President Trump talked about could boost corporate profits more. But the economy was already getting stronger.""And mutual fund professionals expect the uptrend to continue this year.""The market could go in two very different ways,"" said Omar Aguilar, Charles Schwab Investment Management's chief investment officer of equities. ""On the one hand, there is a very powerful combination of factors that could translate into record levels for equities.""On the other hand, the market could go south. ""The attempt at reforms (of taxes, corporate cash repatriation and regulatory burdens) could increase the federal budget deficit,"" Aguilar said. ""There is a potential for trade wars. Emerging markets are still landing. A strong U.S. currency could hurt exports. Those headwinds could backfire into our economy and markets.""On balance, Aguilar is guardedly bullish. ""On a net basis we will see the market trend up,"" he said. ""But it will be volatile.""Scott is favoring stocks in sectors that typically benefit at the outset of a rally. ""Many think we're in the midcycle of a recovery,"" she said. ""But we had a significant corporate-profits recession. So to me this feels like an early-stage economic recovery, and that's when you want to shift more asset weight into technology, financials, energy and industry.""Consumer discretionary is usually part of that early-stage recovery party. But this time brick-and-mortar retailers are battling digital retailers. Brick-and-mortar retailers are being forced to spend on their own websites and low-cost delivery services, Scott says, which will continue to sap their earnings.Large-cap growth mutual funds' 4.10% gain on average in January led all U.S. diversified stock fund categories.Yet investors were still jittery enough at times to drive precious-metals funds, a defensive category, up 14.94% last month, higher than any other sector. That beat basic-materials funds, which gained 7.31%.Latin American funds paced foreign stock fund categories by tacking on 7.67%.Taxable bonds were led by flexible-income funds 1.61% gain. Treasury funds inched up 0.36%.Trailing precious metals and several other sector fund categories, tech funds notched a 5.13% January gain. IPG Photonics (IPGP) is a technology name that John Barr, manager of $60 million Needham Aggressive Growth (NEAGX) — whose 9.32% average annual gain over the past 10 years topped 96% of its small-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. — likes in a market poised to continue higher but with volatility. The company makes fiber-optic lasers, which can be used for cutting and welding in industrial applications. As costs fall, laser systems become increasingly attractive, especially in welding, Barr says. ""Big automotive makers are quite interested in using this for welding,"" he said.Revenue grew 19% and 17% in the two most recent years. Earnings grew an average of 18% annually from 2014 to 2016. ""It has a long runway ahead, with great returns and great management,"" Barr said.PDF Solutions (PDFS) is another tech name Barr likes. The firm produces software that's the core of electrical testing of newly made semiconductors. It has the potential for taking share from more conventional optical testing systems, Barr says.Two major chipmakers signed on as customers in 2016. PDF's service is delivered on a subscription basis. ""So it has high margins and could double company earnings"" in the near term, Barr said, especially if it wins customers in China as the Middle Kingdom builds out its own semiconductor manufacturing industry between now and 2020.Ivy's Scott likes MercadoLibre (MELI), an Argentina-based online retailer that offers an electronic payment service. ""It's still in an earlier phase of development than Amazon (AMZN) is here,"" said Scott. ""There is no reason to think that demand for online buying and payment will not be as attractive to Latin Americans as it is in the U.S. and Asia.""Video-game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) is another of Scott's favorites. The video-game publisher benefits from a console-upgrade cycle and the shift to digital game downloads, which carry higher profit margins, as IBD has reported. Scott says now, ""I continue to like the tremendous changes in the products and innovation there. They make games that consumers love. And the way that these products are developed and distributed digitally is such a profit enhancer. We think that story continues.""Among financial services stocks, Scott likes regional banks such as First Republic (FRC) and Signature Bank (SBNY), which should benefit from rising rates and from a reduction in their regulatory burden. Trump targeted the Dodd-Frank Act for review on Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Midsize regional banks have gotten a boost from congressional moves to raise the threshold of the Dodd-Frank Act's systemic risk designation. The existing rule applies to banks with at least $50 billion in assets, subjecting them to costly regulations. As IBD recently reported, Congress is looking at raising that to $250 billion.Scott also likes MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), an electronic bond-trading exchange that claims cheaper transaction costs than traditional investment-bank bond trades, easier odd-lot trading and specialization in corporate credit. ""There are others trying to do this, but none has gained the traction that MarketAxess has,"" she said.Amid the rally in energy stocks, Stephen DeNichilo, co-manager of $2.9 billion Federated Kaufmann Large Cap (KLCAX), likes small-cap Independence Contract Drilling (ICD). The company offers customers of energy exploration and production very sophisticated drilling rigs. ""They're on the leading edge of what E&P companies want,"" DeNichilo said. ""They have only 12 working rigs, so essentially they are fully utilized. They have leverage to the U.S. shale-pad drilling rally. They have a clean balance sheet. They are trading below their $10-a-share replacement value. And they could be a takeout candidate.""In addition to trading below 10, earnings per share growth has declined at triple-digit paces the past four quarters.Among industrials, DeNichilo likes Dycom Industries (DY). ""We like long-term investment themes,"" DeNichilo said. ""Dycom is the largest specialty contractor for fiber-(optic cable). They're the only national specialty contractor that puts fiber into the ground at a time when AT&T (T), CenturyLink (CTL), Charter (CHTR), Verizon (VZ) and other (telecoms) are about to ramp up.""That cycle will be sparked, DeNichilo says, by AT&T embarking on a massive plan to lay fiber so the telecom giant can offer customers high-speed internet service. ""Their plan is to bring 1-gigabit speed to (at least) 12 million customers by 2019,"" DeNichilo said. The industry has seen that when dramatically higher speeds are offered at the same or comparable cost, customers switch providers. ""Competitors will have to follow,"" he said. ""This will be a big cycle for Dycom. Also, fiber investments could be part of any large infrastructure (upgrade) plan by the government.""At the average U.S. broadband speed of about 18 megabits, downloading a two-hour movie takes more than 10 minutes. It takes eight seconds via 1-Gig fiber, according to fastmetrics.com. And AT&T's speed upgrade can be achieved solely through street-side fiber, and will not require any in-home rewiring or cable replacement, DeNichilo says.Dycom's earnings grew an average of 74% annually over the past three years. ""Despite earnings growth way above the market, they are trading below the market multiple,"" DeNichilo said.DeNichilo also likes Martin Marietta Materials (MLM). As the U.S. economy heats up, demand for construction aggregates will grow. ""Even without Trump's Mexican wall, nonresidential construction — which is the bulk of aggregate consumption — is still below its 55-year normal level,"" he said. ""This company has essentially doubled earnings per share over the past three years, so its outlook is fantastic whether there is a (federal government) infrastructure plan or not.""Ivy's Scott likes water-heater-maker A.O. Smith (AOS). ""There isn't a lot of cyclicality in their business,"" Scott said. ""Homeowners have to replace their heaters every 10 to 12 years. And they have a growing business in China for water heaters and water-purification systems. It's a nice growth engine for Smith.""Smith's average annual earnings growth rate was 24% from 2014 through 2016. ""They're a consistent grower and reliable payer of dividends,"" Scott added. The company's dividend yield is 1.1%. ""We're not a dividend fund, but it's nice to have on top of everything.""RELATED: Where Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 20172017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewClick Here To See A List Of New Buys Of Top Mutual FundsClick Here To See A List Of Latest Sells Of Top Mutual Funds

90,MLM,"Major stock indexes were firmly in the red in afternoon trading Tuesday as earnings reports and Donald Trump remained focal points. The Dow Jones industrial average underperformed, falling 0.8%, as Intel (INTC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) lagged.Several medical-related industry groups outperformed after Trump met with Big Pharma leaders. He called on CEOs to manufacture in the U.S. to curb rising drug prices.The Nasdaq composite lost 0.6% and the S&P 500 eased 0.5%. Volume on both the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking close to Monday's levels.Gold miners and utility stocks also outperformed. Small caps sidestepped the selling as the Russell 2000 was mostly unchanged.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) continued its winning ways, and rose another 1%. Since hitting a low of 107 in mid-December, the ETF is up nearly 8%.Nucor (NUE) shed nearly 5% despite a big earnings beat. A prior breakout over a 57.18 buy point looked good for a while, but the stock has retraced most of a 19% gain. Group peer U.S. Steel (X) reports after the close.Steel stocks and other infrastructure plays rallied sharply after the election but have come under recent selling pressure. Aggregate makers like Martin Marietta (MLM), Vulcan Materials (VMC) and Eagle Materials (EXP) extended losses after recent breakouts.In earnings news, Under Armour (UAA) was a big loser in the stock market today.

91,MLM,"Donald Trump is a different kind of president, touting an ""America First"" vision and conducting trade negotiations and tax policy debates seemingly on the fly via Twitter and TV. Yet investors have taken the hyperactive populist in stride, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring above 20,000 for the first time this week.The stock market rally has breadth: Apple (AAPL), Goldman Sachs (GS), Caterpillar (CAT), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), Home Depot (HD) have broken out in recent days and weeks. (Apple, Caterpillar, Goldman Sachs and Home Depot are all Dow industrials components, but the five reflect a wide array of sectors). And the uptrend has depth: Hundreds of stocks have been hitting 52-week or all-time highs.No wonder investors aren't worried. And that's the problem.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighting growth stocks breaking out of proper bases. The CBOE Volatility Index estimates expected volatility based on S&P 500 option prices. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), commonly known as VIX after its ticker, highlights intense fear or complacency in the market. Low VIX readings are a sign that investors are especially bullish.The VIX has fallen steadily since Election Day as the Dow industrials and other major averages have rallied. On Friday, the VIX fell to a fresh two-and-half-year low intraday, nearly tumbling to a decade low.Extreme bullishness can be a sign of a market top, at least a short-term peak. Likewise, extreme bearishness can foreshadow a market bottom.IBD's David Chung issued a note of caution in Wednesday's The Big Picture:""At some point, U.S. stocks will indeed cool off. Investor complacency, as measured by the CBOE Market Volatility Index, or the VIX, is dangerously thick. The VIX hit extreme lows at the end of 1993, the end of 2006 and the spring of 2011, and each time the indexes staged sharp corrections of 20% or more.""Think of it this way. Stocks rally as investors turn bullish and pull money from the sidelines and into the market. But when ""everyone"" is optimistic and fully invested, who's left to buy? If the market assumes everything will go well, then what news will propel equities higher?The stock market is pricing in a lot of good news that hasn't happened yet — corporate tax cuts, regulatory reform and higher infrastructure spending. Meanwhile, investors don't seem concerned about the risk of growth-killing protectionism barriers or a full-blown trade war. And don't forget that the Federal Reserve is planning on several rate hikes this year, and markets have wobbled whenever policymakers even hint at hikes.In any case, when contrarian psychological market indicators like the VIX go to extreme levels, you don't need to rush into cash. They are secondary market gauges. But be ready to act and pay extra attention to the number of higher-volume declines in the major averages (distribution days), as well as the price and volume action of leading stocks.RELATED:Be Ready To Act When Investor Psychology Reaches Extreme Levels

94,MLM,"The federal government is on track to run a cumulative budget deficit of $9.4 trillion over the coming decade, including $1.4 trillion in 2027, or 5.0% of GDP, new Congressional Budget Office projections indicate.Over the decade, public debt is projected to rise from 77% of GDP to 89%. The updated outlook underscores the challenge President Trump will face as he relies primarily on a narrow GOP majority in the Senate to slash taxes for businesses and individuals and undertake a major infrastructure push.That agenda has fueled the postelection stock market rally, lifting shares of materials companies like Nucor (NUE), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Freeport McMoRan (FCX) that would benefit from an infrastructure push. The prospect that companies will see their after-tax earnings boosted by tax cuts has been a boon to companies that do most of their business in the U.S., such as AT&T (T) and Jack in the Box (JACK).IBD'S TAKE: The ability of Republicans to dramatically cut the corporate tax rate may rest on a House GOP plan to impose a 20% tax on imports, which would raise $1.1 trillion over 10 years. But the plan, which could hurt Wal-Mart and Apple, faces a bruising political fight.In the campaign, Trump promised not to cut Social Security and Medicare. Meanwhile, savings that the GOP hoped to derive by repealing ObamaCare now look somewhat doubtful. Three GOP senators have lined up behind a repeal-and-replacement of ObamaCare that looks to be just as expensive.Trump is already signaling plans to go after nondefense discretionary programs, including those of the Environmental Protection Agency, but Republican leaders are warning him that there are limited savings to be found outside of entitlement programs. Discretionary spending already has been curbed under a budget sequestration deal between the GOP Congress and President Obama.Trump's own budget director pick, Mick Mulvaney, said at Tuesday's Senate confirmation hearing that the $20 trillion national debt must be ""addressed sooner rather than later.""RELATED:Social Security Benefit Cuts In 2017 May Curb Trump's Plans

96,MLM,"Your personal finance plan in 2017 will be like baking a cake. All you'll need is the right recipe. Whether you're investing in stocks, bonds, ETFs or mutual funds in a 401(k) retirement account, now's the time to check to make sure you have the right ingredients at hand.For Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors, the recipe involves six ingredients: overweight U.S. stocks in general; underweight 10-year Treasury bonds; and overweight financial services stocks, U.S. small-cap stocks, energy stocks and industrial companies' stocks.Orlando's colleague, Steve Chiavarone, associate manager of $414 million Federated Global Allocation Fund (FSTBX), cites holdings which illustrate that recipe. Among them, Apple (AAPL) could see higher profits if corporate taxes are lowered as President-elect Trump wants. It could also boost stock dividends or buybacks and spend more to develop new products with repatriated cash under Trump's tax proposal. ""Still, Trump has issues with parts of the tech industry, so Apple's may be a more mixed picture,"" Chiavarone said.In addition, a more lenient regulatory environment for banks would convert JPMorgan (JPM) from a something akin to a regulated utility back into a growth stock, Chiavarone says. Oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL) should get more mileage out of its run, fueled by rising energy prices, he adds. And construction aggregates producer Martin Marietta (MLM) is poised to benefit from a boom in infrastructure projects.IBD'S TAKE: Martin Marietta is No. 2 in IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete-Aggregates industry group. To see how the company's growth metrics — like its strong 83 IBD Composite Rating and very strong 96 EPS (earnings per share) Rating stack up against its rivals, visit IBD Stock Checkup.To Orlando and Chiavarone, the 2017 recipe aims to take advantage of several macroeconomic forces now in play.In financials, $1.2 billion Third Avenue Value (TAVFX) lead manager Chip Rewey says U.S. regional banks are likely to benefit from rate hikes and scaled-back regulation. Their valuations are also relatively low ""since people have shunned them since the financial crisis.""Banks he likes include top holdings Bank of New York Mellon (BK), Comerica (CMA), PNC Financial (PNC) and Keycorp (KEY). All have strong Composite Ratings from IBD in the 80s or 90s.Among other stocks, he said home-builder ""Lennar (LEN) is a new position for Value Fund because housing should do well."" Its balance sheet is improving, it is reducing debt and it is trimming its land bank.He also recently bought shares in Johnson Controls (JCI). Some investors still think of it as a maker of automotive seating, a field it has exited. ""Its hidden gem is its car batteries,"" Rewey said. ""They are a leader in lead acid batteries and in start-stop batteries. And they, not Tesla (TSLA), are the leader in lithium ion car batteries.""In addition, Rewey likes biotech Amgen (AMGN), a relative newcomer to the portfolio, largely ""because the market is ignoring its strong pipeline.""And true to his value orientation, Rewey likes apparel company Ralph Lauren (RL). Earnings per share growth has declined eight straight quarters. The stock's Comp Rating is a dismal 7. ""But Rewey likes CEO Stefan Larsson's turnaround credentials. ""We think it's a great opportunity,"" Rewey said.Lee DeLorenzo, president of United Asset Strategies in Garden City, N.Y., says workers should try to take advantage of the same apparent forces in their 401(k) accounts. At the same time, they should cut their interest-rate risk by shifting 5% to 10% of their weighting in traditional bond funds to stable value funds or flexible, go-anywhere bond funds.She advises increasing exposure to small- and midcap stocks and stock funds. Plan members who can stomach risk, she says, should boost their weightings in financials and energy.Rich Weiss, a senior portfolio manager on a team that oversees 20 American Century target-date, target-risk and asset-allocation funds, says 401(k) plan members should also look at whether the year-end spurt in stock prices threw their target asset allocations out of whack. Does your mix of stocks, large and small, U.S. and foreign, specific geographies and selected sectors, still jibe with your overall financial plan? Your risk tolerance? Your financial goals?If something has grown too big, take profits to rebalance. Keep the proceeds inside your account to avoid an early withdrawal.Plan members who'd rather not make their own investment decisions should leave the heavy lifting to target-date and target-risk funds within their accounts, he says. If you do want to forge your own investment decisions, you can look for ideas at the asset allocations of target date and target risk portfolios that match your situation. ""But doing that may be more expensive and complex than simply purchasing an appropriate target-date fund,"" Weiss added.If your 401(k) does not offer target-date or target-risk funds? Consider investing that same money instead in such a fund inside an IRA, where your investment choices are almost unlimited.In addition, Weiss says, if your 401(k) offers a Roth option, use it if you are young and if your tax bracket will stay the same or rise after you retire. Meanwhile, contributions are not tax deductible. But earnings grow tax-deferred. And withdrawals normally will be tax-free, unlike withdrawals from a regular 401(k) or IRA.Suppose you share the Orlando-Chiavarone vision of what 2017 is to bring. How do you act on it?One approach would be to boost the assets, sectors and geographies that they expect to thrive by 10% in your portfolio. Trim from assets like long Treasuries and emerging-markets stocks. You can tweak those numbers up or down, depending on factors such as your time horizon, risk tolerance, long-term goals and any near-term need for cash.If you're an aggressive investor in your 30s, for instance, you might want to boost your U.S. small caps by 11% or 12%.In any case, first form your 2017 financial action plan, either with your financial advisor or on your own. Then look for securities that can bring that plan to life. It's not all that hard. In fact, reflecting holiday cheer, DeLorenzo said, ""The execution of these changes is as easy as baking a cake.""RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewHot Stocks That Made Craig Hodges A Top 2016 Mutual Fund ManagerWhere Mutual Fund Pros See Big Stock Gains In 2017Here's How To Decide Which Retirement Accounts To Fund First

99,MLM,"Since taking the helm of one of the fund industry's marquee portfolios on April 1, Justin White has guided $3.4 billion T. Rowe Price New America Growth Fund (PRWAX) to a 10.44% return, topping 70% of his large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.In that time going into Thursday, with the broad market not favoring all of the types of stocks the fund held, the S&P 500 gained 12.35%.White is steering a fund with a proud legacy. Its 9.11% average annual return over the past 10 years ranked in the top 7% of its peer group.White is putting his mark on the fund. Since taking the helm, he has boosted the fund's weighting in financials and trimmed its weightings in health care and industrials.""Under (predecessor Daniel Martino) the fund had a tremendous track record,"" White said. ""It was higher octane than it is now."" While willing to hold individual stocks that can be volatile, White is trying to keep the overall portfolio's volatility lower. ""And I don't try to make big macro bets ... . I let stock picking carry the day. I pay more attention to (controlling) downside risk, so I have a greater allocation for example to telecoms — not the AT&Ts (T) or Verizon (VZ), but to tower businesses ... like American Tower (AMT) . . . and core holdings like Comcast (CMCSA).""In broad strategic terms, the fund aims for stocks in the fastest growing sectors. Now that means internet stocks like Amazon (AMZN), which is taking share from brick-and-mortar retailers, he says. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) are taking advertising dollars from nondigital media. ""Those are among my top holdings because their outsize growth will persist for some time,"" White said.Information technology is the fund's largest sector, with a 35% weighting as of Dec. 31.As for stocks that might benefit from Trump policies, White says he is hedging his bets. ""It's hard to make big bets on the economy reaccelerating,"" he said. He does expect financials to benefit. ""The sector has been in regulators' unrelenting crosshairs for the past 10 years,"" he said. ""And I'm pretty comfortable betting on a regulations rollback and tax reductions.""But White thinks new infrastructure spending is already largely or all priced into many materials and industrials stocks. For that reason, he has kept Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) a small holding.And White isn't wearing rose-colored glasses when he looks at internet names either. Netflix (NFLX), for instance, ""is on the right side of (technological) change and can get bigger and more profitable,"" he said. But he has trimmed his stake because ""earnings are no longer sufficiently attractive in the near term for a stock (trading) around 130.""IBD'S TAKE: Netflix is No. 3 in IBD's Leisure-Movies & Related industry group. To see how the company's growth metrics — like its very strong 90 IBD Composite Rating and two quarters of earnings per share (EPS) acceleration — stack up against its rivals, visit IBD Stock Checkup.Even Facebook, a favorite, has a weakness. White describes the stock in terms of the four pillars that he looks for in support of each holding. Three of Facebook's get his strong scores.HCA Holdings (HCA) is a stock that White says has a better outlook than many investors think. Most recently, he thinks the market has been overly negative in the expectation that this stock will be hurt by repeal or rollback to ObamaCare. But HCA likely gets a maximum of 5% of its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) from Affordable Care Act provisions, he says. In a worst-case scenario, after stripping that income away the company would still ""be attractively valued enough to warrant owning."" White said.""It's more of a value play than the average holding in my growth portfolio,"" he said. But share price has the potential to double over the next three years, he says. ""This is still a business that can compound earnings at a double-digit pace over time. There's room for a stock like that in my portfolio.""RELATED:How A Top Mutual Fund Weathers Market VolatilityWhat To Do When Your Fund Gets A New Manager

100,MLM,"Federal Reserve policymakers, the air traffic controllers of the economy, are likely to signal clear running room for economic growth — and, by extension, the Trump stock-market rally — when they telegraph their views on Wednesday.A quarter-point rate hike, just the second interest-rate increase in a decade, is a mere formality at this point, with markets pricing in a 97% chance. What matters to markets is what the Fed has to say about the rate-hiking outlook for 2017 and beyond via Fed members' quarterly economic projections released along with the 2 p.m. ET policy statement and Chair Janet Yellen's post-meeting press conference.When Fed policymakers last detailed their economic projections in September, they signaled two more quarter-point rate hikes in the coming year and three additional hikes in 2018. Any indication that the Fed is getting antsy about inflation pressures and speeding up this timetable wouldn't go down well with markets. But there are some big reasons to doubt that policymakers will take such a hawkish turn right on the heels of the election.The Fed meeting comes as economic growth is on the upswing and the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index is at a 10-year high. Major stock indexes have surged to record highs amid hopes for President-elect Donald Trump's agenda of tax cuts, an infrastructure-spending binge and regulatory relief. Shares of industrial companies like Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and steel maker Nucor (NUE) have outperformed, as have financials like Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Yet there's still a great deal of uncertainty about what Republicans will be able to pass. With 52 GOP senators, Republicans will have to overcome a Democratic filibuster by passing tax legislation via reconciliation, which requires budget neutrality beyond 10 years.IBD'S TAKE: As the Trump agenda emerges, read IBD Leaderboard and The Big Picture each day to see how market leaders are performing, to find breakout candidates for your watch list, and to  get the best assessment of whether the stock market has more running room. Federal Reserve Board governors and regional bank presidents have continually lowered their economic projections over the past year, so a sudden hawkish shift could renew charges leveled by Trump during the campaign that policymakers had a political agenda all along.At her post-meeting press conference on Sept. 21, Yellen said, ""We found the economy has a bit more running room,"" thanks to more people being attracted into the labor force. While the November employment report showed the jobless rate falling to 4.6% from 4.9%, it's unlikely that the Fed will make too much of a single month's data point in the rather volatile household survey.Yellen has urged caution on raising rates for much of the past year, warning that the Fed has much more leeway to fight inflation than to stimulate the economy with its key interest rate still near zero.""Policymakers have been arguing for fiscal policy to take the baton to boost growth,"" wrote Jefferies economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons. ""While fiscal policy appears to be on the way, the Fed will wait until fiscal plans have been implemented before altering the outlook for monetary policy in a meaningful way.""At least as far as the Fed is concerned, Trump is likely to get a honeymoon, but it may not be a long one, writes Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.""Chair Yellen will be able to dodge questions on the inflation risks posed by fiscal loosening at Wednesday's press conference, simply by pointing out that no legislation has yet been proposed, let alone passed,"" Shepherdson wrote. ""But the question will have to be addressed directly by the spring, at the latest.""For now, Yellen is likely to take the same tack as she did in her testimony to Congress the week after the election, gently advising members to take into account the concerning fiscal outlook when they formulate tax and spending policies.""With the debt-to-GDP ratio at around 77%, there's not a lot of fiscal space should a shock to the economy occur, an adverse shock that did require fiscal stimulus,"" she said.RELATED:As Trumponomics Cheers Wall Street, Economists FretWhat's Really Doable In Trump's First 100 Days?

107,MLM,"The stock market loves to do the unexpected. Veterans on Wall Street call it a contrarian streak.Did you see the latest example of the market's psychological mischief? On the night of the Nov. 8 presidential election, fear consumed traders. At one point futures on the Dow Jones industrials index plunged 800 points. Yet by Friday, the index finished the week up 959 points, more than 5%.This past week, the popular blue-chip gauge refused to give back any of last week's rally. The Russell 2000, meanwhile, started the week with an upward surge of nearly 1.3%, after catapulting more than 10% higher last week. With less than an hour to go in Friday's trade, the popular small cap index was poised to gain another 2.4%.The S&P 500 closed down less than 1 point on Monday, but also looks to finish higher for the week. That's bullish action, considering that the large-cap benchmark climbed an astonishing 79 points, or 3.8%, last week.The NYSE composite also looks set to gain some additional ground for the week, following a 3.5% gain last week.Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) all struggled on Monday with losses of 2% to 3% each, yet the market cap-weighted Nasdaq composite finished down only 0.4% on Monday. Why? The Nasdaq is certainly dominated by large tech and consumer-oriented companies, but don't forget the thousands of other smaller firms in the fields of banking, retailing, manufacturing, biotechnology and commodities.Did you see solid gains in heavy volume by Airgain (AIRG) (now up 35% past 17.04 IPO base buy point), Cognex (CGNX) (extended 10% past a 53.55 flat base proper entry) and WingStop (WING) (building a new base since Aug. 15)? All of these Nasdaq-listed names rallied big for the week in rapid turnover.Such action is a hint that equity trading desks and large funds aren't finished buying yet, even after last week's big stock market bounce.Looking ahead, will the market do something even more unexpected?To be more specific, will four years of Donald Trump in the White House be just what the doctor ordered to keep the aging stock market rally going even with 7-1/2 years of gains already behind it? And could the rise in U.S. equities even accelerate?America and the world are still pondering the latest sea change in U.S. politics and governing. But the accompanying chart suggests that good times for long-suffering equity investors may be closer around the corner.Why? The market action since 2000 has been showing similar action to an earlier period: 1968 to 1987.For 14 long years from 1968 to 1982, the S&P 500 struggled to break free from a grinding trading range. Slow growth and high inflation kept it trapped in a series of bear markets, the worst of which cut the market in half in 1973-74.That all changed in 1982 when President Ronald Reagan slashed taxes and unleashed an 18-year super bull market.Jump to 2000. After extraordinary stock gains that ultimately ended in extreme excesses, it was time for another long period of consolidation. It took 13 years for the S&P 500 to completely break through to new high ground. But for the past two years, the stock market has been stuck in neutral.History doesn't precisely repeat itself, but as the late writer Mark Twain was once quoted as saying, it does rhyme. Today, if you overlay the current market with the earlier period on the chart, an interesting parallel emerges.

108,MLM,"U.S. stock indexes advanced nicely Tuesday, but volume stepped down markedly.The Nasdaq rose 1.1%, while the S&P 500 added 0.7%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average crawled 0.3% higher. Small caps, which have been leading the market of late, tacked on 0.3% in the S&P 600. Volume in the stock market today declined roughly 15% on the NYSE and 10% on the Nasdaq from the previous session's pace, according to preliminary figures.Follow-up action has been rather weak among the major indexes, but small caps and select sectors have done very well. Bulls would like to see some days of big gains in rising volume.Banks have been the star sector recently. On Monday, 153 banks scored new highs while the two major indexes accounted for 751 new highs. Nine bank stocks now make up about half of the Big Cap 20, which is a list of the best big caps by fundamentals and technicals. On Tuesday, bank winners led losers in the Big Cap 20.Big Cap 20 members Morgan Stanley (MS), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), KeyCorp (KEY) and Regions Financial (RF) each rose more than 1%, according to preliminary data. Goldman Sachs (GS), Citizens Financial Bank (CFG) and SunTrust Banks (STI) scored smaller gains. M & T Bank (MTB) lost ground.The construction aggregates and cement stocks also have been leaders. But Tuesday, they were taking a timeout. Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), Vulcan Materials (VMC) and Eagle Materials (EXP) recorded losses but without damaging the overall bullishness of their chart patterns.Meanwhile, economic news was mostly positive.Retail sales for October were stronger than expected, and September results were revised upward. The Street expected a 0.6% pop in October, but the percentage came in at 0.8% — above the highest estimate in the range. The September figure initially was reported at 0.6% but was revised to 1%.Most stocks in the retail sector are currently laggards. Of the 18 groups in the retail sector, roughly two-thirds are in the bottom half among 197 industry groups. The one highly rated group is department stores, which is No. 8.Manufacturing also topped expectations. The Empire State manufacturing gauge for November rose 1.5, also above the highest estimate in the range, according to Econoday. The Street expected a reading of minus 2.3. November marked the first positive reading since July.Business inventories for September inched up 0.1%, falling shy of views for 0.2%.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, oil stocks and gold miners were the day's biggest gainers.

The $44.6 billion portfolio was outperforming 98% of its large-cap growth fund rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the three months, going into Thursday.That could help lift the mutual fund, which has been roughly in the middle of the pack so far this year, back to its longer-term record of outperformance, as Fath approaches his three-year anniversary at the helm in January.Over the past three years the fund's average annual gain of 9.53% has topped 85% of its peers, which averaged 7.37% yearly. The S&P 500 notched a 9.18% annual pace.The fund's recent rally stems from the market's rotation back toward the type of growth stocks that Fath favors. Earlier in the year, the market was rewarding deep cyclical stocks.

It outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31. Only 9% of U.S. diversified stock funds accomplished that. And it was in the top 100 in three categories: all U.S. equity, all growth funds and all large caps.How is the fund managing this rebound? Eight of its 10 largest holdings as of Sept. 30 had IBD Composite Ratings of 83 or better. Five of its top 10 new buys also had Comp Ratings of at least 83.IBD'S TAKE: The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher, which means that they've outperformed 95% of all other stocks in terms of their Composite Rating. Here's where to learn more about reading the Comp Rating road signs.MasterCard (MA) is one the fund's top holdings. It has trended higher since early July, and it did well on Wednesday, the first day after Donald Trump's election victory. But it pulled back on Thursday, finishing 4% below its all-time high.Illinois Tool Works (ITW) is among the fund's top buys. The stock has rallied this month, adding 8% this week. Many investors look at it as a way to benefit from investments in U.S. infrastructure under a Trump administration. Fath instead is focused on the stock's ongoing fundamentals, not its potential macroeconomic drivers.""It's more of a mergers-and-acquisitions story within industrials,"" he said. ""And it is a disciplined, well-run company with seven business units. They're all doing well, all pushing margin structure over 20%. Only the welding unit is under pressure.""Fath added that the company management has executed ""good deployment of capital. They've gotten rid of bad stuff, focused on their best stuff and made good deals in recent years.""Another of his holdings, Martin Marietta (MLM), is more of a Trump infrastructure play, he says. The stock, which has an IBD Composite Rating of 94, gapped up 12% on Wednesday on massive volume and was up again Thursday. That puts Martin Marietta shares above the level at which you'd want to buy them under CAN SLIM rules.IBD'S TAKE: CAN SLIM rules establish buy ranges above buy points to keep investors from ""chasing"" stocks beyond low-risk buy zones. Leading stocks executing powerful gap-up breakouts operate according to a slightly different set of rules.The company produces crushed stone, and an other aggregates for construction.Earnings per share grew 886%, 56% and 22% the past three quarters.The company stands to benefit from programs like the Free and Secure Trade (FAST) program, which is a commercial clearance program for known low-risk shipments entering the United States from Canada and Mexico. ""(Those programs) have been slow to roll out but are ramping up now,"" he said.Also, Fath sees the company's low single-digit volume and high single-digit pricing as set to recover into high single-digit growth as the heavy rain and flooding in the Southeast that hurt them earlier this year have passed.Many investors expect certain financial stocks to benefit from a lighter regulatory burden during a Trump regime as well as from a rising-rate environment. Morgan Stanley (MS) gapped up 7% on Wednesday and was up again Thursday.Trading around 38, that left the big financial firm's shares extended above their 32.47 buy point.""(A bullish outlook for a) lot of financials is predicated on a rising-rate environment,"" Fath said. ""We think Morgan Stanley is a good company-specific story.""Fath likes Morgan Stanley's heightened focus on wealth management.And the company's bank is becoming a bigger source of income and profit as the firm does more lending.Ferrari (RACE) is another holding that Fath likes. The Italy-based sports- and luxury-car maker was spun off from Fiat just over a year ago.""This stock does not get a lot of attention,"" Fath said. ""European car analysts follow it. But it is really a luxury goods company. It does not have a lot of capital requirements and it does have a lot of demand backlog.""The company enjoys production growth of roughly 4% a year, Fath says. And it has annual pricing power of about 3% to 5%.""This is a company that can grow in the midteens for the rest of the decade,"" Fath said. ""Other luxury goods makers like Hermes trade at much higher multiples. In today's market, we like a company that can be defensive as well as offensive.""Generally, superwealthy consumers don't downshift their car buying even during a time of slow or uncertain economic growth, Fath says.RELATED:Franklin's DynaTech Wins With Stocks Of InnovatorsWhat Fidelity Trend Fund Likes About Apple, Amazon and Alphabet

112,MLM,"U.S. stock indexes were mixed Thursday afternoon, as tech stocks endured some selling heading into the last hour of trade.The Nasdaq trimmed 0.4%, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.5% and 1.4% respectively. The small cap Russell 2000 led the upside with a 1.7% thrust. Volume in the stock market today was running modestly higher on both major exchanges.Copper rose 3.6% Thursday afternoon. The metal, which is vital to many industries, rose 2.6% Monday, 3.1% Tuesday and 4% Wednesday. Some market watchers say the strength in copper is a Trump play. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to push an infrastructure strategy. Barclays iPath Copper (JJC), the exchange-traded fund for copper, is working on its third weekly gain in a row.Other infrastructure plays, such as Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), Eagle Materials (EXP) and Vulcan Materials (VMC), followed up strongly after breakouts Wednesday. Martin Marietta was added to IBD Leaderboard this week as a potential new stock market leader.In the tech camp, the mega caps, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), were down without exception. However, none of the five found much traction Wednesday in the initial reaction to the Trump victory.Many bank stocks added to their straight-up moves. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) was up 5%. Wells Fargo (WFC) jumped 8%. Midcap play Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL), which recently made the IBD Sector Leaders screen, popped 4%.West Texas intermediate crude oil was down 1.3%, while gold trimmed 0.8%.RELATED:Big Internet Stocks Aren't Participating In Trump RallyBanks Keep Adding To Gains

113,MLM,"U.S. stock indexes rose for a third consecutive day, climbing above their 50-day moving average lines, as the market took a second, more bullish take on a Trump presidency.The Nasdaq popped 1.1% and closed bullishly high in the day's range. The S&P 500 also grabbed a 1.1% gain, while the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.4%. The small cap S&P 600 led with a 3.1% surge. Volume in the stock market today was higher across the board. The market outlook was upgraded to ""uptrend resumes.""Many of the day's leaders and laggards were reacting to the presidential and congressional elections. Small cap HealthEquity (HQY) roared 12% higher in busy volume. The provider of health savings accounts is likely to benefit under a Republican Senate, House and presidency. President-elect Donald Trump has endorsed health savings account in the past as part of an alternative to ObamaCare, which is likely to be either overturned or amended.The Medical-Hospitals industry group was the day's biggest loser, according to preliminary data. The group lost almost 10%, easily the worst among 197 industry groups. If ObamaCare is overturned, hospitals are likely to encounter more patients without medical insurance and in some cases, no way to pay the bills. Republicans haven't made clear what they would do to address the problem.On the upside, groups showing strong gains included steel producers, coal, construction equipment and cement-related companies. United States Steel (X) gapped up 17%. Westmoreland Coal (WLB) jumped 18%. Caterpillar (CAT) gapped up 8%. And three stocks in the cement group — Eagle Materials (EXP), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC) — each staged breakouts from cup bases. A heads-up on the cement stocks was offered in Friday's Big Picture column.The market showed resilience in the wake of the election. On Tuesday night, futures sold off sharply as it became clear that Hillary Clinton would likely lose. But the fearful money exhausted itself in the first hour of trade Wednesday.The sell-off probably said less about the overall market than it did about the two candidates. Under Trump and a Republican Congress, different winners and losers are likely in the stock market than under Clinton. Investments that had bet on a Clinton victory probably were sold and shifted to stocks likely to benefit under Trump. More of that could continue in the days ahead.RELATED:Hospital Stocks Get Post-Trump Stress DisorderWill Trump Spur Lasting Stock Rally?

The 10-year Treasury yield was unchanged at 2.22%. Among Nasdaq 100 names, Applied Materials (AMAT) rose 1% to 29.96. It's acting well as it works on a flat base with a 31.17 buy point.Also in the stock market today, retailers were in the high and low end of the S&P 500. Target (TGT) spiked 6% after reporting above-par third-quarter earnings and revenue and lifting fourth-quarter comparable store sales guidance. Lowe's (LOW), on the other hand, dropped around 3% as earnings came up short of expectations, and management lowered its full-year earnings guidance below the consensus view.IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks are taking a breather Wednesday, but so far the action has been healthy. Here's a look at notable bank stocks' chart action.The volatile rally in shipping stocks continued, with highly speculative names like Genco Shipping & Trading (GNK), Seanergy Maritime (SHIP) and Euroseas (ESEA) showing gains ranging from 23% to 45%. IBD's shipping group is up about 16% so far in November amid prospects for improving fundamentals.Infrastructure plays Martin Marietta (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC) both fell around 3% after Bank of America downgraded both to neutral from buy after big price runs in recent days.Outperformers in the IBD 50 included Nvidia (NVDA).

Pfizer also said it's ending development of a cholesterol-lowering drug projected to be a blockbuster. It also reduced its earnings outlook for the current quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Pfizer's weakness since August is partly due to concern about growing drug competition from Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novartis (NVS).In economic news, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey index ticked up to 51.9 in October from 51.5 the prior month, slightly ahead of expectations.Outside the U.S., economic data out of China looked pretty good.

December gold rallied around 1% to $1,286.50 an ounce.Drugmakers, a campaign target of Democrat Hillary Clinton due to pricing, traded generally higher.

121,MLM,"Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) fell well short of second-quarter forecasts Tuesday after rival Vulcan Materials (VMC) badly missed quarterly estimates Monday.Martin Marietta, which makes crushed stone, sand and other aggregates for the construction industry and supplies chemicals to various industries, reported a 56% increase in second-quarter earnings per share to $1.90 on a 7.7% hike in revenue to $915.40 million. Analyst consensus was for $2 EPS and $946.74 million revenue.The wide earnings miss dashed hopes that Martin Marietta would record a second straight quarter of better-than-expected earnings. It beat earnings forecasts in the first quarter after missing the prior four straight quarters.Coming as it did after Vulcan badly missed, Martin Marietta's results raise a red flag about strength of the construction industry recovery, although it, like Vulcan, blamed the miss largely on inclement weather.Martin Marietta Chairman and Chief Executive Ward Nye said in a written statement that aggregates pricing rose, and when combined with cost cuts, that led to a 340 basis point increase in gross profit margin to 23%.""This gross margin expansion was achieved despite record or near-record rainfall and its attendant effects in many of our key markets, notably Texas, North Carolina and Colorado,"" Nye said. He added that the El Nino weather effect, which causes more storms and rainfall than normal in parts of the country, began in spring of 2015 and concluded at the end of May. With that gone, construction activity will likely pick up again.Martin Marietta shares closed up 1.1% at 198.50 on the stock market today, remaining in buy range after breaking out early last month.IBD'S TAKE: After consolidating from last September through the first part of July, Martin Marietta's stock is trying to stay above the 193.97 entry point it passed on July 7. To see how it fares vs. other big construction suppliers go to the IBD Stock Checkup.Rival Vulcan rose 0.2% to 116.56, after a 6% loss on Monday when it dropped below its 50-day average. It ended below that support line Tuesday. Vulcan Materials missed on both earnings and revenue growth Monday. In addition to bad weather, it cited project delays, indicating it could return to stronger growth later this year.Meanwhile, Martin Marietta and Vulcan continue to benefit from the housing recovery and will also likely get a boost from the $305 billion federal highway bill signed into law last December that will begin to take effect later this year and roll out over the next five years.Among other large construction materials suppliers, Eagle Materials (EXP) fell 2%, Summit Materials (SUM) dropped 4.3%, and Ireland's CRH (CRH) retreated 0.4%.
"
122,MLM,"Vulcan Materials (VMC) badly missed second-quarter financial estimates Monday, as bad weather and project delays hurt sales, driving its stock down sharply Monday and pulling the sector down.The maker of construction materials such as aggregates, asphalt mix and ready-mix concrete's second-quarter earnings per share minus one-time items rose 36% to 90 cents on a 7% increase in revenue to $956.8 million. Wall Street had expected $1 per share earnings and $1 billion revenue. ""Weather patterns and the timing of large project activity have led to higher month-to-month and state-to-state variability in our shipments, somewhat masking the continued recovery in construction materials demand across our footprint,"" Vulcan Chief Executive Tom Hill said in a prepared statement.Specifically, in several markets higher levels of public funding for transportation and other infrastructure projects ""have yet to convert into construction activity, creating a 'lull' in materials shipments to these end uses,"" Hill said.Vulcan shares fell 6.2% to 116.31 on the stock market today, crashing below its 50-day moving average. Vulcan had traded above or found support at that key line since early February as a strong housing market and the $305 billion federal highway bill signed into law last December raised prospects.IBD'S TAKE: Vulcan Materials has a near-best 97 IBD Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. It's in the middle of the pack among construction suppliers. To see who tops the list, go to the IBD Stock Checkup.Prior to earnings, its stock had a 97 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it had outperformed 97% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters.Rival Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) is set to report second-quarter earnings Tuesday before the market opens. Consensus is for diluted earnings to grow 64% to $2 a share on an 11% increase in revenue to $946.74 million. Martin Marietta shares fell 3.1% to 196.31 Monday.Among other large construction materials companies, Ireland's CRH (CRH) was down 1.4%. Eagle Materials (EXP) lost 2.4% and Summit Materials (SUM) 2.5%.
"
123,MLM,"U.S. Concrete (USCR), which sells ready-mix concrete and other construction supplies, reported higher Q2 sales but missed estimates. Profit was also light.Together with other weak earnings reports from rock and sand construction aggregates companies Vulcan Materials (VMC) and Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), the report raises concerns about construction activity -- or at least construction stocks. All three companies cited unusually harsh weather for the downturn though, saying they expect a quick return to robust growth. U.S. Concrete's Q2 earnings per share plunged 59% to 54 cents, 41 cents below forecasts. Revenue rose 12.7% to $275.75 million. Consensus was for $294.68 million.President and CEO William Sandbrook said U.S. Concrete faced ""near historical levels of significant inclement weather in our North Texas market."" Like Vulcan and Martin Marietta, he expects results to improve in the back half of the year, saying, ""Our underlying demand trends continue to be positive.""Gross profit margin fell to 19.4% from 21.4% in Q2 2015, as higher costs offset a rise in consolidated gross profit. During the quarter, the company bought Nycon, a ready-mix concrete supplier, expanding its footprint in the New York metro area.IBD'S TAKE: Construction supplier U.S. Concrete on Thursday joined Vulcan Materials and Martin Marietta Materials, which earlier reported weak earnings. U.S. housing fundamentals remain strong though. To see ratings for these companies, go to the IBD Stock Checkup.U.S. Concrete stock fell 6.6% to 58.33 at the close, plunging below the 50-day and 100-day lines on the stock market today. U.S. Concrete had been consolidating since the end of April.Vulcan Materials edged up 9 cents to 117.70 while Martin Marietta Materials fell 0.8% to 198.47.In a related development, TopBuild (BLD), which provides insulation services to the construction industry, also came up short of forecasts. Q2 EPS rose 59% to 43 cents, 3 cents below estimates. Revenue grew 7% to $431.59 million, vs. consensus for $450 million. TopBuild shares fell 7.4% to 35.10.Also, LGI Homes (LGIH) reported a 1.7% dip in July home closings vs. a year earlier. LGI Homes, which makes entry-level homes in growth markets, saw closings rise 7% in June and 24% year to date.

Sales in the company's oil and gas proppants fell 78% due to a sales-volume drop in frac sand, which is used in fracking.The company said its frac sand business ""continues to be impacted by the significant slowdown in oil and gas drilling activity over the past 18 months; however, we continue to right-size the business to match our business with current activity levels.""IBD'S TAKE: The Building/Cement/Concrete/Aggregates industry group is ranked 13 out of 197 tracked by IBD, helped by construction growth in the public and private sectors.

Merck stock jumped 10.4%, hitting its highest level since June 2001.Earlier, Merck was reported to be talking with Biogen (BIIB) about a possible Biogen buyout, as was Allergan (AGN).

130,MLM,"Vulcan Materials (VMC) stock appears headed for a new high soon, as the building materials maker builds momentum in the construction industry.RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Wetenhall on Tuesday went so far as to say in a report that the maker of crushed rock and sand aggregates, asphalt mix and ready-to-use concrete is a ""Rock Star!"" in the materials industry. The exclamation point is his. Wetenhall raised his price target on Vulcan to 140 from 127 and maintained an outperform rating.Vulcan shares closed up 1.4% at 125.67 on the stock market today. Its stock boasts a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed at least 99% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth. It was trading just a few points below its all-time high of 128.62 set in early April 2007.The Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates group is ranked a lofty 14 on IBD's list of 197 industry groups. Among other leaders in the group are U.S. Concrete (USCR), which also boasts a 99 IBD Composite Rating and climbed 3.25%, and Eagle Materials (EXP), which rose 1%.Martin Marietta (MLM), which produces aggregates, but also chemicals for industrial and agriculture uses, rose 0.7%. Ireland-based construction materials giant CRH (CRH), which has a presence in the U.S. too, rose 1.2%.Wetenhall expects Vulcan to benefit as public sector spending, which accounts for 50% of its shipments, remains on track to grow by mid-single digits in 2016, driven by strength in highway construction. President Obama signed a $305 billion highway bill into law last December, ensuring that market leader Vulcan and others will see growth in that sector for several years.Private sector construction volumes are expected to rise by mid-double-digit levels this year, Wetenhall said. He noted in the report that there's a slowdown in nonresidential construction activity compared to 2015, but he still sees spending there rising by mid-single digits.RBC projects that Vulcan's earnings per share will grow from $2.16 in 2015 to $3.41 this year, $4.51 in 2017 and $5.40 in 2018.""Our estimates over the next three years reflect our confidence in management's ability to execute against its profit enhancement plan, which should lead to strong incremental margin performance,"" Wetenhall said.IBD'S TAKE: Vulcan shares continue to climb after breaking out of a cup base in April. Shares have surged over the past week. Vulcan has a composite rating of 99, the highest possible rank among stocks. Earnings growth is expected to stay in triple digits for the June quarter.

132,MLM,"When President Obama signed a $305 billion highway bill into law last December, it was good news for Vulcan Materials (VMC).For one, it meant Vulcan stood to gain more than any other building materials company from the legislation. But it also was one of many signs that the provider of aggregates -- crushed stone, sand and gravel -- is now paving a path to prosperity, a year after it was losing money.Another positive sign came late last month, when Britain decided to exit the European Union. The move rattled global markets, but Vulcan was among a handful of stocks that stood up well during the selling frenzy. Showing strength, its stock dipped just 0.4% on June 24, while the Dow industrials fell 611 points.Chief Executive Tom Hill told analysts on a recent earnings call that several things have come together for the company, most notably a long-term housing recovery. There also has been better execution on customer deliveries, fixed-cost leveraging and lower costs of goods sold. Meanwhile, prices continue to migrate upward toward longer-term higher return on capital.Hill also said the housing recovery still has legs.""I want to emphasize that we continue to believe that the recovery in our markets still has a long way to go. Our business is in the midst of a long, gradual recovery in demand,"" he said. ""This is, to our way of thinking, a recovery with real staying power.""Vulcan is the nation's largest pure-play maker of aggregate building materials. Public works account for about 50% of construction materials spending, and the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act allocated funds for work on U.S. roads, bridges, public transit and rail transportation systems over the next five years.Of the remainder, commercial buildings account for 30% of construction materials spending, and housing makes up the final 20%. With incomes slowly rising and housing recovery steady, driven by low interest rates and unemployment, Vulcan's prospects are bright, according to BB&T Capital Markets analyst Adam Thalhimer.""When I talk to private aggregates companies, they point to Vulcan as the best-run company in the space. They are the most consistent,"" Thalhimer said in an interview with IBD.Thalhimer said it's really not a complicated business. Vulcan's sales are all domestic.""Their cash cow is turning big rocks into little rocks"" and selling them, he said. He has a buy rating on Vulcan with a 135 price target.Birmingham, Ala.-based Vulcan, also a major producer of aggregates-based construction materials such as asphalt and ready-mixed concrete, crushed profit estimates in its most recent quarter, reporting 26 cents fiscal-first-quarter earnings per share on May 3, swinging from a 16-cent loss in the same quarter a year earlier. That was more than triple the analyst consensus estimate of 7 cents a share.The company recorded a 20% hike in first-quarter revenue to $755 million, easily beating forecasts for $711 million, while gross profit climbed 112%.""It is certainly true that you can't extrapolate the full picture from a single quarter's results, but when you look at our results in the context of the last several quarters, you see very solid and improving fundamentals,"" Hill said on the May 3 call with analysts.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters call for earnings per share to climb 52% in the current quarter vs. the same quarter in 2015, to $1. Revenue is projected to grow 13% to $1.1 billion.Vulcan operates 315 sites that produce construction aggregates and more than 100 facilities that produce asphalt and/or concrete. It's costly to transport rocks and other construction materials, so Vulcan's nationwide quarry-to-construction-site reach gives it a defensible market position, according to D.A. Davidson analyst Brent Thielman.""It does come down to local domination,"" Thielman told IBD. ""You're not going to get outsiders in your end markets once you're in there and serving addressable areas,"" because it's just too costly for smaller companies to ship rocks long distances.Thielman has a neutral rating on Vulcan, based on its strong stock valuation, with a 115 price target.RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Wetenhall called out Vulcan in a June 17 client note as a top performer in its markets. Wetenhall noted that housing starts for the month of May increased by 9.5% to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 1.167 million units, topping estimates of 1.15 million.""From an investment standpoint, we remain confident that a healthy labor market will continue supporting a slow and steady recovery in the housing market,"" Wetenhall said. He has an outperform rating on Vulcan with a 114.08 price target.In February, Vulcan expanded its management team, including creating new positions. Stan Bass, who was a vice president with responsibility for the company's Western and Mountain West divisions, was named to the newly created post of chief growth officer.CEO Hill said in making the announcement that an executive growth officer was needed because ""our company is poised for a new era of strategic growth, building on our unparalleled positions in recovering and growing markets across the United States.""Additionally, former general counsel Michael Mills was named to the newly created chief administrative officer post. Former assistant counsel Jerry Perkins stepped up to the general counsel position. Brock Lodge, who previously was manager of Vulcan's Western division, including its strategic California operations, was promoted to president of that division.Although Vulcan is the 800-pound gorilla of construction aggregates in the U.S., it has competition. Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) is the other large, publicly traded aggregates supplier. But the Raleigh, N.C.-based company also sells specialty chemicals such as magnesia and has aggressively pursued the cement market.Like Vulcan, Martin Marietta boasts a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, meaning its stock has outperformed at least 99% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters.Large international companies also have a toehold in the U.S. market, including Ireland's CRH (CRH), the largest company in the building materials group, with nearly $26 billion annual sales vs. about $3.6 billion each for Vulcan and Martin Marietta. However, CRH also sells security gates and fencing, bricks, shutters, awnings and other items.It's a fragmented market, and large local aggregate materials suppliers also vie in some regional markets, though they're much smaller than Vulcan and Martin Marietta.Vulcan's stock price reached a new intraday high of 120.83 Thursday and matched it again on Friday, its highest point since June 2007, just before the start of the 2007-2009 recession. Shares ended trading on both days around 120, and shares were down slightly Tuesday after the holiday weekend to end the day at 119.66.

134,MLM,"Nothing taxes the soul like having to wait. The test can be double to an investor, for whom waiting can also risk missing a breakout and gaining entry to a winning run.So God invented handles.In stock charts, handles occur most commonly at the end of cup bases. They form less often on double-bottom and flat bases. But in nearly all cases, they offer an earlier entry into a rising stock.No matter the type of base, a handle must be at least five days long. Start counting on the first down day. Mark the buy point a dime above the highest intraday high etched along the handle structure. Note: This high mark sometimes appears on a day before the five-day handle count begins.In a cup base, the midpoint between the handle's highest and lowest price points must be higher than the midpoint between the highest and lowest points marking the left side of the cup. Handles that fail this test may still be usable, but carry added risk.A handle should also form above a stock's 10-week moving average. In the best handles, the price lows drift lower in declining volume. Upward wedging handles along the lows signal the weak underlying shareholders have not yet been shaken out, and the stock's supply-vs.-demand profile may not be ready for a market-leading run.Handles aren't perfect formations. It's good to keep in mind that if we look back over the past few years, the performance of some highly rated stocks that formed handles on flat and double-bottom bases was not stellar.The reason may have more to do with the fact that a stock had already made many bases. Plus, the bulk of recent double-bottom-with-handle breakouts occurred at or near market tops, or in stocks with further consolidating to do before breaking out into winning runs.A great stock will set up a new base. Take Apple (AAPL), which cleared a 208.10 buy point in a flat base with handle in December 2009 (see the accompanying chart). It immediately pulled back more than 8%. But it then formed a six-week cup and continued to carve its multiyear advance.TransDigm Group (TDG) topped a handle buy point of 108 in a seven-week flat base on April 12, 2012. The handle formed low in the base, and the breakout occurred in soft trade. But investors who bought at the handle buy point were rewarded, as the stock gained 31% by last month. (Check out MarketSmith, now part of IBD, to see TransDigm's historical charts.)Another example: Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), which cleared a flat base with handle at 90.52 on Nov. 29, 2012.Handles on some double-bottom bases have shown more dubious results. Bucyrus International staged a weak but ultimately successful breakout from a double-bottom-with-handle base in October 2007, before it was acquired by Caterpillar (CAT).MEMC Materials cleared a double bottom with handle in late October 2007. It rose briefly before slipping into a multiyear decline.Natural gas producer XTO (acquired by Exxon Mobil (XOM) in 2010) cleared a double-bottom-with-handle base in so-so trade in July 2006. The stock soon slipped into another base, which could have been read also as a double bottom with handle. XTO eventually mounted a 104% advance from its original double-bottom-with-handle buy point.(Editor's Note: This column originally published in the Feb. 6, 2013, edition of IBD. MEMC Materials acquired SunEdison in 2009 and changed its corporate name to the latter, but filed for bankruptcy in April 2016.)

143,MLM,"Stocks lost ground Wednesday, and the Nasdaq was once again rebuffed at its 50-day line.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 trimmed 1%. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1.2%, partly because of Home Depot's (HD) 2.5% dent. Volume in the stock market today rose on both major exchanges, according to preliminary data.From a stock chartist's viewpoint, action was bad. For the second consecutive day, the Nasdaq tried and failed to retake its 50-day moving average. Until the Nasdaq can turn that resistance into support, the uptrend isn't likely to make much progress.The IBD 50, a proxy for top-rated stocks, illustrated the lukewarm temperature of this uptrend. Hardly any stocks were moving up or down in strong volume. For example, fast-food chain Sonic (SONC) shed 4%, but volume was 20% below average.Constructive action, however, was evident among stocks that recently made good up moves. Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) lost 0.7% in fast trade, but this came after four up days in a row. Gains were 2% to 3% each day in much heavier volume than Wednesday's negative action.RV parts maker Drew Industries (DW) also showed positive action, even though it fell. The stock gapped up 9% Monday, and then added almost 2% Tuesday. Wednesday's 0.8% loss was puny by comparison.On Thursday, the Labor Department will release first-time jobless claims. The consensus view among analysts is 267,000, down about 2.5% from the previous week. The range of estimates runs from 263,000 to 275,000.

144,MLM,"Although one-third of First Trust Materials AlphaDEX ETF (FXZ) is in chemical companies, its most interesting stocks are smaller holdings in the building trades.It's in that batch that investors will find Masco (MAS), Watsco (WSO), Martin Marietta (MLM), Vulcan Materials (VMC) and other building-supply companies that have become among the best performing in the market today.Masco broke out past a 30.71 buy point in March and is near new highs after finding support at the 50-day moving average. The cabinetry maker's earnings growth ramped up 26%, 61% and 78% the past three quarters. Sales gains have been in single digits, however.Martin Marietta, a provider of asphalt, concrete and other aggregates, has surged more than 75% from its Feb. 9 low. Vulcan, another supplier to the heavy-construction industry, is at multiyear highs after an impressive climb since January. The two are growing thanks to the rise in home construction (April new home sales were at an eight-year high) and new funding for roads and bridges.Watsco has pulled back from its April high, but is holding on to most of its 2016 advance. Valspar (VAL) is another top holding, although the paint maker is being acquired by rival Sherwin-Williams. The stock soared to record highs in March on news of the deal and has been flat since then.Fastenal (FAST), a construction supply retailer, is 3.1% of the total fund. Shares are consolidating but trading below the 50-day moving average.At its core, First Trust Materials is a cyclical-stock play. Its major holdings include Dow Chemical (DOW), Steel Dynamics (STLD), fertilizer giant Mosaic (MOS) and paper producer Domtar (UFS). Although some major holdings are well off 52-week highs, it's not that they're all dogs. Dow and Steel Dynamics made big strides earlier in the year.One-third of the ETF is in chemical stocks, about 16% in mining and 15% in packaging. Building and construction companies make up a combined 18%, according to the fund's website.First Trust Materials tracks an enhanced index developed by NYSE Group that selects stocks from the Russell 1000 based on growth factors including three-, six- and 12-month price performance.

145,MLM,"LGI Homes (LGIH) reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter earnings Tuesday. Shares initially peeked out to a buy zone, but then reversed sharply as investors focused on the homebuilder's weaker-than-expected revenue. Meanwhile, decking products maker Trex (TREX) neared a breakout.LGI Homes' Q1 earnings per share minus one-time items rose 73% to 57 cents, topping estimates for 52 cents. Revenue grew 36% to $162.5 million as home closings grew 26% to 844 homes. But revenue was lighter than estimates for $167.8 million. Also gross profit margin was 26.7%, down a bit from 27.8% in Q1 2015.The Woodlands, Texas-based homebuilder's profit spike benefited from a 7% rise in its average home selling price to $192,491, largely on changes in product mix and a favorable pricing environment. “We continue to see strong demand for home ownership across the country,"" Chairman and CEO Eric Lipar said in a written statement.LGI Homes shares rose to 30.35 after the opening bell, moving above a 29.87 buy point intraday for a second straight day. But the stock reversed hard, crashing more than 13%. It's closed down 7.1% at 27.50 on the stock market today.Separately, Trex, the world's largest maker of wood-alternative decking and railing  products, said Q1 revenue grew 9% to $131.7 million, just above analyst consensus for $131.4 million. EPS jumped 42% to 78 cents, well above Wall Street's 65-cent target.But Trex guided Q2 revenue to rise 8% year-over-year to about $145 million, below consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $150.25 million.Trex kicked off a print and TV advertising campaign in early April that will increase costs this quarter, but the company hopes to gain market share from the wood decking and railing market.Trex shares shot up as high as 50 soon after the opening bell, close to a 50.72 buy point in a nine-month first stage cup-with-handle base. But they quickly reversed and closed down 4.45% at 44.04.Continental Building Products (CBPX), a leading maker of wallboard and gypsum products, shot up to a 7-month high intraday on strong earnings released late Monday. Continental Building Products rose as high as 22.11, closing up 8.85% to 21.41.Last week, building products firm Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and installation firm Installed Building Products (IBP) shot up to new highs on huge earnings growth. Martin Marietta Materials stock rose 3.1% while Installed Building Products advanced 0.9%.

Shares are extended from a 35.70 cup-with-handle buy point. Mizuho and Pacific Crest Securities raised their price targets on the stock. Activision on Thursday reported Q1 results that smashed views, helped by its King Digital acquisition and strong demand for its “Call of Duty: Black Ops III” game.Among recent IPOs, Square (SQ) gapped down and sank nearly 20% in heavy volume after reporting mixed Q1 results late Thursday.

"
150,MLM,"A major theme of this year’s presidential campaign is how candidates plan to improve the nation's employment picture, and one idea espoused by almost everyone from Donald Trump to Sen. Bernie Sanders is to create jobs through a massive program to improve the nation’s infrastructure.Much of the work will go toward rebuilding and upgrading highways, bridges, tunnels and rail lines. On the federal level, a transportation bill has passed allocating $305 billion to repair and expand highways, bridges and mass transit over the next five years. Many states and municipalities have also passed or proposed legislation to improve infrastructure.This is all good news for Vulcan Materials (VMC), which supplies aggregates -- rocks, gravel and sand to the layman -- as well as asphalt mix and ready-mix concrete to the paving and construction industries.The company’s stock price has been trading near multiyear highs this month, in part because of anticipation over how infrastructure projects will impact demand for its products. Many analysts reckon Vulcan shares can keep pushing higher in coming months.“Increased highway construction awards and an expansion of state (transportation) budgets could act as a catalyst for the stock,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Wetenhall wrote in a recent report to clients.Analyst Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson offers a similar view. ""It certainly doesn’t hurt that there’s federal support in terms of infrastructure projects. This creates enthusiasm for the stock,” Thielman told IBD.Vulcan has already gotten a lift from rebounding construction markets in the private sector, he says. With more spending on public works, the company stands to gain even more.“They’ve seen pretty solid growth on the volume side for their core aggregates product line, in conjunction with accelerating pricing throughout 2015,” Thielman said. “The main driver behind volume growth is strong construction industry fundamentals in the private sector, and now we’re seeing a little momentum developing on the public side.”On the private construction side, Vulcan and peers such as Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), Eagle Materials (EXP) and U.S. Concrete (USCR) have gotten a lift from a rebounding housing market in the U.S.Housing starts last year reached their highest level since 2007, according to the Census Bureau.Meanwhile, commercial construction -- where Vulcan gets most of its business -- has also picked up steam over the last year or so. Nonresidential construction spending “greatly exceeded” expectations in 2015, according to a survey from the American Institute of Architects (AIA), and should continue to see healthy growth over the next couple of years.Overall nonresidential construction spending is expected to grow 8.3% year-over-year in 2016, the AIA said, led by double-digit gains in the hotel, office and industrial sectors. Spending is seen rising another 6.7% in 2017.“While rising interest rates could pose a challenge to the U.S. economy, lower energy prices, improved employment figures and an enacted federal budget for 2016 are all factoring into a very favorable outlook for the construction industry,” AIA Chief Economist Kermit Baker said in a statement. “And after several years of challenging economic circumstances, the institutional project sector is finally on very solid footing.”These favorable trends are reflected in Vulcan’s recent financial performance. The company’s annual earnings in 2015 more than doubled from the prior year, and that was on top of an even bigger gain in 2014. Annual revenue grew 14% in 2015 -- the biggest increase in at least eight years.Vulcan earned 74 cents a share during the fourth quarter of 2015. That was up from 31 cents the previous year and well above consensus analyst estimates for 60 cents. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased by 830 basis points to 35.1%, led by increased profitability in the company’s aggregates segment.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Vulcan to grow full-year earnings by 51% in 2016 and by another 37% in 2017.“On the expense side, lower costs for diesel fuel and less spending on both repairs and maintenance and overtime labor contributed to a 3% year-over-year decline in aggregates unit costs,” Wetenhall noted. ""The combination of stronger volumes, higher selling prices and lower unit costs was the primary driver of strong incremental margin performance.”Fourth-quarter revenue grew 14% to $857.3 million, also above views, helped by higher prices. It was the fifth straight quarter of double-digit gains on the top line.Same-store shipments for the quarter climbed more than 8% in the company’s aggregates segment, 4% in its asphalt segment, and 2% in its concrete segment.For the full year, Vulcan shipped 178 million tons of aggregates, which was slightly above its mid-year forecast of 177 million tons and an increase of about 10% from 2014.“All in all, this was a very solid year of volume growth,” Chief Executive Tom Hill said on a fourth-quarter conference call with analysts. He expects even greater volume in coming years.“We are still early in the recovery towards 255 million tons, which we believe represents a more normal mid-cycle level of shipments,” Hill said on the call. “We have a broad base of demand, both in terms of geography and end-use markets. We see each of our end-use markets continuing to grow.”

345,MLM,"All built up with a game-changing buy, Martin Marietta Materials has laid the groundwork for a healthy growth spurt amid upbeat prospects for its end markets in construction materials.
"

"
347,MLM,"The company, which is highly rated by IBD, gave its business a nice jolt when it acquired Texas Industries in July. As a stand-alone entity, TXI, as it is called, was the largest producer of cement in Texas and a major cement producer in California. It was also a top supplier of construction aggregate, ready-mix concrete and concrete products.
"
348,MLM,"TXI's shareholders received 0.70 Martin Marietta share for each share of TXI common stock. The transaction is valued at about $2.7 billion, including the assumption of $0.7 billion of TXI debt.
"
349,MLM,"The deal created a leading supplier of aggregate products and heavy building materials and vaulted Martin Marietta's position in its markets in various ways, the company says.
"
350,MLM,"Martin Marietta became the nation's largest producer of construction aggregates and the largest producer of cement in Texas. The buy also increased Martin Marietta's presence in the Southwest, with cement production facilities concentrated primarily in Texas and California, two of the largest and fastest growing markets for construction materials in the U.S.
"
351,MLM,"'Transformational' Acquisition
"
352,MLM,"Stephens analyst Trey Grooms describes the the TXI buyout as ""transformational.""
"
353,MLM,"He says prior to the buy Martin Marietta was primarily an aggregate company in stone, gravel and sand.
"
354,MLM,"""The TXI acquisition got them into more downstream integration in concrete and asphalt, and it also got them into cement in a big way,"" he told IBD.
"
355,MLM,"Martin Marietta is now the No. 1 producer of cement in Texas, Grooms adds, and the TXI acquisition got the company into that leading position.
"
356,MLM,"With TXI in the mix, Texas is Martin Marietta's largest market, Grooms says. He estimates it now represents about 35% of the company's annual sales vs. about 20% prior to the buy.
"
357,MLM,"The buy has given Martin Marietta a lift in revenue and profit as well as generating cost synergies.
"
358,MLM,"Martin Marietta showed just how beneficial the TXI buy has been when it posted impressive fourth-quarter results on Feb. 10.
"
359,MLM,"The company's adjusted Q4 earnings rose 27% to 99 cents a share, handily topping analyst views for 82 cents in a poll by Thomson Reuters. Total revenue leapt 57% to $856.3 million.
"
360,MLM,"Consolidated net sales increased 59% to $779.5 million, well ahead of forecasts for $772.78 million.
"
361,MLM,"""Our strong foundation, bolstered by the acquisition of (TXI), has us well-positioned to continue delivering increased shareholder value as we serve the rising demand for building materials,"" said CEO Ward Nye in a statement.
"
362,MLM,"TXI-related realized synergies accelerated in the fourth quarter, making the transaction accretive for the year, said Nye. The company expects to achieve annual synergies of $100 million by 2016 resulting from the TXI buy, more than 40% greater than its previous guidance.
"
363,MLM,"For the second half of 2014, the company achieved synergies of $27 million, 50% higher than original expectations.
"
364,MLM,"""They reported a beat across the board, primarily driven by higher aggregates gross margins and better synergies from the TXI deal,"" Grooms said.
"
365,MLM,"He says the growth in the quarter was driven by an increase in Martin Marietta's heritage, or legacy, aggregates volume of 7.6% vs. a year earlier. Legacy aggregates' pricing was up 6%. He says cement pricing increased by 16%, primarily driven by price increases put in place in Texas.
"
366,MLM,"""In the fourth quarter, they showed they are delivering on some of the promises they made (about the TXI acquisition),"" D.A. Davidson & Co. analyst Brent Thielman told IBD. ""To the extent they said it's going to be accretive in the first year, they achieved it in the (fourth) quarter.""
"
367,MLM,"Share Buybacks
"
368,MLM,"In reporting results, the company announced it has authorized a new share repurchase program under which it may acquire up to 20 million shares of its outstanding common stock. The authorization includes the 5 million shares authorized under the company's previous repurchase program.

"
373,MLM,"""Their bullishness around pricing, their optimistic outlook for demand in Texas, and good guidance (in the fourth-quarter report) is what drove the stock up. The announced stock repurchase is another primary driver for the stock-price recovery.""
"
374,MLM,"Thielman adds that one of the concerns heading into the quarter was the decline in oil prices, which ""raised some fears"" about what would happen to the company in the Texas market.
"
375,MLM,"""They showed in the quarter that they see fairly good visibility in that market,"" he said. ""That doesn't eliminate the risk down the road if oil prices stay low.""
"
376,MLM,"Also in the fourth quarter, the company showed that the TXI integration process is going well, he adds, and ""there seems to be opportunities in front of them.""
"
377,MLM,"Analysts expect 2015 earnings to jump 39% to $5.20 a share. They see a 36% gain in 2016 and a 40% increase in 2017.

378,MLM,"Construction Tailwinds
"
379,MLM,"""We're starting to see some more volume momentum in the aggregates business, and there are some construction market tailwinds within the company that are helping drive better profitability,"" Thielman said.
"
380,MLM,"The tailwinds, he adds, include the start of more nonresidential construction activity such as building roads and highways, which is a ""significant driver of heavy-materials demand.""
"
381,MLM,"In giving its 2015 outlook, Martin Marietta management noted positive trends in its business and markets: Nonresidential construction is expected to increase in both the heavy industrial and commercial sectors, the company said, noting the Dodge Momentum Index is at its highest level since 2009 and ""signals continued growth.""
"
382,MLM,"""Residential construction is expected to continue to grow, driven by historically low levels of construction activity over the previous several years, employment gains, low mortgage rates, significant lot absorption, higher multifamily rental rates and rising housing prices,"" the company said.

"
384,MLM,"After getting a nice boost from the ongoing recovery in homebuilding demand, Eagle Materials is primed to tap into America's oil and natural gas exploration boom.
"
385,MLM,"Eagle (EXP) provides basic building products used in residential, industrial, commercial and infrastructure construction. Its lineup includes gypsum wallboard and recycled paperboard, which sell mainly to the housing market. It also makes aggregates, concrete and cement, including specialty cement used in oil and natural gas wells.
"
386,MLM,"Another offering that Eagle has recently added to the mix — an important one — is frac sand. It's a crush-resistant sand that drilling companies use in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to get oil or natural gas out of the ground.
"
387,MLM,"The Dallas company has delivered a long winning streak, buoyed by the housing market recovery that has led to strong demand for products such as wallboard and cement, and price increases along the way. Earnings have climbed by at least double-digit percentages in all but one of the past 11 quarters.
"
388,MLM,"Foray Into Fracking Sand
"
389,MLM,"Newly added to its lineup, frac sand may spur more growth.
"
390,MLM,"Frac sand is a so-called proppant used in the hydraulic fracturing process to help get oil and natural gas from rocky areas such as shale. In fracking, liquids are injected into the ground to make space for underlying oil or natural gas to flow through. Proppants are solids used to prop the space open during or after fracking.
"
391,MLM,"Last year, Eagle completed a facility in Corpus Christi, Texas, to produce frac sand, and in fiscal 2015's first quarter, which ended June 30, it received the final permit needed to start operating its frac-sand mine in Utica, Ill. During the quarter, Eagle continued to process and sell purchased sand in Corpus Christi awaiting the opening of the mine in Illinois.
"
392,MLM,"With the receipt of the final permit necessary to start up its mine, Eagle expects to be able to sell its sand through its Corpus Christi facility no later than the fiscal third quarter, primarily into Eagle Ford shale-drilling applications. The Eagle Ford shale formation is in South Texas.
"
393,MLM,"D.A. Davidson analyst Brent Thielman is upbeat about Eagle's prospects in oil and gas proppants, which Eagle started to report as a separate operating segment beginning in fiscal 2015.
"
394,MLM,"""They've talked about this business being as large as their cement or wallboard business,"" he said. ""It will take a few years to get there, but over time, it will be a third leg to the stool. That's the key message. They truly believe it will be a meaningful platform for them. The growth opportunity is pretty significant.""
"
395,MLM,"On the first-quarter conference call, Eagle CEO Steven Rowley said that the new Oil and Gas Proppants segment ""will be increasing in importance in coming years.""
"
396,MLM,"He also noted that he expects the frac-sand business to ""become a material contributor to Eagle's cash flow by the end of this fiscal year.""
"
397,MLM,"Adds Thielman: ""For the immediate (second) quarter, I don't expect tremendous momentum for the proppants business. In the second half, it will become a more meaningful contributor.""
"
398,MLM,"Drillers Spur Demand
"
399,MLM,"The nation's shale boom has caused a surge in demand for frac sand. In addition to Eagle, other frac sand producers include U.S. Silica (SLCA) and Hi-Crush Partners (HCLP).
"
400,MLM,"Thielman says the demand for frac sand is strong and the growth profiles of the companies that produce it are ""pretty significant.""
"
401,MLM,"Meanwhile, Eagle continues to enjoy a nice lift from an uptick in homebuilding demand.
"
402,MLM,"The company is the fifth largest by market cap of nine in IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates industry group, after Cemex (CX), CRH (CRH), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC). The group ranks No. 134 of 197 tracked, and Eagle stock is up 34% so far this year.
"
403,MLM,"Eagle's first-quarter earnings rose 25% from a year earlier to 75 cents a share. Revenue increased 17% to $266.3 million. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see full-year fiscal 2015 earnings rising 49% to $3.72 a share. They expect a 45% increase in fiscal 2016.
"
404,MLM,"Improved prices in all businesses helped first-quarter sales.
"
405,MLM,"The results ""reflect improving, early-cycle construction fundamentals in the U.S.,"" the company said in a press release.
"
406,MLM,"""Their building-products business looks pretty brisk, and they feel pretty optimistic heading into the second half of the calendar year,"" Thielman said.
"
407,MLM,"Eagle's wallboard business has done well year-to-date with good volume growth, he adds. He says that business is benefiting from being concentrated in some relatively strong housing markets, citing Texas and Colorado in particular.
"
408,MLM,"""The primary drivers"" of the first-quarter earnings gain were increased wallboard and paperboard sales volumes, the company said.
"
409,MLM,"The wallboard and paperboard segment's operating earnings climbed 27% from a year earlier to $45 million in the first quarter. Revenue rose 18% to $136.1 million, helped by an 11% rise in gypsum wallboard prices.
"
410,MLM,"Operating earnings from Eagle's cement business were up 8% to $20.5 million. Average sales prices rose 5% from a year earlier, though they were partially offset by $5.2 million in costs related to a shift to the first quarter of the annual maintenance outages at its Kansas City, Mo. and Tulsa, Okla., facilities.
"
411,MLM,"Cement revenue increased 9% to $127.9 million.
"
412,MLM,"""The macro environment is good for (Eagle),"" said Stephen Melman, director of economic services for the National Association of Home Builders. ""The future looks bright, and the demand for its products will go up. They're in the right business now.""
"
413,MLM,"Homebuilding Outlook Mixed
"
414,MLM,"While homebuilding has rebounded from its slump after the U.S. housing market crashed, it hasn't reached anywhere near the high levels of the housing boom.
"
415,MLM,"Single-family starts peaked in 2005, reaching 1.7 million that year, according to the NAHB. In the wake of harsh weather patterns in the first quarter of 2014 that slowed construction demand, the NAHB expects this year to end with 649,000 single-family housing starts, up just 4.5% from a year earlier. But it forecasts that single-family housing starts will rise 34.8% to 875,000 in 2015. It sees a 34% gain in 2016 to 1.173 million.
"
416,MLM,"Melman says demand is strong for Eagle's gypsum wallboard and should stay there, though its margins could possibly get ""squeezed a little if it can't get price increases.""
"
417,MLM,"One gauge of the homebuilding outlook is the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index.
"
418,MLM,"Builder confidence in the market for newly built, single-family homes rose two points to 55 on the index for August. This third consecutive monthly gain brings the index to its highest level since January.
"
419,MLM,"""Each of the three components of the index registered consecutive gains for the past three months, which is a positive sign that builder confidence appears to be firming following an uneven spring,"" said NAHB Chief Economist David Crowe in a statement. ""Factors contributing to this rise include sustained job growth, historically low mortgage rates and affordable home prices, which are helping to unleash pent-up demand.""After getting a nice boost from the ongoing recovery in homebuilding demand, Eagle Materials is primed to tap into America's oil and natural gas exploration boom.Eagle (EXP) provides basic building products used in residential, industrial, commercial and infrastructure construction.

During the quarter, Eagle continued to process and sell purchased sand in Corpus Christi awaiting the opening of the mine in Illinois.With the receipt of the final permit necessary to start up its mine, Eagle expects to be able to sell its sand through its Corpus Christi facility no later than the fiscal third quarter, primarily into Eagle Ford shale-drilling applications. The Eagle Ford shale formation is in South Texas.D.A. Davidson analyst Brent Thielman is upbeat about Eagle's prospects in oil and gas proppants, which Eagle started to report as a separate operating segment beginning in fiscal 2015.""They've talked about this business being as large as their cement or wallboard business,"" he said. ""It will take a few years to get there, but over time, it will be a third leg to the stool. That's the key message. They truly believe it will be a meaningful platform for them. The growth opportunity is pretty significant.""On the first-quarter conference call, Eagle CEO Steven Rowley said that the new Oil and Gas Proppants segment ""will be increasing in importance in coming years.""He also noted that he expects the frac-sand business to ""become a material contributor to Eagle's cash flow by the end of this fiscal year.""Adds Thielman: ""For the immediate (second) quarter, I don't expect tremendous momentum for the proppants business. In the second half, it will become a more meaningful contributor.""Drillers Spur DemandThe nation's shale boom has caused a surge in demand for frac sand. In addition to Eagle, other frac sand producers include U.S. Silica (SLCA) and Hi-Crush Partners (HCLP).Thielman says the demand for frac sand is strong and the growth profiles of the companies that produce it are ""pretty significant.""Meanwhile, Eagle continues to enjoy a nice lift from an uptick in homebuilding demand.The company is the fifth largest by market cap of nine in IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates industry group, after Cemex (CX), CRH (CRH), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC). The group ranks No. 134 of 197 tracked, and Eagle stock is up 34% so far this year.Eagle's first-quarter earnings rose 25% from a year earlier to 75 cents a share. Revenue increased 17% to $266.3 million. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see full-year fiscal 2015 earnings rising 49% to $3.72 a share. They expect a 45% increase in fiscal 2016.Improved prices in all businesses helped first-quarter sales.The results ""reflect improving, early-cycle construction fundamentals in the U.S.,"" the company said in a press release.""Their building-products business looks pretty brisk, and they feel pretty optimistic heading into the second half of the calendar year,"" Thielman said.Eagle's wallboard business has done well year-to-date with good volume growth, he adds. He says that business is benefiting from being concentrated in some relatively strong housing markets, citing Texas and Colorado in particular.""The primary drivers"" of the first-quarter earnings gain were increased wallboard and paperboard sales volumes, the company said.The wallboard and paperboard segment's operating earnings climbed 27% from a year earlier to $45 million in the first quarter. Revenue rose 18% to $136.1 million, helped by an 11% rise in gypsum wallboard prices.Operating earnings from Eagle's cement business were up 8% to $20.5 million. Average sales prices rose 5% from a year earlier, though they were partially offset by $5.2 million in costs related to a shift to the first quarter of the annual maintenance outages at its Kansas City, Mo. and Tulsa, Okla., facilities.Cement revenue increased 9% to $127.9 million.""The macro environment is good for (Eagle),"" said Stephen Melman, director of economic services for the National Association of Home Builders. ""The future looks bright, and the demand for its products will go up. They're in the right business now.""Homebuilding Outlook MixedWhile homebuilding has rebounded from its slump after the U.S. housing market crashed, it hasn't reached anywhere near the high levels of the housing boom.Single-family starts peaked in 2005, reaching 1.7 million that year, according to the NAHB. In the wake of harsh weather patterns in the first quarter of 2014 that slowed construction demand, the NAHB expects this year to end with 649,000 single-family housing starts, up just 4.5% from a year earlier. But it forecasts that single-family housing starts will rise 34.8% to 875,000 in 2015. It sees a 34% gain in 2016 to 1.173 million.Melman says demand is strong for Eagle's gypsum wallboard and should stay there, though its margins could possibly get ""squeezed a little if it can't get price increases.""One gauge of the homebuilding outlook is the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index.Builder confidence in the market for newly built, single-family homes rose two points to 55 on the index for August. This third consecutive monthly gain brings the index to its highest level since January.""Each of the three components of the index registered consecutive gains for the past three months, which is a positive sign that builder confidence appears to be firming following an uneven spring,"" said NAHB Chief Economist David Crowe in a statement. ""Factors contributing to this rise include sustained job growth, historically low mortgage rates and affordable home prices, which are helping to unleash pent-up demand.""

421,MLM,"Robust gains from home building investments, strong economic growth and recent tax reforms are working in favor of the construction sector. Moreover, modest wage growth, low unemployment and positive consumer confidence are positives. Also, President Trump’s promise to double economic growth through a stimulus program that includes tax cuts, deregulation and higher infrastructure spending are likely to keep the sector on a growth trajectory.Notably, per the latest U.S. Census Bureau report, construction spending in March dropped 1.7% from the previous month. However, for the first three months of 2018, the metric increased 5.5% from the year-ago period.Importantly, political and economic uncertainties continue to affect the sector. One such obstacle is the recent imposition of tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. An increase in import tariff will escalate raw material cost for builders, which are grappling with increased cost, thanks to the imposition of lumber tariff. This along with high cost of land and labor as well as mortgage rate hikes raises concern.The implications of the metal tariffs and mortgage hike are yet to be felt in the sector that has occupied the third position out of 16 sectors based on the Zacks classification. Notably, a sector with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) stocks will have a better average than the rest.Q1 EarningsThe first-quarter earnings season is well past the halfway mark, with earnings and revenue growth set to reach highest level in the last seven years.

In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 32.4%.However, Martin Marietta has a dismal history, at least in terms of bottom-line performance.

Well, the obvious question that arises is whether Martin Marietta will be able to beat earnings in the quarter to be reported.Let us delve into the factors that are likely to affect Martin Marietta’s first-quarter 2018 earnings.Adverse weather conditions in many markets might mar Martin Marietta’s results in the to-be-reported quarter. Weather-related risks have been affecting the company’s performance, thanks to the exterior nature of the business, in spite of improving economic conditions, cost management and enhanced operational efficiency.  The first and fourth quarters are most affected by winter. Hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast are prevalent during these periods.Nevertheless, string of acquisitions, divestitures and an uptick in private construction activity are expected to provide some cushion to revenues and earnings.

Hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast are most active during these quarters. Also, Martin Marietta has been grappling with weak volumes since 2016 due to labor constraints and delays in large projects.Nonetheless, the company is well positioned on its solid exposure in states like Texas, Colorado, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina in the South East and the West. Also, state/local municipal level initiatives to finance infrastructure projects should drive construction of highways, streets, roads, and bridges, thereby boosting aggregates demand.

428,MLM,"Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (MLM  -  Free Report) has witnessed a dismal price trend so far in 2017. The company’s shares have lost 5% as against the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates Industry's growth of 0.1%. Also, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock has underperformed the industry in each of 4-week, 12-week and 52-week time frames.Abnormal weather conditions in many markets are affecting Martin Marietta’s operations. The company’s businesses are subject to weather-related risks that can significantly affect production schedules and profits. Excessive rainfall, flooding or severe drought can jeopardize shipments, production and operations in all markets. The first and fourth quarters are most affected by winter. Hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast is most active during the third and fourth quarters.The recent hurricanes — Harvey and Irma — disrupted the company’s operations, caused short-term dislocations and work stoppages in August and September.During the third quarter, volume growth in the Mid-America Group was affected by heavy precipitation while Southeast Group’s shipments were unaffected. Volumes also declined due to  project delays. Infrastructure volume growth declined during the quarter due to weather-related woes and delay in ongoing projects.  Let’s take a look at some more factors affecting the stock.Earnings Miss and Downward Estimate Revisions: The company’s lackluster bottom-line performance in the last reported quarters disappointed investors. Earnings of $2.39 missed estimates by 4%. Moreover, the company lagged estimates in the last four quarters with an average miss of 2.01%.Again, Martin Marietta has witnessed current-quarter earnings estimates decline 17.3% over the past 60 days, on the back of two downward revisions against none upwards. The same for the current year fell 5.3% due to three downward revisions versus none in the opposite direction. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings is expected to grow 4%, less than the industry’s projected growth of 12%. Also, earnings estimates for 2018 declined 7.6% in the same time frame.Guidance Cut: The company expects net sales in the range of $3.64-$3.74 billion, lower than the previous range of $3.75-$3.95 billion. Aggregates Product line net sales are projected in the range of $2.1-$2.16 billion (lower than the previous range of $2.2-$2.3 billion). Aggregates product line volume is expected in the range of -1-1%, down from the previous expectation of 4-5.5%.Cement Product Line net sales are estimated in the range of $365-$375 million, down from the previous range of $380-$400 million. Ready Mixed Concrete and Asphalt/Paving Product Lines net sales are projected in the band of $1.27-$1.31 billion compared with the prior guidance of $1.3-$1.4 billion.Overvalued Compared to Peers: Martin Marietta has a Value Style Score of D, pushing it into the bottom 40% of all stocks we cover from this perspective.Looking at the company’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, the company currently has a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 30.7, higher than the S&P 500 index’s average of 21.4x. Also, the stock is relatively overvalued compared with its peers as the industry average is pegged at 23.9x.Looking at the company’s sales, the company currently trades at a Price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.3, higher than the industry average of 1.1. Some prefer this metric more than other value-focused ones because sales are harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.An often overlooked ratio is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn’t take amortization and depreciation into consideration, but can give a more accurate picture of the financial health of a business. Martin Marietta has a P/CF of 18.3, higher than the industry’s average of 10.7.All these ratios show that the company is overvalued compared with industry peers and thus it not a good time to place a bet on the stock.Negative Industry Outlook: The industry has underperformed the broader market over a year. Currently, the industry ranks among the bottom 8% (243 out of 265 industries). Along with dismal performance of the industry in the past, a poor rank signals that the stock is likely to be affected by unfavorable broader factors in the immediate future.Moreover, tightened labor markets, in both the public and private sectors has led to project delays and hinder significant growth in construction activity. Martin Marietta blames the state departments of transportation of being understaffed, which is limiting the number of new projects stemming from the additional infrastructure funding provided by the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, or FAST Act and other state and local initiatives.Therefore, similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. As both the share price and estimates are falling for Martin Marietta, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Construction sector are Patrick Industries, Inc. (PATK  -  Free Report), United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) and Armstrong World Industries Inc (AWI  -  Free Report). All three companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

430,MLM,"U.S. homebuilders’ confidence slipped in September, as two devastating hurricanes — Harvey and Irma — brewed uncertainty for builders.The National Association of Home Builders or NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI), which measures confidence in the market for new single-family home, dropped to 64 this month, from a downwardly revised 67 in August.Hurricane Harvey hit Texas and Louisiana in late August, and Irma lashed Florida in early September. Economists are of the opinion that shortage of skilled construction labor is expected to worsen following the two devastating storms and rebuilding operations are likely to drive construction costs higher causing delays. The construction sector was already witnessing a labor shortage, which has worsened post the hurricanes.All three HMI components fell in September. A measure of current sales conditions for single-family homes dropped four points to 70, while the index depicting sales expectations over the next six months slid four points to 73. Meanwhile, the component measuring buyer traffic edged down one point to 47.Undoubtedly, sales tumbled this summer, reflecting the inventory shortage prevailing in the U.S. real estate market.  This has shot up average home prices nationwide. Investors should note that housing starts, permits and completions dropped 4.8%, 4.1% and 6.2%, respectively, in July. New U.S. single-family home sales also unexpectedly fell 9.4% in July, the lowest level since December 2016. August new-home sales readings are due out next week (Sep 26, 2017).Reaffirming Positive OutlookSeptember readings gauging builders' view on sales over the next six months slipped from August. However, homebuilders' overall vision of the new-home market remains positive.The housing market is expected to gradually recover throughout the rest of the year, banking on solid ongoing job market, economic growth and rising consumer confidence. New home sales figure has been higher compared with last year, reflecting strong demand for homes as the economy continues to create jobs.Against such a backdrop, homebuilders with strong fundamentals are cashing in on higher demand and favorable dynamics, partially offsetting the ongoing challenges of the industry comprising land and labor shortages and rising material prices.However, a number of companies have been losing grounds in recent times and it would be wise for investors to reshuffle their portfolio and get rid of stocks that may hurt returns.5 Names to Stay Away From  Selecting weak stocks and dumping them from your portfolio is a daunting task, as there are names aplenty.

432,MLM,"Hurricane Harvey continues to devastate the Gulf, with many lives lost and thousands rendered homeless. Houston, the fourth largest city in the United States, is flooded receiving more than 50 inches of rain, as per National Weather Service. Goldman Sachs economists estimate $30 billion in property damages due to Harvey, while JPMorgan ranks Harvey among the top ten costliest storms the country has faced.Around 30,000-40,000 houses have been hit by the hurricane. Keeping the tragedy aside, such disasters might prove to be a boon for companies in the building materials/ products space, with homeowners trying to repair the damaged homes.Historically, building product companies like Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.

Shares of Vulcan surged 7.7%, Martin Marietta jumped 9.3%, while Summit Materials (SUM  -  Free Report) increased 9.2% since Harvey wreaked havoc on Aug 25.

433,MLM,"Shares of Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) rose on Monday after a BMO Capital Markets analyst upgraded the construction equipment giant, just one day before it reports its second-quarter financial results.BMO’s Joel Tiss said in a note to clients on Monday that he expects Caterpillar will be positively impacted by a surge in global construction, among other optimistic factors. Tiss raised his price target from $110 to $125 per share.Caterpillar’s stock is up 1.43% through afternoon trading, and it peaked just $1.50 below its 52-week high earlier today. The company is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and scored an A for Momentum in our Style Scores system.“A strong rebound in demand is likely a 2018 occurrence at the earliest, and the stock has historically jumped in earnest 9-12 months in advance of a cyclical pickup,” Tiss wrote in a note to clients. “If this pattern repeats, the shares could trade to our upside scenario.”According to MarketWatch, the BMO analyst also noted that he thinks shares of Caterpillar could “trade at a valuation that yields a long-term upside target for the shares in the range of $208 to $224.” If Caterpillar were able to double its stock price in the relatively near future, it would be an impressive move for a company with a market cap of $62.79 billion.Tiss noted three major reasons why he raised his Caterpillar price target. The first factor was the possibility of a global recovery in the construction industry.On top of that, the analyst pointed to Caterpillar’s push to cut cost and focus on profitability going forward. The company’s new CEO Jim Umpleby, who officially took over from former CEO Doug Oberhelman on January 1, is said to be driving this new cost-cutting initiative with a focus on making the company profitable for investors.Other Construction Stocks Caterpillar’s big upgrade on Monday has helped other companies in the infrastructure and construction industry.Shares of infrastructure company MasTec, Inc. (MTZ  -  Free Report), which operates heavily in the telecommunications sector, rose 2.65% through afternoon trading. The company reached just $0.40 below its 52-week high earlier today.Vulcan Materials Company (VMC  -  Free Report) and Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (MLM  -  Free Report) were both up marginally in afternoon trading. Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report), which works primarily with the oil, gas, and electrical industries, climbed 1.69%.However, some of the bigger infrastructure ETFs have not felt a boost from Caterpillar’s upgrade. iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB  -  Free Report), SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB  -  Free Report), and PowerShares Dynamic Building & Const ETF (PKB  -  Free Report) were all down marginally in afternoon trading.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

436,MLM,"Last night’s debate was awkwardly entertaining. I must admit I was cringing and laughing as the two candidates went after each other. However, my focus was on the futures markets as I expected the market to move during the debate. While most people around the world watched their TVs, I was watching my trading monitors for an indication on which candidate won.Going into the debate, it was widely accepted by traders that if Trump continued his momentum after last night, it would be a negative for the markets. It’s not that the markets don’t like Donald Trump, they just don’t like the uncertainty that he brings. Mr. Trump’s push in the polls over the last week was attributed to the recent sell off in the market. A debate win could have put him in the lead and done some serious damage to the markets.The verdict is in before the polls: Clinton WonRather then analyze what the candidates said, let’s take a look at how futures markets reacted as the debate went on. Before the debates, I watched four different futures contracts to give me clues to who was winning: Gold, S&P 500, VIX, and the Mexican Peso. The thought was, if Trump won the debate, markets would go lower and fear would rise (VIX, Gold).S&P Futures- The main indicator of the markets, the S&P futures, were actually trading down about 0.40% before the debate. However, after an hour into the debate markets turned 0.50% higher as Clinton seemed to be winning.Gold Futures- Since last Wednesday, gold was up 2%. This was a combination of the Fed holding off on rates and Trumps momentum. I was watching for a spike with a Trump win, but when Trump started to struggle, gold sold off.VIX Futures – The fear gauge is always a great indicator to look at during big trading events. Before the debate, VIX futures were trading at 16.50, but fell 2% during the debate, to under 16. If the polls stay tight volatility will stay elevated, but if Clinton takes back a big lead, expect the VIX to get smashed.Mexican Peso- Trump policies would damage the Mexican economy and its currency. As Trump gained momentum, the Peso weakened. Last night, the Peso charged almost 2% higher during the debate, a sign that Clinton had won.Stocks that will benefitThere wasn’t much substance to what was discussed, which makes it very difficult to determine what actually might get done once in the White House. Since Clinton won the debate, let’s focus on stocks that will benefit if she wins the election. These stocks could take off today and continue to rise over the next month as a Clinton victory becomes more certain.The three stocks listed below are all Zacks Ranked #3 (Hold). A Clinton victory might force analysts to revise estimates higher so keep an eye on the rank for any improvements.InfrastructureClinton wants to improve the nations crumbling infrastructure, so it’s wise to go with a known name that deals in the construction of highways and infrastructure.  Martin Marietta Materials (MLM  -  Free Report) will be an important supplier of the aggregates used to build the roads and bridges that will be included in her budget plan.Alternative EnergyClinton’s move off of fossil fuels and into renewable alternative energies makes the solar sector appealing. The Guggenheim Solar ETF (TAN  -  Free Report) should move higher with a Democrat victory.  Clinton’s goal to have renewable electricity in every home within 10 years makes First Solar (FSLR  -  Free Report) very attractive at current valuation levels. HealthcareClinton would expand Obamacare if elected, allowing more visits before deductibles and tax credits for out-of-pocket expenses.Hospitals would profit with an expansion of Obamacare as more people would be encouraged to get care when it’s needed.HCA Holdings (HCA  -  Free Report) operates 164 hospitals and 116 freestanding surgery centers that would benefit.In SummaryBy no means is the election over. There are still two more debates and plenty of time until Election Day. Be aware of the market indicators listed above to give insight into which candidate might be improving in the polls. Use these indicators to allocate funds into stocks that will benefit from that candidate winning the White House.It should be noted that since last night, futures have given back debate gains due to Europe banking fears. While the election is a powerful force in market direction, other issues might temporary stall that direction. The Peso has held on to most of its gains, telling us that other forces then the debate were at work on the selling this morning.Note: Want more articles from this author?

The addition of Bluegrass fortified Martin Marietta’s aggregates position in the high-growth regions of Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic.

445,MLM,"The Q3 earnings season is in full swing, with 54% of the S&P 500 members having reported their results. Per the Earnings Preview  dated Oct 27, approximately 75.7% surpassed earnings, while 66.2% beat revenues. Notably, earnings for these companies have risen 8.7% from the same period last year, with 6.7% revenue growth.For the third quarter, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are projected to grow 5.4% year over year on 5.5% rise in revenues.A Look at the Construction SectorThe overall outlook for the construction market is positive. Factors like an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels and positive consumer sentiments raise optimism over the sector’s performance. Total third-quarter earnings for the construction sector are projected to increase 9% year over year on 10.1% growth in revenues.Historically, the building product industry within the construction sector has been facing the brunt of abnormally wet weather conditions, which have jeopardized shipments, production and profits. The recent hurricanes are also likely to cause shipment delays in the short term. Nevertheless, demand for building materials for the repair of damaged properties is expected to somewhat offset the initial concerns regarding business delays, boosting the top line for these companies.Again, the U.S. construction market in 2017 is expected to get a boost if, as announced, the Trump administration invests heavily in infrastructure. Particularly, Trump’s plans to boost infrastructure by rebuilding highways along with bridges, tunnels, airports, schools and hospitals have brought building product stocks under the limelight.Building Product Stocks Reporting on Nov 2Two building product companies — Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (MLM  -  Free Report) and Vulcan Materials Company (VMC  -  Free Report) — are set to report third-quarter results on Nov 1, before market opens. Let's see how things are shaping up for their announcements.Martin Marietta’s prospects have been getting marred by weak volumes since 2016 due to labor constraints and delays in large projects. Weather-related risks have been affecting the company’s performance due to the exterior nature of its business despite improving economic conditions, cost management and enhanced operational efficiency. Meanwhile, hurricanes Harvey and Irma are expected to weigh on its second-half 2017 results as Martin Marietta generates 39% of its sales from Texas and Florida. The impact of the hurricanes is likely to lead to weak volumes, negative price/mix along with higher operating costs.Nonetheless, the company’s string of acquisitions, divestitures and an uptick in private and public construction activity are encouraging. Sustained growth in construction activity drives demand for the aggregates and cement businesses of the company. This is expected to drive results in the to-be-reported quarter.Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.47, reflecting a 0.8% year-over-year decline. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.06 billion, reflecting 2.3% growth.Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for the company this quarter, as Martin Marietta does not have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher.Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3, combined with a positive Earnings ESP, have higher chances of beating earnings estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The company carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of -1.62%. Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.

Price and EPS Surprise | Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. QuoteVulcan Materials is susceptible to bad weather conditions as most of its products are used outdoors in the public or private construction industry. Also, the company’s production and distribution facilities are located in the open. Inclement weather conditions affect the company’s ability to produce and distribute products as well as demand.Aggregates shipments declined 2% in the first six months of 2017 owing to adverse weather conditions. The recent hurricanes will likely cause shipment delays in the third quarter. Nevertheless, increased demand for building materials for the repair of damaged properties will likely offset the initial concerns regarding business delays. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for aggregates shipments is pegged at 50, 776 tons for the third quarter, up 1% year over year.For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 93 cents, reflecting a decline of 7.7% year over year, while that for revenues stands at $1.06 billion, up 4.7% year over year.Meanwhile, our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Vulcan this quarter as it has an Earnings ESP of -7.19%  and a Zacks Rank #5.

446,MLM,"Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (MLM  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2, before market open.Martin Marietta’s prospects are getting marred by weak volumes since 2016 due to labor constraints and delays on large projects. Importantly, weather-related risks have been negatively impacting the company’s performance due to the exterior nature of the business despite improving economic conditions, cost management and enhanced operational efficiency.  Meanwhile, recent hurricanes, Harvey and Irma, will weigh on its third quarter results as Martin Marietta has significant exposure in Texas and Florida, generating 39% of its sales. The company’s results are likely to get affected by weak volumes, negative price/mix along with higher operating costs due to the hurricanes.Nonetheless, the company is well positioned given its solid market exposures in the states like Texas, Colorado, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina in the South East and the West. Along with this, the company’s Midwest exposure and Magnesia business help it moderate the cyclicality during a downturn.Although the company is experiencing weak volumes, it is expected to grow with federal funding from the FAST Act that is likely to flow in the second half of 2017. Again, many state level initiatives in important markets, good momentum in residential industry as well as solid pipeline of LNG projects are likely to aid the company’s performance.Notably, as Martin Marietta highlighted in the second-quarter earnings call, the residential market, accounting for 20% of aggregates product line shipments, is benefiting from continued economic recovery, particularly in Florida, North Carolina, Colorado, Georgia, South Carolina, and Iowa. The company’s string of acquisitions, divestitures and an uptick in private and public construction activity are encouraging. Sustained growth in construction activity drives the demand for both the aggregates and cement businesses of the company.
