5,GOOG,"You'd think one of the oldest mutual funds would have figured out by now how to beat its benchmark on a consistent basis. And you'd be right. The $55.7 billion T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (PRGFX) notches top results by holding leading growth stocks like Amazon.com (AMZN), Booking Holdings (BKNG), Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).Growth Stock Fund, which opened in April 1950, has beaten the S&P 500 Index for the one-year, three-year, five-year, 10-year, and 15-year annualized periods as of May 31 of this year, according to Morningstar.com. Since inception, the fund has posted an average annual return of 11.06% through May 31. That compares to an 11.3% return for the S&P 500. In the first five months of this year, the fund was up 8.54% vs. the S&P's 2.02%, and 6.73% for the large-cap growth mutual funds that are its direct rivals.Joe Fath, who's managed the fund since 2014, says holdings like Amazon, Booking, Alibaba, Microsoft and Alphabet share one key trait. ""We're looking for innovative disruptors,"" Fath said. ""It's a unique time. We're going through a powerful information revolution. Massive platform businesses are being built on top of powerful technology, and building a powerful network effect between users and platforms.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFath seeks large-caps that can become megacaps because their growth is accelerating on a very big base of business.""Google is a good example of that,"" Fath said, referring to Google's parent Alphabet. ""They've been able to grow their top line 20% (annually) for a long period of time and that continues even as the company becomes much larger. The other big thing is they don't rest on the profit pool they've created. They continue to invest and break down barriers to new areas.""So far this year, Alphabet is up about 9% while Amazon is up about 46%. Gains by Alibaba, Booking and Microsoft range in between.The fund is large-cap focused, all $10 billion or more, mostly domestic with only 8% in foreign stocks as of March 31. Still, the fund has additional international exposure through its large-cap U.S. stocks, many of which have multinational operations.To bring a stock into the fund, Fath needs to see double-digit growth in earnings and free cash flow year-over-year.Fath assesses a company's total addressable market by asking: Is it in an area ripe for disruption? Who are the new entrants? He looks for stocks where the market under-appreciates the speed, pace and durability of a company's growth.Online retailer Amazon is the fund's top holding because it's the ""perfect example"" of the innovative disruptor.""It's going into many different directions at the same time and disrupting many different parts of the marketplace,"" Fath said.The biggest area is e-commerce, driven by its Prime membership. The second is its cloud offering, Amazon Web Services. But it has other irons in the fire. The two biggest are advertising and hardware. Amazon is doing more advertising for third-party merchants that use Amazon as their storefront. It's also moving into home devices with the Alexa speaker system to compete with Google and Apple (AAPL).Fath said Booking, the online travel agent that runs Booking.com, has a powerful business model. He said it's accumulated an inordinate amount of supply in Europe by adding a lot of branded and independent hotels, as well as alternative vacation homes and bed-and-breakfasts.He said it's put pressure on aggregator travel sites such as Trivago by being more efficient with its marketing spend to drive people to its own site.Another big holding is Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant. Fath said it has probably one the best business models and is very cash-flow generative. It's at the epicenter of taking advantage of China's rising middle class, which can buy more and more goods and services.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) has seen its shares rise more than 60% over the past year. First-quarter earnings per share jumped 43% as revenue and profits topped expectations. The company makes the robotic da Vinci Surgical System. Its profitability is based on the classic razor-razor blade business model. It makes money on its robotic surgical system, then creates a recurring revenue stream with additional profits through sales of service contracts and disposable items like surgical blades and other instruments and accessories.Fath also likes Nike (NKE), which has been out of favor as competitor Adidas (ADDYY) hustled its way to a resurgence in the U.S. He said Nike is beginning to ramp up its innovation engine, and will soon pump up a number of products, including its React sneaker line. Going forward, Fath said, ""We feel very good about the fundamentals.""YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeNew ETF Aims To Provide A steady 7% Annual Distribution Rate

12,GOOG,"After being dominated by small-cap stock funds the year before, the best large-cap mutual funds came back strong in the third annual IBD Best Mutual Funds 2018 Awards.Winning Best Mutual Funds Awards isn't easy. The best large-cap mutual funds don't just beat their index for one year. The same goes for the best midcap mutual funds and the best small-cap mutual funds. They need to beat the S&P 500 Index in the one-, three-, five-, and 10-year periods.IBD looked at funds at least 10 years old with at least $100 million in assets. Out of 661 large-cap mutual funds meeting those criteria, 92 beat the S&P 500 in all four periods. Of 231 midcap mutual funds, only 16 qualified. And out of 295 small-cap funds, just 17 took top honors.Large-cap mutual funds hold stocks with large market capitalization, which is derived by multiplying number of shares outstanding by the share price. Morningstar Inc. defines large caps as stocks in the top 70% the capitalization of U.S. stocky market. This means a market cap greater than $20 billion.Of the five best large-cap mutual funds capturing IBD awards in 2018, four are index funds. The only actively managed award winning fund is $5.3 billion Fidelity OTC (FOCPX), which took top place in the first Mutual Fund Awards. After a manager shake-up in September 2017, Sonu Kalra who ran the fund from 2005 to 2009, returned to co-run it.OTC is an aggressive growth stock fund that seeks capital appreciation. Kalra looks for companies with a strong franchise, a high bar that other companies must clear in order to compete, and strong management team aligned with shareholders.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Larger companies are doing better because the global economy is doing better,"" said Kalra. ""If you look at the indicators over the past several months, they indicate the global economy will continue on that path.""The fund holds many of the top tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), the parent of Google, Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA).Kalra also likes video game maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI). He said there many revenue opportunities with game makers like Activision. With digital downloads, they get revenue immediately and don't share any with retail stores. Consumers also purchase upgrades while playing to enhance their chances of winning. In addition, they are moving the franchise onto smartphones and away from consoles to widen their audience. Video game makers are now building leagues where people watch players in stadiums. This brings in ticket sales, merchandise revenue, food and other revenue streams.Chip Reed the co-portfolio manager of the Eaton Vance Capital SMID-Cap Fund (EISMX) has been managing the fund since inception. He said the midcap range starts around $6 billion to $8 billion.He says he's more cautious on the economy these days and spends a lot of time looking, but not a lot of time buying.He likes credit rating agency TransUnion (TRU), which should benefit from the sell-off in Equifax (EFX). He said TransUnion upgraded its technology and has been aggressive about picking up market share.Fair Isaac (FICO), which takes the credit bureaus' data and makes your credit score, has been a home run for the fund.Markel (MKL) is a specialty insurance company that takes nonstandard, higher-risk policies that larger firms can't make money on. ""They've figured out how to make money by underwriting these policies. It's one of our favorites,"" said Reed.Among the best small-cap mutual funds is Virtus KAR Small Cap Growth (PXSGX). Todd Beiley, co-portfolio manager, said he looks for three things when buying a business, durable competitive barriers, a compelling opportunity he can understand and a price that makes sense. He doesn't find many. The fund only owns 28 stocks and most of them it's owned more than five years.""We try to find great businesses and sit on our hands as much as possible,"" said Beiley. It seems to be working. Last year the fund returned 37%. It also beat its benchmark, the Russell 2000 Growth Index, in all time periods, as well.Among Beiley's top picks is the Rightmove ADR.  This firm is the U.K.'s leading online listings website for residential properties. He said it's a very profitable company because it doesn't require a lot of capital to operate, it has about 80% market share, which gives it pricing power, and operating margins are greater than 70%.

18,GOOG,"In an industry clogged with look-alike mutual funds, an ESG focus helps Calvert Equity Fund (CSIEX) stand out. The $2.2 billion fund bases its buy decisions not only on fundamental financial analysis but also on socially responsible criteria.X ESG refers to environmental, social and corporate governance criteria. ""Investors are attracted to this approach (using ESG factors) because they want to invest in companies that are solving these pressing ESG challenges,"" said Anthony Eames, director of responsible investment strategy for Calvert Research & Management. ""Over time, companies that get ESG factors right benefit from that, and that's good for the companies and their shareholders.""The financial fundamentals that the fund's four managers screen for are designed to find ""companies with consistent growth and stability in earnings,"" said Joseph Hudepohl, one of four Atlanta Capital Management co-managers who subadvise the fund for Calvert. Both Atlanta and Calvert are units of Eaton Vance.""Companies like that can thrive in any environment,"" he added. ""They're not reliant on the capital markets for funding, so they can withstand periods like (the financial crisis of) 2008-09, and they can compound over time.""Those traits are reflected in fund performance: strong, not dazzling, with lower downside risk than many of its peers.Calvert Equity outperformed the broad market in the form of the S&P 500 for the past year going into Thursday, up 30.87% vs. 26.95%. Large-cap growth mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Direct averaged 32.56%. And the fund provided shareholders with a smoother ride than its peer group has over time periods stretching from three to 15 years. Over the past three years, for example, the fund has gone down less than 85% of the S&P 500 in downturns, while its peers have averaged declines of more than 110% vs. the big-cap bogey.Calvert analysts sift through a universe of about 2,500 stocks. They pass a pool of 100 to 150 stocks that meet its ESG standards to the fund's Atlanta Capital co-managers. ""Then, based on our financial criteria and (low) valuation, we gravitate to the 45 to 50 names that make it into our portfolio,"" Hudepohl said.""Our universe of high quality businesses overlaps a lot with Calvert's universe of businesses that meet their ESG standards,"" he added.He says companies that satisfy the criteria tend to have tail winds because of those traits. ""There are long-term benefits to focusing on clean water like Danaher (DHR), for example, and on clean air like Praxair (PX).""Danaher's products include water treatment and vapor recovery systems. Its earnings per share rose 8%, 10% and 15% the past three quarters. Shares are up 27% in the past 12 months.Praxair makes atmospheric gases, process gases and industrial gas production equipment. EPS grew 7%, 5%, 6% and 8% the past four quarters, which followed eight quarters of EPS declines. Share price rose 37% in the past 12 months. The stock yields 2%.ESG criteria do not prevent the fund from investing in stocks that are popular among investors. FANG stalwarts Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) are holdings.IBD'S TAKE: You can see how Apple's strengths — like its five quarters of earnings per share growth acceleration — stack up against its peers at the stock's easy-to-read IBD Stock Checkup page.Calvert Equity's thesis for Facebook focuses on what Facebook excels at. ""Advertising dollars go where the eyeballs are,"" Hudepohl said. ""The internet is taking (consumers) eyeball time away from other media. And Facebook is one of the top truly global platforms after Google (for attracting consumers). It benefits from worldwide growth in attracting advertising dollars.""Equity managers like the steady earnings growth prospects for both Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V). ""They're two of the better examples of high-quality growth stocks and what we're looking for from a financial perspective,"" Hudepohl said about the credit card giants.Both companies also appear to have long runways in front of them. ""Amazingly, half of all transactions in developed markets are still in cash, so there is a lot of opportunity there,"" he said. ""And within emerging markets like India, China and South America, 90% of transactions are still done in cash.""And the two companies avoid taking on consumers' credit risk. ""They don't carry loans (from consumers),"" Hudepohl said. ""They are paid on each swipe of a card because of their technology. And the number of swipes is increasing.""Also, the companies have huge free cash flow, Hudepohl says. ""So they don't depend on capital markets to grow their businesses,"" he said. That means they don't have to issue stock or pay interest on loans or bonds to pay for capital expenditures or develop new technology.Charles Schwab (SCHW) benefits from a long-term secular tail wind of online brokers gaining market share, Hudepohl says. Also, Schwab stands to gain from rising interest rates. ""(The) low interest rate environment forced Schwab along with the rest of the industry to grant fee waivers on money market funds,"" Hudepohl said. ""As rates rise, those fees are being reinstituted.""""Secondly, the low rate environment also compressed net interest margin,"" he added. ""As rates rise, the spread that Schwab earns on its assets should continue to expand. Both benefits carry very high incremental margins to Schwab.""RELATED:Here's How Wall Street Professionals Play Bitcoin — Should You?You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

19,GOOG,"The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite rebounded strongly last week, retaking their 50-day moving averages as the market returned to a confirmed uptrend. But Facebook (FB), facing a more competitive Snapchat, owned by Snap (SNAP) and Twitter (TWTR), barely rose, stuck below its 50-day. Facebook appears to be taking over the mantle of quiet big-cap tech laggard from Apple (AAPL), which has started to bounce back.Here's a look at how Facebook and Apple are faring.Facebook hit a record high on Feb. 1, as the major averages and other leading stocks were starting to build up problems, leading IBD to change the market direction to uptrend under pressure. Facebook's relative strength line, which tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, was not at an all-time high. The RS line, the blue line in the chart below, had not made much headway since late July.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportAfter Feb. 1, the market sold off sharply, but Facebook fell even faster, with the RS line falling. When the market began to rally from Feb. 9, Facebook rose, but not as strongly, especially this past week. RS line now at lowest in several weeks, not far from mid-January's seven-month low.Facebook fell 0.8% Tuesday, marginally worse than the S&P 500's 0.6% loss. So the RS line nudged slightly lower.Not coincidentally, Facebook's smaller rivals Snap and Twitter reported strong results. Snap late on Feb. 6 reported better-than-expected revenue and user growth in the fourth quarter while its adjusted loss was less than expected. Snap shares skyrocketed 48% on Feb. 7, blasting out of a consolidation to an eight-month. This past week, eMarketer said Facebook is losing young users to Snapchat at a faster rate.Snap fell 7.3% Tuesday after an online petition urging Snapchat to reverse a major redesign topped 1.2 million.Twitter had strong numbers early on Feb. 8, including its first-ever profit on a GAAP basis. Twitter shares shot up 12% that day and have continued to trend up, trading at their best levels in 30 months. With Facebook downplaying news, Twitter could see further gains.Twitter fell 0.7% Tuesday.As for Facebook's fellow FANG stocks, Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) are still big winners with their RS lines at or near record highs. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is not really leading or lagging. Alphabet shares were unable to close above their 50-day lines on Friday, at least not the GOOGL ticker. The Alphabet (GOOG) class shares are above that support.Amazon rose 1.4%, Netflix was up 3 cents. Alphabet climbed 0.7%, moving above its 50-day line on the GOOGL ticker.Apple was a big laggard from early November to Feb. 2. For much of that time Apple shares were moving sideways while the S&P 500 and other major averages were moving sharply higher. Finally in the latter half of January, Apple's stock began falling steadily, especially after the market peaked, with the RS line hitting an 11-month low.But since Feb. 2, Apple's stock has been outperforming the market. Last week Apple surged 10%, more than doubling the S&P 500's gain, retaking the 200-day and then the 50-day line. Keep in mind that Apple's RS line has a long way to get to new-high ground, and the stock's surge may run out of steam.Apple dipped 0.3% Tuesday.YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: What Usually Happens After A 6-Day RunThese 5 Stocks Are Booming After Holding Up In CorrectionApple Loses This Last-Ditch Support — After Triggering These 4 Sell SignalsAs Apple, Netflix And Cisco Rise, This IBD 50 Stock Breaks OutThese 2 Sectors Flex Strength, Grab Space In This Top Growth Stock Screen

Our exposure to U.S. internet and U.S. cloud are underpinning FANG.The autonomous and EV innovation of automobiles is another theme that has fared well.

There are a lot of different technologies that are now showing up in automobiles, whether it is driver-assisted vision or integrated steering and braking, that are powered by semiconductors — companies like STMicroelectronics (STM) that we are invested in and have been for a while.Lastly, in the consumer space, we have been exposed over time to digital marketing, and the idea we have expressed it the most clearly through is our investment in Live Nation Entertainment (LYV). They have found ways to create advertising units, whether that is the headline sponsor at a concert, the naming rights to a venue or the signage in the parking lot. Advertisers are fighting in a crowded space for the consumer's attention and they have found clever ways to take an event and drive marketing around it.IBD: What is your outlook for large-cap growth stocks for 2018?Brookby: The rampage that large-cap growth stocks have gone on this year should give way to a more balanced performance between growth and value. Within the large-cap growth space, we are more interested in industrial cyclicals and financials and less interested in the big tech and big health care stocks that have done much of the heavy lifting this year and have seen their valuations expand greatly.IBD: Are there any particular industrial stocks that you like right now?Brookby: We have a major investment in Norfolk Southern (NSC). There are really only four railroads in this country. We haven't started another railroad in many, many decades. As economic growth picks up, you should see more freight in general moving over rails. The thing that makes them particularly interesting is not what is going on in rails, but what is going on in trucking. The major competitor of a rail is a truck, and there have been a number of regulatory changes in the trucking market that have really tightened up trucking capacity.IBD: What themes are you seeing at Alphabet that has led it to be a top holding in your portfolio?Brookby: The major one is YouTube. They have 1.5 billion monthly active users of YouTube that are using the service an average of an hour a day. The growth of YouTube this past quarter was just north of 30%. It is an amazing property that is hoovering up advertising dollars. Another major theme is Google Cloud Platform. It has some powerful technologies underlying it that are allowing for pretty explosive growth.IBD: What aspects of Amazon's business do you find to be the most intriguing?Brookby: The two things that intrigue me the most are what they are going to do with voice search expressed through Alexa and advertising in general. They have a high-margin opportunity to start to monetize the opportunity to advertise more directly on their platform. The big three advertising agencies — Publicis, Omnicom and WPP — announced earlier this fall that they were going to more than double the spend they are allocating to Amazon.IBD: How significant do you see Apple's services segment being for future growth?Brookby:  I don't think it is too strong to say it is really the key to the company's future. The iPhone business is down to about 55% of revenue and has been coming down as a percentage as the other parts of the business have picked up. Myself and many growth investors really want to see Apple transform itself into a more recurring revenue type of subscription business where customers are paying Apple $30, $40 or $50 a month, every month, to consume a set of services around its ecosystem, whether it be Apple Music, Apple Pay, the iTunes app store, iCloud or Apple Care.RELATED:Why Fidelity Gave This Mutual Fund Manager More Money To Invest

Shares of Digital Ally, which have shot up 725% since Aug. 18, were up 64%.Mattson cited three major opportunities for Taser.First, it continues to benefit from the rollout of ""smart,"" digital crowd control weapons such as the X2, which can calibrate the charge it delivers.Second is the huge and growing on-officer camera market, where Taser has an advantage with its Evidence.com service that collects and stores data.""Pairing cameras with Evidence.com is critical as far as Taser is concerned,"" Mattson said. ""Over time camera prices will drop. They want to get people on Evidence.com, and they're not too concerned about camera hardware sales.""Down the road, if people want to use third-party cameras, for example Google (GOOG) Glass or GoPro (GPRO) cameras, those will work with Evidence.com.""GoPro, which makes personal on-person cameras for sports and other uses, was up more than 6% Tuesday afternoon.Third, Taser is also seeing growing interest internationally.

58,GOOG,"Microsoft got a boost from its cloud business but took one on the chin from its Nokia phone unit as the company posted fiscal Q4 revenue that edged Wall Street estimates, but earnings fell short.Microsoft (MSFT) said late Tuesday that its commercial cloud revenue jumped 147% from the year-earlier quarter to a run rate of $4.4 billion a year but also said Nokia accounted for a per-share loss of 8 cents.Microsoft stock was flat in after-hours trading after it released results for the quarter ended June 30. Shares also were flat in the regular session, closing at 44.83 and touching 45.71 on Thursday — the stock's highest price since February 2000 — after the company announced big layoffs.Microsoft and its newly appointed CEO, Satya Nadella, are under pressure to accelerate the company's growth following the controversial $7.2 billion acquisition of mobile-handset maker Nokia, which closed April 25.Last week, Nadella said that Microsoft would lay off 18,000 workers, 14% of its workforce, with most of the layoffs coming from Nokia. On Tuesday, Microsoft predicted incurring pretax costs of $1.1 billion to $1.6 billion for the job cuts in fiscal 2015, ""substantially in the first half of the year.""The Q4 results, coupled with the company's plan for managing Nokia, are encouraging, Daniel Ives, an analyst for FBR Capital Markets, told IBD. He rates the stock outperform.""We have started to see them produce strong numbers, and with the cuts (from Nokia), it sort of laid out going into fiscal 2015 a pretty healthy Microsoft,"" Ives said.Still, challenges loom as the company attempts to compete with strong incumbents Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) in the mobile market, says Michael Turits, an analyst for Raymond James & Associates.Transition Uncertainty""We have more uncertainty relative to how a lot of this plays out both in terms of where revenues and margins go as you transition to cloud over time,"" Turits told IBD.

He maintained a buy rating.For Q4, Microsoft reported earnings per share minus items of 55 cents, down 6.8% from 59 cents in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 17.5% to $23.38 billion.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected 60 cents and $23 billion.For Q1, analysts expect EPS ex items of 64 cents, up 3.2%. Microsoft doesn't give EPS guidance. Analysts expect revenue this quarter of $23.08 billion, up 24.5%.As planned, for the first time Microsoft broke its revenue into two large segments, with five sub-categories.Microsoft's devices and consumer licensing revenue, which includes its Windows operating system and subscribers to its Office 365 Home and Personal software, saw sales rise 9.4% to $4.69 billion.Computing and gaming hardware, which includes its Xbox game console and Surface tablet computer, jumped 23.4% to $1.44 billion.Nokia's phone hardware revenue was $1.99 billion.Revenue from the devices and consumer other category rose 20.2% to $1.88 billion.Microsoft faces a long haul to compete with Apple and Samsung, the top user of Google's (GOOG) Android operating system, in smartphones and tablets, says Ives.""They were late to the game on Surface,"" he said. ""That continues to be a major uphill battle with Apple and Samsung.""In a company release, Nadella said ""I'm proud that our aggressive move to the cloud is paying off.""Microsoft stock is up nearly 20% this year.

64,GOOG,"How quickly will installing solar panels on your home or company rooftop pay off these days? How about one decade instead of two — or on a solar lease saving on the power bill right away, with no down payment.
"
65,GOOG,"Solar leasing has zoomed in popularity, especially for residential solar, now that there's a maturing network of outside investors providing solar installation companies with up-front money to fund such arrangements, or similar ""power purchase agreements"" — PPAs.

66,GOOG,"Even better for installers, doing business can drive better gross profit now that panel prices have fallen. And cheaper prices are good for demand.

67,GOOG,"In 2013, ""year-over-year growth in the residential sector (60%) outpaced the overall U.S. market (41%) for the first time, driven by an increase in the availability of third-party financing and the rapid expansion of established market leaders,"" GTM Research analyst Nicole Litvak wrote in a June 24 report.
"
68,GOOG,"Sunny California
"
69,GOOG,"In America's top solar market of California, third-party ownership — such as in leasing — has accounted for most new applications for residential solar systems since 2011, the Energy Information Administration notes. This year, it's just over two-thirds of the 12,082 installations through June, data from the California Solar Initiative show.
"
70,GOOG,"GTM Research data show a similar two-thirds/one-third split nationally between third-party owned and user-owned residential solar systems for 2013.
"
71,GOOG,"Caveats And Calculations
"
72,GOOG,"With the cost of electricity trending up around the U.S., the cost of solar power components coming down and government incentives still in place, it's become a lot more economical than before for homeowners and companies to buy systems and see an expedient return on their investment. Analysts see room for growth in purchased residential systems as well as leased ones, as both marketplaces mature.
"
73,GOOG,"While it may be the right time for considering putting in solar panels, you still have to be in the right place for the economics to prove optimal. First, you need decent sunlight. But there's a rabbit warren of federal, state and local incentives and financing options weighing in.
"
74,GOOG,"Since 2007 in California, 131,536 residential solar systems have been installed with applications made to the California Solar Initiative subsidy program.
"
75,GOOG,"""Typically what you see is that from a net present value perspective, end users want to be able to pay off their systems in a revenue-neutral situation in 20 years — a system typically lasts 20 to 30 years,"" said Nadav Enbar, principal project manager at EPRI, the Electric Power Research Institute. ""What you tend to see is a greater likelihood of investment the further you can push that down — 10 years is starting to get 'into the money' for many people. . ..In some cases homeowners have been able to see paybacks below 10 years.""
"
76,GOOG,"Pay As You Glow
"
77,GOOG,"Sunny California, Arizona and Hawaii — where power is especially costly — added the most home solar power last year. Enbar says the states with the fastest growth in new installations were California, Arizona, North Carolina, Massachusetts and New Jersey.
"
78,GOOG,"A standard 600-square foot rooftop home solar setup could cost $55,000 in 2013, government data show — no small sum. So even with the appeal of a shortening payback period for buying systems, solar leasing has taken off.
"
79,GOOG,"That typically involves the option of putting nothing down and a standardized monthly lease payment over the course of about 20 years that altogether results in substantial savings on a homeowner's monthly power bill. Another alternative is a power purchase agreement, where the home or business owner agrees to pay for all the power generated by the system at a fixed rate — wagering to beat traditional power prices and lock in a known cost.
"
80,GOOG,"As the third-party investor networks underlying leasing have ramped up — ranging from banks to Google (GOOG) — putting in solar panels has simultaneously become a better-paying business for installation companies:
"
81,GOOG,"The average price of a solar panel declined 60% over the last three years, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. And, it says, the price to install solar on homes and businesses has fallen steadily nationwide — by 4% from last year and 37% from 2010.
"
82,GOOG,"Big Names In Solar Leasing
"
83,GOOG,"With 20-year rooftop-panel lease arrangements popular among homeowners going solar, there is ""no payback period,"" said Tanguy Serra, chief operating officer at SolarCity (SCTY), the most prolific of a raft of installers that also includes solar panel manufacturer SunPower (SPWR), SunEdison (SUNE), Blackstone (BX)-owned Vivint Solar and several private companies.
"
84,GOOG,"On leases, people ""typically pay 10% to 15% less"" on monthly power bills at a locked-in rate, Serra says.
"
85,GOOG,"Hefty government incentives and financing by third-party solar investors — who use the tax credits — underpin the modern rooftop solar business. SolarCity alone has created funds with third-party investors sufficient to finance more than $4 billion in projects.
"
86,GOOG,"Installers such as SolarCity and solar-investor marketplace Clean Power Finance ""target investor returns of 8% to 12%,"" Enbar said.
"
87,GOOG,"""Solar is an investment business so the amount of money we can make off a given kilowatt-hour is fixed,"" Serra said. ""So it really comes down to 'how low can we get our costs?'""
"
88,GOOG,"Solar panel and inverter costs have ""been coming down nicely"" for the last five to six years, he said. ""The other piece is our scale — we've reached the point where we're able to install and deploy lower than the cost of anyone else.""

90,GOOG,"In pursuit of more economies of scale, SolarCity on June 16 said it signed an agreement to acquire high-efficiency solar panel technology and manufacturing company Silevo, and aims to build one of the largest solar panel plants in the world, in New York, with a targeted capacity above one gigawatt in the next two years.
"
91,GOOG,"Sound a little familiar? The announcement was made jointly by SolarCity's chairman Elon Musk and his cousins Lyndon Rive, who's the CEO, and Peter Rive, the chief technology officer. Over in one of his other businesses, Tesla Motors (TSLA), Musk is also busy putting together a battery ""gigafactory"" to support buildout of the electric car industry, and the stationary-storage needs of the solar industry, among other possibilities.

92,GOOG,"While lifetime savings on a rooftop solar system may potentially be better buying than leasing, stock market investors have bet that the convenience factor of leasing — where home or business owners aren't responsible for maintenance — will keep driving revenue for installers. The big pure-play installer and leasing specialist, SolarCity, ranked among the top stock market gainers of 2013 (with a 376% rise), along with SunPower and SunEdison, which have installation business segments. So far this year, SolarCity stock is up 17%, SunPower 28% and SunEdison 74%.

"
98,GOOG,"For homeowners or businesses doing the math on whether to get solar panels, he notes, be sure to check state and local incentives. North Carolina ended up seeing one of the faster growth rates in installations last year in part because, he says, it ""has an amazing local incentive of 35% on top of the 30% (national) investment tax credit, which makes the money fantastic.""How quickly will installing solar panels on your home or company rooftop pay off these days? How about one decade instead of two — or on a solar lease saving on the power bill right away, with no down payment.Solar leasing has zoomed in popularity, especially for residential solar, now that there's a maturing network of outside investors providing solar installation companies with up-front money to fund such arrangements, or similar ""power purchase agreements"" — PPAs.Even better for installers, doing business can drive better gross profit now that panel prices have fallen. And cheaper prices are good for demand.In 2013, ""year-over-year growth in the residential sector (60%) outpaced the overall U.S. market (41%) for the first time, driven by an increase in the availability of third-party financing and the rapid expansion of established market leaders,"" GTM Research analyst Nicole Litvak wrote in a June 24 report.Sunny CaliforniaIn America's top solar market of California, third-party ownership — such as in leasing — has accounted for most new applications for residential solar systems since 2011, the Energy Information Administration notes. This year, it's just over two-thirds of the 12,082 installations through June, data from the California Solar Initiative show.GTM Research data show a similar two-thirds/one-third split nationally between third-party owned and user-owned residential solar systems for 2013.Caveats And CalculationsWith the cost of electricity trending up around the U.S., the cost of solar power components coming down and government incentives still in place, it's become a lot more economical than before for homeowners and companies to buy systems and see an expedient return on their investment. Analysts see room for growth in purchased residential systems as well as leased ones, as both marketplaces mature.While it may be the right time for considering putting in solar panels, you still have to be in the right place for the economics to prove optimal. First, you need decent sunlight. But there's a rabbit warren of federal, state and local incentives and financing options weighing in.Since 2007 in California, 131,536 residential solar systems have been installed with applications made to the California Solar Initiative subsidy program.""Typically what you see is that from a net present value perspective, end users want to be able to pay off their systems in a revenue-neutral situation in 20 years — a system typically lasts 20 to 30 years,"" said Nadav Enbar, principal project manager at EPRI, the Electric Power Research Institute. ""What you tend to see is a greater likelihood of investment the further you can push that down — 10 years is starting to get 'into the money' for many people. . ..In some cases homeowners have been able to see paybacks below 10 years.""Pay As You GlowSunny California, Arizona and Hawaii — where power is especially costly — added the most home solar power last year. Enbar says the states with the fastest growth in new installations were California, Arizona, North Carolina, Massachusetts and New Jersey.A standard 600-square foot rooftop home solar setup could cost $55,000 in 2013, government data show — no small sum. So even with the appeal of a shortening payback period for buying systems, solar leasing has taken off.That typically involves the option of putting nothing down and a standardized monthly lease payment over the course of about 20 years that altogether results in substantial savings on a homeowner's monthly power bill. Another alternative is a power purchase agreement, where the home or business owner agrees to pay for all the power generated by the system at a fixed rate — wagering to beat traditional power prices and lock in a known cost.As the third-party investor networks underlying leasing have ramped up — ranging from banks to Google (GOOG) — putting in solar panels has simultaneously become a better-paying business for installation companies:The average price of a solar panel declined 60% over the last three years, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. And, it says, the price to install solar on homes and businesses has fallen steadily nationwide — by 4% from last year and 37% from 2010.Big Names In Solar LeasingWith 20-year rooftop-panel lease arrangements popular among homeowners going solar, there is ""no payback period,"" said Tanguy Serra, chief operating officer at SolarCity (SCTY), the most prolific of a raft of installers that also includes solar panel manufacturer SunPower (SPWR), SunEdison (SUNE), Blackstone (BX)-owned Vivint Solar and several private companies.On leases, people ""typically pay 10% to 15% less"" on monthly power bills at a locked-in rate, Serra says.Hefty government incentives and financing by third-party solar investors — who use the tax credits — underpin the modern rooftop solar business. SolarCity alone has created funds with third-party investors sufficient to finance more than $4 billion in projects.Installers such as SolarCity and solar-investor marketplace Clean Power Finance ""target investor returns of 8% to 12%,"" Enbar said.""Solar is an investment business so the amount of money we can make off a given kilowatt-hour is fixed,"" Serra said. ""So it really comes down to 'how low can we get our costs?'""Solar panel and inverter costs have ""been coming down nicely"" for the last five to six years, he said. ""The other piece is our scale — we've reached the point where we're able to install and deploy lower than the cost of anyone else.""SolarCity Buys SilevoIn pursuit of more economies of scale, SolarCity on June 16 said it signed an agreement to acquire high-efficiency solar panel technology and manufacturing company Silevo, and aims to build one of the largest solar panel plants in the world, in New York, with a targeted capacity above one gigawatt in the next two years.Sound a little familiar?

100,GOOG,"When PayPal (PYPL) split from online auction site eBay (EBAY) in 2015, Wall Street wondered whether the digital-payments provider would truly find its place in the world of ushering money between people online.XCould it stand up to Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA), they wondered. Would it be able to justify its existence alongside Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google? Could it compete with basically any of the large banks, who had plenty of reasons to offer payment services themselves?Rather than go to war, PayPal has reached truces, of sorts, with those and other companies since the spin-off from eBay. The strategy has sent its stock on a marathon run higher. It's also extended the company's reach online, into the muscle memory of smartphone users, and into any moment where someone might think to pay for something. It has also given PayPal a foothold in actual, physical stores, which still make up the vast majority of retail.Today, PayPal users can draw on a Mastercard or Visa card or their bank account to pay for something via their phone in such retail locations. In May, PayPal said users would be able to pay for stuff on Gmail, YouTube and other locations in the Google ecosphere. PayPal last year struck a deal with Facebook that allowed someone to send money via Facebook Messenger.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""That's really helped them become much more of a partner, obviously, than a competitor with a lot of these companies,"" Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson said. ""I think that's helped ease Wall Street's concerns about whether a big tech company would just leapfrog them or make their technology obsolete.""The company also counts Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) as partners, and is trying to attract more people without bank accounts. In moves abroad, the company last year struck a deal with Chinese search giant Baidu (BIDU) to let Baidu Wallet holders buy things from PayPal merchants.In May, it announced the $2.2 billion purchase of iZettle, a Stockholm-based company sometimes called the Square (SQ) of Europe. The deal is likely to put PayPal's technology into retail outlets across that continent as well as Latin America.How sustainable these partnerships are over the long term remains an open question. Competition from Square, best known for the card readers often used by small businesses, is nothing to sneeze at. PayPal's margins have been under pressure as it chases bigger customers, Olson says. EBay's decision this year to eventually handle more payments on its own — rather than PayPal — is a big deal.But for now, analysts suggest that more freedom from eBay has allowed PayPal to come into its own. The collaboration-over-competition approach, along with the growing ease and popularity of online payments, has sent its stock up 126% since the company's 2015 spinoff. Over the past year alone, the stock is up nearly 60% and maintains an IBD Composite Rating of 96. Shares were down fractionally to 85.31 Friday.Even as competition escalates, the company in May said it was targeting around a 20% compound annual earnings per share growth rate over the next three to five years. Over that time, it also forecasts expanding adjusted operating margins and 17%-18% compound annual sales growth, when factoring foreign exchange fluctuations.In years past, the firm tried to encourage customers to link their PayPal accounts with their bank accounts. The practice helped the company avoid paying fees to the credit card networks, making those companies dyspeptic. Visa's chief executive in 2016 warned that the card network could try to compete with the payments company ""in ways that people have never seen before.""PayPal eventually backed off, agreeing later that year to partner with Visa. The agreement expanded the ""acceptance for PayPal's digital wallet to all physical retail locations where Visa contactless transactions are enabled,"" according to a statement announcing the deal.The deal also allowed customers to instantly move money from their PayPal and Venmo accounts to their bank account via a Visa debit card, that statement said. Shortly after, PayPal and Mastercard announced a similar pact that expanded an existing partnership.""It just made it a lot easier for individual consumers to sign up for PayPal,"" William Blair analyst Bob Napoli said of its increased flexibility.The company's active customer accounts grew 15% last year. In the first quarter, reported in April, it added 8.1 million active accounts, with payment transactions up 25%. The company has 218 million active users in more than 200 markets. It processes around one in every six dollars spent online, according to Edward Jones.""Embracing the traditional payment ecosystem was a positive in many investors' eyes,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said.What's more, analysts say, the company's technology is good, and it works on lots of things with which you can make payments. Its One Touch technology allows customers to buy things online without entering their password and other information. The company rolled out its own cash-back credit card last summer. The company was testing a Venmo debit card, Recode reported earlier last year.As PayPal makes it easier to pay for things, businesses have taken notice. The company has some 19 million merchant accounts, most of them small to midsize businesses.""I think, (they) have signed up, and continue to sign up, more merchants post-spinoff from eBay that maybe wouldn't have been able to sign when they were part of eBay,"" Napoli said.Still, a big chunk of PayPal's financials hinge on eBay's auction activity. EBay acquired the company in 2002 to make it easier for eBay's buyers and sellers to pay or get paid online. Last year, PayPal drew around a fifth of its revenue from customers on eBay's Marketplaces platform.But in January, the online auction platform said it would begin managing payments on its own. It said that process will be a ""—multiyear journey."" EBay also said it would use Adyen, a Netherlands-based company, as its payments processor. PayPal's stock crashed on eBay's announcement. PayPal will remain a payment option on eBay until mid-2023.The payments company seems likely to compensate by reeling in bigger retailers elsewhere. But Olson notes that its pursuit of larger customers has weighed on margins. Those companies have more bargaining power to negotiate lower fees, he says.Analysts also debate whether it has the upper hand on Square, the payments company best known for its credit-card readers used by small businesses. Square also is stepping up efforts to compete with PayPal via acquisitions.On one hand, PayPal has a massive network of millions of users. The purchase of iZettle would unite PayPal's immense digital platform with iZettle's card readers and software tools for small businesses. But small businesses comprise the turf upon which Square has built much of its reputation.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) still has Apple Pay, although PayPal last year landed a deal to allow iTunes users to buy things with PayPal. The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Amazon (AMZN) was looking into developing something similar to a branded checking account. As long as tech and financial companies work in the payments business, friction could wear at PayPal's partnerships.""Long-term, it's harder to say,"" Sebastian said of how those partnerships will hold up. ""PayPal still has many elements of duplicating what a credit card offers.""So there's always the prospect, if PayPal were to potentially turn (to) a competitive angle vs. a partnership angle,"" he said. ""But I certainly don't foresee that in the near term or the medium term.""RELATED LINKS:Square, PayPal Lead These 5 Financial Stocks In Or Near Buy ZonesBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStock Spotlight List Adds 8 For Your Best Stocks To Buy And WatchSquare Rival Testing Buy Zone After Biggest Acquisition Since eBay Spinoff

130,GOOG,"What accounts for USAA Aggressive Growth Fund's (USAUX) tidy gain so far this year? In terms of holdings, the credit goes to Amazon (AMZN), Mastercard (MA), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Booking Holdings (BKNG) (formerly Priceline).X They're among the fund's best performing stocks this year, and have helped propel it to a 6.17% gain going into Thursday vs. 6.09% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar and 2.35% for the S&P 500.But those stocks might not have had meaningful positions in the portfolio were it not for new fund managers John Jares and Craig Behnke, who took the reins of the fund in August last year.For the board of the USAA Aggressive Growth Fund, 2016 was the straw that broke the camel's back.After years of consistently trailing its benchmark — the Russell 1000 Growth Index — in 2016 the fund posted a return of 0.72%. That year the Russell 1000 Growth rose 7.08% and the S&P 500 Index gained 11.96%. The fund's parent company knew drastic action needed to be taken. It fired the subadvisors managing the fund, Winslow Capital and Wellington Capital, and gave it to two in-house portfolio managers, John Jares and Craig Behnke, in August 2017.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersSince then, the managers have looked at each of the 125 stocks in the fund and done their own fundamental research. They've sold many stocks, narrowing the fund down to a smaller, lighter, more concentrated portfolio of 80 stocks with the goal of hitting around 70.""I don't know what was going on before, but by virtue of having two subadvisors, it was over diversified, and had little chance of outperforming,"" said Jares. ""We want to differentiate ourselves based on security selection, keep the beta in line with the benchmark, and add alpha through stock selection. We're nearly done with the process. We have 15 names to go.""The fund kept the top five holdings: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), which is the parent of Google, Visa (V) and Amazon. It also kept Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL). Among the names sold were Alibaba (BABA), Expedia (EXPE), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Amdocs (DOX), Teradyne (TER) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS).They're not just selling. They've also been adding new stocks and boosting the concentrations of the ones they like. When they took over the fund, 15 stocks made up 30% of the portfolio. Jares said by the time he's done, 15 stocks will make up about 40% of total assets.""It's a tale of two different time periods,"" said Behnke. ""From Sept. 1, 2017, to Dec. 31, 2017, when we were in the process of turning over a lot of the portfolio, our performance relative to the Russell 1000 Growth trailed by 200 basis points."" Even so, the fund ended 2017 up 30.05% vs. the Russell's 30.21% and the S&P's 21.83%.Now that the fund is closer to the managers' ideal portfolio, from Jan. 1 through March 4, it beat its benchmark by 105 basis points.Jares said the fund has performed well because of its holdings in technology and the consumer discretionary sector. Despite this, the managers have reduced the fund's technology weighting to 40% from 46%. And they increased the consumer discretionary weighting to 16.2% from 13.1%. Overall, they've broadened the fund's sector exposures by diversifying the number of sectors, while concentrating the number of stocks.Among the new stocks, they like Vulcan Materials (VMC)) so much that it became a top 10 holding. Based in Birmingham, Ala., the company supplies crushed stone, known as aggregates, along with concrete and asphalt to make roads and bridges.""Those aggregates have seen nice pricing power,"" said Jares. ""And in an improving economy where you may have infrastructure programs coming down the pike, their volume outlook is excellent.""The company has grown earnings at a 48% annual clip the past three years, but the stock is 14% off its 52-week high and trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a bearish sign.Edwards Lifesciences (EW), which makes catheters to treat heart disease, has grown earnings at an annual pace of 29% in the past three years.""The original estimates of that market were $3 billion over the next three to five years,"" said Behnke. ""But with lower death rates and lower complications compared to surgery, those numbers are so strong that the total addressable market increased and the current estimate is $5 billion. Through our research and our industry contacts, over the next 12-24 months estimates for that market could push to the $6 billion-$8 billion range by 2025.""Jares also likes HP (HPQ), which he expects to become a growth company again. Best known for making computer printers, HP, Jares notes, is launching a new line of copiers. As 3-D printing kicks in, the company will become a leader again, he says. Jares says he expects HP will see growth return in the mid-single-digit range.The fund charges a below average expense ratio of 0.81%.RELATED:Look At What Hot Stocks Are Driving This Market-Beating Mutual FundDow Retakes 50-Day As Apple Pegs New Closing High; Bitcoin Dives

169,GOOG,"New York-based Verizon said it had contracted with San Jose, Calif.-based solar developer SunPower (SPWR) to design and install the systems, for rooftop and ground-mounted solar-power systems in California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York. More than 44,000 solar panels in all will be installed at the locations.
"
170,GOOG,"SunPower, the No. 2 U.S. solar panel maker behind First Solar (FSLR), is planning a fifth factory to expand its production capacity by more than 50%.
"
171,GOOG,"SunPower stock was up a fraction in afternoon trading in the stock market today. Verizon stock also was up a fraction.
"
172,GOOG,"Verizon said the latest solar project expands an ""on-site green energy program"" it launched last year. Previously, Verizon had invested $100 million as it looks to cut its carbon emissions footprint substantially by 2020.
"
173,GOOG,"When completed, Verizon expects to have a 25MW system. That's enough to power more than 8,500 homes per year and to offset 22,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, James Gowen, Verizon chief sustainability officer, said in the company's press release.
"
174,GOOG,"Last year, Verizon exceeded its 10MW target, deploying 14MW using both solar-power systems and fuel cells. Verizon uses 26 solar-assisted cell sites in remote areas of the western U.S. to help power its wireless network.

178,GOOG,"One hurdle for SunPower has been production capacity constraints, UBS analyst Stephen Chin told IBD.

The data-center operator's Friday and Monday closes set new 52-week highs. Shares are up 17% this year.Zacks Equity Research says that a recent deal with Orange Business Services, a global provider of IT and communications services, should boost Equinix's volume and beef up its market position. Zacks also cited the opening of an Equinix data center in Dallas.Walgreen (WAG) is in a second-stage flat base and within 5% of its entry. The drugstore chain's pending buyout of Swiss-based Alliance Boots looks like a chance to move its headquarters to a lower-tax locale.

Plains said that its drivers are continued strong fundamentals and favorable market conditions.Priceline (PCLN) has formed a cup-with-handle base and is within 7% of its buy point.

208,GOOG,"New ad features at social network Twitter (TWTR) could drive near-term revenue more significantly than previously forecast, says Pacific Crest analyst Evan Wilson, who initiated coverage with a rating of outperform, or buy.Twitter on Thursday also announced the acquisition of Namo Media, a native advertising firm. The price tag reportedly was about $50 million.""In our conversations with the Namo Media team, it became clear we share a vision for how native advertising can improve the state of mobile app monetization for marketers, app publishers, and users,"" Twitter said in a statement.Twitter stock climbed 3% to 33.89 on the stock market today after hitting 34.89 intraday.Pacific Crest's initiation report, published before the Namo acquisition, touts Twitter's new app-installing mobile ads. Those ads allow advertisers to add a button to advertisements for mobile users to download the advertiser's app directly. So if you buy an ad for your app, the person viewing that ad can just click on the button to download the app.""While Twitter has become more revenue-minded, we view this as the most significant catalyst to date,"" Wilson wrote in a Thursday initiation note.Twitter announced its app-install ads on April 17 as part of a spate of mobile-focused ad features. Social networking rival Facebook (FB) runs similar ads, and Google (GOOGL) announced ads in late April that allow mobile users to launch apps by clicking on search ads.Mobile advertising growth is expected to outpace PC ad growth in coming years, as overall time spent on the Web shifts to tablets and smartphones from PCs and laptops.In the U.S., mobile ad spending is expected to jump 82.5% to $17.7 billion this year, according to research firm eMarketer. Twitter is expected to grab 3.2% of that spending, even with its 2013 percentage. Leader Google is seen handling 35.7%, while Facebook is set to grab 17.7%, eMarketer says.To capitalize on mobile ad growth, Internet ad firms have been rebuilding their ad-buying platforms so that advertisers can switch more easily between buying PC and mobile ads. Google (GOOG) has switched all of its advertisers to an ad-purchasing portal that allows ad buyers to buy both mobile and PC ads at the same time.Twitter in September 2013 announced a $350 million acquisition of MoPub, a mobile ad firm. Namo Media, the native-ad company Twitter acquired on Thursday, will work with MoPub.""Combining our technology with MoPub will offer our current and future customers a more powerful platform to generate revenue, all while preserving an amazing user experience,"" says Namo in a blog post.Twitter is now figuring out how to be a ""revenue-first"" company while still maintaining its original mission, says analyst Wilson. That's an ""existential"" battle that other big firms have faced after their public offerings, says Wilson.""It is very obvious that Google has done this over the past decade and that Facebook has done this over the past 18 months,"" Wilson said.For Twitter, Pacific Crest is modeling 2014 revenue up 96% to $1.3 billion. The consensus view is $1.27 billion, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Twitter also is looking for new revenue streams, and reportedly has eyed acquisitions that include Pandora Media (P) and its rival Spotify.RELATED: Google Sells App-Focused Ads, Following Twitter, Facebook.Twitter Steps Up Its Move Into Mobile Ads.Follow Kevin Shalvey on Twitter at @IBD_KShalvey.

IBD recently reported that Aetna is talking with Apple (AAPL) about offering free or discounted Apple Watches to Aetna customers.Fidelity managers increased their collective stake in online payment processor PayPal by 34%, in database and e-commerce software leader Oracle by nearly 34%, in hotel giant Marriott by just under 30% and in cigarette maker British American Tobacco by almost 21%.PayPal is the No. 1-ranked stock in IBD's Finance-Creditcard/Payment Processor industry group. It sports a best-possible Composite Rating of 99 from IBD. Consensus among analysts is that earnings per share will rise 22% this year.IBD'S TAKE: You can compare PayPal's other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Oracle's EPS grew 8% and 10% the past two quarters after sliding 3% in the prior stanza. The stock has an excellent A SMR Rating from IBD. That means it is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.Marriott and Alibaba (BABA) have agreed to a joint venture that will let Alibaba users use the e-commerce giant's travel service platform, Fliggy, to book Marriott rooms, as IBD recently reported. Earlier this months Marriott reported better-than-expected earnings for the June quarter but gave weak guidance.Marriott International's (MARS) shares are forming a flat base, while Alibaba's are extended from an optimal buy point.British American Tobacco is 16% off its June 6 high and has a weak 31 Composite Rating.Individual Fidelity funds and managers can deviate from the overall net patterns.The technology sector remained Fidelity's largest cumulative sector, with a 27% weighting, Rosenbluth reported this week. The complex's six top individual stock holdings by combined market value in Fidelity portfolios were in fact tech stocks.Consumer electronics colossus Apple led the way with a $20.3 billion portfolio value, accounting for a 2.94% weighting. Social media mammoth Facebook (FB) was next, with an $18.1 billion portfolio value, with a 2.63% weighting.Third was Amazon (AMZN), a giant in e-commerce and web services, with a $14.4 billion portfolio value and 2.09% weighting. Classes A and C of Alphabet (GOOGL) were fourth and fifth, with values of $13 billion and $10.4 billion and weightings of 1.88% and 1.51% respectively. Software titan Microsoft (MSFT) was worth $9.5 billion to Fidelity, with a 1.38% weighting.Still, several of those favorites' allure faded in Fidelity's eyes. Fidelity sold 6.6 million shares of Apple, trimming its share count by 5%. That left Fidelity's Apple exposure at its lowest level since June 2016, Rosenbluth wrote.It disposed of about 1 million shares of Facebook, or just under 1% of its total.It sold 404,426 shares of Amazon, or 2.64% of its total.Fidelity added 102,000 shares of GOOGL, raising its share count by 0.75%. But it sold nearly 50,000 shares of class-A GOOG, or 0.43%.And it got rid of 5.3 million shares of Microsoft, a 3.9% cut in shares.Other big tech names suffered big share-count cuts. Fidelity trimmed its share count in Nvidia (NVDA) by nearly 11%, in Broadcom (AVGO) by 10.5% and Cisco (CSCO) by 10.2%.Financials stayed the second-largest Fidelity sector with a 16% weighting. Fidelity added exposure to big banks Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) by boosting share counts 4.4% and 3.8% respectively.But Fidelity cut share counts in Goldman Sachs (GS) by 9.8%, in Morgan Stanley (MS) by 8.1%, in Wells Fargo (WFC) by 7.9%, and in JPMorgan Chase (JPM) by 7.5%.It also trimmed share count in credit card network Mastercard (MA) by 2.2%.The $39.3 billion Fidelity Growth Company Fund (FDGRX) and $22.7 billion Blue Chip Growth (FBGRX) both held top-10 positions in Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia and electric car maker Tesla (TSLA) as of June 30, Rosenbluth reported.TIPS & TOOLS:Is this a good time to buy Fidelity's top holdings?

247,GOOG,"Though Trump administration and geopolitical concerns have roiled the stock market lately, little movement occurred among the top-performing ETFs the past month.XThat is, aside from the commodity/currency group. Teucrium Wheat (WEAT), which topped the category last month with an 11% year-to-date gain, fell out of the top 10. Shares tumbled 20% from their early-July peak through Aug. 15.IShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor (MTUM) was again the best performer among U.S. diversified stock funds, with a 23.2% return through Aug. 15, according to Morningstar Inc. Jumping to second place was PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ), which is up 22.2% YTD. Their one-month returns were a more modest at 1.4% and 1.3%, respectively.Technology was the $52.3 billion QQQ's biggest sector weighting as of Aug. 15, at nearly 57% of assets. That's not surprising, given the ETF tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index. Top five holdings, which accounted for 38% of assets, were Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOG).Since clearing a flat-base entry last month, QQQ has made little headway. It dropped 2% Aug. 10 and more than 1% Thursday.Is the long bull market getting tired?""Equity markets have greeted positive earnings reports largely with indifference,"" Richard Turnill, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, noted in an Aug. 14 commentary. ""Investor sentiment shows more signs of fatigue than euphoria, even as stock markets have repeatedly reached new highs this year.""Still, he expects equity fundamentals to remain positive in the second half of the year, with technology and financials leading earnings growth.As in July, ARK Innovation (ARKK), up 56% YTD, led sector ETFs once again. It jumped 6.7% the past month through Aug. 15. Another ARK fund, ARK Web x.0 (ARKW), moved up to No. 2 with a 52.9% YTD gain. ARKW, which scored a 5.6% advance on the month, is trading near all-time highs.ARKW, which will mark its third anniversary next month, has attracted $75.9 million. It provides exposure to companies that are transforming economic sectors with internet-enabled innovation. Top holdings as of Aug. 17 include Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), Amazon, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA). The top five made up nearly 30% of assets.EMQQ Emerging Markets Internet & Ecommerce (EMQQ) again topped the foreign-stock category with a 52.1% YTD gain. The $252 million fund, which is heavily weighted in Chinese internet stocks, was up 2.9% the past month.Brazil funds stayed strong: VanEck Vectors Brazil Small-Cap (BRF) returned 39.7% YTD and iShares MSCI Brazil Small-Cap (EWZS) rose 38.1%. BRF saw a one-month return of 4.6%, while EWZS got a 6% bump.Turnill remains bullish on emerging markets. ""We see opportunities in emerging-market equities, as economic reforms, improving corporate fundamentals and reasonable valuations provide support,"" he said.RELATED:Emerging Markets, Tech And Momentum Plays Among Top Gainers

248,GOOG,"With fellow FANG stocks Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) set to report earnings later in the week, Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) is forming a base offering a 988.35 entry as it gets ready to release its latest numbers after the close.The current formation is a first-stage flat base. In afternoon trading Monday, Alphabet was up fractionally in volume trending above average, bringing the search giant within 1% of the buy point.XUnderstand that buying a stock just before it reports is risky, since poor numbers could send it sharply lower. You can reduce your exposure by waiting to see how the company reports and how the market reacts.The company reported 28% earnings growth last quarter. Sales rose 22%.Analysts expect EPS growth of -36% for the quarter, and 10% growth for the full year. Annual growth estimates were recently revised lower.The company has a 93 Composite Rating and earns the No. 14 rank among its peers in the Internet-Content industry group. Autohome (ATHM), Facebook and Momo (MOMO) are among the top 5 highly rated stocks within the group.Note: Dates for earnings reports are estimates and subject to change.

249,GOOG,"Since equity ETFs are essentially a basket of stocks, they tend to trade like individual stocks but can be less volatile since there are many other holdings.Today's two picks are at the top of their respective flat bases. For those who prefer to buy when an ETF bounces off its 50-day moving average, both funds are also within striking distance from a recent rebound.XVanguard Growth (VUG) closed Monday just shy of a 129.87 flat-base buy point. It found support near the 50-day line last week and is up about 2% from the support line. Shares advanced nearly 8% from their prior touch of the 50-day line to the June 2 intraday high.The fund, which tracks the CRSP U.S. Large Cap Growth Index, has attracted north of $27 billion in assets. Technology was for the biggest chunk of assets, at almost 28% as of June 30, followed by 18% in consumer cyclical and 15% in health care, according to Morningstar Inc. Consumer defensive and industrials made up about 9% each.The tech-heavy stance is evident in the top five holdings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's class A (GOOGL) and class C (GOOG) shares. Those five names accounted for nearly one-fifth of total assets; each of the stocks have rallied more than 20% this year.VUG has outperformed the S&P 500 year to date by 17.3% to 11.1% through July 14. It's slightly outpaced the benchmark index based on three- and five-year average annual returns. For the 10-year period, the ETF returned an average annual 8.6% vs. 7% for the S&P 500. VUG carries a 0.06% expense ratio.Also closing in on a flat-base entry, at 109.85, and within 2% of its recent bounce off the 50-day line is iShares Russell Mid-Cap Growth (IWP). The fund advanced nearly 5% from a late-April breakout from a flat base to the start of its current pattern.The $7.7 billion fund, which celebrated its 16th anniversary Monday, provides exposure to domestic midsize companies that are expected to grow their earnings at an above-average pace vs. the market. Top holdings as of July 13 included drugmaker Zoetis (ZTS), chipmaker Analog Devices (ADI) and Illumina (ILMN), a maker of gene-sequencing systems.Technology was also the biggest sector weighting for the fund, at 23% of assets. IWP, whose 15-year average annual return of 10.8% is ahead of the S&P 500's 9% gain, has a 0.25% expense ratio.Monday's emerging markets picks were little changed: iShares Emerging Markets Dividend (DVYE) remains just below a 41.40 flat-base buy point, while SPDR S&P Emerging Markets Dividend (EDIV) is still in buy range from a 30.88 flat-base entry.RELATED:For Outsize Dividends, Check Out These 2 Hot Emerging Markets PlaysLook Outside The U.S. For Top Dividend Funds So Far This YearCan The Bull Keep Running In The Second Half?

250,GOOG,"Known for managing millions of retirement accounts, college savings plans and regular taxable-investment accounts, Fidelity Investments on Thursday said 2016 revenue rose 3.4% to $15.9 billion, a record for the privately held company.The combination of revenue growth and slightly lower expenses produced a record profit of $3.5 billion. That was an increase of 19.5% over 2015's $3 billion in operating income.""All businesses contributed to our strong results,"" a Fidelity spokesman said.The 2016 profit increase reversed a profit decline in 2015, when profit fell $325 million, or 9.8%, from 2014's $3.282 billion.""Fidelity is profitable, strong, innovative and driven to growth,"" said Jim Lowell, editor-in-chief of Fidelity Investor, an independent newsletter. ""That's not true for many financial services companies.""The 2015 profit erosion was caused by spending on staffing and technology to compete with tough rivals.Operating expenses fell slightly to $12.35 billion in 2016 from $12.4 billion the year before.""The slowdown in expenses is because Fidelity is starting to see the benefit in Abigail's (Johnson) leadership,"" Lowell said. One way she has cut spending is by centralizing functions, eliminating redundancies in information technology and compliance. ""There's more efficiency,"" Lowell said.Across all of its stock mutual funds, technology was Fidelity's largest sector as of Jan. 31 with a 20.3%, according to Morningstar Inc.Fidelity's top U.S. holdings were Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).Apple's stock has surged 22% since shortly after the election. It has a so-so 76 Composite Rating from IBD. Facebook has a 90 Comp Rating and is trading near its all-time high after breaking out of a cup-with-handle base in late January. Amazon has risen 12% this year, has a 76 Comp Rating, and has formed a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 843.94. Alphabet's Comp Rating is 69. Microsoft has a weak 60 Comp Rating. It has uptrended since June.99 is the highest possible Comp Rating, which is on a scale from 1-99.Fidelity also reported a record $5.7 trillion in investor assets under administration (AUA), up 10.6% from year-end 2015.Total discretionary and nondiscretionary asset flow for the year was $218.9 billion, up 15% from 2015 flow.Discretionary flow includes flow to and from managed accounts, mutual funds, exchange traded funds and collective investment trusts.Nondiscretionary flow goes to and from investments not managed by Fidelity, such as other firms' mutual funds and individual securities.At year-end, Fidelity serviced 27.5 million members of workplace retirement plans. It serviced another 8.9 million retail households, plus 8.7 million institutional accounts.Those totals were 6%, 6.8% and 4.1% higher, respectively, than at year-end 2015.Fidelity mutual fund managers found it harder to beat their peers in 2016. Fidelity mutual funds beat 58%, 68% and 70% of their peers for the trailing one-, three- and five-year periods that ended Dec. 31. They outperformed 72% of their peers in the one- and three-year periods and 71% of their peers in the five-year span.Still, the outperformance rate was high. ""To beat 58% of your peers and have that as a bad year — most fund companies would kill for that number,"" said newsletter editor Lowell. ""The falloff reflects the difficult time active managers had during the six-week Trump (inspired) market run-up. Odds are they'll be back to outperforming 70% or more in 2017. That is excellent.""The annual report is a must-read mainly for Fidelity employees, who control 51% of the voting stock, while the Johnson family controls the other 49%.Abigail Johnson is chairwoman of parent company FMR. She succeeded her father, ""Ned"" Edward C. Johnson III, late last year, shortly before her 55th birthday. Ned Johnson had been chairman since 1977.Fidelity was founded by Abigail's grandfather, Edward C. Johnson II, in 1946. His father, Samuel Johnson, worked in the family dry goods business at the C.F. Hovey department store.Abigail's brother, 52-year-old Edward C. Johnson IV, is president of Fidelity's Pembroke Real Estate division.Going forward, a key challenge for Fidelity is persuading customers — especially mutual fund investors — of the value of active management. ""Broad indices are holding fair or fully valued stocks (after the long market run-up),"" Lowell said. ""Active managers can look at which stocks have the best cash flow, best defensive characteristics, best growth opportunities, rather than buying bundles of high-priced stocks passively.""Formally, the annual report is for Fidelity Financial Services, which consists of Fidelity Investments and the other financial services lines of parent company FMR. It excludes FMR's nonfinancial businesses such as its hotel and real estate operations.Fidelity has lagged rival Vanguard in attracting net new money from shareholders.In 2016, Fidelity saw the second-largest net outflow from mutual funds, as shareholders hit the firm with $24.5 billion in net redemptions, according to Morningstar Inc. That left Fidelity with $1.2 trillion in mutual fund total net assets. That asset count reflects open-end mutual funds and excludes money market funds and funds of funds.Fidelity's mutual fund outflow was exceeded only by Franklin Templeton Investments' $43.2 billion in net outflow. Franklin Templeton had $378.7 billion in total net assets.Net inflow to passively run Fidelity funds — mainly exchange traded funds — reduced its combined mutual-fund-and-ETF net outflow by about $1 billion.Whether it was flow just to mutual funds or to funds plus ETFs, shareholders largely had low costs on their minds. That made index mutual funds and ETFs popular destinations for net inflow. ""By far, 2016 belonged to Vanguard,"" Morningstar editor Tom Lauricella and senior analyst Alina Lamy noted in a recent report. ""The low-cost juggernaut dominated the flows landscape to a remarkable degree.""Vanguard drew net inflow to its mutual funds that vastly outpaced its rival firms'. Vanguard lured in a net $182.997 billion to its mutual funds.All other mutual fund complexes with inflow — there were 314 if them — had combined net inflow of $151 billion.Vanguard also attracted $94.26 billion in net inflow to its ETFs.Still, Fidelity had bright spots. Investors poured $37.2 billion in net inflow into passively run Fidelity mutual funds and ETFs. The trouble was that investors yanked a net $60.5 billion from Fidelity's actively run funds and ETFs.And three Fidelity portfolios were among the 12 top stock mutual funds of 2016 in terms of gathering net inflow. Now-$111.4 billion Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FUSEX) pulled in a net $7.3 billion, fourth best. Sixth best was now-$5 billion Fidelity SAI U.S. Large Cap Index (FLCPX), which drew in a net $4.4 billion. And 11th best was now-$4.3 billion Fidelity SAI U.S. Quality Index (FUQIX), which attracted a net $3.2 billion.In addition, a trio of Fidelity money market funds had massive net inflow, which are not reflected in the Morningstar flow data for long-term funds.Fidelity Institutional Government (FIGXX) pulled in $74.8 billion in net inflow. Fidelity Government Money Market Fund (SPAXX) drew a net $37.7 billion. And Fidelity Government Cash Reserves (FDRXX) pulled in a net $21.3 billion.Industrywide, money market fund inflow was driven by investor uncertainty. Investors are unsure how markets will respond to President Trump's policies, actions by the new Congress, the strong dollar, expected additional interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and global political events, Tom Roseen, head of research services for Lipper, told IBD.Another reason for volatile flow into and in some cases out from money market funds is the new Securities and Exchange Commission rule requiring certain money market funds to impose redemption fees and limits to discourage shareholder exits in time of market stress, Roseen says.The funds with net inflow hold government-issued debt. Referred to as government money market funds, funds in that group are generally exempt from the gates-and-fees requirement. In turn, that makes them popular with investors who do not want their ability to exit the fund to be limited or subject to penalty fees.RELATED:Are Fidelity's Recent Stock Buys And Sells Retirement Account Hot Sauce?Vanguard Net Fund Inflow Dwarfed Its Peers' In 2016Vanguard Drew The Lion's Share Of 2016's Mutual Fund Net Inflow

251,GOOG,"Want to put Fidelity Investments' world-class research resources to work for your retirement accounts and your taxable portfolios? Of course you do.Knowing how the Boston-based asset management giant has deployed the assets of shareholders in its stock mutual funds and balanced funds can help you make decisions about your own buys and sells.For example, in the fourth quarter Fidelity trimmed its exposure to several big technology bellwether stocks. Not all Fidelity funds may act in lockstep, but overall the fund complex lightened its net share count in Facebook (FB) by 5.1%, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & mutual fund research for CFRA, an independent research firm.Facebook is ranked No. 4 on IBD's Internet-Content industry group, thanks in part to a strong 91 Composite Rating from IBD and 87% average earnings per share growth over the past three quarters. 99 is the highest possible rating, which is on a scale from 1-99.Fidelity's Facebook holding is now at its lightest quarter-end level since the end of 2013, Rosenbluth says in a new report for MarketScope Advisor.Facebook has rallied 16% since the beginning in a year to an all-time high. Subsequent disclosures by Fidelity will reveal whether it's been a buyer of Facebook shares in the current period.The fund complex also trimmed its net share count in Google-owner Alphabet's C-class shares (GOOG) by 5.6% and its A-class shares (GOOGL) by 1.4%. Alphabet has rallied 6% so far this year. It faded after clearing the 816.78 buy point of a flat base on Jan. 23. It's retaken the buy point.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) was a third tech big name to be trimmed by Fidelity. Fidelity also trimmed Salesforce.com (CRM), a provider of customer relationship management software.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia ranks No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, buoyed by a solid-gold 99 Comp Rating and six straight quarters of EPS growth acceleration. For details, check the stock's vital signs at IBD's Stock Checkup.Still, tech remained Fidelity's biggest sector, accounting for 26% of the fund family's shareholders' money. That was an increase from Sept. 30's 24% and June 30's 23% weighting.And many Fidelity funds, including some of its largest, remained owners of stock in which the overall complex made net trims.For instance, now-$35.3 billion Fidelity Growth Company Fund (FDGRX) held Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia and Salesforce.com in its top 10 at year-end.And there were several tech names in which Fidelity made net increases in its share counts during Q4.Fidelity boosted its share count in software giant Microsoft (MSFT) by 9.3% to 148 million shares. That was the highest share count since the end of 2014, Rosenbluth wrote.That was the highest share count since the end of 2014, Rosenbluth wrote.""A few other stocks that had double-digit percentage share increases include Autodesk (ADSK),"" Rosenbluth told IBD, referring to the developer of computer-aided design software applications.Financials were Fidelity's second-largest sector, with 15% of shareholders' assets. That increase took place as Fidelity increased its exposure to some big U.S. banks.Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) all saw double-digit percentage share count growth, Rosenbluth wrote. He added, ""CFRA thinks investor optimism for banks improved amid expectations for higher interest rates and regulatory reform.""President Trump and Congress are widely expected to lighten the regulatory restrictions on some banks.In addition, Fidelity made a double-digit percentage increase in its share count in Capital One Financial (COF).The $414.3 million Fidelity Blue Chip Value (FBCVX) held Alphabet, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo in its top 10 at year end.Fidelity had a 9% weight in industrials as of the end of Q4. Fidelity managers made a 53% net addition to their share count in aerospace and defense contractor Northrop Grumman (NOC) in the quarter. They added 6.7% to their shares in General Electric (GE).Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon (VZ) were two stocks in which Fidelity managers made double-digit share increases.Tech was not the only space in which Fidelity funds made cuts. Fidelity managers made double-digit decreases to telecom titan AT&T (T), energy explorer and producer Chevron (CVX), medical products maker Medtronic (MDT) and to athletic apparel, footwear and equipment maker Nike (NKE).Each of those decreases appears vindicated at this early point following the quarter. Comp Ratings for each of those stocks current range from an anemic 27 for Chevron to Nike's 59.All of Rosenbluth's data applies to Fidelity's 232 stock and balanced funds (mixtures of stocks and bonds), which together hold nearly $1 trillion in shareholder assets, according to Morningtstar Inc.Fidelity runs an additional 70 funds that hold bonds or commodities, accounting for an additional $233 billion in shareholder money.RELATED:P-s-s-st!

252,GOOG,"Michael Clarfeld has helped steer $5.6 billion ClearBridge Dividend Strategy Fund (SOPAX) to solid performance by pursing high-quality stocks that provide price appreciation with improving dividends.The fund he co-manages has returned an average annual 8.89% in the three years ended Jan. 31, topping 80% of the diversified income-oriented stock mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. The fund's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.12%.His bull's-eye is dividend growth, not high dividends. He and co-managers Harry Cohen and Peter Vanderlee favor stocks that are financially healthy enough to pay dividends that rise. They avoid those with yields that are inflated either by companies desperately trying to attract investors or by falling share prices.The bonus is that the financial strength that provides a launchpad for dividend growth inoculates stocks against the risks of a rising interest rate environment, he says.""Stretching for yield is risky,"" he warns. ""Dividend growth is the place to be. That growth can offset the negatives of rising rates.""Dividends can be shock-absorbers, smoothing investors' rides during market turmoil. Yet their stock holdings still offer the potential of price gains, the thinking goes.Just look at some of his fund's holdings. Among the fund's four holdings with the highest Composite Ratings from IBD, Texas Instruments (TXN) is up 43% in the past 12 months ended Jan. 31; it has an annual dividend growth rate of 15.3% in the past three years, according to dividend.com. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is up 42%; its dividend growth rate is 10.6%. Automatic Data Processing (ADP) is up 22%; its dividend growth rate is 6.8%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is up 41%; its dividend growth rate is 31.2%.IBD'S TAKE: UnitedHealth is No. 1 in IBD's Medical-Medical Care industry group. To see how the company's growth metrics — like its strong 87 IBD Composite Rating and four straight years of earnings per share (EPS) growth — stack up against its rivals, visit IBD Stock Checkup.That volatility antidote of dividend-paying stocks might come in handy sooner rather than later. The market has traded sideways since mid-December as investors wait to see how the newly installed president's policies play out and whether a Republican-controlled Congress makes good on the business friendly actions investors expect from it.Stocks offering dividend growth also might fare better than bonds if the Federal Reserve makes good on its signals that it intends to raise rates multiple times this year.From his office in Manhattan, 39-year-old Clarfeld talked with IBD about whether it's wise to own a dividend-paying portfolio in a rising rate environment and his fund's overall investment approach.IBD: Do you ever give in to temptation and buy high-yield stocks?Clarfeld: If you buy only stocks with high current dividends, you miss out on some good stocks. We own American Tower (AMT), for instance, which is a wonderful business. (Its share price is up 34% since the end of 2012. Its dividend yield is 2.2%.) But it only began to pay dividends in 2012. So you have to be open-minded.We used to own Heinz (now part of KraftHeinz (KHC)). Several years ago it was much easier to find great companies with solid growth and high dividends like Heinz. But then it got taken over. We couldn't find a replacement that was as good a company with a good growth rate and a high current yield, so we ended up tilting more toward dividend growth and a little less toward high current yield as the impacts of quant easing became more pronounced over the last many years.IBD: Dividend growers are among the most stable companies. Why not buy shares in them directly and avoid a fund's expenses?Clarfeld: There are a couple of reasons. One is diversification. It would not be particularly efficient for an individual to buy 4o to 50 stocks. The broker commissions would add up.And the average person who has a job and a family does not have time to follow 50 different companies, industries, competitors and figure out which to buy, the correct time to buy, and so on.IBD: You began a stake in JPMorgan Chase (JPM) not long ago, but well before its recent Trump bump. What's your thesis?Clarfeld: We bought it early in the year when it was yielding north of 3%. (Yield now is 2.3%.) Pre-election, there was so much investor fatigue toward large banks, prices were very beaten down. And the prospect of interest rates going up, it seemed like it would never happen. And it seemed like regulatory pressures would persist forever. We just thought the valuation was too pessimistic. And JPMorgan has lots of franchises that are valuable.IBD: Texas Instruments' (TXN) earnings per share growth has accelerated for four straight quarters. What's driving it?Clarfeld: We like their emphasis on analog chips. If you think about Texas vs. Intel (INTC), which we also own, Intel makes the brains of computers. They are high performance, high dollar value. Texas focuses on the other end of the spectrum. Their chips sell for 10 to 20 cents. They are basic but high quality. And they're attractive because they are the largest player in that space.Anyone designing a new alarm clock or refrigerator or car and needs basic chips knows that Texas Instruments has them. And once those chips are designed into something, it rarely changes. So they provide a recurring revenue stream like an annuity.High performance chips require huge R&D spending. Texas Instruments' chips are much less capital intensive. So they can direct 100% of their free cash flow to shareholders.IBD: Automatic Data Processing (ADP) got a nice Trump bump. But you've owed this for years, right?Clarfeld: It's been a core holding for 10-plus years. It's a business we think can compound earnings for years. And payroll processing provides recurring revenues. Once you get a company's payroll, the business is sticky. This company benefits from job growth in the economy. It is taking share. And it provides ancillary services. They help companies deal with Affordable Care Act compliance, although a potential repeal or replacement is now a risk for them. Still, the ACA is not a core driver of this business.And recently it's benefited like a lot of financials from rising interest rates. They earn a float on payrolls they handle. Rising rates mean that float will increase.IBD: You reopened your stake in Alphabet (GOOG) after closing it. What brought you back?Clarfeld: We're a dividend portfolio. We don't go looking for nondividend-payers, but we don't want to be overly dogmatic. We wanted this exposure and there is no other way to get it.Over the past 10 years, we've owned three nondividend-payers: Apple (AAPL), Berkshire Hathaway (BERKB) and Alphabet. There is no search company like Google. There is no company like Berkshire Hathaway, which won't initiate a dividend while Warren Buffett is alive. After he's gone, who knows? And we think Alphabet will likely initiate a dividend in the future. We're not forecasting that, but we think they will.IBD: You trimmed your Waste Management (WM) stake. Why is that?Clarfeld: Actually, it's an example of a business we like. The business is stable and predictable. It's cyclical with the economy. There's been enough consolidation to make the industry rational. In fact, they've been able to drive prices higher despite a relatively weak economy. We have trimmed some just on valuation.IBD: What distinguishes Walt Disney (DIS) from other media names?Clarfeld: Their ability to create properties and then monetize them. They make movies, then turn it into a theme park attraction and then sell merchandise from it to kids. They show an ability to do that in a way few other companies can.And they own ESPN, which is dominant in sports. The biggest piece of ESPN is monthly subscription income, not advertising, and their paid subscribers are growing. So their revenue is stable and predictable. They have multiyear contracts with (cable) systems, with built-in (price) escalators.IBD: Is Home Depot (HD) a play on an expected pickup in economic growth?Clarfeld: What we like about it is not what's going to happen to the economy in 2017. We don't own a lot of retailers because they're hard to understand. And they have a fashion element, which can become unpopular suddenly. Home Depot is not like that. They're not trying to call a fashion fad. And they don't need to spiff up their stores, which are warehouses. It took a huge step down in the financial crisis. We bought it back then. Our cost basis is below 30. (Now it's trading around the high 130s.) It's a play on people spending on their homes.IBD: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has trended higher since the election. Is this a play on the expectation of reduced health care regulation?Clarfeld: They have diversified their operations. The stock has done well because people expect reform or changes under the new administration that will be market based. Company management is very commercially oriented.RELATED:Where Vanguard's CEO McNabb Sees Fund Giant Headed In 2017Where Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stocks Gains In 2017After 2016 Ends On Strong Note For Mutual Funds, What's Ahead For 2017

253,GOOG,"Facebook (FB) stock pierced its 200-day moving average early Monday, as did Alphabet (GOOGL), as the largest tech stocks — FANG plus Apple (AAPL) — continued to fall in the wake of Donald Trump's surprise presidential win.Trump has championed Rust Belt issues and has specifically criticized Apple and Amazon.com (AMZN). He's also feuded with the Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon found and CEO Jeff Bezos.Sectors such as banks, drugs and defense have gotten a boost from the Trump win, and those stocks could be getting some funds that had gone to the biggest tech stocks, in a sector rotation.""Mega-cap tech stocks where hedge fund clients were broadly overweight appear to have been viewed as 'safe' and are being used as a source of funds for the rotation into financials, health care and industrials, where investors were not positioned,"" Morgan Stanley said in a research note Monday. ""AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN are among the 10 worst-performing mega-caps relative to what our model would have expected given broader macro moves.""We are underweight technology, viewing the crowding as an issue and concerned about the ability of the group to expand margins, an important element of multiple expansion in tech stocks.""Facebook stock ended trading down 3.3% to 115.08 on the stock market today, at a more than four-month low. Shares on Thursday pierced the 200-day average, a key support line, for the first time since Jan. 20, as Facebook had been a leading stock this year. On Friday, Facebook stock closed right at its 200-day line. The stock is down 17% since touching an all-time high of 133.50 on Oct. 25. Ironically, some pundits says fake news sites on Facebook contributed to Trump's win, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has sharply objected.""Personally I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, of which it's a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,"" Zuckerberg reportedly said at the Techonomy conference on Thursday near Silicon Valley.Trump has criticized Apple for manufacturing its smartphones and other products overseas. Apple CEO Tim Cook also had been a big supporter of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Apple stock fell 2.5% to 105.71 Monday, at a two-month low near 104.50, and has been trading below the key 50-day support line all month. Shares are approaching the 200-day line, which the stock hasn't breached since July.The president-elect, however, has proposed a one-time big tax cut for U.S. companies looking to bring cash back from overseas. That could be a big plus for Apple, which leads in cash holdings at a gaudy $230 billion-plus, but the great majority of those funds are overseas. The company faces a huge tax bite if it tries to move that cash back to the U.S.Google-parent Alphabet saw its stock pierce its 200-day line for the first time since mid-July. The Google Home smart-home speaker, which started shipping this month, is seen as a solid challenge to Amazon's hit Echo smart speaker, but Alphabet recently pulled back on its Project Wing drone initiative.Alphabet stock dropped 2.4% to 753.22, a four-month low. Shares are down more than 8% since the election.Streaming-video leader Netflix (NFLX) was down 1.2%, to 113.38 at the close Monday. That's a one-month low, but the stock remains above its 50- and 200-day lines. It also is forming a cup-with-handle base, with a possibly buy point at 129.40, but the stock has fallen 10 days out of the past 11 trading days, including Monday.Amazon stock gave back 2.7%, to 719.07. Trump has talked about what he says might be unfair tax advantages that the No. 1 online seller might have enjoyed, though he's made no specific proposals. Amazon stock is down 8% since Wednesday, following Trump's victory. Amazon shares fell below their 50-day line on Oct. 28, for the first time since late June, and are getting fairly close to the 200-day line.RELATED:Apple, FANG Stocks Not Joining Trump RallyBiotech, Drug Stocks Fly On Clinton LossApple, Others Eye Trump's Overseas Cash Tax Plan

254,GOOG,"In a strong market, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) would be looking very attractive. The search giant's stock is close to a potential buy point, consolidating near record highs.In the current shaky market, investors should be cautious about making any purchases. But you should always be looking for quality stocks forming sound consolidations.Among those bullish patterns is the flat base, where leading stocks can catch their breath for several weeks before trying to make a new advance. Flat bases are common now given the market's subdued, sideways action until the last week or so.Alphabet leads four top-rated stocks that are in flat bases. All four -- the others are Nvidia (NVDA), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Equifax (EFX) -- have found support at or near the 50-day moving average recently.IBD'S TAKE: The flat base is a sideways pattern, with a smaller decline than in other patterns. It can be of short duration (minimum five weeks) and often forms after a breakout from a cup-with-handle or double-bottom base. Here's a quick explainer on how to identify a proper flat base.Alphabet is a fairly typical example of a flat base. The stock broke out of a double-bottom base with a 753.58 entry in late July. Shares peaked at 813.88 on Aug. 11, then began consolidating in a sideways. Shares never fell more than 4% from the high, finding support last week just above the 50-day moving average, closing Friday at 797.97. The flat base entry point is 813.98.Alphabet shares rose early but closed down 0.3% at 795.39 on the stock market today.Fundamentals: Q2 adjusted earnings rose 20% vs. a year earlier, picking up from 14% in Q1. Total revenue growth has trended higher, with Q2's 21% increase the best in two years. Core revenue, which excludes traffic acquisition costs -- what it pays partner websites to carry ads -- climbed 22%.RELATED:Google Rebounds With Big Q2 EPS, Revenue BeatNvidia makes chips for gaming, autonomous driving and artificial intelligence.The stock had a long run up before peaking at 63.50. Shares moved sideways, finding support at the 50-day line on Sept. 12 as rebounded last week. At five weeks, Nvidia now has a flat-base pattern with an 63.60 buy point. Nvidia closed Friday at 62.86.Nvidia rose 1.3% to 63.67 after climbing as high as 65.26. The stock closed just above the pivot point, but volume ended about average. It's a tough time to be making any new buys, in any caseFundamentals: Earnings skyrocketed 700% in the latest quarter.

The stock has a buy point at 137.07.Equifax reversed to trade down 0.5% at 131.55.An extra note of caution. Equifax is in a fourth-stage base. Late-stage bases are more likely to fail.Fundamentals: Q2 earnings rose 24%, the best quarterly gain in three years. Sales climbed 20%, the most in several years.

256,GOOG,"Taxes: The European Union's laughably misnamed ""competition commission"" has slapped a $15 billion penalty on Apple for supposed back payments of taxes. This is nothing more than a cash grab by money-hunrgy Eurocrats, and is Exhibit A in why the EU is failing.We'll spare you all the dry technicalities of Apple's case because, in fact, the EU is going after a whole slew of mainly U.S. companies that do business there — including Google, Amazon, Starbucks and McDonald's. The reasons in each instance are as varied as the companies themselves.In Apple's case, the EU accuses it of dodging taxes by booking profits not where they're earned, but in Ireland, with which Apple signed a tax deal years ago and where its regional headquarters is.As an example, the EU claims Apple paid 0.005% of its profits as taxes in 2014 — roughly equal to about $50 for every $1 million in profits. For the record, Ireland's corporate rate is 12.5%, about $125,000 per million.So Ireland must be furious about being cheated out of so much tax revenue, right?Wrong. The deal is this: Apple creates jobs, and Ireland keeps taxes low. Simply put, it's a great deal for any country that seeks economic growth — and has the common sense to pursue it.In effect, the EU has gone back and retroactively rewritten tax law to suit its ideas of ""fairness."" It may also slap another $6 billion on Apple's bill for ""interest"" -- which is absurd, considering the EU's negative interest rates.All this has enraged Apple, not known for throwing public tantrums.""The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple's history in Europe, ignore Ireland's tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process,"" said Apple CEO Tim Cook.""The Commission's case is not about how much Apple pays in taxes, it's about which government collects the money. Apple follows the law and pays all of the taxes we owe wherever we operate. We will appeal and we are confident the decision will be overturned.""The U.S. Treasury is likewise angry, accusing the EU of trying to turn itself into a global tax regulator — imposing taxes on U.S. companies it really has no jurisdiction over, in the name of ""competition."" To top it off, the EU decision comes just two days after a top German official pronounced free-trade talks between the U.S. and EU ""dead.""Whether Apple wins its appeal is questionable. But either way, the EU almost certainly will lose as a result of this.As we said, the EU these days goes after virtually every successful American company that operates in its territory. And it jealously punishes its own members within the 28-nation bloc that actually compete to make their economies better — which is exactly what Ireland did.Europe has fewer and fewer innovative, champion companies these days, because of the massive amounts of regulation they face. So the EU's assault on highly successful U.S. businesses is in part out of envy — Apple iPhones are near ubiquitous across Europe. There is no real European alternative.In going after these American champions that so improve European life, the EU routinely vilifies those it has targeted, treating them as if they were pirates — not job creators.Yet, these corporate villains employ thousands of Europeans, and, yes, also pay taxes. But they never pay enough to satisfy the far-left Eurocracy that has spent the EU into near-bankruptcy.Apple shows what happens when unelected bureaucrats have power to control businesses. In this instance, Margrethe Vestager, the grandly titled EU ""competition commissioner,"" is an inveterate leftist politician from Denmark who has repeatedly gone after successful companies to shake money out of them.This latest salvo will no doubt be greeted with huzzahs in the EU's headquarters in Brussels and Luxembourg. But it shouldn't be.These attacks on successful, mostly U.S.-based companies will backfire horribly. The EU already struggles with high unemployment, low growth and lagging standards of living — but not because Apple isn't paying enough in taxes.Apple employs 22,000 workers in Europe, out of a worldwide workforce of 370,000. And it supports another 257,000 or so jobs at other companies worldwide. Those are huge benefits to the economies they operate in.Would chasing Apple and other winners from Europe serve any purpose?Already, there is talk of companies rethinking their EU strategies. After Brexit, a more pro-business Britain could become a very attractive alternative to the EU's socialist planners. Heck, even strife-torn, authoritarian Turkey is rolling out a welcome mat to Apple.The U.S. is little better. It taxes U.S. companies at an absurdly high 35%, when the average rate for other nations is below 25%. If the U.S. reformed its tax code, the $2 trillion or so stashed overseas in corporate accounts would come flooding back, creating thousands and thousands of jobs.In the meantime, the EU has investigations going on just about every major successful U.S. company doing business there. But companies will only take so much abuse. Sadly, the EU's socialist-leaning rulers show no signs that they get it.RELATED:EU: Apple Must Pay Ireland $14.5 Billion In Taxes No, Brexit Won't Kill U.K. Brexit Fears Weren't Overblown — They were Flat-Out Wrong

272,GOOG,"The terrorist attack in Paris this month that left at least 130 dead is igniting more debate on the already hot-button issue of encryption. A legislative fistfight in the U.K. over Internet surveillance could buoy similar measures in the U.S., where law enforcement has long clamored for access to Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG) -owned Google encrypted communications, an analyst told IBD.U.S. counterterrorism officials renewed calls for backdoor access this week in the wake of the Nov. 13 massacre in Paris. The Islamic State terror group claimed responsibility, saying it was the ""first of the storm.""But law enforcement will face a bitter battle from Silicon Valley and privacy advocates who have overwhelmingly launched staunch opposition to any legislation that would mandate that companies decrypt customers' information.They'll have to do so without support from the overall Obama administration which, in October, retreated from FBI-backed calls for government access. FBI Director James Comey is seemingly leading the charge amid worries that ISIS is using encrypted communications to avoid detection.All Eyes On The U.K.U.S. lawmakers appear unwilling to support backdoor access to locked communications, FBR analyst Daniel Ives told IBD. Still, the eyes of Washington are now on the U.K., where the Investigatory Powers Bill is under heated debate.The Paris attacks ""changed the game,"" Ives said. Although French authorities haven't said whether encrypted communications were used to organize the attacks, it seems likely, Ives said. An abandoned cell phone helped French police track down the alleged ringleader.""But this is a much broader issue,"" he said, ""because a lot of malicious actors over the last year have communicated through encryption, and it's really created a lot of challenges for law enforcement.""The U.K. bill, introduced in May, has made it further than any U.S. cybersecurity bill and could signal changing attitudes on the encryption issue, he said. In the U.S., however, similar bills emphasize ""voluntary information sharing"" between private enterprise and the federal government.Last month, the Senate passed the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, 74-21. In April, the House passed the National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act of 2015 by a vote of 355-63.""The differences between the bills will need to be reconciled before going to the White House,"" Ives said. ""We do not expect the bills to be reopened or expanded in the wake of the Paris attacks.""Opposition on Capitol Hill — and within private and public ranks — include ""privacy advocates who are ideologically opposed to any bill compromising encryption, and those who are concerned that backdoors would be exploited by hackers,"" Ives said.The 408 BlockBasically, ""if you have a 408 area code, you're against (decryption legislation),"" Ives said. ""Any tech firm in Silicon Valley is against this, just as part of the solidarity.""Apple CEO Tim Cook lands squarely in the opposition block. In September 2014, Cook wrote that Apple wouldn't share its data with any government.""I want to be absolutely clear that we have never worked with any government agency from another country to create a backdoor in any of our products and services,"" he wrote on Apple's website. ""We have also never allowed access to our servers. And we never will.""To that point, Apple doesn't have access to encryption keys, which are stored locally on each smartphone. Touch ID scans a user's fingerprint and then tokenizes it, according to Apple's Privacy page. That token is then stored within the device.Apple declined to comment for the story.It's a common standard, Proofpoint (PFPT) CEO Gary Steele told IBD. Proofpoint, a Sunnyvale, Calif.-based cybersecurity firm, encrypts data in two ways — encrypted email and a cloud-based email archival system.""We give the encryption key to the customer,"" he said, explaining that the key is stored within a box inside the cloud. ""We don't stand in the way of the customer's privacy.""Could Proofpoint give the government access to a customer's data?""We couldn't,"" Steele said. ""We would prefer to see law enforcement work with the customer because it's their data, their information and their employees.""Fallout In Snowden's WakeEdward Snowden's 2013 release of thousands of classified documents revealing NSA surveillance programs still weighs heavy on American thought, Ives said. He estimates that there's a $30 billion, three-year encryption market opportunity.The number of encrypted applications has also skyrocketed since, Check Point Software (CHKP) researcher Shahar Tal told IBD. That's why legislation forcing decryption in cooperation with law enforcement is relatively fruitless, he said.""People who want to encrypt, no one will ever be able to stop them,"" he said. ""The fact that Apple is doing it and putting encryption in the device is something that's helping every(body) do that without effort. But, anyone who wants to properly encrypt, can properly encrypt.""ISIS proved as much last December. An eight-minute video circulated to members discusses surveillance techniques of hostile governments and how phones can be tracked, according to the Wall Street Journal.In January, an online follower ranked 33 encryption applications. Signal, RedPhone, Wickr and Telegram Messenger topped the list, according to Computer World . ISIS has since moved official communications to Telegram Messenger from Twitter (TWTR).Apple devices, on the other hand, were deemed ""dangerous"" and banned among Islamic State members, according to tech site Arab Crunch .Smartphone Firms Draw The LineStill, law enforcement isn't letting up on Apple and Google, and Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance recently noted that 111 cases handled by his office were hampered by encrypted devices.""The line to protect the public should not be drawn by two companies who make smartphones,"" he said, according to Bloomberg.But Vance isn't calling for backdoor access per se — rather he's asking that companies download encrypted data for investigators with a warrant.On Nov. 18, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, National District Attorneys Association President William Fitzpatrick, FBI Agents Association President Reynaldo Tariche and National Sheriffs' Association CEO Jonathan Thompson joined Vance in calling for Apple and Google to cooperate with law enforcement.The letter addressed Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai and outlined ""deep concern with the new encryption software installed on Apple and Android cell phones."" Google representatives didn't return an email requesting comment.""Even with a valid search warrant, the current encryption measures utilized in your phones make it impossible to access evidence of a crime,"" they wrote. ""Without law enforcement access to this vital information, you have created a safe harbor for criminals where they may operate freely.""They relied heavily on the 2012 Steubenville High School rape case to underscore their point. In August 2012, an intoxicated 16-year-old West Virginia girl was repeatedly raped by two of the Ohio high school's football players and sexually assaulted by others. The crimes were later documented on social media.Ohio investigators seized more than a dozen cell phones during the investigation. The analysts uncovered ""hundreds of incriminating text messages and pictures,"" according to the letter.""But for the evidence recovered from personal cell phones, that high school girl and her family would likely never have seen justice served,"" they wrote.'Mandating Insecurity'Exceptional access by law enforcement would ""introduce unanticipated, hard-to-detect security flaws,"" a coalition of MIT researchers wrote in July. Essentially, where there's a hole in security, there's a potential exploit — and hackers will find it.They likened it to ""mandating insecurity.""""We believe that law enforcement has failed to account for the risks inherent in exceptional access systems,"" the researchers wrote. ""Based on our considerable expertise in real-world applications, we know that such risks lurk in the technical details.""Such access would force a ""U-turn"" in best security practices and substantially increase complexity in an already complicated, delicate system. Agencies holding those backdoor keys would be especially vulnerable to attacks, they wrote.""If law enforcement's keys guaranteed access to everything, an attacker who gained access to those keys would enjoy the same privilege,"" they wrote.Georgia Institute of Technology law and ethics professor Peter Swire testified in July before the Committee on the Judiciary, noting that law enforcement already has the tools it needs for effective surveillance.""We are currently in the golden age of surveillance,"" he wrote in a July editorial on Slate.com. ""The 'going dark' argument should not be used as a reason to support backdoors or other special access by law enforcement to encrypted communications.""Over the past 20 years, smartphone innovations have allowed law enforcement to track suspects through GPS and compile lengthy dossiers on their contacts and digital lives, he wrote. Text messages, too, are often available via the network provider.Like the MIT researchers, he noted the inherent vulnerabilities within backdoors.""The inability to access the content of a small fraction of these communications does not warrant the subsequent damage that would result to privacy and to the U.S. economic, diplomatic and security interests,"" he wrote.

293,GOOG,"Wall Street pitted No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) against Apple (AAPL) chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) on Friday in a battle for data-center market share.The clash comes as Intel, after the close Tuesday, is expected to report roughly in-line Q3 revenue and an 11% decline in earnings per share ex items vs. the year-earlier quarter.Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel has owned the market for chips that power data-center servers, Richard Windsor, an analyst with Edison Investment Research, wrote in a research report Friday. On Thursday, Qualcomm announced an ARM-based data-center system-on-a-chip.""Over the years, server processors have consolidated in the hands of a couple of heavyweights, so competition could do the industry some good,"" Qualcomm wrote on its website.San Diego-based Qualcomm, with help from partners Xilinix (XLNX) and Mellanox (MLNX), could pose a threat to Intel, said Windsor. Intel sells $12 billion to $14 billion annually to data centers and enjoys 90% of the market, he said.""Qualcomm is the king of execution, and if it can get a foot in the door, then there could be real trouble on the horizon for Intel,"" Windsor wrote.Qualcomm, though, is planning a realignment and in July announced it would cut 15% of its workforce, or some 4,700 jobs.An ARM processor in general uses less power and generates less heat than its Intel counterpart.""The net result is substantially lower running costs because power is far and away the biggest operating expense of a data center,"" Windsor wrote.To be truly competitive, Qualcomm will need to completely rewrite its software. But that's what big ecosystems like Google (GOOG), Facebook (FB) and Apple want, he wrote.""This gives them the ability to do whatever suits them in the data center,"" he explained.MKM analyst Ian Ing, on the other hand, sees Intel and Qualcomm as complementary. Their cooperation ""increasingly makes sense,"" he wrote in a report.The semiconductor sphere will likely see more consolidation ""with Intel potentially playing a role,"" Ing predicted.Intel To Report Q3Intel is expected to report an 11% decline in Q3 earnings per share vs. Q3 2014, to 59 cents, according to the consensus of 48 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Analysts expect $14.2 billion in revenue, down 2.5%.Three months ago, Intel guided for $13.8 billion to $14.8 billion in revenue.MKM's Ing forecasts an easy beat for Intel.""Due to low expectations, we think results and guidance at consensus will be viewed as positive,"" he wrote. ""Given the lack of follow-through to recent PC build activity, investors question whether Intel set a high bar with implied Q4 revenue up 4% to 5%.""Intel is beating the odds of the weak PC market, he wrote.""We think Intel was early to fully de-stock (its PC channel inventory) compared to broad-based semi(conductor companies),"" he wrote.Also, demand remains strong in the hyper-scale cloud market, and Intel will likely focus on data centers in 2016, Ing wrote. Servers bring in about 30% of Intel's revenue, Nomura analyst Romit Shah wrote in a research note.Ing rates Intel stock a buy, with a price target of 40. Shah is neutral on Intel stock and has a 33 price target.Intel stock fell 1.2% Friday, to 32.14. Qualcomm stock rose a fraction, to 57.78.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

294,GOOG,"Little Lies.....Fleetwood Mac - Tango in the Night - 1987 ""If I could turn the page, In time then I'd rearrange just a day or two, I couldn't find a way, So I'll settle for one day to believe in you........Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies...Oh no, no, you can't disguise....""
"
295,GOOG,"And so - let the confessions begin - or not......Yesterday - Citron Research - a firm that publishes negative research and actively makes bets against companies - made some very high-profile allegations against Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) using phrases like - ""web of deception"", ""Fraud"", calling it the ENRON of the pharmaceutical industry.....Now for those of us who actually remember the ENRON scandal - that was not good.... and or those of you who do not - let me outline it....
"
296,GOOG,"At the height of its 'season' Enron was an energy, commodity and pulp and paper services company based in Houston, TX. Ticker symbol on the NYSE was ENE and it was one of the most actively traded stocks at the time.....Everyone wanted to be 'in' ENRON.....there was always a big crowd, big trades, lots of action.....Just the name caused your blood to pump and your brow to sweat.........and it was right outside of my booth... ..so the energy and excitement was never far away...... It was a company that claimed to have $100 bil. in revenues in 2000 and for 6 consecutive years was named one of ""America's Most Innovative Companies"" by Fortune magazine..... and then in December 2001 - they filed for bankruptcy and it all went POOF!
"
297,GOOG,"Rumors had been building for weeks, questions raised, stories written....but remember - there was NO Internet, no Facebook, no Twitter.....so the news moved a bit slower....but it moved just the same....and then it was revealed...that all of that money and supposed financial condition......was nothing but a fraud.......I will never forget the action on the floor of the NYSE at the time - the stock crashed, dozens of brokers, vying for position, the roar of the market at work....the energy, the excitement, the tension, it was a broker's dream......it was the very definition of the functionality of the exchange....it was the very core, the heart and soul of capitalism........ and so today when something or someone is ENRON-like - it is accusing them of fraudulent and corruptive behavior....It is essentially a death knell......
"
298,GOOG,"At about 10:13 am yesterday - the headline hit Twitter - Citron Research was calling 'VRX the pharmaceutical ENRON ' and the rest is history.....The stock crashed - Now the stock fell 30% in 30 mins......only to rally and then fall another 18% by 1:30.....Then Bill Ackman (large shareholder) comes out and announces that he was buying 2 mil more shares....and the company defends itself saying that the report is 'erroneous full of false and misleading statements'......""We categorically deny the allegations"".....Oh boy.....Now it's gonna get interesting..... The stock closed last night at $118.61 (down 28% on the day) and this morning in the pre-market , the stock is trading at $117...this is a story that is far from over.....so sit down and pay attention.....One day there will be a book written about this....
"
299,GOOG,"So - that was all the excitement yesterday - pharma and healthcare - and that managed to cast a pall over the broader market...... The decline added to the market's losses from Tuesday and came on top of crude oil price weakness and investors focusing on the latest wave of companies reporting quarterly financial results. The lower close reflected ongoing concerns about corporate earnings and the outlook for the global economy. Now yes BA, and UTX did help to push industrial names higher but the broader market suffered under the negative tone created by the action in VRX and a buildup in oil reserves.......

300,GOOG,"A DOE (Dept. of Energy) report showed an 8.0 mil barrel inventory build in crude oil, which is the highest weekly inventory build since April 3rd and dramatically higher than what was expected - this caused oil prices to fall $1.09 closing at $45.20. We are still holding within the range ($43/$50), but are now worried if the intermediate-term is looking more and more challenging as supplies continue to build. This morning - oil is trading up a bit - so the churn remains.

301,GOOG,"As we have noted this is the one to keep your eyes on...a breach below $43 a barrel will bring more selling in the market despite all of the chatter that the Fed governors might say.

302,GOOG,"Weak earnings continue to pressure stocks....and because earnings expectations have been lowered, when a company beats its expectations it doesn't necessary mean we're expanding - it just means that they beat lowered estimates - just like when you buy or sell a stock in pico seconds - it does NOT mean you did a good job...it just means you did it fast....

303,GOOG,"So now 3rd quarter earnings for the S&P are coming in slightly better than expected....analysts are now calling for a 4.8% decline in profits - better than the original 7% decline they had prepared us for - this because 70% have beaten the estimate while only 40% are beating the top line.....(disconnect) .....Now 9 of the 10 sectors in the S&P 500 moved lower yesterday. Energy stocks fell the most on the back of weaker oil, industrials the only sector to rise thanks to BA and UTX......

362,GOOG,"Verisk Analytics has watched its stock price soar to new highs, again and again, after its quarterly earnings reports. The stock notched a new high a couple of weeks ago after the company reported second-quarter earnings. The same thing occurred after it posted first-quarter and 2014 fourth-quarter results.Verisk (VRSK) provides risk assessment services and decision analytics to professionals in a variety of fields, including property/casualty insurance, financial services, health care, government, human resources and energy — the last of which it entered in May via the biggest acquisition in its history.The company has been on a pretty good roll of late, with three straight quarters of accelerated earnings gains.Earnings AccelerateAfter the close on July 28, Verisk posted a 35% year-over-year earnings increase — its biggest in at least a dozen quarters. Results easily surpassed consensus analyst views. The next day Verisk stock climbed 9% to a record high of 79.88 intraday before closing up 7% to 78.60.Similar spikes occurred on April 29, a day after Verisk reported Q1 results, and on Feb. 25, the day after it reported 2014 fourth-quarter earnings.How does Verisk view such stock action?""It's always interesting to try to understand that. Fundamentally, I'd say all of our verticals are doing well,"" said Eva Huston, Verisk's senior vice president and chief knowledge officer.In addition, she told IBD, the company has ""a lot of consistency"" in terms of financial performance.""Investors value that,"" she said.That consistency is partly the result of having expertise that spans more than 40 years.Verisk was founded in 1971 when Insurance Services Office, or ISO, launched operations as a not-for-profit advisory and rating organization providing services for the U.S. property/casualty insurance industry. The original business remains part of the company's Risk Assessment segment. Verisk also operates a Decision Analytics segment, which now makes up the bulk of the business.The Risk Assessment segment primarily helps property/casualty customers define, measure and manage risk via the flagship ISO subsidiary as well as several other units. The products and tools include data and statistical services, actuarial services, standardized insurance policy programs, underwriting information and rating-integrity tools.Its Decision Analytics segment provides a wide variety of customers with tools to help them make informed decisions about managing their assets and risk. These tools are used to predict future losses, select and price risk, detect and prevent fraud and quantify losses that have already happened.Decision Analytics Drive GrowthIn the second quarter, the Decision Analytics business posted a 24.6% revenue increase to $325.9 million, with more than half of the gain coming from the insurance sector. Revenue in the Risk Assessment segment grew 6% to $171.7 million.Total revenue for Verisk rose 17.5% to $497.6 million. Organic revenue, which excluded recent acquisitions and other items, grew 9.4% year over year.Verisk's second-quarter earnings came in at 77 cents a share, up 35.1% from a year earlier and well above consensus estimates for 66 cents.Technology Pays BackMuch of Verisk's recent profit growth can be traced to what it calls a ""build it once, sell it many times"" revenue model, as well as investments the company has made in new solutions, Huston says.""Over the past few years we have been doing more investing in our business, thinking up new analytics to help customers run their businesses better,"" she said.Huston cites the company's investments into its new software platform called Touchstone. Touchstone is designed to perform advanced analytics to help companies better assess their risk.""That took a fair amount of investment, but it allows us to increase our revenue growth,"" Huston said. ""We are now providing a solution that might have been used in a small portion of the insurance industry before, but can now be used by underwriters and a wider portion of the industry.""Similar investments have been made in Verisk's aerial imagery tools. Among other things, these tools let insurance customers view structures from their computers to assess associated risk. This lets them avoid the time and cost of visiting the structures themselves.Verisk's biggest investment came in May, when it closed its $2.8 billion acquisition of Wood Mackenzie, a Scotland-based provider of data analytics and commercial intelligence for the energy, chemicals, metal and mining industries.One major benefit of the acquisition — the biggest in Verisk's history — is that it greatly expands the company's global footprint.""Wood Mackenzie has offices around the world — in Tokyo, Hong Kong, China, Australia, all throughout Europe,"" Huston said. ""We can leverage that footprint into selling our existing solutions into those markets. For example, we have the opportunity to expand our footprint into China, where we didn't have a presence.""In a recent report, JPMorgan analyst Andrew Steinerman noted that ""WoodMac has the ability to transform Verisk on the global front,"" though the acquisition ""bears risk due to its energy end market."" He also expects reinvestments in WoodMac ""to boost revenues over the medium term.""The deal has already paid bottom-line benefits, notes Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Arash Soleimani: ""Verisk's (Q2) outperformance relative to our estimate stemmed mostly from likely recurring tax benefits associated with WoodMac's UK domicile and higher-than-expected gross margins.""Apple And Android AppsMeanwhile, Verisk continues to broaden its product lineup. On Aug. 5, it announced that its Verisk Insurance Solutions unit launched the ISO ClaimSearch mobile application available on Apple's (AAPL) iTunes and Google 's (GOOG) Google Play.The app gives subscribers, including adjusters and investigators, a new tool that provides real-time access to the company's database of claims.""ISO ClaimSearch mobile users will see instant search results to help them investigate and adjust claims more efficiently, whether they're on a roof, in a salvage yard, in a home, at a business, or at a catastrophe site,"" Carlos Martins, vice president and general manager of ISO ClaimSearch Solutions, said in a statement.Users will be able to securely access the claims inquiry function on ISO ClaimSearch via their iPhone, iPad or Android phone and tablet.Verisk has an IBD Composite Rating of 95. The company belongs to IBD's Commercial Services-Market Research group, which ranks No. 64 of 197 industries tracked. The group's biggest stocks by market cap are Thomson Reuters (TRI) and Moody's (MCO).

Besides QQQ, $13 billion Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and $7.71 billion Vanguard Information Technology (VGT) also hold Apple as their No. 1 stock.These smaller, highly rated technology ETFs will also be in investors' sightlines ahead of July 21: IShares U.S. Technology (IYW) holds $2.91 billion in assets and earmarks a hefty 20.6% of assets to top holding Apple. The portfolio includes 137 stocks in total. It's pricier than VGT and XLF, with a 0.45% expense ratio, but is described as more of a pure-play technology ETF. It has virtually no exposure to financial or communication services, unlike its larger counterparts. Fidelity MSCI Information Technology (FTEC), a $432.9 million ETF, also has Apple as its No. 1 holding. It's more diversified than IYW, with 396 stocks. That, coupled with a 0.12% expense ratio — matched only by VGT — make it a top choice for tapping the technology sector.Most major ETFs holding domestic stocks tracked lower Wednesday as investors digested earnings and economic data reports.

450,GOOG,"When Qualcomm set out to develop a more accurate sensor to authenticate fingerprints, the chipmaker chose ultrasound technology — the same high-frequency sound waves used by doctors to examine pregnancies.""It actually sees into the ridges of your fingerprint and pores of your skin,"" said Tim McDonough, Qualcomm's (QCOM) vice president of product marketing. ""That's the starting point. Then we encrypt the fingerprint and store it inside (Qualcomm's) Snapdragon processor. That's basically our brain inside the smartphone.""The Sense ID ultrasonic 3D fingerprint reading technology lets smartphones scan fingerprints through cover glass, sapphire or other material, giving smartphone designers more flexibility, he says.Qualcomm is among the tech companies developing biometric authentication technology aimed at doing away with passwords.""We all have too many passwords to deal with,"" said Mark Hocking, general manager of Intel (INTC)'s Safe Identity division, who says the effort to improve biometric authentication comes as no surprise given that personal identities are increasingly at risk.""Because this is such a big problem and because there are many different players and different approaches to solving the problem, there is a lot of experimenting and solution development going on. ..,"" Hocking said. ""We think we're unique in that we're trying to solve this problem holistically for consumers, which means across all their devices.""Windows 10 AuthenticationIntel's RealSense 3D camera, which uses infrared technology to enable biometric authentication, will be part of Microsoft 's (MSFT) new Windows 10 authentication feature, called Windows Hello.Intel Security also has unveiled its True Key password management application that can be installed on smartphones, tablets or computers. It uses biometrics factors such as fingerprints and facial recognition, using your ""facial math,"" Hocking said. The app also helps users choose stronger passwords with a password generator that uses military-grade encryption and multiple advanced-security technologies.Hocking said True Key's ""Face Unlock"" feature works by taking a template of your face and creating a mathematical representation of the key facial features, such as the distance between your eyes. The calculation, not a photo, is stored locally and encrypted on a person's device.The goal of getting rid of passwords has been talked about for years. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates predicted it in February 2004, when speaking at an RSA Conference on security.Advances in biometrics technologies are bringing the concept of fewer or no passwords closer to reality, and opening up market opportunities. The worldwide market for fingerprint sensor-enabled devices alone is expected to reach 1.4 billion units by 2020, up from just 317 million units last year, says market research firm IHS.Ninth-Grader's ProjectCompanies are exploring better ways to authenticate fingerprints, faces and components of the human eye such as the retina and iris, as well as behavioral characteristics such as how a person types on a keypad, writes a particular phrase or signs their name.Budding scientist Nikhil Behari's ninth-grade science project, at North Allegheny Intermediate High School in Pennsylvania and featured at the White House in March, showed how connected sensors and a microprocessor could be combined to detect keystroke pressure and recognize a person's unique typing pattern, adding another level of security.Fujitsu's PalmSecure ID Match biometric authentication uses the unique pattern of veins in the human hand to verify identities.More companies are offering layers of security through hybrid biometrics, combining physical and behavioral characteristics such as voice recognition. Chipmakers are partnering with other companies to leverage expertise and differentiate their products.Cypress Semiconductor (CY) has combined its touch-sensing controllers, touchscreen and other sensor technologies with Norway-based Idex ASA's patented SmartFinger fingerprint-sensing technology to create the TrueTouch Fingerprint Reader.""Barriers to entry are considerable in the emerging market for fingerprint readers, in part because of the highly specialized intellectual property and complete solution that's required to compete,"" Cypress CEO T.J. Rodgers said in the company's press release last month on the partnership.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) is partnering to bring its microcontroller, for ""always-on"" sensor processing applications running on a smartphone, with Next Biometrics' fingerprint sensor. NXP also is working to improve biometric authentication for smartcards.SmartMetric  has embedded a fully functional biometric fingerprint reader inside a credit card-sized identity card, using miniaturized radio frequency technology.Synaptics (SYNA) has developed its Natural ID fingerprint identification process using proprietary imaging technology and matching algorithms. The sensor requires a single touch rather than a swiping motion to unlock devices and access online services such as banking, retail and social media portals.Synaptics' Natural ID technology is in Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphones. Synaptics is looking at many other uses for biometrics, including applying eye-scanning technology and fingerprint-sensing in cars and in gaming.Synaptics, Cypress, Qualcomm, Microsoft, NXP, Google (GOOG) and PayPal are part of the Fast IDentity Alliance (FIDO), a consortium launched in 2012 to create interoperability among different platforms for hardware and software makers, financial firms and others.FIDO's first industry standards for online authentication are available and are being implemented in authentication products and services.Qualcomm Rolls Out ZerothFIDO member Nok Nok Lab's authentication technology is being used by fellow FIDO member MedImpact Healthcare Systems' physician access portal to enable doctors and other health care providers to log in with a fingerprint reader.Qualcomm is rolling out its Zeroth ""cognitive computing platform,"" a platform in development for years, McDonough says. Its technologies, including the new Snapdragon 820 chip, aim to set the stage for a new level of ""intelligence,"" personalization and security for mobile devices.Zeroth combines sensors, cameras, processors and other components to enable devices to analyze, learn and act on a person's behavior. Their technology also enables devices to recognize scenes, patterns and objects and read handwriting, among other things.Hocking said Intel is ""just getting started"" with technologies to give users better security while still providing easy access.""We view it as a multiyear journey that takes consumers from the point where they are today — which is overwhelmed with passwords — to eliminate that hassle,"" Hocking said. ""But that's going to take a long time because passwords are everywhere. This isn't a flip-a-switch type of problem.""

470,GOOG,"Earnings season kicks into high gear this week, with a slew of high-profile quarterly results from some of the biggest and brightest companies. Many are the first to report for their given industry, giving investors a particular interest in analyzing the financials and outlooks.Here are six of the most important earnings reports on tap.TuesdayCharles Schwab (SCHW) was a pioneering discount brokerage, but it's still blazing new trails. Schwab shares hit a 13-year high on March 21. The stock consolidated and attempted a breakout on July 3. It fell back as the market sold off, though in light volume. Schwab rose 0.7% to 27.10 on the stock market Friday.Wall Street expects Schwab to report a 28% earnings per share gain to 23 cents. That would snap 3 quarters of accelerating growth.J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM) has had a tough time of late. Once deemed the best-run Wall Street bank, JPMorgan Chase has paid billions of dollars in various settlements. Mortgage activity has slowed — affecting many lenders — while fixed-income trading seems permanently depressed. JPMorgan said in a SEC filing that it expected Q2 market revenues down 20% vs. a year earlier. Finally, the company reported on July 1 that CEO Jamie Dimon has throat cancer, though that should be ""curable.""Shares have retreated since hitting a 14-year high in late March.JPMorgan earnings likely fell 19% to $1.29 a share, matching Q1's 19% year-over-year decline. JPMorgan is just one of several major bank earnings. Wells Fargo (WFC) reported earnings Friday. Citigroup (C) reports Monday, with Goldman Sachs (GS) joining JPMorgan on Tuesday. Bank of America (BAC) results are due Wednesday.Intel (INTC) has seen a rebirth in recent months, with shares recently hitting a 10-year high, in the wake of solid Q1 results in early April and then upwardly revised revenue guidance on June 12. Intel is benefitting from the recent revival in corporate PC sales after Microsoft (MSFT) stopped supporting the venerable Windows operating system.Intel earnings should show a 33% gain to 52 cents a share, following yearly changes of -5%, 6%, 0%, -28% in the prior four quarters. Investors will want to have some indication if PC sales will remain strong in the second half of the year, or if Intel will find some other way to expand.Yahoo (YHOO) earnings will rise 9% to 38 cents a share, following Q1's flat reading. Q1 revenue edged higher, as display ad sales climbed 2%, offering some hope that CEO Marissa Mayer can generate top-line growth. Still, Yahoo's most important news may be about Alibaba. Yahoo owns a minority stake in the Chinese e-commerce giant, and it gives some headline figures on Alibaba's results.Alibaba's planned U.S. IPO is widely expected to take place in August. Yahoo will sell a significant share of its existing holdings as part of the offering.Yahoo shares have been in a downtrend since hitting a decade-best in early January.WednesdayLas Vegas Sands (LVS) is the world's largest casino operator. Despite its name, Sands — like Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and MGM Resorts (MGM) — gets the bulk of its revenue and profit from Macau, China's gaming enclave and the world's largest gambling site. Macau growth has slowed in recent months amid a crackdown on moneylenders in the area. But there are some signs that the worst is over for Macau. Meanwhile, Las Vegas casino revenue has been solid.Las Vegas Sands earnings should show a 40% gain to 91 cents a share, analysts predicted. That would the second straight quarter of moderate acceleration.But Sands stock has been in a modest downtrend for the past four months, falling below its 50- and 200-day moving averages last week.ThursdayGoogle (GOOGL) is involved in many ventures, from self-driving cars to alternative-energy investments to Android mobile software. The open-source Android has become the global leader over Apple (AAPL) iOS. It's a direct money-maker, though it likely does help boost mobile ad revenue. Search-based ads remain the bulk of Google's business. But it's a good business: Earnings likely rose 31% to $6.26 a share. That would follow decelerating growth for the past two quarters to just 8% in Q1.Google shares hit a record high of 615.05 in late February. The stock consolidated and has been building a handle on its cup base.

582,GOOG,"Short-messaging service Twitter has made its name worldwide by letting users share real-time information in 140-character posts called tweets that can also display photos and videos — and now they may let people ""click to buy.""Largely through use on mobile devices, Twitter (TWTR) has lately helped ignite online conversations on topics ranging from disgraced Minnesota Vikings football star Adrian Peterson's child-abuse charges to the execution of a British aid worker by Islamic State militants.The service is where many people now go to find breaking news, follow celebrity gossip and keep up with colleagues, friends and acquaintances. More than a million apps now interact with it, from games to trend trackers.The San Francisco-based microblog platform already counts 271 million average monthly users, but it has even bigger ambitions.This month, Twitter raised $1.8 billion in its first fundraising campaign since its November 2013 IPO . The campaign was originally slated as a debt offering of $1.3 billion, but the company boosted the stakes as investors showed a strong appetite for the convertible notes.While Twitter is popular, a longtime question has been: How can it make substantial money? Efforts to bolster an already-hefty cash war chest come as the company is forging into e-commerce and mobile advertising while tweaking its website to bring in more users and entice them to return.Feathering A Nest EggBeyond reserving an undisclosed part of net proceeds to pay for the cost of the convertible-note hedge transactions and ""general corporate purposes,"" Twitter hasn't specified uses for its growing financial holdings. In addition to the $1.8 billion from the debt offering, it possesses $2.46 billion in cash and other assets, according to its second-quarter earnings report. And its $32 billion market capitalization gives the firm additional Wall Street heft.To expand its money-making abilities, Twitter has bought several complementary companies, including social data analytics startup Gnip in April and mobile ad exchange marketplace MoPub in September 2013.Twitter CEO Richard Costolo highlights this summer's World Cup soccer championship as an example of the company's potential. The Germany vs. Brazil World Cup game alone was the subject of 2 billion tweets, said Costolo on Twitter's Q2 conference call, describing how it was handled as ""a kind of events experience that I have wanted to see from us for some time.""Twitter users can follow other users who tweet about things they're interested in, and they can search for topics by keywords and even stock symbols (with a dollar sign in front) such as $TWTR.Most tweets can be seen by all users, although a private conversation can be held through what are called direct messages.Potential new services include the ability for users to send direct messages privately to entire groups rather than just one-to-one, Twitter Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto said at the recent Citi 2014 Global Technology Conference in New York.Tweeting To TransactSpringboarding into e-commerce, Twitter rolled out a ""buy"" button on a limited basis this month. It lets users make purchases directly from some tweets.""The ability of this platform to sway public opinion, to allow the world's most interesting things to be shared virally — and, of course, to promote products, services and people — seems to be just getting started,"" wrote Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham in a report initiating his coverage of Twitter.""We believe the platform's utility has a good chance of ultimately being on par with Google (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB), and that its evolution will pave the way for significant value creation over time,"" he wrote.Canaccord gave Twitter a buy rating and price target of 62.Twitter ranks 13th in size by market cap among companies in IBD's Internet-Content industry group. China search giant Baidu (BIDU) is the largest in the group, which ranks No. 37 in performance of 197 groups tracked. Twitter has an IBD Composite Rating of 83 out of a possible 99, measured by key metrics such as revenue and earnings growth.Social networking giant Facebook is Twitter's top rival because its advertising services are most similar to Twitter's offerings of video ads and ""buy"" buttons, notes research firm eMarketer. Twitter also vies in the booming mobile ads space with search giant Google (GOOG).Twitter gets most of its business from mobile, with 81% of the company's advertising revenue generated from mobile devices in Q2.The company's ad revenue comes from businesses that pay for ""promoted tweets,"" which appear in users' personal timelines (a timeline is a list of tweets) or in their search results, blending in with ordinary postings but noted as ads. Twitter also makes money from selling advertiser-run ""promoted accounts"" and ""promoted trends"" that advertisers create. Those items can appear in users' timelines or elsewhere on the site.Google will capture an estimated 40.3% of U.S. mobile Internet ad revenue in 2014 — excluding so-called traffic acquisition costs paid to partner sites that carry their ads — and Facebook will have 18.7%, while Twitter is projected to report a 3.8% share, eMarketer said.Rising ad revenue and income from recent acquisitions are contributing to growth for Twitter, which reported its third consecutive quarter of revenue acceleration in Q2, with sales hitting $312.2 million, up 124% year-over-year. The results beat estimates from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, who had expected sales of $283.1 million.Twitter earned 2 cents a share excluding various items in Q2, beating Wall Street expectations of a 1-cent loss and following a 12-cent loss a year earlier.For Q3, the company guided revenue in the range of $330 million to $340 million — with the midpoint almost double its year-earlier revenue. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect $360.1 million.As Twitter's spending continues, analysts expect EPS of just 10 cents this year but 37 cents in 2015.Twitter has a sales presence in more than 40 countries, but just three — the U.S., U.K. and Japan — contribute the most revenue, Twitter CFO Noto said on the Q2 conference call in July.International ExpansionOverall, Twitter's rate of user growth is slowing. The company's worldwide monthly active user base rose 24% in Q2 year-over-year, compared with growth of 44% year-over-year in Q2 2013.Twitter added 3 million new users in the U.S. in Q2, reaching 60 million. It added 13 million international users, reaching 211 million — more than triple its U.S. user base. Even so, international sales comprised just 33% of revenue in Q2.International growth could eventually become a bright spot, analyst Graham says.""Monetizing those international users is a key opportunity,"" he said, since Twitter earned $3.05 in ad revenue per monthly active user in the U.S. in Q2, compared with just 45 cents internationally. ""We look to the continued rollout of Twitter's self-serve ad buying platform, now available in 20 countries, to help this gap close more quickly.""International sales in Q2 jumped 168% year-over-year to $102 million as Twitter rolled out self-service ad platforms for small- to medium-sized businesses in Spain, Israel, South Africa and elsewhere.""We see significant room for international revenue growth as we continue to expand the direct sales, sales support staff, reseller efforts and the continued rollout of our self-service advertising platform,"" said Mike Gupta, Twitter's senior vice president of strategic investments, on the earnings call.

636,GOOG,"Firms will spend $6 billion on Facebook (FB) ads in 2014. Social media is crucial, says Jim Tobin, author of ""Earn It. Don't Buy It: The CMO's Guide to Social Media Marketing in a Post Facebook World,"" but he sees better ways to make money while using the social forum. Tips on monetizing marketing:• Provide valuable information. Useful content spreads through social media because people want to talk about it, Tobin says. So make marketing material compelling.Jay Baer, author of ""Youtility,"" puts it like this: ""The best way to break through in that incredibly cluttered (Internet) environment is not to shout louder but rather to create marketing that is truly and inherently useful. That's why today's smart marketing is about help, not hype. ... It's marketing that customers want to receive.""Tobin's research shows that earned mentions — free blogs and videos — drive visitors to a website at three times the rate of paid social media ads. ""We should think about content and promotions that people want to share first, and only use paid ones to supplement the reach of our best efforts,"" Tobin told IBD.• Turn it up. Shoppers crave data. Baer cites Google's (GOOG) finding that Americans needed 5.3 sources of information before making a purchase in 2010 and 10.4 by 2011. ""Because they have always-on Internet access via smartphones and tablets,"" he said, ""customers are hyper-researching purchases, and your company must fully provide information in a self-serve capacity.""• Blog. It boosts your Internet traffic. Baer found that companies that write on the Web at least 15 times a month draw top reaction.• Use multiple channels. Don't limit social media marketing to one site, says Tobin. While Facebook is the social king, smaller sites such as Instagram and Snapchat have more passionate communities.Rich Rodman, CEO of compliance software provider Crowdentials , notes that he's received a great return using Twitter (TWTR) and LinkedIn (LNKD). ""LinkedIn is actually one of the fastest-growing social networks on the Internet,"" he said, ""with two new people joining every second."" Rodman also is on board with LinkedIn groups, which share company news, media mentions, events and ""other items to build brand awareness within your target audience.""• Use success metrics. Technology can help you determine if your social media marketing is effective.""In social media, we look at the total brand mentions in a category, people talking about each brand on Twitter, in forums, in blogs, on public Facebook messages,"" Tobin said. ""If there were 10,000 mentions of three companies in this example, how many mentions were for your company? If 3,400 were, then their online share of voice would be 34%.""• Get visual. People are drawn to images and videos that are shareable and convey a strong message. Infographics are especially effective, contends Rodman. Choose carefully, he cautions: ""If a picture speaks louder than words, you don't want to relay the wrong message.""• Host webinars. Promote them through social media.""Not only is a webinar a good way to educate people, but it frequently serves as a sales call among many customers,"" Rodman said.• Take the long view. ""Giving away useful information and resources to customers without necessarily expecting something instantly in return requires companies to trust that consumers will reward the brand eventually with attention, sales and loyalty,"" said Baer. ""The difference between helping and selling is just two letters. But in modern marketing, those two letters make all the difference.""

637,GOOG,"Do you want to find great stocks? If so, think new.IBD research shows that the market's best winners had their biggest price advances not long after going public. That's because companies with new products, services or technologies tend to produce strong sales and profit growth before the competition has a chance to catch up.The IPO Analysis column appears every Tuesday and Thursday. The stocks went public in the past three years and are selected from a computer-generated screen that picks out the best new issues based on key fundamental and technical criteria. They include profit and sales growth and relative price strength.The screen yields as many as 32 stocks. Typically, half the charts will run on Tuesday and the other half on Thursday. Tableau Software (DATA), whose software turns huge amounts of data into easily understood graphs, was one of three recent IPOs featured in the Jan. 27 inaugural column.On that day, the stock closed at 73.50 — still in buying range after breaking out above a 71.88 buy point from a narrow cup-with-handle base. Volume on the breakout — and in subsequent days — was weaker than you'd like to see on a breakout.So investors could have waited for the stock to clear a later buy point at 77.84, or 10 cents above the left-side high of the cup. It did so on Feb. 5 (please see a daily chart), gapping up in huge volume on a better-than-expected Q4 report. Profit jumped 400% to 20 cents a share, topping the prior quarter's 300% increase. Revenue soared 95%, picking up from gains of 62%, 71% and 90% in the prior three quarters.Tableau's base was smooth and symmetrical and showed plenty of accumulation. Also, its Relative Strength line hit a new high on the Feb. 5 breakout, boding well for the stock's success.Tableau is now 26% past the 71.88 early buy point and 16% above the 77.84 entry. It could offer a new entry later. If it stays strong, Tableau may show up again on the IPO Leaders page.Some big winners will quickly form IPO bases, which are shorter in length than traditional patterns shaped by more established stocks. Study the price-and-volume action within the base and wait for a big move in heavy trade before making a buy. Google (GOOG) broke out of a four-week IPO base in September 2004, about a month after its debut, and nearly doubled over the next two months before pulling back to form a traditional cup base.

638,GOOG,"Data have long fueled the relationship between sports and their fans. Now, with Big Data tools enabling the collection and analysis of seemingly limitless types of sports-related information, the flow of sports data is poised to accelerate.""If there's data out there, I want it,"" Christy King, vice president of IT for Ultimate Fighting Championship, said following a session at the recent On Deck West sports technology conference in San Francisco. ""It's really about becoming a mini-Google. Collect all the data, analyze it, and spit out something useful.""For King and others who spoke at On Deck West, useful data are fast becoming a — pardon the expression — game-changer. And it's not just about the fan anymore. The explosion of sports-related data targets everything from fan engagement to coaching decisions to venue management.So, while King clearly wants to feed more data to fans — for instance, UFC is working on an app that could one day provide biometric data about fighters during matches — she also is thinking about how data can improve other aspects of the sports-viewing experience.King told On Deck West attendees there's no reason venues can't use wireless networks to anonymously track fans as they move around an event, using the resulting data to, say, locate memorabilia concessionaires in the highest-traffic locations. Or let fans know via a venue mobile app which restrooms have the shortest lines.One intriguing emerging use of data in sports comes from Muthu Alagappan, a data whiz who wowed the basketball world with a presentation at the 2012 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. Alagappan, a data scientist at Big Data startup Ayasdi, was at On Deck West to echo his MIT presentation, sharing how he's analyzed all manner of National Basketball Association statistics to completely rethink the way basketball is played and coached.Alagappan's work uses statistical data to show how the NBA has boxed its players into sometimes ill-suited positions using antiquated assumptions about skill sets. In other words, rather than typecasting a player as a point guard, Alagappan's approach might instead label a player as a ""ball-handling jump shooter"" or a ""3-point-shooting defensive specialist,"" providing more insight into how a player should be used.The goal, Alagappan told On Deck attendees, is to stop shoehorning players into positions and instead develop strategies that make the best use of their actual skills.Data Flows Through HoopsMultiple NBA teams have asked Ayasdi about using its technology to implement Alagappan's approach. Alagappan told On Deck attendees the implications of his work go to sports' bottom line.""We no longer have to guess about what the best strategy is,"" he said. ""We can use data analytics to determine the strategy that gives us the best chance to win a basketball game.""Alagappan's work also can be applied to situations, not just players. For example, the prevailing wisdom in basketball dictates that when a team is down by two points in the final seconds, it should go for a two-point basket to force overtime. But Alagappan said his analysis shows this approach gives a team only a 25% chance of winning (50% for the tying shot, and then 50% in overtime), while having a 30% 3-point shooter put one up from beyond the arc improves the odds of victory.""We finally have the chance to challenge the assumptions we've held for decades,"" he said.Data also can be used to improve player safety, as was demonstrated by a team of developers who were finalists in a nationwide series of hackathons hosted by On Deck West's organizers.The team, which called itself NoBrainer, advanced from a preliminary regional competition in Boston with a helmet-mounted device that illuminates when a health-threatening impact occurs. The device detects collisions, collects and analyzes data on those collisions, and provides color-coded visual alerts.NoBrainer didn't win the national competition at On Deck West — that honor went to ""Team Pharker,"" which emerged from an earlier round hackathon in Los Angeles with an application that would let fans who don't want to pay venue parking fees connect with nearby residents looking to sell parking spaces on their property.Make no mistake, though: No matter how many creative uses of data are invented, the main focus is on fans' in-game experience. And there's plenty of creativity when it comes to keeping fans engaged.For example, one of the hits at On Deck West was a Google (GOOG) Glass application for baseball fans called Blue that essentially puts the scoreboard directly in the fan's field of vision and adds data such as what type of pitch was just thrown or who's warming up in the bullpen.And there are fan-focused data plays that bring fantasy-like action into the venue. Case in point: Binary Event Network's TradeSports, a mobile app that leverages the company's financial trading platform to let fans make bets on ""game action"" — game results, player stats, play choices and more.""It could help retain audiences during blowouts,"" Douglas Atkins, senior managing director for Guggenheim Partners, which counts BEN among its portfolio companies, told On Deck West attendees.When it comes to such apps reaching their potential, however, UFC's King said the so-called ""second screen experience"" won't take off until sports venues establish stronger Wi-Fi infrastructures.She said the widespread weakness of Wi-Fi at venues is not only preventing mobile apps from functioning in the stands, it's also preventing UFC from getting data out of facilities and into its cloud-based content delivery stream.Larry Scott, commissioner of college's Pac 12 Conference, agreed with King's concerns. Scott, whose conference last year formed its own TV network, worries that the out-of-stadium experience with data is improving much faster than the in-stadium experience.Failing to provide dependable Wi-Fi access at venues, he told On Deck West attendees, is akin to depriving sports fans of oxygen.There you have it in a nutshell: data access as oxygen. If that doesn't speak to the rising profile of data in sports, nothing will.

641,GOOG,"Becoming an excellent investor isn't so much about what you know as what you know to ask.Savvy investors differ from amateurs on that score. The savvy investor knows what to ask, and knows the most important question takes just three words: Is it working?Everything the savvy investor does proceeds from the answer to that question.Questions from amateurs are far different. The questions often revolve around a bargain mentality: Is it cheap? Is it getting cheaper? Should I buy more now that the stock has dived?Sometimes the questions reveal a disposition to argue with the market: Why is my stock going down? Why doesn't the Fed do something? Why don't they fire the CEO? Why doesn't the SEC investigate these crooks? What's that guy who works at the company and often posts on the stock message board think?Online forums are filled with these kinds of desperate and inane questions from shareholders. It's as if there were a federal law that prevented anxiety-filled shareholders from selling a stock.Now consider the beauty of the right question.Is it working?Those three unemotional words sweep aside all the noise. It doesn't matter if the stock is Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG) or a recent new IPO like Zulily (ZU).Is it working?If you want to put a sticker on your computer to remind yourself what investing is mostly about, those three words might be it. The answer to that question will guide the experienced investor to the right action. Either the stock is working or it is not.If the stock isn't working, the choices are simple. If the movement is sideways, you might give it more time. If the movement is down, you might sell all or part of the investment.An investor needn't wait for the stock to trigger the 8% sell rule. William J. O'Neil's ""How to Make Money in Stocks"" mentions one money manager who favors selling half of a position when the stock is down 5% from the buy point and the other half position if it falls 10%. This is a useful approach, especially for people who find it hard to take a loss in one gulp.What if the stock is working?Savvy investors and amateurs differ on this, too.When a stock is working, the savvy investor will force-feed the stock, adding more shares to his or her position at appropriate junctures. Those junctures might include a three-weeks-tight pattern, a first or second trip and bounce off the 50-day moving average and a new early stage base.Granted, the add-on buys are small compared to the original stake (the exception: a breakout from another early stage base ). However, if the investor is riding a monster stock, the additions on the way up can add significantly to the dollar gains, even as they trim the percentage gain.Amateur emotions come into play on force-feeding, too.The amateur doesn't like adding shares to a position that's working for two reasons.First, he or she is convinced that it's dangerous to buy a rising stock. Second, the amateur likes to brag about how much he or she is up. While add-on buys might add profits, the percentage gain will be smaller.And that's yet another difference. For wise investors, stocks are about making money. For amateurs, it's all about their ego.

678,GOOG,"Speculation that Google (GOOG) could add wireless service to areas where it builds out a superfast fiber-optic broadband network has analysts mulling a wide range of options.The Information, a pay-walled website, on Thursday said Google approached Verizon Wireless (VZ) about a wholesale deal. Under one scenario, Google could lease network capacity from Verizon, which has the biggest 4G LTE network, to offer its own services.Over the years, Google has also been linked to a possible networking leasing deal with Sprint (S), which trails Verizon and AT&T (T) in building out a 4G network. And Google in 2012 reportedly talked with Dish Network (DISH), a satellite broadcaster that has been amassing wireless spectrum.Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan, in a research report Friday, speculated that Google might even acquire T-Mobile US (TMUS), which is 67% owned by Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY).Google said in February that it's in talks with 34 cities in nine U.S. markets to expand its 1 gigabit-per-second Internet service. Google is already building out fiber-optic networks in Kansas City, Mo.; Austin, Texas; and Provo, Utah. The company says it's in talks with government officials in Portland, Ore.; San Jose, Calif.; Salt Lake City; Phoenix; San Antonio; Nashville, Tenn.; Atlanta; and North Carolina's Charlotte and Raleigh/Durham.None of Google's proposed or already built-out markets include areas where East Coast-based Verizon sells its FiOS broadband and TV service via a high-speed broadband network.Another potential partner for Google could be Globalstar Telecommunications, which is seeking regulatory approval to use 2.4GHz spectrum for a large-scale urban Wi-Fi network, says Stephen Sweeney, an analyst at institutional broker-dealer Elevation.

692,GOOG,"RELATED: Google Will Benefit From Rising Mobile CPC: Analyst.Google's (GOOG) efforts to move all its advertisers to a single multiplatform ad-buying system is paying off and could return per-click ad rates to growth in 2015, an analyst said Friday.The company's so-called ""enhanced campaigns"" gives ad-buyers a single portal for buying ads on desktops, tablets and smartphones.The search leader last year switched all advertisers to that system, a move that added to its quarterly declines in cost-per-click ad rates, or CPC. That decline is the result of advertisers unwilling so far to pay as much for mobile ads as their desktop counterparts.But Google's CPC rate could ""rebound sometime in 2015"" as advertisers warm to ""newer digital platforms,"" wrote Wedge Partners analyst Martin Pyykkonen in a Friday research note.Google stock was about even in midday trading in the stock market today.Google and online advertising rivals like Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) are all eyeing mobile advertising as drivers for growth, with varying success.Google's share of the global mobile ad market by total sales is expected to slip in 2014, as it loses share to Facebook, according to research firm eMarketer.Facebook's 2014 share is forecast at 21.7%, up from 17.5% in 2013, according to eMarketer research released Wednesday.

693,GOOG,"Now you see it, now you don't.
"
694,GOOG,"The main feature of Snapchat is that the photos you send to friends through the app disappear 10 seconds after they're received. That makes people more comfortable sending shots they might not want friends, family or others to keep.
"
695,GOOG,"Many people see it as a more private alternative to a site like Facebook (FB) or Facebook-owned photo-sharing app Instagram.
"
696,GOOG,"Snapchat became better known after it rejected a reported $3 billion buyout bid by Facebook and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, in November. Just three months later, Facebook reached a deal to buy text-messaging service WhatsApp for an astounding $19 billion.
"
697,GOOG,"Venice, Calif.-based Snapchat's chutzpah in rejecting Facebook's offer is being put to the test. Incidents over the past few months have put the privacy of Snapchat in question. These include:
"
698,GOOG,"A mid-November child pornography scandal in Montreal, in which teenage boys reportedly were snapping pictures of 13- to 15-year-old girls in sexual poses, and telling them the pictures would disappear. Instead, the boys took screenshots of the photos and transmitted the photos to others.
"
699,GOOG," A New Year's Eve incident in which, reportedly, hackers broke into Snapchat's servers and gathered more than 4 million phone numbers and user names.
"
700,GOOG," A recent vulnerability uncovered by a Spanish researcher, who showed a Los Angeles Times reporter how the Snapchat app can be used by hackers to slow, or even freeze, activity on users' phones.
"
701,GOOG,"Snapchat responded to two of these incidents. A week after the New Year's leak, the company rolled out a security fix that lets users opt out of its ""Find Friends"" feature, which was how these data could be collected. It apologized.
"
702,GOOG,"On the phone-freeze incident, Snapchat spokeswoman Mary Ritti says the firm implemented a fix when it learned of the problem.
"
703,GOOG,"""We believe this has resolved the issue. To the best of our knowledge no users were impacted,"" she said.
"
704,GOOG,"The first incident was reported shortly after news surfaced of Snapchat's Facebook offer and rejection. It also was widely reported that Google (GOOG) offered $4 billion for the firm. Snapchat and Google declined comment on the reports.
"
705,GOOG,"Snapchat is popular among teens and young adults, a group that seems to be leaving Facebook.
"
706,GOOG,"Research firm iStrategyLabs has found that since 2011, Facebook has lost more than 25% of its audience in the 13-17 age range and 7.5% of its 18-24 audience. Facebook CFO David Ebersman, in an October earnings conference call with analysts, acknowledged a drop in daily use among teens.
"
707,GOOG,"Mira Silveira, a California 13-year-old who uses Snapchat, backs up this survey. ""My friends don't use Facebook,"" she said. ""Only old people use Facebook; you know, people who are 30-plus.""
"
708,GOOG,"Snapchat doesn't release its user data, but an October survey by Pew Research Center found that 26% of respondents age 18 to 29 reported using Snapchat, compared with just 5% for respondents age 30 to 49, 3% 50-64 and 2% 65-plus.
"
709,GOOG,"Whether Facebook has instead found a way into the teen market with its WhatsApp purchase is unclear. WhatsApp doesn't have demographic data on its users.
"
710,GOOG,"Snapchat was founded in 2011, originally as Picaboo. The Pew study indicates that 9% of U.S. cellphone owners are using Snapchat, which translates to nearly 30 million users. By contrast, 18% of respondents in the Pew survey said they used Instagram.
"
711,GOOG,"Snapchat confirms that its customers share 400 million messages daily through the app. Instagram says 55 million photos are shared per day on the site. So, while Instagram has more users, people on Snapchat seem to be sharing more photos, at least in the U.S.

NBC's ""The Voice"" this month unveiled Chris Martin as its new judge exclusively on Snapchat, a company spokeswoman says. But the firm doesn't charge for ads.
"
717,GOOG,"The brands are trying to strengthen their presence among Snapchat users, often on a part of the app called Snapchat Stories. This feature lets users share collections of photos, which remain available for 24 hours, not just 10 seconds.
"
718,GOOG,"""Basically, it is very difficult for brands to get users to download their own branded app and engage on a regular basis,"" said Forrester Research analyst Julie Ask.

764,GOOG,"Chipmakers got some encouraging news in early March when the Semiconductor Industry Association said global chip sales in January rose 8.8% year-over-year to a record $26.28 billion — the biggest increase in almost three years.Part of the growth is due to a move by global wireless carriers to ramp up their networks in preparation for smartphones with faster processors. Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 5S was the first phone out with 64-bit processors. This year Google (GOOG) Android-based devices will get them too.As service provider networks upgrade to deliver faster speed and more capacity, more consumers will want to buy new smartphones, which in turn heightens demand for chips the service providers use.One of the beneficiaries is Cavium (CAVM), which designs systems on a chip for the networking, telecom, storage, wireless, security and video markets. Cavium is a ""fabless"" chipmaker, meaning it designs the chips and outsources the manufacturing process.The company has strung together five straight quarters of double-digit or better sales and earnings growth. Analysts expect the trend to continue in coming quarters.Outlook For The YearCavium is poised to benefit in 2014 from a ""strong core products design win pipeline, sizeable growth opportunities for new products, and greater customer diversification,"" Wedbush analyst Betsy Van Hees said in a report earlier this year.One of the main growth drivers this year should come from the wireless sector, which has benefited not only from a desire to upgrade networks but also from an improving macroeconomic environment.Cavium officials did not respond to requests for comment. On a fourth-quarter conference call with analysts, CEO Syed Ali said Cavium should see growth this year across all of its core enterprise, data center and service provider markets.""We expect to see very robust revenue growth in the wireless infrastructure market across macro base stations, radio network controllers and EPC (evolved packet core) at all our major customers in Asia and across the world,"" Ali said.Those customers include Samsung and Emerson Network Power, a unit of Emerson Electric (EMR). Cavium's biggest customer is Cisco Systems (CSCO), which accounted for 19% of sales during the 2013 fourth quarter. Cavium's Q4 sales to Cisco rose 8% from a quarter earlier to $15.7 million.""We were encouraged to see Cisco results beat expectations in the quarter,"" noted John Vinh, analyst at Pacific Crest Securities.Although Cavium guided revenue for Q1 2014 below estimates, partly due to softness in the telecom sector, Vinh said this outlook ""may prove to be conservative.""""Cavium indicated that one of its wireline customers has already indicated a recovery in Q1,"" Vinh noted. ""Additionally, booking trends at Cisco remain healthy, with revenue expected to be flat to up slightly.""Earnings Report AheadCavium is due to report Q1 results on April 30. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings of 28 cents a share, up from 19 cents a year earlier. They expect revenue to rise 17% to $81.56 million.Financially, Cavium continues to rebound from a rough patch a couple of years ago, when it posted four straight quarters of lower sales and earnings beginning with the December 2011 quarter. Several chipmaker stocks had also slumped around demand weakness in parts of the industry.During Q4 2013 the company logged earnings of 31 cents a share, up 55% from a year earlier and a penny above consensus estimates. Revenue climbed 22% to $81.1 million, in line with views.On the conference call, CEO Ali said Cavium saw growth in the enterprise and data center markets, with strength in enterprise switches, routers and security equipment.""We saw continued strength in the wireless infrastructure market being offset by weakness in wireline and telecom markets,"" he added.Ali says Cavium's new 28-nanometer Octeon III product line has shown particular promise. This line has been ""sampled extensively"" to a wide range of customers and end applications, with thousands of shipments recorded.""We already have over 20 customers for this product and have won over 35 design wins in a very short time period,"" Ali said. ""We're especially pleased with winning a number of sockets that in the previous generation was being serviced by incumbent competitors.""Cavium also expects continued growth in security products, where it is a leader in the chip market.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Cavium to report full-year EPS of $1.35 for 2014, up 32% from last year. EPS is seen rising 29% to $1.74 in 2015.The company ""should maintain share in the highest-growth portion of the communications processor market, thus outgrowing the peer group,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore noted.Competitors in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless group include Broadcom (BRCM), Marvell Technology Group (MRVL) and Ambarella (AMBA). The group ranks No. 12 of 197 industries tracked and hit a record high on March 21. That day, Cavium shares touched a nearly three-year high of 47.47. The stock then slid, but rebounded more than 4% intraday Monday to near 44.

800,GOOG,"Ruling the cloud services business is one road to glory for new Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, but Amazon.com's leading Amazon Web Services stands in the way.AWS is by far the biggest provider of infrastructure-as-a-service, in which companies rent computers and data storage via the Internet cloud.In cloud services, Microsoft (MSFT) first targeted platform-as-a-services — applications, databases and software that run on cloud infrastructure — but it's been gaining traction as an IaaS provider.Emerging as a strong No. 2 to Amazon.com (AMZN) might be enough to win kudos from growth-hungry Microsoft shareholders, analysts say.Neither Amazon nor Microsoft breaks out cloud revenue in their financial results. Analysts have estimated 2013 revenue for AWS at $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion, which they say represents a 50% to 70% jump from 2012.Microsoft's cloud revenue also is hard to nail down. BMO Capital Markets estimates it's a more than $1 billion business, but that includes license revenue from software Microsoft has retooled to operate on its Azure cloud platform.Nadella, who was executive vice president of Microsoft's cloud and enterprise group before being named last month to replace Steve Ballmer as CEO, played a lead role in moving Microsoft to the cloud, along with Ray Ozzie, Microsoft's former chief software architect, who left the company in 2010.Some analysts expect the Amazon-Microsoft rivalry to heat up as Nadella targets cloud computing growth.""Microsoft may need a strong No. 1 to chase, and they have that in Amazon,"" said James Staten, an analyst at Forrester Research. ""In the video console market, they had (Sony's (SNE) PlayStation, which helped them rise with Xbox.'Cloud-First World'""AWS views only Microsoft and potentially Google (GOOG) as their main (cloud) competitors. They're not really concerned about anyone else.""Nadella hasn't said much about any cloud rivalry since being named CEO. But in a letter to Microsoft employees, he wrote: ""Our job is to ensure Microsoft will thrive in a mobile and cloud-first world.""AWS and Microsoft face rivals besides Google in cloud computing services, such as IBM (IBM), Oracle (ORCL), VMware (VMW) and Salesforce.com (CRM). IBM last year acquired IaaS vendor SoftLayer for about $2 billion. It also recently purchased Cloudant and plans to invest $1 billion in PaaS.2.5 Million ServersAWS and Microsoft, though, have strengths most rivals have trouble matching, analysts say.Amazon expanded into cloud computing as a way to efficiently utilize the massive e-commerce infrastructure it had built up for its own needs. According to one estimate, Amazon has mustered nearly 2.5 million computer servers to power its public cloud services.Microsoft, its PC and server software widely deployed in corporations, built its own in-house cloud infrastructure to support Office 365, Xbox Live, Bing and other products.Still, AWS is much bigger. And Oracle has moved faster than Microsoft in making cloud-related acquisitions, says Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund in a research report.""New management must drive much harder to the cloud,"" said Sherlund. ""It is not too late for either Microsoft or Oracle for PaaS. It is too late for them for leadership in IaaS; they can never catch AWS at the scale they operate.""Microsoft, like VMware, has been adapting as corporate data centers move to cloud technology, says Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard. VMware's virtualization software is widely used in corporate data centers to increase the flexibility and capabilities of computer servers.VMware and its majority owner, EMC (EMC), last year launched Pivotal Software, a cloud computing venture that is developing PaaS products that work on Amazon's public cloud platform.Windows-Only FocusMicrosoft's strategic focus is still on Windows Server and other legacy products, says Pritchard.""With a Windows-only focus, it will be difficult for Microsoft to complete broadly in IaaS. Instead, it must be successful reinvigorating developers around the Azure platform with (PaaS) offerings,"" wrote Pritchard in a research note.Forrester's Staten agrees it's vital for Microsoft to attract more software developers to create cloud apps.The early success of AWS was in making it easy for small and midsize businesses to tap computing resources via the Internet cloud that had only been available to large enterprises. AWS has more recently targeted large companies and other enterprises.Microsoft's ""walled-garden"" approach still aims at locking in customers to its software ecosystem, some analysts say.David Smith, an analyst at research firm Gartner, says Microsoft's Azure cloud platform still needs to invest more in the IaaS market, which is much bigger than the PaaS market.Customers pay IaaS service providers pennies an hour per server. Amazon has cut its cloud prices nearly 40 times since 2006. Since moving into IaaS last year, Microsoft has been cutting prices to match Amazon.""Microsoft has a long history of doing things its own way,"" Smith told IBD. ""But in IaaS, they're starting to focus on not just Microsoft OS, (by also focusing on) Linux and Java. I expect to see more of that kind of thinking in the cloud.""

801,GOOG,"Life is expensive, in part thanks to energy costs.
"
802,GOOG,"Electricity and natural gas or oil for heating and cooking will put a dent in anybody's wallet. Employing the right technology products won't make those expenses vanish, but it can cut those costs.
"
803,GOOG,"Here are a few suggestions for products that can help reduce the burden on your bank account.
"
804,GOOG," Heating is, of course, a big part of home energy costs. Even if you're using only a room or two, you typically need to crank up the thermostat and heat all the unused rooms to the same level as those being used.
"
805,GOOG,"One answer: ceramic heaters. This isn't new technology, but the $220 Honeywell (HON) MyEnergySmart HZ-980 from Kaz USA isn't your ordinary heater. It's a compact box measuring about 18 by 16 inches, and puts out up to 5,200 BTUs, enough heat to warm an entire room, so you don't have to warm an entire house or floor. You can preset two favorite temperatures, and a digital display shows the current temperature in the room. The MyEnergySmart has an automatic shut-off time that can be set. Smaller units are available.
"
806,GOOG," With a government-mandated phase-out kicking in, incandescent bulbs eventually will be a memory. At the moment, florescent bulbs shaped like conventional light bulbs are the ones you see on the shelf. These contain mercury and have other disadvantages, but they also use a lot less energy.
"
807,GOOG,"LED bulbs, though, use less energy. An increasing number of manufacturers make them, and the prices have come down a lot. We tested the Cree (CREE) LEDs at 60- and 75-watt equivalents. A 40-watt bulb is also available.
"
808,GOOG,"We say ""equivalent"" because these LED bulbs use far less energy than incandescents. The bulb that puts out light equivalent to a 75-watt incandescent uses only 13.5 watts of electricity and has an estimated 25,000-hour lifespan. Cree estimates the bulb will save nearly $170 in energy costs compared with its incandescent equivalent over the life of the bulb, which at five hours a day would last more than 13 years.
"
809,GOOG,"We found the light from the LED bulbs we tested easy on the eyes, and with prices coming down to $10 or less per bulb, replacing incandescent and CCL bulbs with an LED when a new bulb becomes necessary is an excellent way to save money.
"
810,GOOG," Most of us who are energy-conscious have learned the value of setting the thermostat up or down as needed. Programmable thermostats let you create schedules so that you don't have to continually change settings manually. The Nest Learning Thermostat takes thermostat technology a step further. It learns your usage patterns and adapts to them, raising and lowering the temperature automatically after a few days of ""watching"" you.
"
811,GOOG,"Last month, online search leader Google (GOOG), making a big move in the so-called ""Internet of Things,"" announced an agreement to acquire the thermometer's maker, Nest Labs, for $3.2 billion.
"
812,GOOG,"The Nest is easy to install, and can be controlled over the Internet so you can make sure that you return home to a comfortable home. At $249, the Nest isn't really going to save much money if you have multiple-zone heating and cooling. But in this case, we'd put the Nest in the room or zone that gets adjusted most often.
"
813,GOOG," At first glance, it would be easy to classify the $179 T-fal grill from privately held OptiGrill as just an expensive version of the familiar ones endorsed by ex-boxer George Foreman.
"
814,GOOG,"But the OptiGrill has some significant differences that make it worth the price, and lets you save money over other cooking methods. Sensors built into the grill let you specify what kind of food is being cooked, and there's a manual setting for foods that don't have an automatic setting. You can put frozen food directly on the grill, and the grill will cook the food to the desired doneness. An indicator changes colors as the food cooks so you can take it off when it reaches your desired level of doneness. We liked the convenience and ease of popping on a steak or burger, and the OptiGrill put a nice sear on our food. Besides all that, it's easy to clean.
"
815,GOOG," The standard gas or electric cooktop in your kitchen is inefficient and wastes energy. The $170 WaringPro Induction Cooktop — the company is traded over-the-counter — claims to use up to 70% less energy than other types of cooktops. It has room for a single pan or pot, which must be steel or cast iron, and fits easily on the counter or kitchen table. It has eight heat settings, a 120-minute timer and shuts off automatically when the pan is removed.
"
816,GOOG,"The surface of the cooktop itself does not heat up. We found that we were able to boil water for pasta somewhat faster than on the stove (though not as fast as Waring claims), and loved having the extra ""burner.""
"
817,GOOG,"Not all of our cookware worked with the Induction Cooktop. Most of our pots and pans are aluminum and induction cooktops work only with steel or cast iron cookware. So make sure when you need a new skillet or pot, you get one that works on the Induction Cooktop.Life is expensive, in part thanks to energy costs.Electricity and natural gas or oil for heating and cooking will put a dent in anybody's wallet.

Cree estimates the bulb will save nearly $170 in energy costs compared with its incandescent equivalent over the life of the bulb, which at five hours a day would last more than 13 years.We found the light from the LED bulbs we tested easy on the eyes, and with prices coming down to $10 or less per bulb, replacing incandescent and CCL bulbs with an LED when a new bulb becomes necessary is an excellent way to save money. Most of us who are energy-conscious have learned the value of setting the thermostat up or down as needed. Programmable thermostats let you create schedules so that you don't have to continually change settings manually. The Nest Learning Thermostat takes thermostat technology a step further. It learns your usage patterns and adapts to them, raising and lowering the temperature automatically after a few days of ""watching"" you.Last month, online search leader Google (GOOG), making a big move in the so-called ""Internet of Things,"" announced an agreement to acquire the thermometer's maker, Nest Labs, for $3.2 billion.The Nest is easy to install, and can be controlled over the Internet so you can make sure that you return home to a comfortable home. At $249, the Nest isn't really going to save much money if you have multiple-zone heating and cooling. But in this case, we'd put the Nest in the room or zone that gets adjusted most often. At first glance, it would be easy to classify the $179 T-fal grill from privately held OptiGrill as just an expensive version of the familiar ones endorsed by ex-boxer George Foreman.But the OptiGrill has some significant differences that make it worth the price, and lets you save money over other cooking methods. Sensors built into the grill let you specify what kind of food is being cooked, and there's a manual setting for foods that don't have an automatic setting. You can put frozen food directly on the grill, and the grill will cook the food to the desired doneness. An indicator changes colors as the food cooks so you can take it off when it reaches your desired level of doneness. We liked the convenience and ease of popping on a steak or burger, and the OptiGrill put a nice sear on our food. Besides all that, it's easy to clean. The standard gas or electric cooktop in your kitchen is inefficient and wastes energy. The $170 WaringPro Induction Cooktop — the company is traded over-the-counter — claims to use up to 70% less energy than other types of cooktops. It has room for a single pan or pot, which must be steel or cast iron, and fits easily on the counter or kitchen table. It has eight heat settings, a 120-minute timer and shuts off automatically when the pan is removed.The surface of the cooktop itself does not heat up. We found that we were able to boil water for pasta somewhat faster than on the stove (though not as fast as Waring claims), and loved having the extra ""burner.""Not all of our cookware worked with the Induction Cooktop. Most of our pots and pans are aluminum and induction cooktops work only with steel or cast iron cookware. So make sure when you need a new skillet or pot, you get one that works on the Induction Cooktop.

900,GOOG,"Amazon.com could face a backlash for hiking the annual membership fee on its Amazon Prime service to $99 from $79, a survey shows.The higher cost might nudge some shoppers to drop their Prime memberships and buy fewer items on Amazon (AMZN), according to findings from the survey by research firm Bizrate Insights.The increase comes at a time when complaints are surfacing about prices charged for some third-party goods sold on Amazon.com and as some consumers have become irked that Amazon now collects state sales taxes. (See related story, this page.)""Everybody knows online shoppers are price sensitive,"" Hayley Silver, a vice president with Bizrate, told IBD.The unit of online-retail site Shopzilla found in a recent survey that only 43% of Prime members definitely plan to renew their membership at the $99 price. Only 15%, however, said they would not renew. The rest were undecided.Silver says the results show that price is a factor even for a familiar and trusted name like Amazon.Bizrate polled 4,200 online buyers in March after Amazon announced its higher Prime fee. It was the first increase since Amazon launched the popular service nine years ago. Prime includes free two-day shipping on all orders, video streaming and e-book borrowing.Big EPS Boost SeenThe increase defrays more of the program's shipping expenses and bolsters Amazon's bottom line.RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney estimates in a March 13 research note that the increase will generate $300 million to $400 million in annual operating income, leading to a 45-cent to 55-cent increase in earnings per share. Amazon posted EPS of just 59 cents last year, as it continues to spend heavily to expand its warehouses and other operations.But some analysts fear that the rising Prime fee, if it deters renewals and new signups, could further slow revenue growth, which has fallen from 41% in 2011 to 27% in 2012 and 22% in 2013.Analysts estimate that Amazon has more than 20 million Prime members, though the company has never disclosed that figure.The Bizrate survey found that when shoppers choose between Amazon and another retailer, familiarity with the retailer matters. When the retailer is familiar, lowest total cost is critical to the decision, with the non-Prime customers more price sensitive.Non-Prime members get free shipping from Amazon on orders of $35 and up — Amazon raised it from $25 in October — but delivery is not guaranteed within two days.Forrester Research analyst Sucharita Mulpuru-Kodali points to an example of a big, well-liked Internet company facing lots of heat when it raised prices.Online video service Netflix (NFLX), an Amazon rival in the video-streaming market, raised its prices on its DVD and online movie packages in July 2011, only to lose more subscribers than it expected.""If Netflix's (past increases) are any sign, then people don't like price hikes of any sort,"" said Mulpuru-Kodali.Video, Lending HelpThe Bizrate poll found that those who intend to renew Prime at the $99 value especially like the fact that it includes Amazon's video-streaming service, called Instant Video, and the Kindle Lending Library, Amazon's program that lets its Kindle users borrow e-books.An upbeat factor for Amazon is that those who intend to renew Prime at the $99 rate placed more Amazon orders in the past year than the others, based on the poll's results.Bizrate says Amazon can do four things to boost Prime renewals:1. Make more products available under Prime,2. Add more, and better, shows to its Instant Video service,3. Increase the number of e-books available in the Kindle Lending Library program, and4. Offer some exclusive discounts for Prime members.Amazon's rivals don't have the e-commerce leader's huge fulfillment centers and vast product selection, nor do many offer the perks that come with Prime.""Amazon is still my 'go to' for online shopping,"" Elena McCoy, a San Francisco area corporate affairs director, told IBD. ""Three reasons: ease of use, a wide variety of choices, and Amazon Prime two-day shipping... . The price increase for Amazon Prime doesn't bother me because it's still an incredible deal.""But some observers contend the higher fee makes alternatives more alluring. It might siphon more sales from Amazon and contribute to its slowing revenue growth.The higher cost narrows Amazon's price advantages. Websites for chain retailers such as WalMart (WMT), The Gap (GPS) and Banana Republic offer free shipping on orders of $50 or more.Websites of these and other retailers are crowded with discounts, and Amazon doesn't always list the lowest total cost.""There is definitely an opportunity for retailers and shop owners to test consumer loyalty programs"" that challenge Amazon, Bizrate's Silver said.Some Amazon rivals are improving their shipping operations. Macy's (M) is using inventory held at its stores to make deliveries for online shoppers nationwide. The chain offers free shipping for online orders of $99 and above. Under an order-fulfillment system launched in 2012, Macy's stores in some regions are getting the capability to serve as product warehouses and ship items that have been ordered online. Macy's hopes to offer same-day delivery in parts of the U.S. eventually.Amazon has long been on the same-day-delivery quest. The company is testing AmazonFresh, a same-day grocery delivery service, on orders of at least $35 in parts of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. Some observers say knowledge gained from AmazonFresh will help Amazon eventually implement same-day delivery for many other products.Amazon faces competition. EBay (EBAY) is testing same-day delivery in San Jose, Calif., San Francisco and New York City. Google (GOOG) is testing a Google Shopping Express same-day service in San Francisco.The free shipping tests online sellers, observers say.""Prime is a very expensive program for Amazon, especially the promise that packages arrive within two days,"" said Forrester's Mulpuru-Kodali. ""They had no choice but to raise prices, but even at that, it's still an expensive program. We'll never know the churn rate (for Amazon Prime) because Amazon never shares (that data).""

901,GOOG,"Google (GOOG) on Thursday said it will slash pricing on Drive, its cloud-storage service.""Today, thanks to a number of recent infrastructure improvements, we're able to make it more affordable for you to keep everything safe and easy to reach on any device, from anywhere,"" wrote Director of Product Management Scott Johnston in a blog post.Google Drive is a platform for saving text documents, photos, spreadsheets and other files. Once those files are saved in the cloud, users can access and edit them via their computers or a mobile app.The company says it will cut the monthly price for 100 gigabytes of cloud storage to $1.99 from its current $4.99. Users who want to store up to 1 terabyte of data — about 1,024 GBs — will be charged $9.99 monthly vs. $49.99. Pricing for 10 TBs or more starts at $99.99 monthly.The prices also includes data stored in users' Gmail accounts, and the first 15 GBs for each Google account are still free.""How big is a terabyte anyway? Well, that's enough storage for you to take a selfie twice a day for the next 200 years and still have room left over,"" wrote Johnston.Consumer cloud data storage is a field with a growing number of competitors, including Yahoo (YHOO) and Apple (AAPL). It's a relatively new consumer segment, and while prices vary at most cloud companies, they all seem to offer some amount of cloud storage for free before charging customers for greater amounts of storage.Popular San Francisco-based cloud startup Dropbox, for example, offers 2 GBs free with paid storage starting at $9.99 per month for 100 GBs.Apple's iCloud lets U.S. users store 5 GBs free, with a http://support.apple.com/kb/HT58790 annual fee for an added 10 GBs of data or $100 for an added 50 GBs.Yahoo in May 2013 announced that its users would get a free terabyte of data for email and Flickr, its photo-uploading website.Google stock was down 1.5% in afternoon trading in the stock market today.Follow Kevin Shalvey on Twitter at @IBD_KShalvey.RELATED: AOL Ad Growth Seen Rising, As Twitter, Facebook, Google Slip.Apple, Google Eyed In Media-Content Consolidation.

""While it's obviously not good news for Arris shareholders to hear that Comcast is considering cooperation with Apple, it's by no means a foregone conclusion that Comcast and Apple reach an agreement.""We believe that Comcast would obviously prefer to own the customer relationship and user interface.""Kisner maintained his buy rating on Arris stock.Barclays, in a report last week, said Cisco Systems (CSCO) was unlikely to soon sell its set-top box business.

But pundits say the rise stems primarily from Yahoo's 24% stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which plans a U.S. IPO this year.Alibaba has released ""very limited"" data though, says BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis. When it does, ""the financial details may be more sobering than the currently available headline metrics,"" Gillis wrote in a Monday research note.

1039,GOOG,"Facebook (FB) had a lot to celebrate on the 10-year anniversary of its founding in a college dorm room by Mark Zuckerberg on Feb. 4.
"
1040,GOOG,"The website was initially created to connect Harvard University students, was soon expanded to Yale and other colleges, then opened to the general public.
"
1041,GOOG,"Facebook today is the world's largest social network, with more than 1.23 billion users.
"
1042,GOOG,"""People often ask if I always knew that Facebook would become what it is today,"" wrote Zuckerberg, chairman and CEO, in a Facebook post on its anniversary. ""No way.""
"
1043,GOOG,"While the plan of Zuckerberg was to connect school communities, he had a stronger passion to connect the world.
"
1044,GOOG,"About 757 million users now log onto the website each day, up 22% from a year ago, Facebook said when it reported fourth-quarter financial results on Jan. 29.
"
1045,GOOG,"Facebook stock gapped up 14% the following day to an all-time high, as it trounced Wall Street forecasts, spurred by mobile growth.
"
1046,GOOG,"Daily usage on mobile devices rose 49% to 556 million. Its 1.23 billion members, up 16% from a year ago, account for half of all Internet users worldwide. But Zuckerberg is hardly content.
"
1047,GOOG,"""Today, only one-third of the world's population has access to the Internet,"" he wrote in the anniversary post. ""In the next decade, we have the opportunity and the responsibility to connect the other two-thirds.""

1048,GOOG,"Social Network Goes Public
"
1049,GOOG,"The enormous success of and excitement around Facebook was evident with its initial public offering in May 2012. The IPO raised $16 billion as Facebook received a market capitalization of $104 billion, making it the biggest U.S. tech IPO of all time — even though the first trading day ended nearly flat.
"
1050,GOOG,"The fun didn't last, as worries surfaced that Facebook lacked an all-important mobile strategy.
"
1051,GOOG,"Facebook stock began a long retreat from its IPO price of 38 a share, hitting a low of 17.55 four months later. Doubts about Facebook's fate lingered until it posted second-quarter earnings on July 24, 2013. That report showed Facebook making strong inroads on monetizing mobile, as earnings and revenue handily beat Wall Street estimates. Facebook stock rose 30% the next day and has continued an upward climb.
"
1052,GOOG,"Its stock reached a new all-time high of 67.33 on Thursday, about 77% above its IPO price.
"
1053,GOOG,"In its Q4 report, mobile revenue of $1.25 billion accounted for 53% of total sales, with mobile ad revenue up 309% from the same period a year ago and up 49% from Q3. Earnings rose 82% to 31 cents a share. Revenue rose 63% to $2.59 billion. That extended a streak of double or triple digit growth going back more than 18 quarters and was its sixth straight quarter of revenue acceleration.
"
1054,GOOG,"""A lot of things came together to help out Facebook in the mobile field,"" said Wedge Partners analyst Martin Pyykkonen. ""The success of smartphones from Apple (AAPL), Samsung and others made it much easier for people to access Facebook on mobile devices.""
"
1055,GOOG,"In a conference call with analysts after posting Q4 results, Zuckerberg said 2013 ""was the year where we turned our business into a mobile business. I expect 2014 will be the year where we begin to develop new and engaging types of mobile experiences.""
"
1056,GOOG,"""Facebook has, so far, effectively addressed one of the most significant overhangs from its IPO days — the lack of mobile monetization,"" wrote Mark Mahaney, analyst with RBC Capital Markets, in a recent report. ""The most important Internet trend by far is mobile, and Facebook has become a mobile company.""
"
1057,GOOG,"Facebook took a big step toward advancing its mobile strategy in April 2012 when it paid $1 billion in cash and stock to acquire Instagram, a popular photo-sharing site for mobile devices, now with about 150 million users.
"
1058,GOOG,"Facebook has carefully managed Instagram, letting it operate as a separate entity. Instagram only launched its first ads in Q4, as the company remains cautious about not disrupting the user experience.
"
1059,GOOG,"Will Facebook Ads Click?
"
1060,GOOG,"Facebook's primary focus is on improving the quality of ads, Zuckerberg said in the conference call; there's no rush to overly pump up ads on Instagram or Facebook.
"
1061,GOOG,"In Q4, Facebook reported the number of ads delivered fell 8% from the year-ago period, but the average price per ad rose 92% in that time frame. Facebook wanted to place an emphasis on ad quality, rather than ad quantity.
"
1062,GOOG,"""I think that the results over the last couple of quarters have really shown that by focusing on improving quality instead of just increasing quantity, we can drive pretty incredible business results,"" Zuckerberg said on the call.
"
1063,GOOG,"Analysts expect Facebook to gradually increase ads on Instagram and see it as a major driver of new growth. Instagram, which isn't included in Facebook's mobile metrics, doubled its user base last year.
"
1064,GOOG,"Another revenue growth driver for Facebook is video ads, which it is just now rolling out.
"
1065,GOOG,"One thing Facebook did not address in the Q4 call was the matter of teens dropping off the site. Analysts have raised concerns that teen users are growing tired of the network and moving elsewhere.
"
1066,GOOG,"Where Is Generation Y?
"
1067,GOOG,"In its Q3 report, Facebook did acknowledge it has seen a decrease in daily use among younger teens. But Facebook declined to comment on it in the Q4 call.
"

"
1069,GOOG,"""The argument is that if you lose teenagers, you've lost them forever,"" he said. ""I think you will see them come back to Facebook as they get older. Many are migrating to Instagram for now, which Facebook owns.""

1073,GOOG,"EBay (EBAY) and activist investor Carl Icahn escalated their war of words Thursday morning over Icahn's proposed spinoff of PayPal.
"
1074,GOOG,"EBay founder and Chairman Pierre Omidyar issued a statement that rebuffed Icahn's charges of conflicts of interest on the company's board. Icahn quickly responded to Omidyar, saying in an open letter to eBay shareholders that ""We look forward to an honest, accurate debate on the issues we have raised.""
"
1075,GOOG,"Icahn, who has nominated two of his employees to serve on eBay's board, said Monday that he's raised his stake in eBay to 2.15%. In the last several weeks, the veteran corporate raider has accused eBay's board members of conflicts of interest and governance lapses, while he continues to press his case that eBay spin off PayPal.
"
1076,GOOG,"EBay has opposed Icahn's efforts.
"
1077,GOOG,"""A new eBay shareholder, Carl Icahn, is making unsubstantiated claims about our company — and deliberately impugning the integrity of our directors,"" Omidyar said, branding Icahn's attacks as ""false and misleading."" ""After acquiring a stake in our company, Mr. Icahn asked a good question: Should PayPal continue to be part of eBay? This is not a new idea. It is a question our board has asked ourselves as we periodically evaluate strategic options for the company.
"
1078,GOOG,"""Our board is deeply committed to doing what's in the best interests of shareholders. After diligent consideration, we believe that PayPal and eBay are better together. In the future, if we determine that's no longer true, we will act accordingly and in the best interests of shareholders and the company.""
"
1079,GOOG,"The flap erupted on Jan. 22 when eBay disclosed as part of its Q4 results that Icahn had taken a 0.82% stake in the e-commerce and payments powerhouse and proposed spinning off PayPal, an idea EBay's board rejected.
"
1080,GOOG,"Icahn also has grabbed stakes and pushed for changes at other tech companies, including Apple (AAPL) and Yahoo (YHOO).

1120,GOOG,"Facebook Loses 7 Million College Users In 3 Years.Wall Street forecasts another dip in Q4 revenue when Internet portal Yahoo (YHOO) reports Q4 earnings after the market close Tuesday as CEO Marissa Mayer continues an uphill battle to reignite growth.The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company is expected to report Q4 earnings per share minus items of 38 cents, up 19% from 32 cents in the year-earlier quarter, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Revenue excluding what Yahoo pays other sites to carry ads is seen slipping 1.6% to $1.2 billion. That would mark the 11th year-over-year sales decline in the past 13 quarters for the company. The two other quarters had scant gains.For the full year, EPS ex items is expected to rise 25% to $1.46, while revenue slips 1% to $4.43 billion.One problem spot is online search ads.Yahoo was used for 11.2% of all U.S. Web searches from desktops in Q4, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney.Rival Google (GOOG) led with 66.7%, while Microsoft (MSFT) had 18.1%. But the data don't include mobile searches.""Given Google's even stronger presence in mobile search than in desktop search, it is highly likely that Yahoo's share of overall U.S. search queries is now in the single digits,"" Mahaney wrote in a recent research note.Mayer joined Yahoo in August 2012 from a top position at Google.

1153,GOOG,"THE BUZZ
"
1154,GOOG,"Busy lifestyles among U.S. diners have boosted the appeal of home delivery or quick pickup food orders. With little time to cook at home or even dine out, consumers are looking for a broader and more diversified choice of cuisine and menu items.
"
1155,GOOG,"This has made online food ordering platforms such as GrubHub (GRUB) all the more attractive.
"
1156,GOOG,"GrubHub provides a Web and mobile platform for restaurant pickup and delivery orders. The company charges the restaurant a per-order commission.
"
1157,GOOG,"GrubHub not only helps satisfy consumer taste, but also lets independent restaurants boost revenue and compete more effectively against large chains.
"
1158,GOOG,"GrubHub on Tuesday raised the proposed deal size for its upcoming IPO. The Chicago-based company would raise $176 million by offering 7 million shares if it prices at the high end of the new range of 23 to 25. The previous price range was 20 to 22. At the midpoint of the updated range, the offering would raise $169 million and value the company at $1.88 billion.
"
1159,GOOG,"THE COMPANY
"
1160,GOOG,"GrubHub was founded in 2004 and merged with rival Seamless in August 2013. Using GrubHub.com or the firm's Apple (AAPL) iPhone or Google (GOOG) Android mobile apps, diners enter their delivery address and are presented with menus of restaurants that provide takeout.
"
1161,GOOG,"The interface can also show which menu items are particularly popular. Once customers place an order through the website or app, GrubHub transmits that to the restaurant through an online process.
"
1162,GOOG,"GrubHub says it has created the largest transaction marketplace for independent restaurants to boost their pickup and delivery sales without their making significant upfront investments.
"
1163,GOOG,"""We connect local restaurants with hungry diners in more than 600 cities across the United States and are focused on transforming the takeout experience,"" the company said in its S-1 IPO prospectus filing.
"
1164,GOOG,"GrubHub says its platform provides diners with a direct line into the kitchen, avoiding the inefficiencies, inaccuracies and frustrations associated with paper menus and phone orders.
"
1165,GOOG,"OpenTable (OPEN) similarly streamlined the process of making restaurant reservations, using an online platform. That company went public five years ago at 20 a share and now trades near 77.
"
1166,GOOG,"GrubHub is used mainly by independent restaurants, which account for 61% of the U.S. market, according to Euromonitor International. The research firm says Americans spent $204 billion in 2012 at those 350,000 independent restaurants, which total 350,000.
"
1167,GOOG,"GrubHub estimates that $67 billion was spent on takeout at those establishments in 2012.
"
1168,GOOG,"As of last December, 28,800 restaurants used the GrubHub platform. Its primary markets are Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.
"
1169,GOOG,"Elizabeth Friend, a food service analyst with Euromonitor, said in a report on GrubHub this month that its prospects are strong.
"
1170,GOOG,"""Domestic interest in delivery is still growing, and the company has a very long way to go before nearing saturation, even in key cities,"" she wrote.
"
1171,GOOG,"RISK/CHALLENGES
"
1172,GOOG,"The online food ordering business is increasingly competitive. GrubHub rivals include Eat24, Delivery.com and DoorDash.
"
1173,GOOG,"In her GrubHub report, Friend said, ""Even fast food is finally recognizing the potential for delivery demand in the U.S., with Burger King (BKW) testing the service in 2013 and McDonald's (MCD) reportedly considering adding it in the future.""
"
1174,GOOG,"GrubHub, in its prospectus, said risks include failing to retain its existing restaurants and diners or to add more restaurants and diners in a cost-effective way. The growth of its business depends on maintaining a strong brand identity. In addition, any failure by restaurants to maintain their service levels could harm its business.
"
1175,GOOG,"THE RESULTS
"
1176,GOOG,"GrubHub generates revenue primarily when diners place an order on its platform. Restaurants pay a commission, typically a percentage of the transaction.
"
1177,GOOG,"For 2013, GrubHub reported revenue of $137.1 million, up 67% from 2012, with net income of $6.7 million. In Q4 of 2013, it reported revenue of $49 million, up 125% from the same quarter a year earlier .
"
1178,GOOG,"GrubHub says it has the largest takeout platform, with $1.3 billion in combined gross food sales ordered through it in 2013, up from $871 million in 2012.
"
1179,GOOG,"It says 3.4 million active diners on its platform place about 135,000 orders per day. That's up from 2.3 million active users and 93,600 orders placed daily in 2012.
"
1180,GOOG,"USE OF PROCEEDS
"
1181,GOOG,"GrubHub expects to receive net proceeds from its IPO of $87.3 million, based on an IPO price of 24 per share, the midpoint of the price range.
"
1182,GOOG,"If the underwriters exercise an option to purchase additional shares in full, GrubHub estimates net proceeds would be $105 million. It intends to use the net proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
"
1183,GOOG,"""We may also use a portion of the net proceeds that we receive to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products, services, technologies or other assets,"" the company said. Following the completion of its IPO, GrubHub will have 78.4 million shares of common stock outstanding.

Wedge Partners analyst Juan Lin had expected 17% in Q4, which would have been a 300% year-over-year gain.""The increasing revenue contribution from mobile over the last several quarters has been especially encouraging,"" CFO Jennifer Li said in a statement.Baidu sees Q1 revenue of $1.526 billion to $1.573 billion vs. Wall Street's model for $1.42 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.Baidu stock jumped 8% in late trading after rising nearly 2% in Wednesday's regular session.China Internets have been investing heavily in mobile technology and handset gaming as ""long-term investment areas,"" notes analyst Lin.The result has been a rush by Baidu and others, such as search rival Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU), to build attractive mobile products.Qihoo, which releases quarterly results next week, also rose in late trading.Baidu spent $671 million on research and development in 2013, up 83% from a year earlier. Q4 R&D rose 85% to $208.8 million.That excludes Baidu's $1.85 billion buy of gaming-app store 91 Wireless Websoft, which closed in August.Lin expects more mobile-focused Baidu takeovers in 2014. It ended 2013 with cash or equivalents of $6.35 billion.Baidu and others are trying to capitalize on quickly growing mobile users in China.About 79% of China's 590.6 million Internet users logged onto the Web via mobile in December, according to data released by Pew Research Center. That's up from 74% of 564 million Internet users a year earlier.Desktop users, meanwhile, slid to 69.5%, down about a percentage point from a year earlier.The investment by Baidu appears to be paying off, says T.H. Capital analyst Tian X. Hou, who rates Baidu stock a hold.Chinese game builders are looking to Baidu for traffic boosts via Baidu's mobile gaming store and search advertising, Hou wrote in a Monday research note.The number of gaming vendors who bought search ads via Baidu leapt 113% vs. Q4 2012, said Hou. Overall ad buyers grew just 11%.""We believe mobile app distribution and mobile game operation can continue to play a role as BIDU's growth driver for the foreseeable future,"" Hou wrote.Baidu's search engine in January held just 58.3% market share in China vs. 24.9% for Qihoo, according to data compiled by CNZZ, a Chinese research firm.Google (GOOG) fell to just 1.7%, although it also shares some technology with Qihoo.When Qihoo launched its 360 search engine in August 2012, Baidu held about 80%.

"
1372,GOOG,"Best Buy (BBY), BlackBerry (BBRY), Cars.com and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) opted out after running ads last year. CareerBuilder.com, Hulu and TaxAct, which advertised two years ago, are sitting out a second straight big game.
"
1373,GOOG,"The event, though, continues to be the single most-watched TV show of the year. Last year's Super Bowl had a U.S. TV audience of 108.4 million, making it the No. 3 most-viewed program in TV history. It trailed two earlier Super Bowls, 111.3 million viewers in 2011 and 111 million in 2010.

1374,GOOG,"Companies, though, have 4 million reasons to stay on the bench. The average price of a 30-second ad is $4 million, up from $3.7 million to $3.8 million last year.

Google (GOOG), too, has run just one Super Bowl commercial. Spokespersons for both companies didn't return emails, but so far no signs have surfaced of any ad for the big game this year.
"
1379,GOOG,"Best Buy, facing plenty of other problems, is bowing out after sponsoring the game the last three years. It wants to be more flexible with its ad dollars, company spokesman Jon Sandler told IBD via email.

1410,GOOG,"Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU) is stepping up its game in the fight for market share vs. Baidu (BIDU), the leading Internet search engine in China.It took aim at its rival with last week's announcement that it hired John Liu, a former top Google (GOOG) executive, as chief business officer. Liu served as corporate vice president and head of greater China for the U.S. search giant.Qihoo, which launched a search engine in August 2012, handles some 23% of China's search traffic. So says Stifel Research, which upgraded the stock to buy on Monday. In addition to pursuing search, the Beijing-based company been expanding its presence in online security and other areas.Last month, it announced plans to up its stake in Brazilian antivirus software maker, PSafe Tecnologia. It also took a stake in Japan's KLab, a developer of mobile social games.Qihoo posted triple-digit revenue growth in the second and third quarters, boosted by strength in mobile gaming and apps. Earnings surged 135% in each of the past two quarters, and analysts expect the triple-digit growth streak to continue in Q4 with a 100% surge.Strong quarterly and annual profit growth help the company land a 99 Earnings Per Share Rating, as well as a 99 Composite Rating.Out of 207 mutual funds owning shares as of Dec. 31, at least five rated A- or higher took new positions in Qihoo or added shares.Since late October, the stock has been forming a third-stage base with a 25%-deep correction. Action has been a bit choppy. It may be shaping the right side of a cup with a potential entry point at 96.84.Keep in mind that later-stage bases have a lower chance of success than earlier-stage patterns.Qihoo displayed strength as it gained 3% in heavy volume on Monday, when the market sold off.

1477,GOOG,"Many investors pay close attention to price-earnings ratios for clues on whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued.
"
1478,GOOG,"But that approach doesn't work for growth stocks.
"
1479,GOOG,"The P-E ratio is a common method of valuing stocks. It is computed by dividing a company's current share price by its earnings per share over the past 12 months. The higher the ratio, the more expensive the stock is considered. So, many value-focused investors shun stocks with a P-E ratio of, say, 20 or more .
"
1480,GOOG,"But growth-stock investors should have no problem buying a stock with a P-E ratio of even 50 or higher, as long as it meets the criteria laid out in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system.
"
1481,GOOG,"No Correlation
"
1482,GOOG,"That's because IBD studies of the biggest market winners over the past 50 years show no correlation between their P-E ratios and their huge run-ups. In fact, many had high P-E ratios before starting their ascents.
"
1483,GOOG,"For example, Google's (GOOG) P-E ratio was a whopping 133 when it broke out above a 113.58 buy point in September 2004, not long after it went public. The Internet search engine went on to quadruple by January 2006, to a high of 475.11.

"
1485,GOOG,"IBD research has found that strong fundamentals and a sound chart, not P-E ratios, are far more relevant in determining whether a stock will be successful.
"
1486,GOOG,"Google's earnings roughly doubled every quarter for six straight quarters leading up to its September 2004 breakout, and revenue growth was similarly robust. The strong, sustained earnings growth was the reason why Google traded at such a high premium. As growth slowed, so did Google's P-E Ratio, which now stands at about 20.

1487,GOOG,"""The reality is, the lowest P-E usually belongs to the company with the most ghastly earnings record,"" O'Neil wrote.
"
1488,GOOG,"In some mature industries where there's little innovation and competition is intense, the result is low profit margins and weak earnings growth. You'd find some low P-E ratios in those companies.
"
1489,GOOG,"To be sure, P-E ratios can come in handy for sophisticated value investors looking to find undervalued stocks. Such investors know that a low P-E ratio doesn't always mean a stock is cheap. Rather, it can be a sign the stock has little prospect for growth.

1555,GOOG,"The 50-day line is shaping up as a battlefield for many Big Cap 20 stocks.Ideally, a stock's trip back to its 50-day line, or 10-week line as some prefer, should be in quiet volume. If the stock bounces off the line in fast trade, then a secondary buy zone can be established.In some instances, an entry at the 50-day line can be an early buy in what eventually becomes a base.For example, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which was No. 9 in the Big Cap 20 on Dec. 10, returned to its 50-day line in mid-December. Volume was quiet on the descent.On Dec. 20, the stock bounced off the line in twice its usual volume. Investors could have bought anywhere from 516 to 533 that day.Chipotle consolidated for about three weeks after its bounce off the line — completing a cup-with-handle base. The entry was 537.10.Although a Jan. 9 breakout came in volume 65% above average, the stock never found further traction. The breakout failed.Investors who bought on the 50-day bounce might have eventually exited the trade with a small profit. Those who bought at the breakout lost money.The point here isn't that the 50-day line is preferable to a breakout. But the case does illustrate that the key area can sometimes give the investor one more tool in how to play a stock.A number of stocks on Monday's preliminary list for the Big Cap 20 are battling at the 50-day line.Facebook (FB) retreated to its 50-day line over four sessions. The first three days involved losses in below-average volume. On Monday, volume picked up, and the stock bounced up after touching the line. At its nadir, the stock fell almost 6% below its 54.93 buy point.Priceline (PCLN) made a 52-week high last week and then pulled back. On Monday, Priceline sliced under the 50-day line in heavy volume.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) retreated to the 50-day line in above-average volume. However, on Monday the stock rebounded off the line in strong volume.Celgene (CELG) broke under its 50-day line in fast trade Friday and lost more ground Monday.Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) is back at the 50-day line, but hasn't made a decisive move above or below the line.Google (GOOG) made a decent move up off the 50-day line Monday, after briefly violating the line. Volume was strong.Netflix (NFLX) closed under its 50-day line for 11 straight sessions and then gapped above the line in big volume Thursday. The stock recrossed a 368.75 buy point and is in a buy zone up to 387.19.A softening market could define the outcome of these battles at the 50-day line. However, should the Federal Reserve deliver a surprise Wednesday when its two-day meeting concludes, that could become the deciding factor.

1599,GOOG,"Stocks held on to strong gains Thursday with little over one hour remaining in the session, helped by a bullish earnings report from Facebook (FB) and better-than-expected economic growth.The Nasdaq rose 1.9%, the S&P 500 climbed 1.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.6%. Volume was tracking lower in the stock market today, more so on the New York Stock Exchange.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Under Armour (UA) paced the IBD 50 as each rocketed 22% and 21% respectively following blowout earnings reports.Facebook jumped 14% to a new high after mobile ad revenue fueled better-than-expected Q4 results. Google (GOOG), meanwhile, gained 4% after getting support at its 10-week line for the first time since its October breakout. Earlier today, Google sold its Motorola Mobility hardware business to Lenova for $2.9 billion. Two years ago, Google paid just over $12 billion for the business.On the downside, Celgene (CELG) was among the few losers in the IBD 50. It was down 2% in heavy volume after the biotech company reported that Q4 profit rose 14% to $1.51 a share, below analysts' expectations. Celgene is below its 50-day line.

1643,GOOG,"A stock that gaps up is flashing a bullish sign.The gap up means the stock opens higher than any price in the previous day's range. Further, the stock stays above the previous day's high throughout the session. The result is air on the chart.The Big Cap 20 features quite a few stocks that have gapped up in recent weeks or months.Online social platform operator Facebook (FB) staged a 30% gap up in late July, then advanced strongly.In late December, the stock delivered a stingy-looking gap up. The low of the gap up was barely above the high of the previous day.Facebook slid sideways to down for about six weeks after that poor man's gap up. A disciplined investor probably would've cut losses during the choppy period.A more convincing Facebook gap up occurred Jan. 30. The stock thrust 14% higher in heavy volume. Since then, it's made three new highs. The stock's about 10% above the close of the gap-up session.Biogen (BIIB) gapped up 13% in November after finding support at its 50-day line. The biomed stock consolidated after the gap up, but is 11% above the gap-up day close.Gene-sequencing company Illumina (ILMN) has delivered a series of gap-ups since April. The stock gapped up 13% in April, 10% in July, 10% in October, and 3% and 9% on Jan. 16-17. The stock is 157% past the close of its April gap up and 18% past its most recent gap up.Sometimes a stock will move sideways after a gap up before advancing again. Other times it will advance immediately after the gap up. Cyber memory company Micron Technology (MU) did both.The stock gapped up 11% on March 22, then shaped and broke out of a six-week flat base. Later, the stock gapped up 5% on Sept. 4 and immediately began an advance. Last month, Micron gapped up 10%. The stock made a new high Monday.After consolidating in a shallow pattern for five months, Google (GOOG) gapped up 14% on Oct. 18. The stock advanced an additional 16% from the gap-up close.Google's advance came after it reported quarterly results that topped the Street's views on Q3 earnings and revenue.This is fairly common. Facebook's Jan. 30 gap up also was on strong quarterly results. The same was true for Micron Technology.Sometimes an investor wonders if he or she should buy a stock when an earnings report is near. Waiting for the earnings report — then buying fundamentally strong stocks that gap up on earnings — is probably a better bet.The problem with buying before a quarterly release is that stocks can gap down if results disappoint. Boeing (BA), a former Big Cap 20 stock, gapped down 5% on Jan. 29 on strong earnings but cautious guidance. This was the second gap down in four sessions. Selling on the first gap down on Jan. 24 could've offered some protection.

"
1651,GOOG,"Traditional TV ad spending, by comparison, is seen inching up just 3% in 2014, to $68.5 billion, says eMarketer.
"

Popular online video sites are starting to attract mass audiences, he says.
"
1653,GOOG,"Advertisers that plan to boost spending on digital video will be seeking more control and better targeting than they had on TV, says Vin Ferrer, social media strategist at New Jersey-based Graphic D-Signs, which works with small businesses.

Some observers say video and interactive ads work better on mobile devices than on desktops, since many of those mobile ads fill the entire smartphone or tablet screen, making them difficult to avoid.But some companies that have long advertised on TV continue to hesitate to switch to digital, says Brian Shin, CEO of Visible Measures, a firm that compiles video advertising data.""Initially, the places where (digital) content marketing really took off fastest were in the most competitive industries, like health and beauty care,"" Shin said. ""The spends are changing, but it really is dependent on the brands.""

But individual tech leaders will remain highfliers.Here are the five Internet stocks on the IBD 50 expected to report the biggest Q4 EPS growth: Qihoo 360, Facebook, Web.com (WWWW), Priceline (PCLN) and NetEase (NTES).Chinese Internet security software maker and Web search company Qihoo, No. 1 on the IBD 50, is projected to see a 100% jump in EPS and trails only Qiwi (QIWI) among leaders with the best expected profit gains.Qihoo's results should reflect further inroads in search, and recent moves could boost future performance.On Jan. 8, Qihoo announced it tapped a top Google (GOOG) executive in China to help it battle Chinese search leader Baidu (BIDU) for market share.John Liu had served as corporate vice president and head of greater China at Google and will be chief business officer at Qihoo, where he will work on search monetization, among other things.Stifel Nicolaus analysts also upgraded Qihoo to a buy rating recently, saying it continues to gain share from Baidu and now accounts for 23% of all searches in China.Wall Street expects Facebook, No. 3 on the IBD 50, to report a 59% surge in EPS when its results come out Jan. 29 — despite some indications the social media giant is losing popularity among young people.Stifel Nicolaus on Jan. 10 maintained a buy rating and raised its price target to 65 from 56, citing expected revenue gains on its Instagram photo-sharing service and mobile video ads.On Thursday, Facebook, which is also on the proprietary IBD Leaderboard list of top-performing stocks, announced a ""trending category"" feature for its News Feed stream. It is viewed as a bid to compete with the microblogging service Twitter (TWTR).No. 27 Web.com builds websites and provides social media marketing services for small companies.""We're not running big, splashy television campaigns. You see us sending out teams into local communities,"" Web.com CEO David Brown told IBD in a recent interview.The marketing strategy is driving growth. The company has put up double-digit EPS gains for 13 quarters in a row and is projected to report a 27% Q4 rise.Name-your-price travel site Priceline, No. 7, is the largest company by market cap in IBD's 11-company Leisure-Travel Booking group. Priceline and rival Expedia (EXPE) both got a boost Wednesday after Evercore Partners raised its price target on their stocks.Evercore lifted its target on Priceline to 1350 from 1250, citing an expected surge in online hotel bookings globally. It's projected to report a 22% hike in Q4 EPS.No. 26 NetEase rounds out the list. The Chinese company provides interactive online games, an Internet portal and Web services. For years it's grown by offering massively multiplayer online role-playing games, including the hugely popular ""World of Warcraft.""But young people are turning to mobile platforms, and NetEase aims to tag along. Its YiChat mobile chat app is seen as a way to segue into the mobile space. It's forecast to put up a 15% EPS gain.Related: Biogen, Celgene Lead 5 Top Large-Cap DrugmakersIBD 50's Top 5 For Expected Earnings AccelerationFollow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar

1817,GOOG,"Wireless phone companies are dialing up tablet users to boost their user numbers, as mobile phone subscribers are harder to come by.Thanks to aggressive holiday season marketing, the four national U.S. wireless firms — Verizon (VZ), AT&T (T), Sprint (S) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) — added more than 1.7 million tablet users as subscribers in Q4, more than double the 770,000 tablet users they added a year earlier, UBS noted in a report.It's a trend that bears watching because the spurt in tablet additions has obscured slowing phone subscriber growth in a saturated market.Tablet users in general bring in less revenue than mobile phone subscribers, but they certainly add to profit. Increasing demand for data services is the name of the game for wireless companies.Competition for tablet users heated up in Q4, says Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen & Co.""Tablets clearly have become a holiday gift that people give to others,"" he said. ""The carriers chose to compete on tablets from a marketing perspective. They were a big driver of fourth-quarter results.""The early Apple (AAPL) iPads and Google (GOOG) Android devices, starting in 2010, didn't bring in huge subscribers because the most affordable such products were Wi-Fi only. And wireless data plans were pricey.More Tablets With Data PlansResearch firm IDC estimates 73% of tablets shipped in the U.S. in 2013 were Wi-Fi only, but the research firm expects the percentage to fall to 63% by 2017.And the number of tablets in the U.S. using an embedded cellular connection jumped 46% in 2013 to 10.4 million, says market tracker NPD.Most tablets now work on 3G and 4G networks, while the cost of data service plans has fallen amid many packaging options.""Data-sharing plans are behind the growth in tablets,"" said Roger Entner, head of Recon Analytics. ""It's easy to add one of them to a bucket for ten bucks a month.""At the same time, wireless service providers realize they've tapped most of the new-user market, Entner says.""The easiest way to make money is to sell more products to the same people, and there is the opportunity of up-selling larger data packages,"" he said. ""Profits are good because the cost associated with adding a tablet (to an existing plan) is relatively small. There's no extra bill.""Wireless firms count tablet users as postpaid subscribers. These are the more lucrative subscribers with service contracts, as opposed to prepaid users, who buy minutes as needed. In most cases, consumers add tablets to existing accounts through data-sharing plans.In Q4, Sprint lost a net 69,000 postpaid subscribers, but analysts expected a loss of 401,000. Adding 466,000 tablet users in Q4 enabled Sprint to offset much of its loss in mobile phone subscribers.""Sprint was giving away tablets with pricing as low as $5 per month over the holidays,"" said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson.Sprint also provided installment billing, letting customers pay off the devices with monthly payments.Free Tablet With ContractVerizon, meanwhile, gave away a 4G tablet under its own house brand for free to users who signed two-year contracts starting at $40 per month. AT&T offered big discounts on many Android-based tablets.In Q4, tablets accounted for about 56% of postpaid subscriber additions overall among the big four wireless firms, analyst Synesael says.Verizon posted a net add of 948,000 postpaid wireless subscribers in Q4, of which 625,000 were tablets. Of AT&T's 566,000 postpaid additions, 544,000, or 96%, were tablets.T-Mobile began selling Apple's iPad for the first time in November. T-Mobile added 800,000 phone subscribers and 69,000 tablet users in Q4.Minus the impact of tablets, Verizon and T-Mobile gained share vs. AT&T and Sprint in phone subscribers, says Synesael.Wireless firms generally get $10 to $20 per month for new tablet users, compared with $60-$80 from smartphone users, who buy data along with unlimited calling and texting.Adding tablet users to data-sharing plans, though, helps wireless firms hold onto higher-spending postpaid subscribers, says Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan.""True, it is not as good as (phone) postpaid. But data usage is taking over,"" he said. ""It helps lock customers in. Margins are high. There are limited subsidy, billing, and customer care costs.""

1843,GOOG,"A big challenge facing businesses involves the digital revolution. Companies better change fast or get left in the dust. That's from Rod Collins, author of ""Wiki Management."" Wiki is the Hawaiian word for quick. ""The most effective organizations"" on the business race track, he told IBD, ""are run by collaborative networks rather than top-down hierarchies.""William Putsis, author of  ""Compete Smarter, Not Harder,"" adds that the Internet, mobile technology, the abundance of available information and Big Data have dramatically boosted the impact of success and failure. ""In today's hypercompetitive marketplace, prioritizing at every step is quite often the key to success,"" he said.Tips on doing that:• Serve the patron. To keep pace with a fast-changing world, stick to a fundamental: ""Never take your eyes off what's most important to your customers,"" Collins said.It will lead you to what you need to improve on.""The purpose of a business is to create customer value, not shareholder wealth, because without customers there is no shareholder wealth,"" he said.• Follow the money. Good companies are obsessed with this, says Putsis. When prioritizing, start with whatever creates revenue.Putsis quotes the English poet William Blake: ""The art of the wise is knowing what to overlook.""Don't overlook this, Putsis said: ""Prioritizing opportunities in today's environment where change occurs in light speed is paramount to success for large and small companies alike.""• Work as one. ""The most untapped resource in the typical organization is the collective intelligence of its own people,"" Collins said. He notes that top outfits such as Google (GOOG) and Wikipedia aggregate their customers' and employees' collective knowledge.Have everyone who is working on the same project frequently get together and hold candid conversations to find agreement on what's working and what's changing. ""This practice greatly minimizes the rework that is so common in traditional management,"" he said.It's crucial to design your organization as a collaborative network rather than a top-down hierarchy. ""That's why Google and Wikipedia are so wildly successful and why (online shoe firm) Zappos recently announced it's going bossless in 2014,"" Collins said.• Keep score. Identify the metrics for your company's leading indicators of success, advises Collins.""By doing this, major problems are identified sooner and take less time and effort to resolve,"" he said.• Constantly re-evaluate. Because markets are moving at unprecedented speed, Putsis says you need to regularly step back and re-think everything. He points to BlackBerry (BBRY), noting that five years ago it had a larger market share in cellphones than Apple (AAPL) and Samsung combined. Now it's less than 5%.""Today, if you don't step back and rethink everything, the market may pass you by before you know it,"" he said.• Fish where customers are. Looking at your margins and growth opportunities will reveal ""where you shouldn't be competing or where you should be redirecting efforts,"" Putsis said.Beating your head against the wall where someone else owns the market can be fruitless. Therefore, ""stepping back and deciding what part of the market to focus on is more important than working hard,"" he said. Those who succeed ""do so because they compete in the most advantageous part of the market with strategies and tactics directed to the right set of customers.""

These folks, who also hold other jobs at Amazon, are separate from the regular hiring team. But they wield veto power over job candidate and can block a hire.
"
1918,GOOG,"""The bar raiser exists to ensure that the next hire should increase the company's collective IQ, capacity and capability — not decrease it,"" said John Rossman, a former Amazon executive.

1919,GOOG,"Rossman was director of enterprise services at Amazon, where he helped manage global enterprise for clients such as Target (TGT) and Toys ""R"" Us. Now, he's a managing director with Alvarez & Marsal Business Consulting, a professional services firm based in Seattle. He's also writing a book called ""The Amazon Way: The 14 Leadership Secrets Behind The World's Most Disruptive Company.""
"
1920,GOOG,"Rossman says the Amazon hiring process also includes all interviewers writing up a report and gathering to debrief one another following a candidate's job interviews. Notes from the interviews are written up by hiring-team members and the bar raiser (there is one bar raiser per candidate). All submit ""yes"" or ""no"" votes.
"
1921,GOOG,"Rossman reveals more details about Amazon's hiring policies in this interview with IBD.
"
1922,GOOG,"IBD: What does the bar raiser do after a candidate's job interviews?
"
1923,GOOG,"Rossman: The bar raiser, along with the hiring manager, works to make sure everybody gets timely and deep reviews put back into the interviewing system. Amazon wrote its own interview management system software. It's called MRT, which stands for Matt Round tool. Matt was an engineer at Amazon who wrote this program. It basically is a tool that helps manage interviews and all the feedback. The bar raiser reviews all this feedback on the interviewees and decides if a debrief (among all interviewers) is needed.
"
1924,GOOG,"The expectation for everybody on the team is that you are providing really deep feedback in both the content of the interview and why it did or didn't meet certain expectations for the job candidate.
"
1925,GOOG,"IBD: Was providing feedback easy?
"
1926,GOOG,"Rossman: I often felt that I needed to be a court reporter. I'm a sort of summary person. But (the process) put an emphasis on being able to write really deep reviews on what the conversation covered and how the candidate reacted.
"
1927,GOOG,"It's like anything in life. There's a certain degree of good processing, but taken over a certain line of reasonableness, it at times got kind of ludicrous and absurd.
"
1928,GOOG,"IBD: What do other hiring team members do? Do they do anything different from the bar raiser?
"
1929,GOOG,"Rossman: It's really a partnership between the hiring manager, the bar raiser and other hiring-team members. It's a consensus test, but the bar raiser has a clear veto. If everybody else says yes but the bar raiser says no, it's a no.
"
1930,GOOG,"IBD: Job interviews can be subjective. How does Amazon ensure objectivity?
"
1931,GOOG,"Rossman: Amazon does this by asking very real, problem-solving questions. The best way to make things objective is to ask a candidate, ""How would youo solve this problem?""
"
1932,GOOG,"IBD: Can you give an example?
"
1933,GOOG,"Rossman: One would be a classic elevator shaft problem, such as how would you optimize the number of floors or stops that an elevator would make, given a set of circumstances, while explaining what the logic would be. Another would ask, 'How would you parse a set of code to count the number of words and the number of letters in a paragraph or document?'
"
1934,GOOG,"IBD: What kind of direct bar-raiser hiring situations involved you?
"
1935,GOOG,"Rossman: I dealt with a lot of account-management and program-management types. We would have real-life scenarios about how you would manage a project where you ran into certain challenges or questions. Candidates would also have to tell where they had had circumstances like this before, and how they handled it.
"
1936,GOOG,"Part of it is trying to appreciate the job candidate's background and part of it is to put them under pressure and see how they deal with certain circumstances in real time.
"
1937,GOOG,"IBD: Were you subjected to the Amazon interview process when you were hired?
"
1938,GOOG,"Rossman: When I was first interviewed at Amazon, I had been a partner at (prominent accounting firm) Arthur Andersen and I had run a professional services and sales organization. I had people in the hiring process asking me statistics and logic questions and it was partially funny and partially insulting. I was a 20-year professional at that point and I was being interviewed like someone out of college.
"
1939,GOOG,"IBD: Are bar raisers used in hiring all Amazon employees?
"
1940,GOOG,"Rossman: They are used primarily for what I call corporate staff. They are not used for warehouse, temporary or labor workers at Amazon.
"
1941,GOOG,"IBD: So we're not talking about all of Amazon's roughly 30,000 employees?
"
1942,GOOG,"Rossman: No.
"
1943,GOOG,"IBD: How many applications or resumes does Amazon typically get for the corporate posts you refer to?
"
1944,GOOG,"Rossman: It wasn't uncommon that you would refer to 100 resumes to identify five to 10 people you would want for a phone interview. Out of those phone interviews, you would call in a couple for a day of interviews at Amazon. Out of that you would hire one.
"
1945,GOOG,"IBD: What are the hardest posts to fill at Amazon?
"
1946,GOOG,"Rossman: The technical jobs. There are technical project managers, technical leaders.
"
1947,GOOG,"For more business-oriented roles like supply chain or vendor management, it is slightly easier to find and recruit the correct talent. But technical talent is the top of the food chain at Amazon as it is at most of tech companies, like Google (GOOG).
"
1948,GOOG,"IBD: What's the bottom line when it comes to Amazon's bar-raiser hiring strategy?
"
1949,GOOG,"Rossman: I think using the bar raiser as part of a process and a commitment to recruiting and attracting the right talent is probably the magic of Amazon. Probably the biggest risk Amazon has culturally is losing that focus on hiring great talent.
"
1950,GOOG,"IBD: Who came up with the idea for the bar raiser, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos?
"
1951,GOOG,"Rossman: I don't know where the initial idea came from. But I can say Bezos from the very first day (of the company) put a ton of personal emphasis into screening and recruiting the best talent, and quickly correcting mistakes. He definitely set the expectations about recruiting the best.Amazon.com, the No. 1 online retailer, tries to ensure organizational excellence in part by raising the bar with its executive and technical hires.To reduce hiring errors, Amazon (AMZN) specially trains some staffers, known as ""bar raisers,"" to be interviewers, the Wall Street Journal pointed out in a recent article.

Candidates would also have to tell where they had had circumstances like this before, and how they handled it.Part of it is trying to appreciate the job candidate's background and part of it is to put them under pressure and see how they deal with certain circumstances in real time.IBD: Were you subjected to the Amazon interview process when you were hired?Rossman: When I was first interviewed at Amazon, I had been a partner at (prominent accounting firm) Arthur Andersen and I had run a professional services and sales organization. I had people in the hiring process asking me statistics and logic questions and it was partially funny and partially insulting. I was a 20-year professional at that point and I was being interviewed like someone out of college.IBD: Are bar raisers used in hiring all Amazon employees?Rossman: They are used primarily for what I call corporate staff. They are not used for warehouse, temporary or labor workers at Amazon.IBD: So we're not talking about all of Amazon's roughly 30,000 employees?Rossman: No.IBD: How many applications or resumes does Amazon typically get for the corporate posts you refer to?Rossman: It wasn't uncommon that you would refer to 100 resumes to identify five to 10 people you would want for a phone interview. Out of those phone interviews, you would call in a couple for a day of interviews at Amazon. Out of that you would hire one.IBD: What are the hardest posts to fill at Amazon?Rossman: The technical jobs. There are technical project managers, technical leaders.For more business-oriented roles like supply chain or vendor management, it is slightly easier to find and recruit the correct talent. But technical talent is the top of the food chain at Amazon as it is at most of tech companies, like Google (GOOG).IBD: What's the bottom line when it comes to Amazon's bar-raiser hiring strategy?Rossman: I think using the bar raiser as part of a process and a commitment to recruiting and attracting the right talent is probably the magic of Amazon. Probably the biggest risk Amazon has culturally is losing that focus on hiring great talent.IBD: Who came up with the idea for the bar raiser, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos?Rossman: I don't know where the initial idea came from. But I can say Bezos from the very first day (of the company) put a ton of personal emphasis into screening and recruiting the best talent, and quickly correcting mistakes. He definitely set the expectations about recruiting the best.

1952,GOOG,"It's likely the biggest virtual real estate expansion this year that you've never heard of — a massive growth of the Internet that, like the land rushes of yesteryear, will have winners, losers and possibly unintended consequences.
"
1953,GOOG,"The generic top-level domain (gTLD), the last portion of an Internet address, such as .com, .org, .edu or .gov, will be dramatically expanded. Companies already have lined up to haggle, bargain and — if need be — fight over them.
"
1954,GOOG,"Currently, there are roughly 200 million domain names worldwide, with .com being the most commonly used gTLD, according to the Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers, a nonprofit organization that oversees various Internet-related tasks. Last year there were 22 gTLD domains, and by the end of 2014 roughly 1,000 new domains will be introduced on the Internet, Icann said.
"
1955,GOOG,"""It's an industry vertical that's ripe for the picking,"" said Erik Ludwick, chief executive of What Box?, a Los Angeles-based Internet domain company. He says the market potential for domains is a ""virtual swampland"" because ""no one knows"" if they'll turn a profit.
"
1956,GOOG,"Wading Into The .swamp
"
1957,GOOG,"BMW already has applied for .bmw. The Vatican has requested .catholic, while Apple (AAPL) has dibs on its namesake .apple. The Boston Globe newspaper has applied for .boston, while New York and London will have their own domain names.

"
1958,GOOG,"Besides tech giants, big cities and major automakers, other companies are getting into the mix. Donuts, a $100 million Bellevue, Wash.-based company built for the purpose of buying new domain names, has been among the most aggressive bidders, applying for more than 300 domains ranging from .pets to .guru to .poker.

"
1960,GOOG,"The process of expanding Internet domain names has been in the works for several years. Those getting in on the ground level have to part with cash — the application fee is $185,000. These proceeds will not go into Icann's general fund, but instead will be stored by Icann until both it and the larger Internet domain business community decide what to do later on with the money, said Cyrus Namazi, an Icann vice president.

1962,GOOG,"Icann received nearly 2,000 applications from 1,000 different entities. Roughly 40% of the domains are being contested by 231 applicants, with some of the names being decided by auction. The others will be decided by the bidding parties themselves through negotiations. Icann takes up to 25 cents of every domain name sold and charges other fees.
"
1963,GOOG,"The project will ""enable and provide a new blank canvas"" to allow businesses and other domain holders ""to have their own distinct virtual identity,"" Namazi said.
"
1964,GOOG,"What each participant in this domain name boom intends to get depends on what it wants. Businesses like Donuts and What Box? are hoping to profit from their ventures, while others may end up buying domains simply to block other people from using them to dilute their trademarks.
"
1965,GOOG,"Although the Internet has a large U.S. stamp on it, the World Wide Web is indeed global with national domains. These aren't called gTLDs, but rather ccTLDs, as in country code top-level domains. Germany is .de, Ireland is .ie, Canada .ca and France .fr, even though many domain names within nations just use the popular .com. Sochi.ru is plastered everywhere at the Winter Olympics.
"
1966,GOOG,"One key goal to expanding the Internet was to expand non-Latin characters — available since 2010 — for use in nations where the dominant languages include Arabic, Russian, Japanese or Farsi, Namazi said.

1967,GOOG,"But it's not all wine and cheese — or beer and bratwurst. Businesses that have a specific brand might find themselves spending more to defend their trademarks from competitors, said Andrea Calvaruso, a partner and intellectual property lawyer at Kelley Drye & Warren.

2054,GOOG,"2014: A Look Back And Ahead
"
2055,GOOG,"Real estate website Zillow in 2013 added some 27 million net users, equal to its gains during the previous six years combined.
"
2056,GOOG,"A $40 million TV ad campaign spurred much of that growth as the Seattle company worked to make its name more visible in a crowded industry.
"
2057,GOOG,"IBD spoke with Zillow (Z) CEO Spencer Rascoff about what he expects from the 2014 real estate market, why his company is pushing rentals and whether we'll soon see a Google Glass app from Zillow.
"
2058,GOOG,"IBD: What fueled Zillow's growth in 2013?
"
2059,GOOG,"Rascoff: Mobile is an extraordinary accelerant to our business — 60% to 70% of our usage is now on a mobile device. And we monetize very well on a mobile device, because when a home shopper is out looking for homes, they're highly likely to contact a real estate agent to help them see a house.
"
2060,GOOG,"The macro trend of increased smartphone penetration benefited Zillow enormously in 2013. We have a lot to be grateful for.
"
2061,GOOG,"IBD: What new markets do you plan to move into next year?
"
2062,GOOG,"Rascoff: In 2014, rentals will be a significant focus for us. We're already the largest rentals site on the Web, but we have historically not charged for rental listings and we're shifting gears to start monetizing our rentals marketplace.
"
2063,GOOG,"In addition, we made a very important acquisition in 2013 by acquiring StreetEasy, the leading online real estate company in New York. And we intend to invest in the StreetEasy product, particularly on mobile, to significantly grow StreetEasy's usage and importance.
"
2064,GOOG,"IBD: Why focus on rentals?
"
2065,GOOG,"Rascoff: The Internet has changed consumer behavior around home shopping and rental shopping, because now home shoppers are able to see rental listings and for-sale listings at the same time on the same website or mobile app.
"
2066,GOOG,"We see a lot more dual-track shopping behavior, where people are looking at for-sale homes and rentals at the same time, so it's critical for a leading sales website to also have a robust rentals website, because so much of your usage is interested in both types of homes.
"
2067,GOOG,"There's also a significant revenue opportunity in rentals, because property managers, landlords, apartment developers advertise, (and) they pay handsomely to help lease up their available units.
"
2068,GOOG,"IBD: What do you expect to happen in real estate in 2014?
"
2069,GOOG,"Rascoff: We think 2014 is going to be a good year for housing. 2013 was a great year for housing. 2014 will be good. That reduction, in the aggregate, is very good. It will mean that hopefully there won't be a hard landing in 2015 or 2016.
"
2070,GOOG,"IBD: So how strong will the recovery be next year?
"
2071,GOOG,"Rascoff: The real estate market is in transition from a market that was too hot to one that is merely hot. So, for example, we saw a 6% nationwide rate of appreciation over the last 12 months and forecast 3% over the next 12 months.
"
2072,GOOG,"There are some markets in the U.S. that are still appreciating at 20% to 30% rates, which is understandable, but most of the country has already moderated a bit.
"
2073,GOOG,"From Zillow's perspective, that's a good thing, because we've come too far too fast off the bottom. By tapping the brakes, we're creating a better foundation for a longer, more sustainable recovery.
"
2074,GOOG,"Home values fell, from the peak to trough, by $6 trillion. In 2013, home values increased by $1.9 trillion.
"
2075,GOOG,"IBD: Will we soon see home shoppers standing in front of homes scrolling through Zillow properties on Google (GOOG) Glass?
"
2076,GOOG,"Rascoff: Someday. We have a couple Google Glasses around the office. I've worn them for a couple days — I always like to learn about new technologies and platforms and I'm certain that someday that will be a very viable and robust platform that app developers will create apps on top of, and I'm sure Zillow will be among them.
"
2077,GOOG,"I think it's going to be a much slower ramp to widespread adoption than some pundits predict ... It's going to take time for wearable eyewear technology to be inexpensive enough — and socially acceptable enough — that it can be mainstream.
"
2078,GOOG,"IBD: Zillow started advertising on TV. Will that continue in 2014?
"
2079,GOOG,"Rascoff: Zillow was a significant advertiser in 2013, to the tune of about $40 million. What we've told investors is that in 2014, we'll spend at least that much, if not more.
"
2080,GOOG,"We were a significant advertiser for the first time in our company's history because we saw an opportunity to grow our brand awareness. Even though we are the largest real estate site on the Web, we still have relatively low brand awareness.
"
2081,GOOG,"When we started advertising, we had 13% awareness. Nearly nine out of 10 Americans couldn't name Zillow or say what Zillow does. Most Americans couldn't name a real estate website, any real estate website.
"
2082,GOOG,"We thought that with advertising we could grow our share more significantly. We did that for 2013. It worked like a charm. We gained about 10 points of market share during 2013. We peaked at a seasonal peak in August at 64 million unique users. We grew traffic over 60% year-over-year. And we're going to follow the same playbook for 2014, because it worked very well for 2013.
"
2083,GOOG,"IBD: Any thoughts on the state of the overall economy?
"
2084,GOOG,"Rascoff: The macro climate — I was really encouraged by the soft taper in monthly Treasury and monthly mortgage-backed security purchases. When I read that, when I talked through that with our economist, I was encouraged by the slow reduction. I think they're very aware that the market's on pins and needles, and the economy is on pins and needles. Everyone's watching every move, and any sudden moves could be very concerning to what has been a fragile recovery for the last few years.
"
2085,GOOG,"The world I live in, which is the venture-technology industry, is in the midst of the biggest boom since 1999, where the venture-funding environment is very healthy, and the Bay Area real estate market is very healthy.
"
2086,GOOG,"The West Coast tech scene is on fire, as evidenced by a very healthy IPO market and a very healthy venture-funding environment. In the West Coast tech industry, there's more optimism and mirth than there ever has been in the 15 years I've been involved in it.
"
2087,GOOG,"IBD: Is Zillow planning to expand internationally?
"
2088,GOOG,"Rascoff: Our focus for now is in the U.S., where we have over $35 billion of addressable revenue in each of our current marketplaces — real estate, mortgages and rentals — and we have less than 2% penetration in those markets. So we feel like we have plenty of opportunity in the U.S. to keep us busy for the foreseeable future.2014: A Look Back And AheadReal estate website Zillow in 2013 added some 27 million net users, equal to its gains during the previous six years combined.A $40 million TV ad campaign spurred much of that growth as the Seattle company worked to make its name more visible in a crowded industry.IBD spoke with Zillow (Z) CEO Spencer Rascoff about what he expects from the 2014 real estate market, why his company is pushing rentals and whether we'll soon see a Google Glass app from Zillow.IBD: What fueled Zillow's growth in 2013?Rascoff: Mobile is an extraordinary accelerant to our business — 60% to 70% of our usage is now on a mobile device.

Russia-backed President Viktor Yanukovych agreed with opposition leaders to reduce the presidency's powers, form a coalition government within 10 days and move up the presidential election by several months. The deal followed…

2174,GOOG,"Analysts maintained a positive tone on Pandora Media (P) despite its outlook for 2014 that fell below Wall Street estimates. Pandora reported fourth-quarter results after the market close Wednesday that slightly missed revenue estimates but soundly beat on earnings, as IBD reported. But its forecast for Q1 and 2014 were below the consensus estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.…

2179,GOOG,"Most American consumers know by now that whatever the brand label on their electronics, most of them were made in the same network of factories in China. Shoppers at the website Monoprice.com follow this to its logical conclusion: Why not cut out the middlemen, and buy the gadgets straight from the Far East?
"
2180,GOOG,"Monoprice launched in 2002 selling cables and switches it had bought from Asia and offered at cut-rate prices thanks to its simplified supply chain. Since then, it's expanded into computer accessories and, more recently, audio and video equipment. And in August, it came to the stock market's attention when Blucora (BCOR) acquired it for $180 million.
"
2181,GOOG,"Search Engine Roots
"
2182,GOOG,"Blucora might have seemed an unlikely buyer for Monoprice, since the only thing the two companies had in common was the Internet. Up until 2012, Blucora was known as the search engine InfoSpace, a by-its-fingernails survivor of the dot-com boom and bust that experimented with various business models before stabilizing under the leadership of CEO William Ruckelshaus, who took the helm in 2010.
"
2183,GOOG,"In January 2012, however, it branched outside its core business by buying TaxAct, a provider of cloud-based tax-preparation software. Like Monoprice, TaxAct has carved out its place in a highly competitive market — dominated by Intuit (INTU) and H&R Block (HRB) — by undercutting its rivals on price.
"
2184,GOOG,"TaxAct has ""a product offering with substantially the same feature set as larger players in the space but at what we would characterize as a substantially more fair price for their filing,"" Ruckelshaus told the BMO Technology, Media & Entertainment Conference in December. ""The cornerstone of their offering is free federal filing for everybody regardless of your filing type or complexity or AGI (adjusted gross income), without any exclusions.""
"
2185,GOOG,"Another thing that TaxAct and Monoprice have in common is the potential that Ruckelshaus sees in them for expansion. He estimates that the digital do-it-yourself tax market is growing 4% to 6% a year, but the company has also been broadening its product offerings with sites designed to help people write up their own wills or navigate ObamaCare.
"
2186,GOOG,"Monoprice also continues to offer a wider variety of wares, with more than 5,000 kinds of product available at this point. Ruckelshaus believes the customer base can be expanded given the high satisfaction of existing customers — some 70% of reviews have given the site a 9 or 10 rating, he says. Jefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald wrote in his Dec. 31 initiation report that Monoprice should also benefit from secular growth.
"
2187,GOOG,"""Monoprice operates in large markets that are rapidly moving online,"" he wrote. ""Global consumer electronics is a $300 billion market growing at single digits. The $37 billion online subsegment is forecasted to grow approximately 15% annually through 2016, according to IDC.""

2188,GOOG,"Business In Transition
"
2189,GOOG,"Even so, the majority of Blucora's revenue — around 60% — is still coming from its core search business. The InfoSpace unit doesn't generate its own search results, but aggregates the results of other search engines through sites such as Dogpile and WebCrawler, as well as through its partners' properties and through the distribution of toolbars. It has more than 100 partners but about 31% of search revenue comes from the top five, led by Google (GOOG).
"
2190,GOOG,"Google has been the source of some concern for analysts, since early in 2013 it changed its software distribution policy in response to complaints about misleading toolbar downloads that wind up taking over the browser. Blucora changed its own policies in accord with Google's, which Fitzgerald says slowed search revenue growth by quite a bit last year — from 62.5% in the third quarter of 2012 to 17.9% in Q3 2013.
"
2191,GOOG,"Nonetheless, Blucora's third quarter handily beat expectations, sending its stock to a 12-year high. Profit rose 20% over the year-earlier quarter to 30 cents a share, nearly double analysts' consensus. Sales climbed 34% to $124 million, vs. analysts' estimate of $96 million.
"
2192,GOOG,"On the conference call to discuss results on Nov. 5, Wedbush analyst Gil Luria asked how the company had achieved such growth in its search revenue, given the policy changes.
"
2193,GOOG,"Ruckelshaus pointed to the advantage of using both the distribution-partner model and the owned-and-operated website model.
"
2194,GOOG,"""You're starting to see evidence of our taking advantage of that on the owned-and-operated side, which is really reverting back to where the company had its origins, which is as a consumer-facing provider of search solutions that are differentiated in their nature,"" he said. ""What you're seeing in recent periods is our ability to not just bring that product to market, but also to market it and promote it in a way that we think is a benefit to consumers and also a benefit to us.""
"
2195,GOOG,"Nonetheless, analysts still see an overhang in the expiration of InfoSpace's contract with Google at the end of the first quarter. Fitzgerald points out that both Google and Yahoo (YHOO), another major InfoSpace partner, have refused to renew contracts recently with partners who they thought were abusing their policies.

2207,GOOG,"Beleaguered BlackBerry (BBRY) is scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the open Friday, with revenue projected to fall 44% from the year-earlier period.It would be the eighth double-digit drop in the last nine quarters.Not all analysts have entirely thrown in the towel on BlackBerry, a pioneer and former leader in the smartphone market prior to the arrival of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone and Google (GOOG) Android handsets.Analyst Brian Blair at Wedge Partners, in ""an open letter to BlackBerry management"" issued Thursday, talked about an opportunity path even though ""Wall Street believes you're dead.""The only way for BlackBerry to survive, he wrote, is to abandon the high end of the market and attack the low end with vigor.""If you stay on the path you've been on, Blackberry will end with all of the various parts of the company getting chopped up and sold to the highest bidder,"" he wrote.""The high end (smartphone market) is slowing; the low end is where the growth is,"" Blair wrote. And while profit on the low end is slim and the competition fierce, ""it's the only place you have a shot of selling units. Over time, you may be able to move upstream to the midtier market.""Once a favorite among corporate and government customers, as the first company to come up with a secure mobile email system, BlackBerry has seen its market share slide ever since the introduction of the iPhone in 2007, followed by Google's introduction of the Android open-source mobile operating system.Pfizer (PFE), one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, recently told its BlackBerry users to switch to an iPhone or Android-based handset when their wireless contracts permit an upgrade, as IBD reported.Just what direction BlackBerry intends to go should come into sharper view when it reports earnings Friday. Early last month, BlackBerry shelved plans to go private, replaced CEO Thorsten Heins and said it was taking a $1 billion investment from Fairfax Financial Holdings in exchange for convertible debt, as IBD reported. Heins was replaced by John Chen, the former CEO of Sybase, as interim CEO.In a press release announcing the CEO transition, Chen said, ""BlackBerry is an iconic brand with enormous potential — but it's going to take time, discipline and tough decisions to reclaim our success.""BlackBerry will be reporting results for its fiscal Q3 ended Nov. 30. Analyst consensus estimate is revenue of $1.6 billion, down from $2.7 billion in the year-earlier quarter but up 2% from the previous quarter. The consensus estimates on earnings per share, minus items, is a loss of 44 cents, widening from a loss of 22 cents. It would be the seventh quarter in a row in the red.""We look for an updated plan from Chen to salvage BlackBerry's lucrative services business by shifting to an open platform while managing its devices business to a break-even point,"" wrote Mark McKechnie, an analyst at Evercore Group, in a research report. ""Long term, we think BlackBerry has the chance to maintain a portion of its services footprint by supporting Android and Apple iOS.""BlackBerry stock was up 2%, near 6.20, in afternoon trading in the stock market today.

Level 4 is completely driverless.Carmakers have different timelines for bringing Levels 3 and 4 to market, Soriano says.""It's not (going to happen in one) great big jump, which some people are envisioning,"" Soriano said. ""We will probably get there (to driverless cars), but the question is when.""

2246,GOOG,"Facebook (FB) on Monday expanded its national security request disclosures, saying government officials requested content from more accounts in the first six months of 2013 than in the second half of 2012.
"
2247,GOOG,"Federal investigators asked Facebook for content posted to the network by 5,000 to 5,999 user accounts in the first six months of 2013.
"
2248,GOOG,"That was up from 4,000 to 4,999 user accounts in the six months prior.
"
2249,GOOG,"Those government requests were made under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. Federal law limits disclosure of FISA requests by Facebook and other companies that have user data, including Google (GOOG), LinkedIn (LNKD) and Yahoo (YHOO).
"
2250,GOOG,"Those companies are not allowed to be more specific about how many requests they've had. And the government mandates a six-month waiting period before any company can release the data, so Facebook cannot yet release the number of FISA requests made in the second half of 2013, according to an open letter dated Jan. 27 from U.S. Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole to several technology companies.
"
2251,GOOG,"Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch wrote on Monday that media reports last summer about ""purported"" direct access by federal officials to Facebook data were ""sensationalist and inaccurate.""

2262,GOOG,"As Google (GOOG), Apple and other digital content companies build in-car technology, many will be working with Gracenote.
"
2263,GOOG,"Oakland, Calif.-based Gracenote is shifting gears from being a CD-data company to an in-car platform maker.
"
2264,GOOG,"Gracenote President Stephen White spoke with IBD about how onboard computers are changing the way drivers listen to music and why Gracenote is working to build a universal software platform to support evolving digital ad formats in vehicles.
"
2265,GOOG,"IBD: Can you give some background on Gracenote?
"
2266,GOOG,"White: The company was founded around media-recognition technology. The original invention that founded the company was the ability to recognize a (specific) CD (put into a car or home CD player, computer or other device).
"
2267,GOOG,"What our co-founders figured out was how to identify a disc and associate that disc to the metadata about the content — the album names, artist names, the track names. It sounds pretty simple, but you need to understand a little something about the disc-pressing process to understand why it's so complicated.
"
2268,GOOG,"We started working very early on with folks like RealNetworks (RNWK), Winamp, Apple (AAPL) and others to power their platforms and enable users to convert their CD collections (to digital music files).
"
2269,GOOG,"From there, we started recognizing playlist technologies, recommendation technologies — helping to understand the relationship between various sets of content, to help (users develop) playlists, to help with recommendations.
"
2270,GOOG,"We do a lot of work around cover art and imagery and other assets that help enhance user experience, help enhance user navigation of content. That really creates a fairly comprehensive and complete suite of audio products for us.
"
2271,GOOG,"We're working with broadcasters and smart-TV manufacturers to bring recognition into smart-TV platforms to be able to enhance the platforms, to do things like dynamic ad insertion for linear broadcast.
"
2272,GOOG,"So when you look across the whole set of products, it's all about helping devices be content-aware, and through that content awareness bringing (to users) related content and then addressability.
"
2273,GOOG,"IBD: What's dynamic ad insertion?
"
2274,GOOG,"White: That means based on a specific user — a specific user profile — we can deliver a different ad to them that is specific to who they are and what they care about.
"
2275,GOOG,"We're doing that for linear broadcast, so today, if you're watching the Super Bowl, everybody gets the same ad. This technology will enable us — much like you see in the Internet today — to deliver a very personalized ad for that user for that smart-TV platform.
"
2276,GOOG,"IBD: Are you building similar products on terrestrial radio or Internet radio in cars?
"
2277,GOOG,"White: We just showed some things at CES (January trade show) around the same concept for terrestrial radio and bringing this addressability layer into the car, which is really only possible now that cars are connected to the Internet.
"
2278,GOOG,"So, yes, we can use that same profiling ability and ad-insertion technology for any advertising content, whether it be radio ads or video ads, and can bring it to any device that is connected to the Internet.
"
2279,GOOG,"IBD: And where do user profiles come from? Is that data based on what someone has watched or listened to in the past? Or is it some outside source?
"
2280,GOOG,"White: Yes and yes.
"
2281,GOOG,"We track your consumption and create that profile based on what content you consume. And we also look at your collection of media. If you have a collection of audio, a collection of video files, we use that to understand a little more about you and create the base profile. Then, over time, as you consume more content we'll augment that content and grow that profile.
"
2282,GOOG,"Then we also work with service providers — who can bring in their usage data, their purchase data — the kinds of things they don't necessarily want out in their public profile, but want in a private profile.
"
2283,GOOG,"IBD: Sounds comprehensive.
"
2284,GOOG,"White: It can be very comprehensive. All this is opt-in by the user. The user has to say, ""Yes, I want this information shared."" There's a lot of privacy concerns to worry about. We make sure that we're very safe with people's data.
"
2285,GOOG,"At the end of the day, we believe that the experience that a consumer gets is superior to what they get today, so there's good reason for the consumers to (opt-in).
"
2286,GOOG,"IBD: What type of in-car products are you working on?
"
2287,GOOG,"White: So the original product for us was embedding some of our CD-recognition technology and embedding the databases of content onto those (in-car) hard drives, so when a user puts a CD in the car they had the opportunity to rip that to the hard drive. Then they would never have to put the CD back into the car. They would have all the files they needed on that hard drive and they could interact with those as they please.
"
2288,GOOG,"That was mostly in high-end cars, in high-end navigation systems, in the Cadillacs and the Daimlers and the BMWs and cars like that.
"
2289,GOOG,"We also started working with digital files in the automotive space, started to power what is a pretty common set of capabilities in the car, which is bringing your phone into the car, indexing the content that is on your phone in your local collection — so we read the files on that phone, we relate them to sets of structured metadata that are resident in the car. Then we do a bunch of things.
"
2290,GOOG,"We attach cover art to them, so you can navigate your collection via cover art. We attach descriptive data to create playlisting abilities. We create one-touch playlists and have a very simple interface on your phone.
"
2291,GOOG,"And then we did a lot of work around voice command and control. The normal voice engines — the ASR, which is the automatic speech recognition, or the TTS, text to speech — don't usually do a very good job with music. The reason is that music artists don't usually have normal names.
"
2292,GOOG,"Look at AC/DC, Beyonce, 311 — it could go on and on with all these artists whose names aren't pronounced the way a normal phonetic engine would think that they are. So what we did was create a phonetic layer, which was the phonetic representation of these artists' names and nicknames.
"
2293,GOOG,"You might be familiar with Ford's (F) MyFord Touch platform. That was really the first platform to come to market with these capabilities, and we powered that.
"
2294,GOOG,"That model — allowing a user to bring their phone into the car and having all these navigation capabilities around cover art, playlisting and voice-command control — has now been adopted by virtually every OEM in the world. So, Gracenote (technology) has shipped in over 50 million cars.
"
2295,GOOG,"IBD: Are in-car technologies changing now that digital audio streaming from Spotify and Pandora Media (P) are becoming more popular?
"
2296,GOOG,"White: We are at a bit of an inflection point. The device platforms in the car have become really smart now. You have a computer in your dashboard, for all intents and purposes. And that computer has Internet capabilities and can do many of the same things that your handset can do.
"
2297,GOOG,"I think the reality is that the car is still a really different environment than the phone, so you're not going to see the same explosion of applications — you're not going to see an app store in the car. Part of the reason is that the safety issues are very real in the car.
"
2298,GOOG,"If you think about it, each car manufacturer has very different platforms. That's a real challenge for service providers like Spotify and Pandora. There's a tremendous amount of effort to innovate your technology with 30 or 40 different platforms, and these platforms change every two years, so it's very challenging.
"
2299,GOOG,"Pandora's been successful in getting their product into the cars, but that's been very difficult.
"
2300,GOOG,"IBD: How is Gracenote involved?
"
2301,GOOG,"White: The big challenge for us is trying to help both sides — to help the OEMs have a simpler way to integrate services .. . and then to help the application service providers with their services and their apps.
"
2302,GOOG,"The auto manufacturers are very excited, as are the service providers, that Gracenote will play the role of integrator here through providing this common platform.As Google (GOOG), Apple and other digital content companies build in-car technology, many will be working with Gracenote.Oakland, Calif.-based Gracenote is shifting gears from being a CD-data company to an in-car platform maker.Gracenote President Stephen White spoke with IBD about how onboard computers are changing the way drivers listen to music and why Gracenote is working to build a universal software platform to support evolving digital ad formats in vehicles.IBD: Can you give some background on Gracenote?White: The company was founded around media-recognition technology.

2408,GOOG,"When was the last time you got excited about a Russian stock? No mystery there; the new Russia is not the land of opportunity.Even so, one name stands out in a crucial 21st-century business: online search.Yandex (YNDX), registered in the Netherlands, is Russia's dominant search engine, holding more than 60% of that market's share.Are you thinking Yandex might be a Russian Google (GOOG)? Maybe it's more of a Russian Baidu (BIDU): It's by far the biggest player in a fast-growing business in an emerging market.That sounds great, but let's look closer at Russia. Its story is far different than China's.The shift to capitalism or entrepreneurialism seems botched. The government doesn't look overly concerned about embracing honestly free markets in any meaningful way.Russia's biggest industries are oil and gas production and metal mining. Moscow has failed to expand its industrial base. Those in power are quicker to intimidate and punish dissent than to bring its economy into the 21st century.So now you have an idea why the Market Vector Russia (RSX) ETF, with a year-to-date 13.6% decline, stands fourth from the bottom on the Daily World Map.If that doesn't scare you from looking at Yandex, let's look at Yandex.Its last four quarterly reports showed EPS gains of 62%, 45%, 53% and Q2's 47%. Consensus for Q3 predicts a 38% rise.Revenue growth in those reports came in at 29% to 46%. Look for a 31% rise in Q3 (in ruble terms), consensus says.Pretax margin and return on equity last year came in at 38.9% and 26.8% respectively. The company has no long-term debt load.Yandex pays no dividend. But it was holding $940 million at the end of Q2, according to a July 26 research note from Moscow-based brokerage Uralsib.Management suggested some of that hoard could be paid to shareholders, Uralsib said.Yandex broke out July 10 from a flat base, the second part of a base-on-base structure. The first base was flawed and awkward. The second — and the more important — was fine.Yandex climbed 21% from its 28.74 buy point from a shallow, cup-with-handle base, then backed off.Thursday's action was promising: Yandex fell as much as 4%, then rebounded from the 10-week line to end off just 1% in fast trade.If the market were in an uptrend, this would be a fresh buy signal and convenient entry.The Internet-Content group, which includes U.S. and foreign names, held the No. 10 slot out of the 197 industries in Thursday's IBD. It's been hot for months.

2443,GOOG," ARM Holdings, long the power player among chip designers for smartphones and tablets, has curbed investor concerns of waning potential and is poised for a strong 2014, analysts say.They see several possible growth drivers for ARM Holdings (ARMH), as customers such as Apple (AAPL) and Samsung roll out new products. There's also word that Google (GOOG) might design its own server processors using ARM Holdings technology, according to a Bloomberg News report last week.""I think ARM is in a phenomenal position headed into next year,"" said Evercore Partners analyst Patrick Wang. ""It is firing on all cylinders.""ARM Holdings is the second-largest firm by market cap in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, after Qualcomm (QCOM), and before Broadcom (BRCM), Avago Technologies (AVGO) and Xilinx (XLNX).Wang noted that ARM Holdings' stock rode a roller coaster over the past couple of years, dipping below 23 per share in mid-2012 and seesawing the middle of this year before recovering in the fall to approach 50 in October. It now trades just shy of that.For the downs, Wang and others have most recently blamed headlines generated by would-be competitor Intel (INTC), which has made known that it wants to carve out a big share of the smartphone and tablet market. This, the thinking went, would come at ARM Holdings' expense.Rivals And AlliancesIntel, the world's largest semiconductor company, has dominated the arena of chipmaking for conventional personal computers, but ARM, which counts Intel competitor Qualcomm among its partners, has virtually shut Intel out of the smartphone and tablet space. Yet Intel, at its investor day in November, touted expectations that sales of Intel-based tablet computers will surge past 40 million next year, a jump of more than 300%, with smartphone growth to follow.""I never want to discount Intel,"" Wang said. ""Intel has deep pockets and they really want a piece of this market.""But, he added, Intel executives also said they would consider making microprocessors based on competitors' designs, presumably including ARM Holdings, And since the latter earns royalties on its chip designs, the Intel concession ""would seem to balance things out"" for ARM Holdings.With the Intel head wind seemingly diffused for now, Wang said, ARM Holdings is now ""my top large-cap pick for next year.""Other Wall Street analysts have been upbeat too, issuing outperform and buy ratings.An easing of Intel pressure is hardly all that puts wind into ARM Holdings' sails.The Cambridge, England-based company designs the chips that go into iPhones, iPads and a plethora of other smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices. It earns royalties on every ARM-powered device shipped — accounting for about half its revenue — and collects licensing fees for products in development that use its chips.Despite a 2% year-over-year decline for the semiconductor industry in the third quarter, processor royalty revenue rose about 14% for ARM Holdings, according to the company. That missed estimates, but its licensing income swelled nearly 50%, beating expectations. And earnings per share rose 39% on 28% higher revenue, with both beating consensus views.Analysts have expressed concerns about the saturation of high-end smartphones. There are fewer royalties to be had if most people in the market for such a device already have one and sales slow. But many analysts think this could be offset by greater volumes of mid-tier smartphones being sold in high-growth markets such as China and India.Equally important, on the high-end front, was the move made this year by Apple to shift from the standard 32-bit chips to 64-bit chips in its iPhone 5S.Wang said the change was ""huge"" for two reasons. One, Apple is a major ARM Holdings customer, and two, others will follow Apple's lead.Future DevicesSamsung already has said it will follow suit in 2014. And ARM Holdings generates higher levels of royalties on the faster 64s, making each shipment more profitable.""If not for Apple, others would have taken their sweet time getting to it, but now it becomes essential. And that's a nice tail wind for ARM heading into next year,"" Wang said. ""I think ARM really got its mojo back with the Apple move, because ARM is only as good as its customers.""William Blair & Co. analyst Anil Doradla agreed. ""I like the story; I like the fundamentals,"" he said in an interview.Doradla has a ""market perform"" rating on ARM Holdings ""strictly on valuation,"" meaning he is not yet convinced that there is room for substantial advancement for the stock. He said the 64-bit chip development could help drive growth, and expansion of the mid-tier smartphone market in developing countries should provide another boost.""That market is going to be very positive,"" he said. But he thinks the stock may need another ""upside surprise"" to advance substantially.Wang said Apple may be the one to deliver such a catalyst. Looming from Apple in 2014 is a larger, roughly 12-inch iPad, expected to have a keyboard and other features associated with notebooks and personal computers. It could change the world of business travel, Wang said, and potentially ""change the PC landscape."" That could boost business for ARM Holdings as well.""I think that if and when it comes out — and all signs indicate it in fact will come out — that's the next leg of growth for ARM's stock,"" he said.In the latest news out of the company, ARM Holdings on Friday said it acquired graphics lighting company Geomerics, and that its technology could accelerate the transition to photorealistic games in mobile.ARM Holdings CEO Simon Segars said on the firm's third-quarter earnings conference call that it is increasingly licensing its chip designs to more companies, and that some of these firms are plowing into cutting-edge areas such as fingerprint recognition and wearable computing, providing new growth opportunities.""A record 48 processor licenses were signed in the (third) quarter with 24 companies,"" Segars said. That included 11 firms with their first-ever ARM license, ""many of whom are planning to take our technology into new and emerging markets.""Looking toward the fourth-quarter's results, he said, a ""record order backlog"" and ""robust opportunity pipeline"" point to a strong quarter for licensing revenue, with a sequential rise in ARM's royalty revenue.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average forecast EPS at 26 cents for the fourth quarter and 98 cents for 2013, then $1.24 in 2014.

2455,GOOG,"Lead manager Matthew Kamm works the market like it's a garden with variety. He treats his young sprouts differently from his mature produce, and both of those differently from crops he's ready to reap.
"
2456,GOOG,"This approach is working. It has made his $9.7 billion Artisan Mid Cap Fund a top performer among the largest diversified U.S. stock portfolios.
"
2457,GOOG,"In the 12 months ended Jan. 31, its 31.18% return topped 91% of its midcap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its 16.94% average annual gain in the past three years topped 92% of its rivals.
"
2458,GOOG,"Kamm, 40 years old, discussed his investment course with IBD from his office in Milwaukee.
"
2459,GOOG,"IBD: In addition to Mid Cap, you run $906 million Artisan Global Opportunities and $1.7 billion Small Cap . How does managing different cap-size and style funds help you?
"
2460,GOOG,"Kamm: Our team includes a group of analysts and five portfolio managers who work collaboratively to identify best ideas. We've been at this over 15 years. That level of tenure and trust is important.
"
2461,GOOG,"We look up and down the market-cap scale and globally. That gives us broad perspective. We like to think we're better midcap investors because we know small-cap competitors and international emerging markets competitors that U.S. midcap companies increasingly face.
"
2462,GOOG,"IBD: You divide your portfolio into three types of stocks. What's the advantage?
"
2463,GOOG,"Kamm: The nomenclature we use is garden, crop and harvest.
"
2464,GOOG,"Garden stocks are ones we believe are just emerging. We try to be early into them. We guard against risk by keeping garden positions small.
"
2465,GOOG,"When a garden position turns out right and profit growth plays out, we allocate more into it and push it into our crop bucket or portfolio. Those are our largest positions and fewest positions. That's where we feel the profit cycle has been largely de-risked.
"
2466,GOOG,"The third area is harvest, where we reduce positions.
"
2467,GOOG,"IBD: How are you tweaking new buys to cope with the expected slow-growth economy?
"
2468,GOOG,"Kamm: We've been focused on uniquely positioned franchises that are exposed to some strong growth trends. You see some signs, especially in the U.S., that the economy is getting better. Housing and jobs are examples. But emerging markets are struggling to grow at the same rates they experienced a few years ago.
"
2469,GOOG,"We're focused on durable, high-quality franchises. We're less interested in high-commodity businesses and materials. And those business models are very cyclical, economy sensitive, but tend not to meet our franchise characteristics criteria.
"
2470,GOOG,"IBD: What are some real-world examples, please, as of your latest disclosure?
"
2471,GOOG,"Kamm: We're focused on innovation in health care. We're 10 years past the first sequencing of the human genome. Now we're seeing benefits in novel drug targets.
"
2472,GOOG,"Regeneron (REGN) is an example. They have a drug called Eylea, which is a retinal drug for age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness for the elderly. It was launched in 2011. In its second full year it sold $1.4 billion. It's a strong driver of company sales and profits.
"
2473,GOOG,"Regeneron also has a diverse pipeline of additional opportunities to extend its profit cycle into the future.
"
2474,GOOG,"They were all discovered in Regeneron's own labs, but primarily funded by Sanofi, a large French drug company, in return for the ability to market these drugs and share profits.
"
2475,GOOG,"IBD: Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) recently gapped up after reporting strong results and guidance. Its 30% earnings per share growth was the second straight quarterly acceleration. What's your thesis?
"
2476,GOOG,"Kamm: We think they're positioned for growth. They have a very strong brand associated with high-quality ingredients. They have a significant opportunity to grow their footprint of restaurants in the U.S., and ultimately internationally.
"
2477,GOOG,"They're executing well. They're getting customers through serving lines quicker. They've enhanced menus. They're offering office catering. They're able to drive solid same-store comps year-over-year and make restaurants more profitable through higher volumes.
"
2478,GOOG,"They've resisted increasing prices to the same extent that a lot of restaurants have. Instead, they're driving growth through higher volume and traffic.
"
2479,GOOG,"IBD: Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) has had a great run and just gapped up the other day. What makes you think it still has room to run?
"
2480,GOOG,"Kamm: It fits our innovation theme. Their sales and profits are driven by Solaris, a biologic drug that's approved for two ultrarare, very serious diseases, not just in the U.S. but globally.
"
2481,GOOG,"They still have room to run because both uses of Solaris still have a lot of growth ahead of them. There's still a lot of opportunity to reach more patients.
"
2482,GOOG,"Solaris is also being tested for three or four additional ultrarare diseases, where early clinical data are encouraging. In three or four years, there will be additional (treatment) approvals for Solaris.
"
2483,GOOG,"They also have asfotase alpha (which targets certain bone diseases and tooth losses), which is expected to be approved later this year.
"
2484,GOOG,"IBD: Is broker-dealer LPL Financial (LPLA) a play on a growing economy?
"
2485,GOOG,"Kamm: They're the largest independent broker-dealer in the country. They've grown by attracting financial advisers away from big banks and wire houses, giving them independence to grow their practices in ways they see fit, and letting them keep a larger percent of their profits.
"
2486,GOOG,"They continue to gain market share, and we like market-share gainers. We like companies that can outgrow the market in a sustainable way.
"
2487,GOOG,"Also, LPL captures some of the float on cash balances that customers keep with them. (Float refers to earnings on cash between the time a customer authorizes disbursement and when the cash actually leaves the account.) While rates were low, there was not so much float to capture. But if rates rise as the economy improves, then LPL earnings will accelerate.
"
2488,GOOG,"IBD: Where's the innovation in a stock like athletic wear seller Under Armour (UA)?
"
2489,GOOG,"Kamm: The innovation is in new materials that deliver better performance, whether sweat-wicking or shielding athletes from heat or cold. Companies like Under Armour and Nike (NKE) and Adidas have been able to grow by innovating product lines and driving increased value to customers.
"
2490,GOOG,"Under Armour has a great brand with athletes, especially young athletes, who are inclined to spend more. They're expanding into other categories, such as footwear via cleats. And that's translating into more traditional ware like running shoes.
"
2491,GOOG,"They've been mostly a U.S. brand, but they're extending their brand internationally and driving additional growth outside the U.S. So we think they still have a long runway. They're in our bucket category.
"
2492,GOOG,"IBD: Am I right in thinking you like Illumina's (ILMN) genomic sequencing advances?
"
2493,GOOG,"Kamm: Gene sequencing is a transformational technology. In 2007 they launched a next-generation sequencing platform. Cost of sequencing began to fall, leading to big growth in the market. They launched (on Jan. 14) another new product (the HiSeq X Ten) that delivers the first $1,000 genome, a target that researchers have been fixed on for five or six years.
"
2494,GOOG,"So they're the center of action in human genetic research and have significant growth opportunities as they make these tools even more affordable.
"
2495,GOOG,"IBD: TripAdvisor (TRIP) has pulled back from its Nov. 15 high. And earnings per share fell in the most recent quarter. Why aren't you concerned?
"
2496,GOOG,"Kamm: They're the leading review site for hotels and other travel destinations globally. They've moved toward a bidding model, where companies bid for placement on a TripAdvisor site. It's almost like bidding for Google (GOOG) search terms. Earnings have declined during this process because it is a transition. They're foregoing some older advertising measures as they move customers to the new bidding system. Until this new system starts to mature, their profits are lower.
"
2497,GOOG,"This was expected. That's why it's a garden investment. It will move up as they get through the transitional period.
"
2498,GOOG,"IBD: Cepheid (CPHD) has uptrended since June. Why has it shown so much volatility in quarterly earnings?
"
2499,GOOG,"Kamm: This is a crop position. They make diagnostic systems that let hospitals easily identify molecular markers of disease in patients. That used to be a complex, time-consuming process that required highly trained staff. Cepheid made GeneXpert, which automated it. You put a blood sample into a plastic cartridge, which goes into the instrument, and you get the answer. So more hospitals can do molecular testing.
"
2500,GOOG,"The company ran into manufacturing challenges, which hurt earnings. Over (the past year) they've addressed those issues, exited 2013 in a better place in terms of inventory and ability to provide test cartridges to customers. And they have a broad pipeline of new tests that they've brought to market. Now they have to leverage their new systems to do a broader range of tests.
"
2501,GOOG,"IBD: Is Fortune Brands (FBHS) a play on the housing rebound?
"
2502,GOOG,"Kamm: They're a leading housing-products company, and this is a crop position.
"
2503,GOOG,"They have a leading position in fixtures for kitchens and bathrooms, cabinets, faucets and locks in what tend to be attractive segments. It became clear last year that the U.S. housing market was coming out of the depths of the downturn. Fortune has been gaining share in key markets. That's delivering strong margin expansion, and margins are still below the peaks of the last housing cycle, so it's reasonable to assume that margins can continue to rise.
"
2504,GOOG,"IBD: The rate of growth of LinkedIn's (LNKD) earnings per share have declined for two quarters. You've added to your stake in several recent disclosures. What's your game plan?
"
2505,GOOG,"Kamm: LinkedIn has transformed the recruiting and hiring market. The main advantage is that people update their resumes and profiles even when they're not actively looking for a job. People who are hiring can access a rich database of not just job-seekers but also of people who would be open to the right opportunity. That's valuable to corporate HR departments.
"
2506,GOOG,"In recent years LinkedIn has been investing to improve its mobile smartphone and tablet tools and provide more content, more articles and experts who write on topics that are relevant. That brings people to the site more frequently and with a higher level of engagement. And that translates into more advertising dollars for LinkedIn. There's not only a growing number of recruiters who subscribe to the platform. There's also growing advertising business. All of this has a long way to run.
"
2507,GOOG,"IBD: You began your current stake in Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) in September. Why do you like this particular casino stock?
"
2508,GOOG,"Kamm: They're a leading casino operator in Macau and the Cotai Strip (in Macau), which is well known as a high-growth market, noticeably larger than Las Vegas. The subtle shift in the market in recent years is that the market is no longer driven primarily by high rollers, ultrahigh net worth individuals gaming in Macau. It is driven by the mass market today.
"
2509,GOOG,"Melco's properties are well positioned to serve the mass market. And that part of the market is more profitable than the high-net-worth part. Melco is working to open new properties, which will expand its earnings potential.
"
2510,GOOG,"Also, transportation to Macau is improving. And we're seeing changes that make it more attractive for destination travel, not just gambling demand.
"
2511,GOOG,"IBD: Your stake in Tractor Supply (TSCO) has edged up.
"
2512,GOOG,"Kamm: They're the leading supply store for recreational farms and the rural lifestyle. They have 1,300 stores today. We think they have potential for at least 2,100 stores. As they grow, they've done a good job of increasing productivity of existing stores. They've done a good job of understanding their business data.
"
2513,GOOG,"They've done a good job with e-commerce to leverage their brand outside their physical stores. They've done a good job of laying in private label goods within the store to provide different price points and help expand their own margins. All of those drivers have potential in the coming years.Lead manager Matthew Kamm works the market like it's a garden with variety. He treats his young sprouts differently from his mature produce, and both of those differently from crops he's ready to reap.This approach is working.

2605,GOOG,"Moving to Internet streaming via broadband networks would lower DirecTV's operating costs and boost free cash flow, says Citigroup.
"
2606,GOOG,"DirecTV, however, doesn't sell broadband Internet services itself. So any Web-based service would be potentially vulnerable to data caps imposed by broadband service providers, says Citigroup analyst Jason Bazinet in a research report Tuesday. Broadband providers are mostly DirecTV rivals such as cable TV firms like Comcast (CMCSA) and phone companies such as AT&T (T).

2607,GOOG,"""If management does unveil this platform, we expect limited testing in 2014 and rollout to ethnic niches and/or multi-dwellings shortly thereafter,"" Bazinet said. ""If deployment proceeds smoothly and data caps don't restrict rollout, we could see broader U.S. deployment in the future.""
"
2608,GOOG,"He says it's possible DirecTV would need to renegotiate content deals with media companies like Walt Disney (DIS). If DirecTV adopts a Web platform, it would also potentially compete with other broadband-based services, also called ""over-the-top"" services.

And the 45 initial public offerings completed thus far is double the amount from the same period last year, according to Renaissance Capital. They've raised $7.6 billion, up 28%.""We're off to a very strong start this year and we think at the beginning stage of a new long-term IPO cycle,"" said Linda Killian, portfolio manager for the Global IPO Fund at Renaissance Capital, an IPO investment and research firm.From 2008 through 2012, IPO offerings per year were, on average, less than half of historic norms. That changed in 2013 when 222 IPOs launched, the most since 2004. So far, 2014 is on pace to exceed last year.IPO market enthusiasm is expected to accelerate now that China e-commerce giant Alibaba Group confirmed it plans to file an IPO on the U.S. market.

This follows Friday's news that Sina's (SINA) Weibo, a Chinese microblogging service similar to Twitter (TWTR), filed paperwork for its IPO with plans to raise $500 million.Other high-profile tech IPOs expected this year include cloud storage operator Box and Dropbox, online music provider Spotify, wearable camera maker GoPro, and GrubHub, an online portal for food delivery service.""All of this brings positive attention to the IPO market and underlines how important it is to equity markets overall and our economy,"" said Killian.(Nearly) Double CouponsAlso fueling enthusiasm is the performance of recent tech IPOs.

The next day came Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical (RARE), which rose 101%.Already four IPOs have more than doubled this year, vs. six in all of 2013, Ipreo said.The health care sector has dominated the IPO market, with 26 of the 45 thus far this year, primarily in the biotech field.""The enormous amount of biotech IPOs is a continuation of 2013 but at an even faster pace,"" said Scott Sweet, senior managing partner at IPOboutique.com.The downside, said Sweet, is that top-notch biotech IPOs, in the foreseeable future, are already out the door.""They're getting weaker in quality,"" he said.A10 Networks SoonTen IPOs are slated for this week. Among those receiving the most attention is A10 Networks, which makes technology that accelerates data center networks. Rivals include F5 Networks (FFIV), Radware (RDWR) and Cisco (CSCO).IPOboutique says its channel checks reveal that A10 is in strong demand, already multiple times oversubscribed.Checks also suggest strong demand for Paylocity Holding, a cloud-based provider of payroll and human management software, Q2 Holdings, a provider of cloud-based banking services, and Akebia Therapeutics, a developer of anemia treatment.Other IPOs this week include international e-commerce services provider Borderfree; Amber Road, a cloud-based provider of trade management software; and Globoforce, a provider of cloud-based social recognition software.Another five IPOs are lined up for next week.

2752,GOOG,"Most people desire to hit home runs when it comes to responsibilities, both in the office and at home. Swing too much one way or another, and things can get out of whack. Some things get neglected, resulting in unhappy people, including you. Tips on the balancing act of achieving it all:
"
2753,GOOG,"• Grasp it. ""A work/life balance doesn't happen on its own,"" said Linda Drumright, general manager for IMS Health, which provides information, service and technology to the health care industry. ""You have to decide what you will live with and stick by it.""
"
2754,GOOG,"• Take inventory. Make a list of your success factors — elements you need to bring your vision to life. That's from Allison Rimm, author of ""The Joy of Strategy."" ""This tangible step,"" she told IBD, ""marks real progress toward creating your personal strategic plan and builds momentum that moves you forward before your glowing vision dims and you go back to the way you've always done things.""
"
2755,GOOG,"• Take the initiative. A recent study from the Center for American Progress and Elle magazine show 53% of women and 40% of men have never asked for a raise. So reports Liz O'Donnell, author of ""Mogul, Mom & Maid."" ""This would lead you to believe that many workers aren't comfortable advocating for themselves,"" she said. ""If you want to access work-life benefits like staggered start times, extra days off, etc., you need to feel comfortable negotiating.""
"
2756,GOOG,"This goes for the home, too, she adds. Whether you want help with yardwork and the laundry or have a few weekend hours to yourself, ""you need to know how to enter a two-way dialogue and exit with a mutually beneficial arrangement.""
"
2757,GOOG,"She recommends enrolling in a negotiation course online.
"
2758,GOOG,"• Embrace technology. It can tether us to our jobs, but it can also free us from our desks and keep us organized, O'Donnell said. ""Are you living a busy life? There's an app for that. Having a smartphone is table stakes for any busy professional. Up the ante with apps that can free up some of your time — like Uber, TaskRabbit and Evernote. Become expert, not just proficient, at Microsoft (MSFT) Outlook or Google (GOOG) Apps.""
"
2759,GOOG,"• Listen to yourself. Be cognizant of your feelings, says Bob Deutsch, author of ""The 5 Essentials."" He suggests asking: ""What attracts you, what repels you, what interests you, what makes you feel most alive? These are revelatory clues to your authentic self. Leave your cocoon of the familiar and explore. Use your curiosity to get under the hood of how things operate and create new ideas.""Most people desire to hit home runs when it comes to responsibilities, both in the office and at home. Swing too much one way or another, and things can get out of whack. Some things get neglected, resulting in unhappy people, including you. Tips on the balancing act of achieving it all:• Grasp it.

""You have to decide what you will live with and stick by it.""• Take inventory. Make a list of your success factors — elements you need to bring your vision to life. That's from Allison Rimm, author of ""The Joy of Strategy."" ""This tangible step,"" she told IBD, ""marks real progress toward creating your personal strategic plan and builds momentum that moves you forward before your glowing vision dims and you go back to the way you've always done things.""• Take the initiative. A recent study from the Center for American Progress and Elle magazine show 53% of women and 40% of men have never asked for a raise. So reports Liz O'Donnell, author of ""Mogul, Mom & Maid."" ""This would lead you to believe that many workers aren't comfortable advocating for themselves,"" she said. ""If you want to access work-life benefits like staggered start times, extra days off, etc., you need to feel comfortable negotiating.""This goes for the home, too, she adds. Whether you want help with yardwork and the laundry or have a few weekend hours to yourself, ""you need to know how to enter a two-way dialogue and exit with a mutually beneficial arrangement.""She recommends enrolling in a negotiation course online.• Embrace technology. It can tether us to our jobs, but it can also free us from our desks and keep us organized, O'Donnell said. ""Are you living a busy life? There's an app for that. Having a smartphone is table stakes for any busy professional. Up the ante with apps that can free up some of your time — like Uber, TaskRabbit and Evernote. Become expert, not just proficient, at Microsoft (MSFT) Outlook or Google (GOOG) Apps.""• Listen to yourself. Be cognizant of your feelings, says Bob Deutsch, author of ""The 5 Essentials."" He suggests asking: ""What attracts you, what repels you, what interests you, what makes you feel most alive? These are revelatory clues to your authentic self. Leave your cocoon of the familiar and explore. Use your curiosity to get under the hood of how things operate and create new ideas.""

Charles Schumer, D.-NY.The network will cover the outdoor area between Gansevoort St. and 19th St., from 8th Avenue to the West Side Highway, the companies said. That area includes Google's headquarters, along with public housing complexes and could help some 5,000 students, Google's Chief Information Officer Ben Fried said in a statement.When Google opened its New York office six years ago — the first outside its Mountain View, Calif., headquarters — Bloomberg had joked that it would be welcomed as the ""second-best"" company in New York. The first, presumably, is his eponymous data and news organization, Bloomberg.Google's headquarters in New York sits on what's known as the ""fiber highway,"" according to New York Magazine. The building sits close to a fiber-optic cable network ""that's considered one of the most vital connection points to the world's telecommunications networks,"" that magazine reported.The area sometimes is referred to as ""Silicon Alley,"" or the Silicon Valley of the east.Google's dabbled in Internet networks in the last few years, most notably in Kansas City. In July, it launched a network of high-speed fiber Internet in K.C.RELATED: Google Gets 'High-Five' From FTC In Antitrust Inquiry.Google Maps On Apple iPhones Will Boost Ad Sales.

2925,GOOG,"But age discrimination in tech occupations is hard to determine, says Marshall Oldham, recruiting director for Hanover, Md.-based information technology services firm TEKsystems.
"
2926,GOOG,"""I'm confident that it's a real thing,"" Oldham, 39, said, ""but this is just a very difficult industry to assess when it comes to age discrimination because of how fast technology changes.""
"
2927,GOOG,"What some would call discrimination, others describe as a need for the latest and greatest skills, Oldham says.
"
2928,GOOG,"""It's not so much a company saying 'We don't want to hire an older person' as it is a company saying 'we want to hire someone who has today's skills,'"" Oldham said.

2929,GOOG,"Survival Of The Fittest
"
2930,GOOG,"Tech sectors move fast, especially in areas such as social media and Big Data, he says.

2932,GOOG,"Younger tech workers use technology differently, says Patrick Egan, Silicon Valley chapter president of the nonprofit Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International. The association works to advance and promote drone and robotic technologies.
"
2933,GOOG,"Younger workers often look down on those who want ""everything on paper"" and would rather leave voicemails than text, says Egan, 47, who also consults for the U.S. Army on tech issues.
"
2934,GOOG,"""I definitely think there's some contempt and arrogance,"" said Egan, who says he's been on the receiving end of that.
"
2935,GOOG,"But he says this arrogance might be more general attitude than deliberate discrimination.
"
2936,GOOG,"There are cases where age discrimination is more clear-cut, at least to juries. In August, a Texas appellate court upheld a $900,000 age discrimination verdict against Dell (DELL) involving a former sales representative, age 61.
"
2937,GOOG,"Federal law prohibits discrimination against those 40 or older. In some states, similar laws apply to younger workers.
"
2938,GOOG,"Awareness of age discrimination in technology is generally on the rise, says San Francisco attorney Janette Wipper of law firm Sanford Heisler.
"
2939,GOOG,"The Washington, D.C.-based firm represents plaintiffs in employment law cases. A quarter of its work is against tech firms, says Wipper.
"
2940,GOOG,"Age discrimination awareness would have happened sooner except that most cases are resolved in confidential arbitration, she says.
"
2941,GOOG,"Being over 40 means not being up-to-speed in the minds of some employers, Wipper, 40, says.
"
2942,GOOG,"""There's age-based stereotyping where many employees over 40 are perceived to have dated technology skills,"" she said.
"
2943,GOOG,"That perception can have serious consequences for older workers.
"
2944,GOOG,"""It's a barrier that impacts their employment opportunities,"" Wipper said. ""When it's time to cut people, the (older ones) tend to be first.""
"
2945,GOOG,"In fact, Wipper contends that ""a typical tech employee is aware that once they turn 40, they'll soon be subject to these stereotypes, unless they're the CEO, CTO or CIO.""
"
2946,GOOG,"The issue should be addressed, she says.
"
2947,GOOG,"""Tech companies shouldn't wait for lawsuits and arbitration to create a diverse workforce that includes older employees,"" Wipper said.
"
2948,GOOG,"Companies can take steps to avoid age discrimination, says attorney Mark Spring of Irvine, Calif.-based law firm Carothers DiSante & Freudenberger.
"
2949,GOOG,"The firm represents tech companies and other employers in labor-related cases.
"
2950,GOOG,"Most age discrimination cases Spring sees involve men age 40-55 who are laid off in company reorganizations. Some are engineers. Many are in mid-management, supervising engineers or programmers.
"
2951,GOOG,"The size of the companies sued is across the board, Spring says. Some, such as video game or app makers, generally have younger workforces. Others, such as hardware companies, tend to have more older employees, he says.
"
2952,GOOG,"Potential Legal Target
"
2953,GOOG,"Any company is a potential legal target when an older individual is let go or doesn't get hired, Spring, 47, says.
"
2954,GOOG,"It's important to make sure management understands the value of older workers, Spring says. Tech companies have many business-to-business relationships, and diversity makes good business sense, he says.
"
2955,GOOG,"""The folks on the other side of those relationships are not going to all be white males between the ages of 22 and 35,"" Spring said. ""Get older people in the applicant pool. It starts there.""
"
2956,GOOG,"If older potential employees aren't in the pool of applicants being considered, then it can look as if a company is intentionally discriminating when it's not, Spring says.
"
2957,GOOG,"One way to find more older job-seekers, he says, seems to contradict today's trends.

3068,GOOG,"Besides the expected things like who your competition is and how you'll best them, ""you will need to explain to the angel your unique value proposition.

"
3081,GOOG,"And its new, unusual market endeavor this year is helping to keep the company's growth moving steadily up and to the right.
"
3082,GOOG,"Web.com isn't just buying keyword ads from Google (GOOG) or other search firms to drive traffic. Nor is it doing a lot of conventional advertising. Instead, it's undertaking what Brown calls a grass-roots effort.

"
3084,GOOG,"After Q2, Web.com boosted its full-year revenue outlook to $531 million to $534 million, up from its previous forecast of $526 million to $533 million. At the midpoint, sales would rise 31%.
"
3085,GOOG,"Such growth hasn't made the company a household name. To get its name out there, Web.com executives have opted to offer free, in-person sessions aimed at schooling small businesses on, among other things, how to use Facebook (FB), Twitter and other social media.
"
3086,GOOG,"The company does do other marketing, most notably its sponsorship of the ""Triple A"" golf tour for professional golfers seeking to earn their way onto the bigger PGA Tour. Web.com replaced Nationwide Insurance as the tour's title sponsor in June 2012.
"
3087,GOOG,"The workshops, though, are its main drive. In the first year, Web.com has run 26 free workshops, with more scheduled, says Brown.

Nor is it doing a lot of conventional advertising. Instead, it's undertaking what Brown calls a grass-roots effort.""We're not running big, splashy television campaigns,"" the CEO told IBD. ""You see us sending out teams into local communities all across the country, running small-business forums where we teach businesses how to get more value out of the Internet.""After Q2, Web.com boosted its full-year revenue outlook to $531 million to $534 million, up from its previous forecast of $526 million to $533 million. At the midpoint, sales would rise 31%.Such growth hasn't made the company a household name. To get its name out there, Web.com executives have opted to offer free, in-person sessions aimed at schooling small businesses on, among other things, how to use Facebook (FB), Twitter and other social media.The company does do other marketing, most notably its sponsorship of the ""Triple A"" golf tour for professional golfers seeking to earn their way onto the bigger PGA Tour. Web.com replaced Nationwide Insurance as the tour's title sponsor in June 2012.The workshops, though, are its main drive. In the first year, Web.com has run 26 free workshops, with more scheduled, says Brown.The company doesn't sell products to small businesses at the events, but invites business owners to ask questions about ways to build a presence online — from buying search advertising keywords to building a Facebook page.""You don't find many businesses who go out across the country, educate small businesses, spend money to do it — and don't ask for something in return,"" Brown said.However, it's working.Web.com growth has accelerated in recent quarters.

3107,GOOG,"Comcast's rollout of advanced, Internet-ready X1 set-top boxes, along with a new cloud-based movie storage service and Weblike program guide, could shave video subscriber losses and boost cable TV revenue, analysts say.More than that, the new set-tops might give Comcast (CMCSA) more strategic options vs. Internet streaming services. Such competition from Intel (INTC), Google (GOOG), Sony (SNE), Apple (AAPL) and others has yet to materialize, though Netflix (NFLX) has made inroads vs. pay-TV firms.Comcast has invested heavily in its Xfinity Internet portal, building up a huge video-on-demand library of movies and TV shows. Comcast earlier this year agreed to buy out General Electric 's (GE) remaining stake in media firm NBCUniversal, after buying 51% of the firm in early 2011.Google, Intel and others eyeing Internet video delivered over broadband pipes to homes, called over-the-top TV, have been delayed in forging content deals.""I would call X1 more of a hedge against OTT than anything else,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan. ""If an Intel, Google or anybody gets the rights to sell linear TV over the Web, then the X1 platform would enable Comcast to very quickly offer a similar video product nationwide.""Comcast upped capital spending in 2013 to speed up deployment of X1 boxes in homes. Comcast, which has 21.7 million pay-TV customers, expects all of the markets served by its cable network to have X1 set-tops available by Jan. 1.Comcast hasn't disclosed how many customers have the new set-tops. The X1 set-tops provide easier-to-use interfaces for the program guide, digital video recorder and on-demand content.Consumers can access apps such as Facebook (FB) and Pandora (P). But on its Q3 earnings conference call, Comcast downplayed interest in making Netflix available as an app to its pay-TV customers""If customers really like the X1 platform, I think some could decide to forgo their $8 per month Netflix subscription and purchase more content from Comcast instead,"" analyst Horan said.The new guide is a plus, says Craig Moffett, analyst at research firm MoffettNathanson.User-Friendly Interface""A perennial knock on cable is that the user interface is clunky and unpleasant. As more and more people experienced the user-friendly and graphical experience of Netflix, that became too big a problem to ignore,"" Moffett said. ""Comcast's new guide measures up very well to what you find on the Web. It shares the same DNA as Web-based video services.""Moffett says the X1's Internet capability shouldn't be overlooked. The set-top delivers video both in standard cable TV format as well as IP (Internet protocol) streams.""A key element of the boxes is the IP chipset. That allows them to render any IP video stream on your television, whether from Netflix or Comcast itself,"" Moffett said.Comcast owns a stake in online video firm Hulu, but doesn't play a role in Hulu's management, one condition imposed by regulators in allowing Comcast to buy NBCU. Hulu is said to be in talks with cable TV firms.Philadelphia-based Comcast hasn't charged customers directly for the new set-tops. On its Q3 earnings call, Comcast executives indicated they expect the X1 investment to improve customer retention. Comcast had a net loss of 348,000 video subscribers in the first nine months of 2013, up slightly from the year-earlier period.With X1, Comcast is targeting higher-spending ""triple play"" customers that buy Internet, TV and phone services, says Bruce Leichtman, head of research firm LRG.Comcast expects X1 to drive video-on-demand usage and subscriptions to premium channels, and to enable targeted advertising.""X1 encourages consumption through VOD rather than DVRs, which is critical to Comcast's programming suppliers, who have seen 10 years of pressure on their ad models from commercial skipping,"" said Bryan Kraft, an analyst at Evercore Partners.Satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH), on the other hand, has irritated content firms with its ad-skipping Hopper DVR.Kraft says X1 is the most advanced video platform deployed by a U.S. cable TV firm, closing the gap in some ways with rivals and grabbing an edge in new areas.Phone companies Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T; (T)earlier used IP technology in their FiOS and Uverse products, enabling them to offer Web-based apps. Satellite firms DirecTV Group (DTV) and Dish pioneered DVR marketing.The X1 set-top provides a 500-gigabyte hard drive for storing recorded programs. Comcast plans to provide more online storage, but hasn't revealed costs .Comcast plans a software upgrade to its X1 boxes starting this year. Improvements are expected in the TV guide. Comcast has demonstrated voice-based program search, personalized viewing recommendations a la Netflix, and social networking features on what shows are trending.""There's definitely a growing 'cool' factor to the brand for the next generation of cable consumers,"" said Macquarie Capital analyst Amy Yong.

"
3208,GOOG,"The company aims to increase its search market share to 30% in 2014. Its browser is the second-largest in China, behind Microsoft's (MSFT) Internet Explorer, and should provide additional search traffic. Credit Suisse analyst Dick Wei expects the search revenue to grow at a 63% average annual rate to $317 million, or 20% of the firm's total revenue, by 2015.

Sogou's traffic share, which He estimates at 8% to 10%, may not be as large as perceived and may have overlaps with Qihoo's. Also, integrating a merger may be challenging and could lead to a significant share dilution for current shareholders, He writes in a research report.

"
3274,GOOG,"The Internet company has long had a goal to start turning a profit at Patch by Q4 of this year. In releasing its Q2 results last month, AOL (AOL) said it would close some Patch sites and lay off employees in its quest to make it to the black.
"
3275,GOOG,"The company reportedly has laid off about 350 of what had been about 1,100 Patch employees, with another 150 or so layoffs apparently coming soon. Those numbers have been widely reported, though AOL has declined to confirm any specifics. In addition, AOL reportedly has closed about 150 of its 900 Patch sites — in 22 states and Washington, D.C. — and is looking for partners on another 150.
"
3276,GOOG,"But AOL really has been cutting back since 2011, says a laid-off Patch editor who spoke to IBD on condition of anonymity. The staffer says laid-off employees have signed confidentiality agreements. Other former and current Patch employees declined to comment.
"
3277,GOOG,"AOL bought Patch in 2009, and started making investments to build a network of local news websites that would provide content to draw local viewers and, thus, local advertisers. AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, hired away from Google (GOOG) to lead AOL in 2009, was himself an early investor in Patch and is considered a co-founder.

"
3285,GOOG,"Having to write about local businesses that might become advertisers, and some do, has made the site's content seem less professional and likely hasn't helped attract readers, other editors have told media blogger Jim Romenesko.

"
3287,GOOG,"AOL responded to an interview request with an email saying the cuts are part of Patch's strategy to ""focus resources against core sites and partner in towns that need additional resources.""
"
3288,GOOG,"AOL expects Patch will cost $14 million to $18 million in restructuring charges through the end of the year. The benefit, however, will be a $30 million increase to adjusted operating income before depreciation or amortization, or OIBDA, it said in a regulatory filing.
"
3289,GOOG,"That would boost OIBDA to $465 million for the year vs. the $435 million that analysts had modeled before the cuts, wrote Cowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge in a research note. He rates AOL stock as outperform, or buy.
"

"
3292,GOOG,"But the online economic mix of content and ads continues to challenge newspapers and media companies of all sizes. Even before the latest changes, AOL in the first half of the year cut Patch costs by 25%, Armstrong told analysts on a conference call earlier this month.

3297,GOOG,"Patterns To Market Wealth: Tenth In A Series
"
3298,GOOG,"Every now and then, a leading stock forms a chart pattern that IBD calls a ""high, tight flag.""
"
3299,GOOG,"It's a rare pattern, but if you happen to spot one, then buy the stock and hang on. You could end up with a big profit.
"
3300,GOOG,"A high, tight flag has two parts: a flagpole and a flag.
"
3301,GOOG,"The flagpole generally consists of a gain of 100% or more during a period of four to eight weeks. The flag comes as the stock etches a three- or four-week decline of typically 10% to 25%.
"
3302,GOOG,"The breakout from this base occurs when the stock clears the peak of the flagpole in big turnover, meaning daily volume that's at least 40% above average.
"
3303,GOOG,"How rare is the high, tight flag? It's typically seen only a few times during a bull market. That's what IBD's founder and Chairman William O'Neil says in his book, ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""
"
3304,GOOG,"Google (GOOG) provided a strong example of a high, tight flag with its action in 2004, even though it didn't exactly match the definition for this pattern.
"
3305,GOOG,"The Web search king formed its flagpole in August 2004 in its first few sessions of trading 1 after its initial public offering of shares priced at 85.
"
3306,GOOG,"The flag took shape mostly through early September. 2 It featured a correction of 13% from a high of 113.48 — within that expected range of 10% to 25%.
"
3307,GOOG,"Google broke out past its flagpole's peak of 113.48 in the week ended Sept. 17, 2004 3 in higher weekly trade.
"
3308,GOOG,"So where did Google deviate from the exact definition of a high, tight flag? With its flagpole, which didn't feature a gain of at least 100%.
"
3309,GOOG,"Still, this is a great example of a leadership-quality stock that met the spirit of a chart pattern, even if the stock didn't match the definition perfectly.
"
3310,GOOG,"Keep in mind that stock chart reading is both an art and a science, and this would be a case where the art comes more into play. In hindsight, it's clear that Google's stellar fundamentals helped offset some technical flaws in the base.

3311,GOOG,"This was also an IPO base, or the first chart pattern formed by a new issue. Such bases often don't resemble a conventional base, so they can carry more risk. But they can still work out.Patterns To Market Wealth: Tenth In A SeriesEvery now and then, a leading stock forms a chart pattern that IBD calls a ""high, tight flag.""It's a rare pattern, but if you happen to spot one, then buy the stock and hang on. You could end up with a big profit.A high, tight flag has two parts: a flagpole and a flag.The flagpole generally consists of a gain of 100% or more during a period of four to eight weeks. The flag comes as the stock etches a three- or four-week decline of typically 10% to 25%.The breakout from this base occurs when the stock clears the peak of the flagpole in big turnover, meaning daily volume that's at least 40% above average.How rare is the high, tight flag? It's typically seen only a few times during a bull market. That's what IBD's founder and Chairman William O'Neil says in his book, ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""Google (GOOG) provided a strong example of a high, tight flag with its action in 2004, even though it didn't exactly match the definition for this pattern.The Web search king formed its flagpole in August 2004 in its first few sessions of trading 1 after its initial public offering of shares priced at 85.The flag took shape mostly through early September. 2 It featured a correction of 13% from a high of 113.48 — within that expected range of 10% to 25%.Google broke out past its flagpole's peak of 113.48 in the week ended Sept. 17, 2004 3 in higher weekly trade.So where did Google deviate from the exact definition of a high, tight flag? With its flagpole, which didn't feature a gain of at least 100%.Still, this is a great example of a leadership-quality stock that met the spirit of a chart pattern, even if the stock didn't match the definition perfectly.Keep in mind that stock chart reading is both an art and a science, and this would be a case where the art comes more into play. In hindsight, it's clear that Google's stellar fundamentals helped offset some technical flaws in the base.This was also an IPO base, or the first chart pattern formed by a new issue. Such bases often don't resemble a conventional base, so they can carry more risk. But they can still work out.

3313,GOOG,"Wouldn't it be great to find just one or two stocks that could help you retire, finance a child's education or pay for a new roof?Finding a stock like Google (GOOG), Home Depot (HD) or Microsoft (MSFT) in the early stages of their big runs can help you accomplish those goals. What feature in IBD can help your search?A very good place to start is the IBD 50, a computer-generated list of top growth stocks.These are not pure momentum stocks. They're selected based on key fundamental criteria such as earnings and sales growth and the quality of price performance. The list appears in the B section of IBD every Monday and Wednesday and includes a column of commentary. In IBD Leaderboard, the IBD 50 is updated every day.The IBD 50 saves you time because it does the screening for you. Every Monday, IBD also highlights two stocks from the IBD 50 in the form of mini columns. They discuss each stock's fundamentals, the company's business and its competitive strengths.Each mini column is accompanied by a chart, which includes long-term annual earnings growth and other statistics that provide clues to a stock's potential. Often, the stocks either are working on bases or are near buy points. Find a brief chart analysis at the bottom of the chart. Learning how to analyze charts helps you become a better investor.Web.com (WWWW), a provider of website publishing and e-commerce services for small and midsize businesses, was featured in an IBD 50 mini on Feb. 19. The chart that went with the story showed that Web.com sported a 91 Composite Rating and a 97 Earnings Per Share Rating, just shy of the best-possible 99.The chart analysis said it was near a possible 19.21 buy point of a long base. Instead of immediately clearing that buy point, Web.com went on to form a flat base with an 18.57 entry. It broke out on May 3 in huge volume. At the time, its Composite and Earnings Per Share remained strong at 91 and 96 respectively.From the breakout, Web.com ran up its 10-week line, hitting a high of 33.70 on Oct. 4, good for an 81% gain in just five months. Shortly after, the stock crashed through its 50-day line in heavy volume and now appears to be working on a new base.Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) has done well since it appeared in an IBD 50 mini column Jan. 7. Not long after, on Jan. 31, it crossed resistance at about 36 in the week ended Jan. 18 and has since risen along with its 10-week line. It's up 33% so far and hasn't yet triggered any major sell signals.Don't buy a stock just because it's in the IBD 50. Make sure to scrutinize the stocks to make sure they conform to IBD's fundamental and technical characteristics as they cross buy points in sound bases. Also, make sure the market is in a confirmed uptrend before buying.

3336,GOOG,"Does the uptrend of 2013 have more thrust left?Growth investors don't have to know the answer to that question, but it might be helpful to know which stocks are still in, or forming, first- or second-stage patterns.A first- or second-stage breakout has a better shot at success than later-stage breakouts do.The Big Cap 20 features quite a few stocks that aren't yet late stage.Google (GOOG) is extended from a first-stage pattern. Depending on how much the stock gains before consolidating, a new pattern would either be a first stage, base-on-base pattern or a second-stage base.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is extended from a first-stage, base-on-base pattern. The stock has gained more than 20% from that pattern, so a new base would be stage two.Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH), a provider of technology consulting and outsourcing services, is extended from a first-stage base. If the stock forms a new base, it would be second stage.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) cleared a first-stage base in late October. The next consolidation could be either a first-stage, base-on-base pattern or a second-stage base.Nike (NKE) shows no signs of consolidating at this point. The footwear maker is too extended from a first-stage base to be bought. A new base would be second stage.Cerner (CERN), a medical software maker, has sketched a stage two base-on-base pattern. The potential buy point is 59.52.Precision Castparts (PCP) is still in a buy zone from a 254.24 entry in a stage-two base. The company makes parts for the aerospace, power generation and automotive industries.Las Vegas Sands (LVS) has sketched a second-stage base. The potential buy point is 73.59.In the current market, patience might be needed for many of these stocks.Investors should avoid jumping into a stock before a valid buy point has been crossed in strong volume. Early entries can be dangerous, especially when some of these stocks may need to consolidate further.Some stocks are in, or are approaching, the 20% profit-taking zone. A retreat after a 20% to 25% gain from a breakout is common. So buying before a new entry has been triggered could lead to sizable and unnecessary losses.Also, take a close at each stock's fundamentals.Of the eight stocks mentioned here, four are expected to deliver slower earnings growth in 2014.The Street expects only one, Cerner, to deliver higher revenue growth in 2014. All eight carry a best possible A in Sales + Profit Margin + Return On Equity.Each has some quality fund support. The stock that saw the biggest increase in fund support in 2013 through September was Las Vegas Sands with a 9% increase.

Fairfax owns about 10% of BlackBerry shares.The consortium is seeking financing from BofA Merrill Lynch and BMO Capital Markets to acquire BlackBerry and take the company private. Canadian pension funds have been said to be cool to the idea of a leveraged buyout.Trading in BlackBerry, which on Friday said it would report a Q2 loss of nearly $1 billion and would cut 40% of its workforce, or 4,500 jobs, was halted Monday afternoon on the news. The stock plunged 17% on Friday and was down 5% on Monday before trading was halted. When trading resumed, the stock was up nearly 1%. BlackBerry stock was near 8.80 in afternoon trading in the stock market Monday, giving it a market cap near $4.54 billion.BlackBerry shareholders would receive $9 per share in cash under the proposal.""We believe this transaction will open an exciting new private chapter for BlackBerry, its customers, carriers and employees,"" Prem Watsa, chairman and CEO of Toronto, Ontario-based Fairfax Financial, said in press release.""We can deliver immediate value to shareholders, while we continue the execution of a long-term strategy in a private company with a focus on delivering superior and secure enterprise solutions to BlackBerry customers around the world.""Instead of focusing on sales of smartphones, BlackBerry on Friday said it would pull out of the consumer market and focus on selling smartphone services to businesses and other enterprises.BlackBerry was the first company to develop a cellphone email system robust enough to handle the demands of enterprises, and it took an early lead in the emerging smartphone market. But the company's market share has crumbled the past three or four year in the face of rising competition from Apple (AAPL) and the makers of smartphones based on Google's (GOOG) open-source Android operating system, led by Samsung.Apple on Monday reported better-than-expected opening-weekend sales of its newest iPhones.

3402,GOOG,"When you climb a mountain, you tend to take smaller, more careful steps as the elevation increases.Makes sense, right? As the ascent steepens, so does the risk of falling.This logic certainly benefits both you and your portfolio when you're scaling into a great stock.The key to making big money in stocks is to concentrate, over time, more of your money into your best performers.Mathematically, this makes a lot of sense. If a third of your account is in a stock that is poised to double in price, and the other two-thirds are in duds, you can bolster your overall return by jettisoning the laggards and buying more shares in your emerging big winner.Just make sure to do this carefully. In the Jan. 24 IBD, this column showed how to pyramid into a full position at the breakout.The same strategy applies when you're up 10%, 20% or more on the initial position and the stock approaches a follow-on buy point. By adding smaller amounts of shares, you avoid a dramatic rise in the average cost of your shares.Why do so? A quick correction could send your entire stake underwater and shake your confidence.When you add shares as the stock finds support at the 10-week moving average, consider buying just a quarter's worth of your initial position, or even less.Did a three-weeks-tight pattern form? When the stock clears this entry point, perhaps adding just a tenth of the number of shares you already own or less makes sense.If the stock stumbles soon after your follow-on buy, you need not blow out the entire position. Consider selling just the most recent stake and keep your core holding.Suppose you grabbed 100 shares of Google (GOOG) just as it moved past a 558.68 base-on-base buy point on Sept. 21, 2007 1. When it hit 670 five weeks later, you could have exited the Internet search leader with a 20% gain 2.What would have happened if you instead added to your stake?In November, Google pulled back to the 10-week line in unusually heavy volume 3. Say you added 30 shares at 680. Your average cost would have risen to 586.68, or nearly 15% below that price.That's a decent, but not great, profit cushion. As the bull market lost steam at the end of 2007 and Google began rolling over in January in accelerating volume 4, you could have sold as late as the week ended Jan. 18 and salvaged a gain.If you bought 100 shares at 680, your overall profit cushion would have shrunk to just 9% below the latest price.The risk of losing money jumped quickly if you had tripled your stake with 200 more shares. Your average cost: 639.56 a share. That's more than 14% above the original buy point. By the week ended Jan. 4, 2008 5, your total gain would have shrunk to a measly 3%.

3491,GOOG,"Weak industrial activity in the early summer signaled that the economy's soft patch continues, but a rising inflation trend may limit any further monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve, various reports showed Friday.June industrial output rose 0.2% last month, the Fed said, as expected. But May production was revised to a 0.1% drop from a 0.1% gain. Output was up 3.4% vs. a year ago.The New York Fed said its Empire State manufacturing index unexpectedly stayed negative for a second straight month in July.Meanwhile, the consumer price index fell 0.2% in June as gasoline prices plunged, the Labor Department said. But core CPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.3%. Core inflation rose to 1.6%, still below the Fed's unofficial 2% target but double the rate at the end of last year.""We've seen inflation accelerate at a time when we've seen high unemployment, low economic growth and practically no income growth,"" said Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wells Fargo. Fed chief Ben Bernanke told Congress last week that the central bank would consider additional asset purchases if economic weakness continues and deflation risks reappear.But he said such a scenario is unlikely. He expects the economy to accelerate in the months ahead as oil prices moderate and disruptions caused by Japan's disaster fade.Meanwhile, ""the core rise for second month in a row ... is certainly anything but deflationary,"" making it unlikely that Fed policymakers will vote for a third round of bond purchases, said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial.Stocks rallied as Google (GOOG) earnings and relief over European bank stress tests offset the modestly disappointing data. The Nasdaq rose 1% and the S&P 500 0.6%.The New York Fed's factory index was -3.76 in July after June's -7.79. New orders contracted while hiring stalled and the workweek fell sharply.Vitner said: ""Look at the Empire ... that to me is troubling.""U.S. manufacturing production, meanwhile, was flat in June as Japan's earthquake continued to curb auto output.""The key is July, August and September, when we should see a markedly better move up in industrial production,"" Hoffman said. ""If not, then the soft patch continues beyond what many economists were expecting.""Also Friday, the Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index sank 7.7 points in July to 63.8, the lowest since March 2009, when the U.S. was still mired in a deep recession and bear market. That mirrors a sharp drop in the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index.

3493,GOOG,"Keeping a close eye on technology has a new meaning as more companies use eye-tracking technology.
"
3494,GOOG,"Eye tracking can increase convenience, performance and safety for consumers. It also, however, raises privacy questions. When a sensor is tracking and recording what a person is looking at, who is using that data, and for what?
"
3495,GOOG,"The technology, basically, uses a camera and lighting source (usually infrared) to gather data about where the eye is gazing and how it is rotating. This is used to analyze the way a user looks at an interface, such as a computer screen, and make it possible for people to navigate the interface with their eyes.
"
3496,GOOG,"People should know beforehand when eye-tracking technology is being used, and they should have the ability to opt out, says John Villanos, a professor of electrical engineering and public policy at UCLA.
"
3497,GOOG,"""If you're being watched by your electronic devices without specific consent, that raises real privacy concerns,"" Villanos said.

3499,GOOG,"""So far, I have not seen any examples of this (eye-tracking) data being inappropriately collected and used,"" he said. ""But I also haven't yet seen any service agreements specifically mentioning eye tracking,"" though he expects to start seeing them.
"
3500,GOOG,"Eye tracking is being used in a variety of products on the market or in testing stages. For example:
"
3501,GOOG," South Korea's Samsung's Galaxy 4 smartphone features eye-tracking that will scroll a page of information as a person is reading, pause a video when a person looks away, or change a screen to landscape mode when the person is lying down to read.
"
3502,GOOG," Sweden's Tobii Technology, which has been developing eye-tracking technologies for over a decade, is incorporating its Tobii Gaze interface in a prototype of a new Ultrabook laptop PC, in partnership with touchpad and user interface tech firm Synaptics (SYNA). Users will be able to select apps and emails, surf the Web and perform other tasks hands-free, with eye gaze used to point and direct.
"
3503,GOOG,"A Tobii spokeswoman said developers will ultimately determine what functionality options (using eyes, touch, voice and gesture) will be programmed into their products to create the best user experience. The key to eye-tracking integration for mainstream computer users, says Tobii, is the intuitive nature of the experience, when eyes choose and fingers select.
"
3504,GOOG," Palo Alto, Calif.-based Mindflash, which develops training software, is beta testing an eye-tracking feature called FocusAssist, for use with Apple (AAPL) iPads, and later in other tablets. Different types of organizations use Mindflash to train employees on many aspects of their work. If a trainee, though, gets distracted during a session — say he or she opens an email or clicks on a cat YouTube video — the program stops until the trainee is ready to resume. It also collects data on what parts of the training program are engaging people, and what parts aren't.

"
3508,GOOG,"But if trainees are wary of being watched this way, they can note that Mindflash doesn't report anyone for slacking off. It collects aggregate data only on what worked and what didn't, rather than data on individual trainees.
"
3509,GOOG,"""We provide feedback on the training,"" Vieira said. ""We might say that 'this course was more engaging than that course,' or 'this section was more engaging than that one' or 'here's where people were confused.'""
"
3510,GOOG,"Besides just eye movements, FocusAssist will one day track facial expressions and other indications of how people feel about a course, Vieira said.
"
3511,GOOG,"But do people want their tablet telling the world how happy, sad or confused they are?
"
3512,GOOG,"""There's definitely a feeling with any of this technology — is this Big Brotherish?"" Vieira said. ""From our perspective, as long as we make it clear to the trainee what is happening, and why, and what is being shared and what's not, we're fine with it.""
"
3513,GOOG,"He says the software aims to help trainers improve their courses and improve engagement in a world becoming ever more distracting.
"
3514,GOOG,"""We're trying to deliver training that is critical to job performance, which may involve issues of safety or even life and death,"" he said, using airlines and health care organizations as examples. ""We want to make sure people are very focused, and are getting the information they need.""
"
3515,GOOG,"Eye tracking hit another touchstone last month when Google (GOOG) got patent approval for its pay-per-gaze tracking technology. The patent describes the feature on a head-mounted device, which fits the description of Google Glass, the wearable, eye-glasses-like computer the Internet giant is developing. The company could use pay-per-gaze to charge advertisers based on whether and how long a person actually is looking at an ad, online or in the real world.

"
3576,GOOG,"As Twitter prepares for the most-anticipated Internet IPO since Facebook, some observers say the microblog's ad growth prospects are better than those of No. 1 social network Facebook.
"
3577,GOOG,"Twitter late Thursday announced, via tweet, that it's confidentially filed for an IPO, meaning it doesn't yet have to disclose financials. The initial public offering has been long awaited. Facebook (FB) went out in May 2012.
"
3578,GOOG,"But Twitter's timing is much better than Facebook's, says an analyst, because mobile ads conveniently are just now emerging as a major revenue source for Internet companies, including Google (GOOG) and Yahoo (YHOO).
"
3579,GOOG,"""It should benefit Twitter that they're coming out at a time when mobile adoption, broadly speaking, is seen by advertisers as better,"" Wedge Partners analyst Martin Pyykkonen told IBD.
"
3580,GOOG,"And Pyykkonen is among those who say Twitter might be better suited to mobile ads than even Facebook.
"
3581,GOOG,"Because Twitter has revealed scant financial data, Wall Street estimates on the company's total valuation range roughly between $10 billion and $20 billion. It has some 200 million registered users, while Facebook has more than 1 billion.
"
3582,GOOG,"Facebook's stock famously tanked right after its IPO, largely when investors realized the most-used social network wasn't yet prepared to sell mobile ads. Valued at more than $100 billion at the start of the IPO, its valuation fell by more than half a year ago, and is now back above $100 billion.
"
3583,GOOG,"Twitter won't have that same mobile ad problem.
"
3584,GOOG,"Research firm eMarketer expects Twitter's total revenue to double this year to $583 million. It estimates that 53% of that revenue, or $309 million, will come from mobile ads.
"
3585,GOOG,"In 2014, eMarketer forecasts $551 million in mobile ad revenue for Twitter, or 58% of its total revenue of about $950 million.
"
3586,GOOG,"Facebook Faced Long Climb
"
3587,GOOG,"Facebook just posted a big mobile-ad-revenue quarter in Q2, results that propelled its stock finally to rise above its offering and first-day-high prices. Facebook said its Q2 mobile ad revenue rose 75% in Q2 to $656 million from $375 million in Q1, a huge single-quarter jump. In Q2, mobile accounted for 41% of Facebook's total revenue, up from 30% in Q1.
"
3588,GOOG,"Twitter and Facebook both target users with ads based on information their users have shared on the service, from location, gender and age to hobbies, field of employment and more.
"
3589,GOOG,"But differences in the way users interact on the two networks seem to give Twitter an edge, says analyst Pyykkonen.
"
3590,GOOG,"Facebook is a more ""social focused"" platform, where users mostly are following family and friends, he says. Twitter users, on the other hand, follow lots of news and brands. That can make it easier for advertisers to target a premium audience with pertinent ads, he says.
"
3591,GOOG,"""Neither one is a perfect system for targeting,"" he said, ""but in theory, Twitter should be more effective.""
"
3592,GOOG,"Ad networks could also be a big boost for both social networks, as they are for Google and Yahoo. Facebook is deep into developing such a network, which will let it sell ads outside the Facebook platform.
"
3593,GOOG,"Similarly, Twitter on Sept. 9 agreed to acquire ad exchange MoPub for a reported $350 million, a deal that focuses on mobile ads and buying based on bidding.
"
3594,GOOG,"""In particular, we think there is a key opportunity to extend many types of native advertising across the mobile ecosystem through the MoPub exchange,"" Kevin Weil, Twitter's vice president of revenue product, said in a blog post announcing that deal.
"
3595,GOOG,"MoPub Acquisition Praised
"
3596,GOOG,"MoPub will boost Twitter's profitability, Joe Kowan, practice lead of digital investment and activation at media agency MEC, told IBD via email.
"
3597,GOOG,"The acquisition will let Twitter build out its mobile advertising business, Kowan says.
"
3598,GOOG,"Another factor in ad sales is that Facebook is a closed network. Users have to register and sign in to view any of the site. Twitter's site is open to all, who can view any content that tweeters haven't made private. So, Twitter can serve ads to people who aren't even users.
"
3599,GOOG,"Under a 2012 Securities and Exchange Commission rule, companies with less than $1 billion in annual revenue can choose to keep financial details private until three weeks prior to selling shares or starting a road show.

3718,GOOG,"When circumstances change, a reasonable investor will adjust. Consistency isn't worth much if it puts you out of sync with reality.
"
3719,GOOG,"Over the years, the S factor in CAN SLIM — supply and demand — has changed to some extent.
"
3720,GOOG,"For example, in the first edition of William O'Neil's ""How to Make Money in Stocks"" in 1988, the summary of the S chapter says, ""stocks with a small or reasonable number of shares outstanding will, other things being equal, usually outperform older, large capitalization companies.""
"
3721,GOOG,"This remains generally true, particularly if you take note of the words ""older"" and ""usually.""
"
3722,GOOG,"In the fourth edition, however, the S chapter summary says, ""Stock of any size capitalization can be bought using the CAN SLIM system. But small-cap stocks will be substantially more volatile, both on the upside and on the downside.""
"
3723,GOOG,"The emphasis changed, didn't it? As longtime readers of IBD know, many big-cap stocks — such as Priceline.com (PCLN), Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG) — became big gainers and fast movers in recent years.
"
3724,GOOG,"In many respects, these big stocks acted like small stocks in their ability to break out aggressively and hustle to new highs.
"
3725,GOOG,"What changed?
"
3726,GOOG,"The short answer is that the stock market today is a high-volume world. The ability of institutions to move a big stock is greater. Consider these facts:
"
3727,GOOG,"In 1945, there were 68 mutual funds. In 2012, there were 16,380 funds, if you include exchange-traded funds, unit investment trusts and closed-end funds. (The count is even higher if you add hedge funds.)
"
3728,GOOG,"In 1980, mutual funds owned 3% of the shares of U.S. stocks, according to NYSE, Wilshire Associates and the Federal Reserve Flow of Funds Report. In 1990, the figure was 8%. By 2004, mutual funds owned 25%.
"
3729,GOOG,"Mutual funds' willingness to trade rather than sit also increased. Turnover of shares as a percentage of assets was in single or low double-digit percentages from 1945 to 1975. From 1980 on, turnover soared to a range of 22% to 40%. As Vanguard Group founder John Bogle wrote in Financial Analysts Journal in 2005, ""Once an own-a-stock industry, funds became a rent-a-stock industry.""

3730,GOOG,"Hedge funds grew in the 1990s, bringing a cowboy-capitalist approach — quick on the draw whether buying, selling or shorting.
"
3731,GOOG,"Add this up, and you have a stock market with more buying and selling power than ever before. These changes are why IBD says institutional activity shapes the stock market.
"
3732,GOOG,"This is why you now read ""stock of any size capitalization"" works with CAN SLIM. Stocks with bigger floats can move more rapidly than they could in the past because the buying and selling power has ballooned.

"
3767,GOOG,"But that mostly reflects JPMorgan's (JPM) unexpected loss due to a huge charge for ongoing litigation woes.

"
3769,GOOG,"Of the 228 S&P 500 companies that have reported Q3 earnings, 68% have topped analysts' expectations, while 20% have fallen short, according to Thomson Reuters. That's slightly better than normal.

"
3776,GOOG,"Several big techs are still on deck, including Apple (AAPL), which should report a 9% earnings per share drop Monday. Facebook (FB) and LinkedIn (LNKD) are expected to deliver large profit gains this coming week — but neither social network is on the S&P 500.
"
3777,GOOG,"Industrials have had a strong showing, with 69% beating earnings estimates so far, including giants such as General Electric (GE), Boeing (BA) and 3M (MMM). Caterpillar (CAT) reported a bigger-than-expected earnings drop and cut its outlook, as the construction equipment giant cited weak mining gear demand. But S&P 500 industrial earnings should show a 7.3% yearly gain.

"
3780,GOOG,"The financials sector is a drag on overall S&P 500 earnings, with a mere 0.2% gain expected. That's a big change from the 9.1% increase seen on Oct. 1. In recent years, banks had boosted their earnings by releasing billions of dollars from funds they set aside to cover losses.
"
3781,GOOG,"That has masked prior underlying weakness in the rest of corporate America. In Q2, S&P 500 earnings rose 4.9% — but dipped 0.2% excluding financials.

That would be the third straight quarter of decelerating growth and below the 4.5% expected on Oct. 1.But that mostly reflects JPMorgan's (JPM) unexpected loss due to a huge charge for ongoing litigation woes.Excluding JPMorgan, the blended S&P 500 estimate is for 5.9% growth.Of the 228 S&P 500 companies that have reported Q3 earnings, 68% have topped analysts' expectations, while 20% have fallen short, according to Thomson Reuters. That's slightly better than normal.Revenues are expected to rise 2.2%, the same as in Q2. About 54% of companies so far have topped sales targets vs. 49% over the past four quarters.Sales have been a challenge for corporations amid sluggish U.S. and global economic growth.""A lot of the earnings growth over the last year has been to cost cutting and not top-line growth,"" said Gregory Harrison, a Thomson Reuters analyst. ""Companies are reorganizing, doing whatever they can to keep the earnings numbers up.""No IT Woes HereThe tech sector has been an earnings standout so far, thanks to robust results from Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT) and others. As of Friday, 84% of S&P 500 technology components have topped analyst estimates. Two-thirds of S&P 500 tech firms have beaten revenue forecasts.S&P 500 tech earnings are on track to rise 6.3%, with revenue up 3.9%.Several big techs are still on deck, including Apple (AAPL), which should report a 9% earnings per share drop Monday. Facebook (FB) and LinkedIn (LNKD) are expected to deliver large profit gains this coming week — but neither social network is on the S&P 500.Industrials have had a strong showing, with 69% beating earnings estimates so far, including giants such as General Electric (GE), Boeing (BA) and 3M (MMM). Caterpillar (CAT) reported a bigger-than-expected earnings drop and cut its outlook, as the construction equipment giant cited weak mining gear demand. But S&P 500 industrial earnings should show a 7.3% yearly gain.The consumer discretionary sector leads with an expected 9.2% increase. Ford (F) delivered strong earnings, with General Motors (GM) on tap this week.Financial LossThe financials sector is a drag on overall S&P 500 earnings, with a mere 0.2% gain expected. That's a big change from the 9.1% increase seen on Oct. 1. In recent years, banks had boosted their earnings by releasing billions of dollars from funds they set aside to cover losses.That has masked prior underlying weakness in the rest of corporate America. In Q2, S&P 500 earnings rose 4.9% — but dipped 0.2% excluding financials.However, on Oct. 11 JPMorgan reported its first-ever loss under CEO Jamie Dimon. The nation's largest bank disclosed it has stashed $23 billion in its legal reserves to deal with its ongoing litigation and regulatory battles.JPMorgan late Friday agreed to pay $5.1 billion to settle mortgage securities claims with Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. A reported $13 billion settlement with the Justice Department has yet to be announced.Excluding JPMorgan, financials are expected to end up with a 15.8% profit gain.But big banks such as Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) continue to face legal fallout from the financial crisis.S&P 500 energy earnings are expected to drop 7.9%, the only sector to suffer a decline. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and other Big Oil giants report this week.Looking ahead, analysts still see robust Q4 earnings growth — 9.5% as of Friday. Sales are expected to climb just 0.7%. That wide disparity suggests that profit forecasts will be coming down rapidly as the year winds down.

"
3856,GOOG,"Verizon Communications' FiOS phone, broadband Internet and TV business continues to dish out pain to cable TV firms, but whether its market gains are enough to create a spinoff of that business isn't clear.
"
3857,GOOG,"Observers have long speculated that Verizon (VZ) could spin off its residential landline business and go wireless-only. Goldman Sachs in January 2012 suggested Verizon could sell its wireline assets, which include FiOS, partly to unload pension liabilities for unionized workers.
"
3858,GOOG,"Verizon's recent agreement to buy out Vodafone's (VOD) 45% stake in their Verizon Wireless joint venture, meanwhile, led Citigroup to ponder whether Verizon would restructure to make its residential business — including consumer services delivered over copper and newer FiOS fiber-optic lines — independent.
"
3859,GOOG,"On a conference call with analysts to discuss the Vodafone buyout, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam did not shoot down the idea, but added he would be ""very thoughtful about making operational changes.""
"
3860,GOOG,"Adding $62B In Debt
"
3861,GOOG,"Verizon will add nearly $62 billion in debt to finance the Vodafone deal. Verizon has already issued a corporate-record $49 billion in new bonds, gobbled up by institutional investors. With a spinoff or sale of its FiOS and copper residential business, Verizon could unload some debt. It's made such moves before, such as selling phone lines in the Northeast in 2007 to FairPoint Communications.
"
3862,GOOG,"A big question is whether Verizon's residential business still churns out enough cash to make a spinoff feasible.
"
3863,GOOG,"""Wireline operations aren't highly leverageable because they don't generate lots of excess cash flow,"" said Dennis Saputo, senior vice president at Moody's Investor Service, via email.
"
3864,GOOG,"Verizon's FiOS business has taken a toll on cable TV firms Comcast (CMCSA), Cablevision Systems (CVC) and Time Warner Cable (TWC). In Q2, Verizon added 161,000 FiOS Internet and 140,000 FiOS video customers, up 20% and 17% from the year-earlier quarter. Its FiOS revenue rose 14.7% to $2.7 billion. Verizon had more than 5 million FiOS TV customers as of June 30.
"
3865,GOOG,"While Verizon's FiOS network passes 18 million homes, it still has 9 million customers connected to copper lines, which provide much slower Internet speeds and no TV. Residential line losses to cable rivals have stabilized in FiOS areas but continue in copper-wired markets.
"
3866,GOOG,"In a Sept. 3 research report, Citigroup analyst Michael Rollins said that after closing the Vodafone deal, Verizon might be spinning off its residential wireline operations. Rollins says it would make sense for Verizon to keep its wireless and enterprise units. The enterprise business sells services to corporate and government customers.
"
3867,GOOG,"""Verizon could try to architect itself as a wireless-plus-enterprise provider of telecom services if it could find a way of monetizing its residential copper and fiber-based FiOS assets without impairing its ability to retain last-mile access to business customers within the Northeast,"" Rollins wrote.
"
3868,GOOG,"Verizon says it aims to return to single-A credit ratings within four or five years after buying out Vodafone's share in Verizon Wireless, a deal expected to bring Verizon's total debt to more than $117 billion. Moody's rated Verizon's recent bond offering at Baa1, a notch below A-.
"
3869,GOOG,"But a sale of the consumer residential business is ""hard to imagine,"" said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson Research.
"
3870,GOOG,"""Regulators probably wouldn't let Verizon walk away from the non-FiOS parts of the network,"" Moffett said. ""Verizon probably wouldn't be willing to sell FiOS if it left them with just the legacy copper.
"
3871,GOOG,"""And any buyer other than an already-regulated telco like CenturyLink (CTL) probably wouldn't be willing to accept the regulatory burdens that would come with the legacy copper network.
"
3872,GOOG,"""I don't know there is any way to satisfy buyer, seller and regulators at the same time.""
"
3873,GOOG,"Fiber Upgrades Continue
"
3874,GOOG,"Verizon continues to invest in FiOS. Verizon said it planned to spend some $23 billion upgrading homes to fiber-optic services before it stopped giving cost updates to Wall Street analysts back in 2006. Out of the 18 million homes ""passed"" by the FiOS network, the service is available to 14.6 million. The other 3.4 million — many in apartment complexes — would still need some final wiring.
"
3875,GOOG,"Verizon is focused ""on converting homes passed to available,"" said Bryan Kraft, an analyst at Evercore Partners, in a research report. It's a challenge getting rights to re-wire apartment buildings in markets such as New York City and Philadelphia.
"
3876,GOOG,"Kraft estimates the FiOS network will reach 19 million homes by the end of 2016.
"
3877,GOOG,"Verizon says 35% of its 5.7 million FiOS Internet customers subscribe to broadband speeds ranging from 50 to 300 megabits per second. Verizon has tested gigabit services on par with Google 's (GOOG) well-publicized fiber-optic network, being built in Kansas City and Austin, Texas. One gigabit is 1,024 megabits.
"
3878,GOOG,"But Verizon might have to upgrade to even more advanced fiber-optic technology, analysts say, to keep up in the broadband race with cable TV rivals and Google.
"
3879,GOOG,"It's clear, however, that Verizon's FiOS service has slowed growth at cable TV firms in areas where FiOS has been built out.
"
3880,GOOG,"""Since the launch of service in 2005, FiOS has grown rapidly, and in Q2 made up 75% of Verizon's fixed-line consumer retail revenues and 28% of total fixed line revenues,"" wrote Joseph Mastrogiovanni, a Credit Suisse analyst, in a research report. ""There is still material room for Verizon to grow the FiOS subscriber base, despite the rollout to new areas slowing down.""
"
3881,GOOG,"As Verizon expands the FiOS footprint in New York, that city's cable TV providers, Cablevision and Time Warner Cable, stand to feel more pain, says Moffett.
"
3882,GOOG,"""Is a sale of Cablevision, which by a huge margin is the publicly traded cable operator most directly affected by FiOS, feasible given what potential buyers must know about the FiOS effect?"" he asked in a report.
"
3883,GOOG,"Evercore's Kraft agrees Cablevision has the greatest exposure to Verizon's FiOS service, with half of its territory in Long Island, and parts of New York City, New Jersey and Connecticut vulnerable. He says 15% of Comcast's service region is covered by FiOS, with TWC and Cox Communications a bit lower. Only 4% of Charter Communications (CHTR) markets are impacted by FiOS, he says.
"
3884,GOOG,"While Verizon's FiOS unit competes with cable TV firms, Verizon Wireless has taken a different path. Verizon Wireless acquired radio spectrum from Comcast, TWC, Cox Communications and Bright House Networks in 2012, forming a joint venture under which the cable firms have rights to resell wireless services.
"
3885,GOOG,"Verizon Communications' FiOS phone, broadband Internet and TV business continues to dish out pain to cable TV firms, but whether its market gains are enough to create a spinoff of that business isn't clear.
"
3886,GOOG,"Observers have long speculated that Verizon (VZ) could spin off its residential landline business and go wireless-only. Goldman Sachs in January 2012 suggested Verizon could sell its wireline assets, which include FiOS, partly to unload pension liabilities for unionized workers.
"
3887,GOOG,"Verizon's recent agreement to buy out Vodafone's (VOD) 45% stake in their Verizon Wireless joint venture, meanwhile, led Citigroup to ponder whether Verizon would restructure to make its residential business — including consumer services delivered over copper and newer FiOS fiber-optic lines — independent.
"
3888,GOOG,"On a conference call with analysts to discuss the Vodafone buyout, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam did not shoot down the idea, but added he would be ""very thoughtful about making operational changes.""
"
3889,GOOG,"Adding $62B In Debt
"
3890,GOOG,"Verizon will add nearly $62 billion in debt to finance the Vodafone deal. Verizon has already issued a corporate-record $49 billion in new bonds, gobbled up by institutional investors. With a spinoff or sale of its FiOS and copper residential business, Verizon could unload some debt. It's made such moves before, such as selling phone lines in the Northeast in 2007 to FairPoint Communications.
"
3891,GOOG,"A big question is whether Verizon's residential business still churns out enough cash to make a spinoff feasible.
"
3892,GOOG,"""Wireline operations aren't highly leverageable because they don't generate lots of excess cash flow,"" said Dennis Saputo, senior vice president at Moody's Investor Service, via email.
"
3893,GOOG,"Verizon's FiOS business has taken a toll on cable TV firms Comcast (CMCSA), Cablevision Systems (CVC) and Time Warner Cable (TWC). In Q2, Verizon added 161,000 FiOS Internet and 140,000 FiOS video customers, up 20% and 17% from the year-earlier quarter. Its FiOS revenue rose 14.7% to $2.7 billion. Verizon had more than 5 million FiOS TV customers as of June 30.
"
3894,GOOG,"While Verizon's FiOS network passes 18 million homes, it still has 9 million customers connected to copper lines, which provide much slower Internet speeds and no TV. Residential line losses to cable rivals have stabilized in FiOS areas but continue in copper-wired markets.
"
3895,GOOG,"In a Sept. 3 research report, Citigroup analyst Michael Rollins said that after closing the Vodafone deal, Verizon might be spinning off its residential wireline operations. Rollins says it would make sense for Verizon to keep its wireless and enterprise units. The enterprise business sells services to corporate and government customers.
"
3896,GOOG,"""Verizon could try to architect itself as a wireless-plus-enterprise provider of telecom services if it could find a way of monetizing its residential copper and fiber-based FiOS assets without impairing its ability to retain last-mile access to business customers within the Northeast,"" Rollins wrote.
"
3897,GOOG,"Verizon says it aims to return to single-A credit ratings within four or five years after buying out Vodafone's share in Verizon Wireless, a deal expected to bring Verizon's total debt to more than $117 billion. Moody's rated Verizon's recent bond offering at Baa1, a notch below A-.
"
3898,GOOG,"But a sale of the consumer residential business is ""hard to imagine,"" said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson Research.
"
3899,GOOG,"""Regulators probably wouldn't let Verizon walk away from the non-FiOS parts of the network,"" Moffett said. ""Verizon probably wouldn't be willing to sell FiOS if it left them with just the legacy copper.
"
3900,GOOG,"""And any buyer other than an already-regulated telco like CenturyLink (CTL) probably wouldn't be willing to accept the regulatory burdens that would come with the legacy copper network.
"
3901,GOOG,"""I don't know there is any way to satisfy buyer, seller and regulators at the same time.""
"
3902,GOOG,"Fiber Upgrades Continue
"
3903,GOOG,"Verizon continues to invest in FiOS. Verizon said it planned to spend some $23 billion upgrading homes to fiber-optic services before it stopped giving cost updates to Wall Street analysts back in 2006. Out of the 18 million homes ""passed"" by the FiOS network, the service is available to 14.6 million. The other 3.4 million — many in apartment complexes — would still need some final wiring.

But it's more important if the device has great features so that it can compete against the market leaders, Apple's (AAPL) iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy.""I think more important (than release date) is the device itself,"" Sebastian said, ""and creating a product with Google DNA and Android that is competitive.""The phone's design is still a mystery, though Google repeatedly has hinted at some possible features.On Motorola's website, the company says it'll be the ""first smartphone designed, engineered and assembled in the U.S.A.""Motorola also says the Moto X will be the first smartphone you can ""design yourself,"" which may refer to hardware choices or to personal modifications to Android, Google's open-source mobile operating system.From comments that Google CEO Larry Page has made, the phone might well be indestructible.

4054,GOOG,"The technology of online display advertising is evolving rapidly, says Tim Cadogan, chief executive of OpenX.
"
4055,GOOG,"His startup recently received $20 million in funding led by the venture capital units of SAP (SAP) and AOL (AOL), along with two big Japanese groups, Mitsui Global Investment and Sumitomo's Presidio Ventures. It's now received $50 million in total funding.
"
4056,GOOG,"OpenX provides OpenX Market, an online ad exchange that enables live-auction bidding for Internet ad placement. The company also provides OpenX Enterprise, an ad-serving technology that integrates with an ad exchange for a unique digital ad serving and revenue sharing platform. The business could disrupt older business models and search ad leaders like Google's (GOOG) DoubleClick service. This category of technology has been in the news of late with Google's $400 million acquisition of AdMeld.
"
4057,GOOG,"Cadogan recently spoke with IBD about its business opportunity in the online advertising market.
"
4058,GOOG,"IBD: Tell me about the market opportunity you are targeting.
"
4059,GOOG,"Cadogan: Internet advertising has two major sectors, search advertising and display. Search for so many years has been the biggest and was the fastest growing, but it's now beginning to slow down simply because the volume of searches is decelerating. It has sort of reached a natural level of search volume.
"
4060,GOOG,"Search marketing is now mature enough that it is not growing at the rate it was. The quantity of ads is not growing as fast and the price isn't growing that fast either. The Interactive Advertising Bureau said U.S. ad revenue from searches grew about 12% in 2010 to $12 billion.
"
4061,GOOG,"Online display advertising, though, is nearly $10 billion and is growing twice as fast as search. According to the IAB, it grew 24% last year. And at the same time, the display world, which traditionally was pretty much manual, is now becoming more scientific.
"
4062,GOOG,"IBD: What do you mean by saying that display advertising was manual?
"
4063,GOOG,"Cadogan: Traditionally, display was sold through a sales force. People come to you and ask if you would like to buy the big ad at the top of the Yahoo home page and that will be $700,000 for the day. A lot of big deals get negotiated upfront around big packages.
"
4064,GOOG,"Now what is happening is that you have the rise of ad exchanges, such as ours. An ad exchange is basically like a stock market, except that you are not trading stocks but you are trading ad inventory. We take all the components of an ad server traditionally used for online advertising to help with direct sales and we add in an ad exchange — the stock market for ad inventory — and put them together into a single platform. We can offer the publisher an integrated system where they can manage and maximize their revenue in one place.
"
4065,GOOG,"IBD: Can you explain further how you do that?
"
4066,GOOG,"Cadogan: There are a lot of companies on the Web who make most of their money off advertising. Display advertising is quite hard to manage because there are multiple revenue streams within it. For example, if you are a publisher, you often have a sales force and you sell advertising yourself. You might sell out your home page to a big branded advertiser. That's one revenue stream.
"
4067,GOOG,"The second major one is often called nonguaranteed, which is where you are selling some of your ad space through intermediaries that are essentially ad brokers (who sell ads on short order) .
"
4068,GOOG,"Increasingly this is being done through an ad exchange, which is one of the things we do.
"
4069,GOOG,"The publisher, who is selling ad space inventory, puts it into this market to see who wants to buy it. And the buyers do that in real-time. When the consumer is browsing and pulls up a Web page, that ad space is being put into our auction.
"
4070,GOOG,"And we're sending this out to multiple bidders and receiving back bids and getting it to the highest bidder, all in a couple of hundred milliseconds. That page is being auctioned off to the highest bidder. It's a live auction, like a stock market, trading in real-time.
"
4071,GOOG,"IBD: Is this the future of selling Web display ads?
"
4072,GOOG,"Cadogan: Yes, and it's why this market is growing fast. For a seller (of online ad space), you now have a place to drive more competition for your inventory.
"
4073,GOOG,"You can put your ad space into an open market and lots of people bid on it and the highest bidder wins. It's a way to drive competition. You don't have to have a contract and collect the money from all those bidders.
"
4074,GOOG,"We take care of all that. We manage the auction and integrate with all the bidders. We have a clearinghouse where we collect the money and we pay you out. For the seller, it's appealing and there is no risk.
"
4075,GOOG,"IBD: How many such ad exchange companies are there?
"
4076,GOOG,"Cadogan: A small number; maybe less than six companies are running these true real-time ad exchanges right now.
"
4077,GOOG,"No one was doing it two years ago when we started our exchange. A small number of companies are innovating in this area.
"
4078,GOOG,"IBD: Some advertisers and ad executives perceive online display ads as ineffective.
"
4079,GOOG,"Cadogan: The ads are getting better. The ads are becoming more targeted and relevant to the consumer.
"
4080,GOOG,"The goal is to try to anticipate what someone is going to be interested in and then harvest that interest. That is helping.
"
4081,GOOG,"Two, the ads are becoming more engaging with the use of things like rich media. It's true that people don't click on display ads as much as search.
"
4082,GOOG,"What has happened, though, is that the industry has started to realize that measuring display ads by the click isn't natural. It's one measure but possibly not the best. For example, no one clicks on a TV ad. That's not the point. The point is to create an impression. That's why TV advertising, despite the dire prognostications, is doing pretty well, because it works and it does create awareness and preference, just in a different way.
"
4083,GOOG,"IBD: And who are you competing against in this space?
"
4084,GOOG,"Cadogan: In part it is Google's DoubleClick. There is a disruptive element. We are providing advertisers an alternative to using DoubleClick, which is very welcome by people wanting a strong option in the market.
"
4085,GOOG,"They don't want to put all their eggs into one basket. This industry we are now in is growing so quickly and attracting new businesses.

4086,GOOG,"SEOUL, South Korea — Police said Thursday that Google (GOOG) violated South Korean laws and referred their findings to state prosecutors, adding to a slew of privacy cases the world's largest search engine is facing.
"
4087,GOOG,"Google has been accused of collecting e-mails and other personal information from unsecured wireless networks while it took photos of neighborhoods in South Korea for its ""Street View"" mapping service between October 2009 and May 2010.

4100,GOOG,"Daniel Kelley, manager of the $1.3-billion Fidelity Trend Fund , paid a price for sticking to his guns in the first half of this year.The fund gained 9.91% vs. 10.99% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and 13.82% for the S&P 500.But since June 30, the fund was up 11.42% going into Tuesday vs. 10.61% for its direct rivals and 7.13% for the big-cap bogey.The fund's first-half lag stemmed from the market's preference then for earnings predictability, attractive dividend yields and preservation of capital, Kelley says.In contrast, Kelley focused then — and now — on stocks whose prices seemed cheap compared with their earnings power two years and more ahead.""I look for mispriced growth, which frequently arises when investors underestimate the rate or sustainability of a company's earnings growth,"" Kelley said.Despite investors' concerns about U.S. and China GDP growth, Federal Reserve tapering and rising interest rates, Kelley sees the market shifting in his direction. ""The market has renewed focused on growth prospects,"" he said.Kelley seeks three kinds of growth stocks: stable earnings growers; firms on a hot streak, with prospects for years of high sustainable growth; and opportunistic growers, which have low valuations but are near a point where a catalyst sparks a growth spurt.Targeting TrendsReflecting the fund's name, certain macro trends can provide those catalysts. Best Buy (BBY), a holding in the fund's latest disclosure, is an example of an opportunistic grower. Challenges confronting the company had knocked its share price from a high near 60 in 2006 to a low of 11.20 on Dec. 27, at the tail end of last year's holiday shopping season. But new management is benefiting from renewed consumer spending on their homes, Kelley says.Best Buy is giving more store space to appliances, among many reforms.""New management is reducing their cost structure at the same time they're getting more help from suppliers,"" Kelley said. ""Their stores-within-a-store for Microsoft (MSFT) and Samsung are helping with real estate issues.""Best Buy is up 234% this year.Another trend he's pursuing is the spread of smartphones. The investment story has shifted to software from hardware, he says. Key beneficiaries include  Google (GOOG)and Priceline (PCLN), which were listed in his latest disclosure .""It's about applications and services,"" he said. ""Facebook (FB) had looked extremely mispriced vs. its long-term earnings potential. They've been a big beneficiary of their ability to monetize their platform.""Kelley calls Tesla Motors (TSLA), whose stock is up 431% this year, a company on a hot streak. He visited the electric-car maker's California headquarters a little over a year ago. Demand for Tesla's Model S has stayed strong, he says. He likes its move to market a lower priced model, in pursuit of a wider market.""Their runway is longer than the market appreciates,"" Kelley said.Despite his focus on growth, Kelley diversifies by holding cyclical names like United Parcel Service (UPS). ""It is relatively defensive, but exposed to global GDP growth,"" he said. He likes its strong balance sheet, savvy capital allocation and buybacks.

4102,GOOG,"Internet radio company Pandora Media  (P) late Thursday reported fiscal Q2 results that met Wall Street expectations, but its profit guidance fell short on higher spending.
"
4103,GOOG,"Pandora's shares were down 8% in after-hours trading, after it released results and after rising 1% in the regular session.
"
4104,GOOG,"The Oakland, Calif.-based company said it expects current-quarter earnings per share minus items of 3 cents to 6 cents, below the 8-cent consensus from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Pandora sees EPS ex items at break-even to 5 cents for the fiscal year ending in January vs. views of 5 cents.
"
4105,GOOG,"Pandora's focus in the second half of the year will be on increasing investment in new and mobile technology, company CEO Joe Kennedy told analysts on a conference call. Pandora is seeking ""top-line growth rather than profitability,"" he said. ""We believe this customer-centric focus is the right approach for long-term sustainable growth.""
"
4106,GOOG,"For the quarter ended July 31, Pandora reported EPS ex items of 4 cents, up from break-even in the year-earlier period and topping views of 2 cents.
"
4107,GOOG,"Sales climbed 55% to $157.4 million, where analysts were expecting $156.2 million.
"
4108,GOOG,"Much of the sales growth came via mobile, which has become an important driver for Pandora, says B. Riley & Co. analyst Sameet Sinha, who on Monday initiated coverage of Pandora with a buy rating.
"
4109,GOOG,"Non-GAAP mobile revenue, which includes some revenue held in reserve, jumped 92% to $116 million, even as overall listener hours slipped.
"
4110,GOOG,"The hours slipped as a result of Pandora's decision to limit mobile listening to 40 hours per user per month, Sinha told IBD. Listener hours rose 18% from the year-earlier quarter to 3.88 billion, but they declined from Q1.
"
4111,GOOG,"The drop helped Pandora hold down costs, observers say.
"
4112,GOOG,"""They pay for every song you stream and they were seeing that people would leave (the radio) on their mobile phones and just let it go,"" Sinha said, ""and they weren't able to monetize that.""
"
4113,GOOG,"Ad sales per 1,000 streamed hours jumped for both mobile and desktop users. On mobile, that rate climbed to $33.90, up 46% from the prior quarter. Desktop sales rose 23% to $59.31, Pandora says.
"
4114,GOOG,"Mobile sales growth ""clearly demonstrates the leverage in Pandora's business model,"" CEO Kennedy said on the call. ""Mobile drove the quarter.""
"
4115,GOOG,"Content costs were equal to 51% of sales in fiscal Q2, down from 64% in Q1 and down 59% from the year-earlier period. Still, the company is ending that 40-hour limit at the end of September, Pandora CFO Mike Herring told analysts on the call. Users will be able to listen for unlimited hours.
"
4116,GOOG,"BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield, in an email to investors, on Thursday said he's skeptical of Pandora's long-term profit potential.
"
4117,GOOG,"Greenfield, who rates the stock a sell, wrote that near-term improvement in Pandora's finances doesn't mean that the company will overcome rising content costs and increased competition.
"
4118,GOOG,"Pandora's free-streaming radio finds itself in an ever-growing field of competitors. Google (GOOG) in May launched a paid ""All Access"" music library, which has a streaming radio product.
"
4119,GOOG,"Then Apple (AAPL) in June launched iTunes Radio, which is similar to Pandora.
"
4120,GOOG,"Those additions to the market haven't yet spooked Pandora investors. The stock's up 136.5% in 2013 as year-over-year revenue continues to rise 50%-plus each quarter.
"
4121,GOOG,"Pandora listeners who don't want to hear ads can pay for ad-free service. That subscription revenue rose 142% to $28.8 million in Q2.

4122,GOOG,"Pandora plans to switch its quarterly reporting schedule to the calendar year. It will report its usual fiscal Q3 ending in October and then report a truncated two-month quarter ending in December. The company plans to file an 8-K with the SEC on Friday detailing the change.Internet radio company Pandora Media  (P) late Thursday reported fiscal Q2 results that met Wall Street expectations, but its profit guidance fell short on higher spending.Pandora's shares were down 8% in after-hours trading, after it released results and after rising 1% in the regular session.The Oakland, Calif.-based company said it expects current-quarter earnings per share minus items of 3 cents to 6 cents, below the 8-cent consensus from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Pandora sees EPS ex items at break-even to 5 cents for the fiscal year ending in January vs. views of 5 cents.Pandora's focus in the second half of the year will be on increasing investment in new and mobile technology, company CEO Joe Kennedy told analysts on a conference call. Pandora is seeking ""top-line growth rather than profitability,"" he said. ""We believe this customer-centric focus is the right approach for long-term sustainable growth.""For the quarter ended July 31, Pandora reported EPS ex items of 4 cents, up from break-even in the year-earlier period and topping views of 2 cents.Sales climbed 55% to $157.4 million, where analysts were expecting $156.2 million.Much of the sales growth came via mobile, which has become an important driver for Pandora, says B. Riley & Co. analyst Sameet Sinha, who on Monday initiated coverage of Pandora with a buy rating.Non-GAAP mobile revenue, which includes some revenue held in reserve, jumped 92% to $116 million, even as overall listener hours slipped.The hours slipped as a result of Pandora's decision to limit mobile listening to 40 hours per user per month, Sinha told IBD. Listener hours rose 18% from the year-earlier quarter to 3.88 billion, but they declined from Q1.The drop helped Pandora hold down costs, observers say.""They pay for every song you stream and they were seeing that people would leave (the radio) on their mobile phones and just let it go,"" Sinha said, ""and they weren't able to monetize that.""Ad sales per 1,000 streamed hours jumped for both mobile and desktop users. On mobile, that rate climbed to $33.90, up 46% from the prior quarter. Desktop sales rose 23% to $59.31, Pandora says.Mobile sales growth ""clearly demonstrates the leverage in Pandora's business model,"" CEO Kennedy said on the call. ""Mobile drove the quarter.""Content costs were equal to 51% of sales in fiscal Q2, down from 64% in Q1 and down 59% from the year-earlier period. Still, the company is ending that 40-hour limit at the end of September, Pandora CFO Mike Herring told analysts on the call. Users will be able to listen for unlimited hours.BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield, in an email to investors, on Thursday said he's skeptical of Pandora's long-term profit potential.Greenfield, who rates the stock a sell, wrote that near-term improvement in Pandora's finances doesn't mean that the company will overcome rising content costs and increased competition.Pandora's free-streaming radio finds itself in an ever-growing field of competitors. Google (GOOG) in May launched a paid ""All Access"" music library, which has a streaming radio product.Then Apple (AAPL) in June launched iTunes Radio, which is similar to Pandora.Those additions to the market haven't yet spooked Pandora investors. The stock's up 136.5% in 2013 as year-over-year revenue continues to rise 50%-plus each quarter.Pandora listeners who don't want to hear ads can pay for ad-free service. That subscription revenue rose 142% to $28.8 million in Q2.Pandora plans to switch its quarterly reporting schedule to the calendar year. It will report its usual fiscal Q3 ending in October and then report a truncated two-month quarter ending in December. The company plans to file an 8-K with the SEC on Friday detailing the change.

4201,GOOG,"Want to make your firm a popular place to work? People feel the need to believe in their leaders. Here's how to earn credibility and gain their trust.• Spread the word. Communication is vital. But it's not just how often you talk to people, says Jennifer Robin, a Bradley University faculty member who is co-author of ""The Great Workplace."" Make sure your interactions are meaningful to your people. Talk beyond the numbers. Explain your thoughts about the latest results and what the firm will do about them. ""It creates more of a connection when leaders share their feelings, especially about negative news,"" Robin told IBD.• Hit home. Find out what your people want to know. Google (GOOG) uses discussion boards for employees to voice their concerns. Sheboygan, Wis.-based insurer Acuity runs a gossip line. Either way, leaders learn what employees' concerns are. The bosses can address those to provide meaningful communication, says Robin, who is also a research fellow at the Great Place to Work Institute, a consulting firm.• Set the tone. Act with integrity to garner credibility in your people's eyes. Show that your actions match your words and that you follow the company's values. ""This can't just be rhetoric,"" said Paul Fiorelli, co-director at the Cintas Institute for Business Ethics at Xavier University. ""It has to be lived. If you say something and do another, it's hard to be taken seriously.""• Be consistent. Fiorelli calls it ""ethical muscle memory."" Leaders and firms must make acting with integrity such a regular occurrence that it becomes second nature.""You have to do the right thing time and time again,"" Fiorelli said.• Show competence. You gain credibility when others know you can do the job. Express reasons behind a decision rather than just dictate. ""The more those reasons can be tied back to your company's values or mission statement, the more effective they'll be,"" Robin said.At Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts, managers are required to have worked in the job they supervise.""Then workers feel confident that the manager makes decisions in their best interest,"" Robin said.• Shift your view. Much of changing a culture means adjusting your attitude, Robin says. Make integrity and trust key parts of the way you do your job. ""You can't say, 'Now I will set out to build credibility,'"" she said. ""It has to be built in to everything you do.""• Make it a priority. Take regular steps that will help you earn credibility, Fiorelli says. Be transparent and open with communications. Follow the corporate culture consistently. Treat employees with respect. Stakeholders will then see you as a credible leader.• Start out right. When new employees are brought in, make it clear what the company's culture is and how important it is to do things the right way, Fiorelli says.""That lets people know, 'This is how we do things,'"" he said.• Be accessible. Aim to build two-way communication. Listen to your people, Robin says. And when you ask for ideas, give them parameters, such as budget limits.""People get paralyzed when they have no boundaries,"" she said.• Live it. The leader has to serve as the role model for solid behavior, Robin says. If you want to improve communication, set an open-door policy. And take extra steps. Go out to employees' desks to talk. That shows them you really mean what you say.

4202,GOOG,"Keeping a close eye on technology has a new meaning as more companies use eye-tracking technology.
"
4203,GOOG,"Eye tracking can increase convenience, performance and safety for consumers. It also, however, raises privacy questions. When a sensor is tracking and recording what a person is looking at, who is using that data, and for what?
"
4204,GOOG,"The technology, basically, uses a camera and lighting source (usually infrared) to gather data about where the eye is gazing and how it is rotating. This is used to analyze the way a user looks at an interface, such as a computer screen, and make it possible for people to navigate the interface with their eyes.
"
4205,GOOG,"People should know beforehand when eye-tracking technology is being used, and they should have the ability to opt out, says John Villanos, a professor of electrical engineering and public policy at UCLA.
"
4206,GOOG,"""If you're being watched by your electronic devices without specific consent, that raises real privacy concerns,"" Villanos said.
"
4207,GOOG,"He says adoption of some sort of service agreement is a key to using eye-tracking data responsibly.
"
4208,GOOG,"""So far, I have not seen any examples of this (eye-tracking) data being inappropriately collected and used,"" he said. ""But I also haven't yet seen any service agreements specifically mentioning eye tracking,"" though he expects to start seeing them.
"
4209,GOOG,"Eye tracking is being used in a variety of products on the market or in testing stages. For example:
"
4210,GOOG," South Korea's Samsung's Galaxy 4 smartphone features eye-tracking that will scroll a page of information as a person is reading, pause a video when a person looks away, or change a screen to landscape mode when the person is lying down to read.
"
4211,GOOG," Sweden's Tobii Technology, which has been developing eye-tracking technologies for over a decade, is incorporating its Tobii Gaze interface in a prototype of a new Ultrabook laptop PC, in partnership with touchpad and user interface tech firm Synaptics (SYNA). Users will be able to select apps and emails, surf the Web and perform other tasks hands-free, with eye gaze used to point and direct.
"
4212,GOOG,"A Tobii spokeswoman said developers will ultimately determine what functionality options (using eyes, touch, voice and gesture) will be programmed into their products to create the best user experience. The key to eye-tracking integration for mainstream computer users, says Tobii, is the intuitive nature of the experience, when eyes choose and fingers select.
"
4213,GOOG," Palo Alto, Calif.-based Mindflash, which develops training software, is beta testing an eye-tracking feature called FocusAssist, for use with Apple (AAPL) iPads, and later in other tablets. Different types of organizations use Mindflash to train employees on many aspects of their work. If a trainee, though, gets distracted during a session — say he or she opens an email or clicks on a cat YouTube video — the program stops until the trainee is ready to resume. It also collects data on what parts of the training program are engaging people, and what parts aren't.
"
4214,GOOG,"Simulate A Classroom
"
4215,GOOG,"Randhir Vieira, vice president of product and marketing at privately held Mindflash, says FocusAssist was added to help simulate qualities of a live classroom.
"
4216,GOOG,"""In a live classroom, if you have a trainee who is falling asleep, a trainer would probably pause and try to get the person back into the program,"" Vieira said. ""It's our goal to bring that kind of responsive training into an on-demand environment.""
"
4217,GOOG,"But if trainees are wary of being watched this way, they can note that Mindflash doesn't report anyone for slacking off. It collects aggregate data only on what worked and what didn't, rather than data on individual trainees.
"
4218,GOOG,"""We provide feedback on the training,"" Vieira said. ""We might say that 'this course was more engaging than that course,' or 'this section was more engaging than that one' or 'here's where people were confused.'""
"
4219,GOOG,"Besides just eye movements, FocusAssist will one day track facial expressions and other indications of how people feel about a course, Vieira said.
"
4220,GOOG,"But do people want their tablet telling the world how happy, sad or confused they are?
"
4221,GOOG,"""There's definitely a feeling with any of this technology — is this Big Brotherish?"" Vieira said. ""From our perspective, as long as we make it clear to the trainee what is happening, and why, and what is being shared and what's not, we're fine with it.""
"
4222,GOOG,"He says the software aims to help trainers improve their courses and improve engagement in a world becoming ever more distracting.
"
4223,GOOG,"""We're trying to deliver training that is critical to job performance, which may involve issues of safety or even life and death,"" he said, using airlines and health care organizations as examples. ""We want to make sure people are very focused, and are getting the information they need.""
"
4224,GOOG,"Eye tracking hit another touchstone last month when Google (GOOG) got patent approval for its pay-per-gaze tracking technology. The patent describes the feature on a head-mounted device, which fits the description of Google Glass, the wearable, eye-glasses-like computer the Internet giant is developing. The company could use pay-per-gaze to charge advertisers based on whether and how long a person actually is looking at an ad, online or in the real world.
"
4225,GOOG,"Google, through a spokesman, told IBD it has no plans to use this patent in the foreseeable future.
"
4226,GOOG,"""We hold patents on a variety of ideas,"" the spokesman said via email. ""Some ideas mature into real products or services; some don't. Prospective product announcements should not necessarily be inferred from our patents.""
"
4227,GOOG,"Tobii provides eye-scanning services and software for a variety of applications, from assisting people with disabilities to improving driving safety. It also uses eye scanning to help companies determine what aspects of their marketing — websites, packaging and more — are most effective.
"
4228,GOOG,"The company sells or rents its Tobii Glasses for mobile eye-tracking research. Marketers can send a person wearing the glasses into a grocery store and track what ads and packaging catch the person's eye, learning what really grabs a shopper's attention.
"
4229,GOOG,"Carl Korobkin, Tobii's vice president of OEM solutions, says academics, marketers and manufacturers will soon be using eye-scanning technology across a wide range of applications and products.
"
4230,GOOG,"""Eye tracking is a game-changer because it provides a whole new level of interactivity,"" he says. ""It helps us understand what people are looking at, in order to make better products.""
"
4231,GOOG,"In terms of the privacy issues, he says eye tracking will follow the same path as other technologies.
"
4232,GOOG,"""For instance, there's the GPS technology in smartphones,"" he pointed out. ""People realize that they're getting an amazing benefit from the technology, and it's becoming ubiquitous. But people are allowed to opt in or opt out.""
"
4233,GOOG,"He says developers will consider privacy issues with eye scanning in the same way they did with GPS.

"
4245,GOOG,"Love those protective moats.
"
4246,GOOG,"Columbia Marsico Focused Equities Fund aims for quality growth companies whose use of technology creates a protective moat around them.
"
4247,GOOG,"That investment approach is paying off this year for the $1.2 billion fund. Columbia Marsico Focused Equities is having its best year since 2009. The fund, which is the sister portfolio of no-load Marsico Focus , was up 28.04% this year through Oct. 31.
"
4248,GOOG,"That topped 77% of the fund's large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
4249,GOOG,"That's also far better than the fund's five-year average annual gain of 14.43%, which topped just 29% of its rivals.
"
4250,GOOG,"Thomas Marsico, 58, and 42-year-old co-manager Coralie Witter talked with IBD from their offices in Denver. They were joined by analysts Dr. Matt Norkunas, John Machock, Kevin Boone and James Marsico, Tom's son.
"
4251,GOOG,"IBD: You like technology's impact more than you like tech companies, right?
"
4252,GOOG,"Marsico: The theme of the portfolio and the theme we look for in growth markets is innovation and technology.
"
4253,GOOG,"But we usually are not direct investors in technology because they have short product cycles.
"
4254,GOOG,"And pricing around those products goes down in line with Moore's Law (which says that microchip performance generally doubles about every two years) or sometimes much deeper.
"
4255,GOOG,"So you have to sell more and more of the product just to stay even. Instead, we like companies that use innovative technology to create moats around their businesses.
"
4256,GOOG,"IBD: You've also said you look for companies with a catalyst. How does that work?
"
4257,GOOG,"Marsico: Generally, we are looking for strong companies. Their catalyst might be superior execution of a business plan.
"
4258,GOOG,"Take the retail concept area. We've owned TJX Cos. (TJX) for a long time. They built a moat by providing quality goods at lower prices. That's a moat because they have 30,000 points of touch with various suppliers, to find the best branded products at low prices. That's a difficult model to build. And they're expanding into Europe.
"
4259,GOOG,"IBD: How often do you look for turnaround situations sparked by a catalyst?
"
4260,GOOG,"Marsico: Sometimes, as far as change is concerned, we look for a life-cycle-change company. We have two financial stocks like that: Citigroup (C) and AIG (AIG).
"
4261,GOOG,"Both came through the financial crisis with a lot of restructuring that needed to be done. Both were trading at large discounts to book value.
"
4262,GOOG,"But the brands they established over decades were still intact, and the book value of assets held on their balance sheets was greater than what was reflected on their stock prices. With better management teams, they have turned around. The catalysts were positive changes in management, resetting their cost structures, and re-establishment of the financial markets after the turmoil of the crisis in 2008.
"
4263,GOOG,"But the main focus of the portfolio is imbedded in unit growth companies. Mostly as a result of the application of technology to various markets.
"
4264,GOOG,"IBD: Why is the fund doing better this year?
"
4265,GOOG,"Witter: With less volatility around policy risk, we're in an environment where stock picking is now being rewarded again. That had not been true for years. And that lends itself to active management, such as we do.
"
4266,GOOG,"Combined with low inflation, that favors the quality growth names where we do the bulk of our research.
"
4267,GOOG,"IBD: Tom, how do you and Coralie divide duties? Do you follow stocks in different sectors? Or do you backstop each other?
"
4268,GOOG,"Marsico: Our work is collaborative. We communicate multiple times a day. We don't follow different sectors. We come to agreement on names. We have dialogue and debate to increase our overall confidence and conviction in names we buy. That makes for a healthy process.
"
4269,GOOG,"IBD: You recently opened a stake in Facebook (FB), whose earnings per share growth jumped to 108% in the most recent quarter from 0% two quarters prior. What's its driver?
"
4270,GOOG,"James Marsico: We try to find companies that are aggressively going after specific trends in the technology space. And consumption of content, which is moving from desktop to mobile devices, is where we seek to target certain opportunities.
"
4271,GOOG,"One thing that's unique about Facebook is that mobile revenue growth has accelerated meaningfully as people move from desktop to mobile consumption.
"
4272,GOOG,"When the company went public (May 18, 2012), they had zero realized revenue from those mobile-device users. Now, in the most recent quarter, mobile revenue accounted for 41% of their total revenue base. So the company has solved a problem in 12 to 18 months and started capturing and unlocking value in their user base accessing the platform from a mobile device.
"
4273,GOOG,"IBD: Which of its acquisitions do you like?
"
4274,GOOG,"James Marsico: Facebook made a $1 billion investment in Instagram about a year ago. Recently some people saw that as a signal that user engagement was slowing on Facebook. Now it looks as if Instagram is taking disproportionate share away from other online websites and platforms. And the current valuation of about $10 billion on the Instagram platform shows significant return on investment, giving us confidence in the company's ability to understand the marketplace and recognize trends and where viewers are going.
"
4275,GOOG,"IBD: Facebook and Google's (GOOG) efforts are aimed at boosting advertising revenue.
"
4276,GOOG,"Witter: To tie those two ideas into themes that we're highlighting today, those two companies are competing in a large global market that is growing. They are taking share through the shift to online advertising, where consumer behavior is shifting. Both companies benefit from a network effect that their business models enjoy. They've created products that increase in value the more that people use it. That is the moat around their businesses. The opportunity set around both companies is tremendous.
"
4277,GOOG,"Google has less than 10% of the global advertising market and is growing at a 20% compound annual rate. Facebook, which is younger and smaller, is growing around a 50% pace this year. They are share gainers using investments they made to stay ahead of the competition and gain share in growing markets.
"
4278,GOOG,"IBD: Have you increased your stake in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR) because of its new products?
"
4279,GOOG,"Marsico: They're one of our smallest positions. Their new CEO came from Coke. He has a good understanding of how to manage a global beverage product.
"
4280,GOOG,"Green Mountain has 90% of the K-Cup market. But the current debate around this company is whether private label competitors that make coffee will gather more share. And there's interest in the short community, highlighted by David Einhorn's position at Greenlight Capital.
"
4281,GOOG,"But we believe Green Mountain's new management is executing well. They're finding new customers for their K-Cups, they have a relationship with Starbucks (SBUX), and we don't think (Starbucks' Chairman, President and CEO) Howard Schultz would have a relationship if he didn't think they had the best product. Starbucks tried to develop their own K-Cup, but then deferred to Green Mountain, which will have a new product next year (soup in partnership with Campbell's Soup). They've also done a good job of getting into stores similar to but smaller than Starbucks'.
"
4282,GOOG,"IBD: What about their upcoming new brewing machines for specialty coffees?
"
4283,GOOG,"Witter: What got us into the stock is the big picture. Single-serve is taking share from ground coffee. And 2014 should see acceleration in that trend when the company comes out with a new brewer and demonstrates the benefits of their manufacturing efficiencies.
"
4284,GOOG,"IBD: Speaking of Starbucks, what's the thesis there?
"
4285,GOOG,"Marsico: They have seven or eight drivers. They have a number of initiatives. Their same-store sales growth is accelerating. They are executing better within stores. Their service is getting faster. They keep coming out with new beverage innovations like pumpkin spice latte around the holidays. And they've improved their food, which increases the attachment of food to beverage items. They acquired a company called La Boulange, which takes their food quality up.
"
4286,GOOG,"On top of that, these guys are the poster boys of using Facebook and other digital media to drive more business into their stores. That's looped in with a Starbucks loyalty card. It started as a physical card, now it's an app.
"
4287,GOOG,"The third leg of their growth is in the consumer packaged goods area. They're getting close to the point where anything sold in the store belongs to Starbucks. And they can use their thousands of stores as a launch platform for new products.
"
4288,GOOG,"IBD: You've trimmed your Biogen Idec (BIIB) stake. Is that for risk management, or are you cooling on the stock?
"
4289,GOOG,"Machock: There's no change in our view. As share price increases, we trim positions.
"

Columbia Marsico Focused Equities is having its best year since 2009. The fund, which is the sister portfolio of no-load Marsico Focus , was up 28.04% this year through Oct. 31.That topped 77% of the fund's large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc.That's also far better than the fund's five-year average annual gain of 14.43%, which topped just 29% of its rivals.Thomas Marsico, 58, and 42-year-old co-manager Coralie Witter talked with IBD from their offices in Denver. They were joined by analysts Dr. Matt Norkunas, John Machock, Kevin Boone and James Marsico, Tom's son.IBD: You like technology's impact more than you like tech companies, right?Marsico: The theme of the portfolio and the theme we look for in growth markets is innovation and technology.But we usually are not direct investors in technology because they have short product cycles.And pricing around those products goes down in line with Moore's Law (which says that microchip performance generally doubles about every two years) or sometimes much deeper.So you have to sell more and more of the product just to stay even. Instead, we like companies that use innovative technology to create moats around their businesses.IBD: You've also said you look for companies with a catalyst. How does that work?Marsico: Generally, we are looking for strong companies. Their catalyst might be superior execution of a business plan.Take the retail concept area. We've owned TJX Cos. (TJX) for a long time. They built a moat by providing quality goods at lower prices. That's a moat because they have 30,000 points of touch with various suppliers, to find the best branded products at low prices. That's a difficult model to build. And they're expanding into Europe.IBD: How often do you look for turnaround situations sparked by a catalyst?Marsico: Sometimes, as far as change is concerned, we look for a life-cycle-change company. We have two financial stocks like that: Citigroup (C) and AIG (AIG).Both came through the financial crisis with a lot of restructuring that needed to be done. Both were trading at large discounts to book value.But the brands they established over decades were still intact, and the book value of assets held on their balance sheets was greater than what was reflected on their stock prices. With better management teams, they have turned around. The catalysts were positive changes in management, resetting their cost structures, and re-establishment of the financial markets after the turmoil of the crisis in 2008.But the main focus of the portfolio is imbedded in unit growth companies. Mostly as a result of the application of technology to various markets.IBD: Why is the fund doing better this year?Witter: With less volatility around policy risk, we're in an environment where stock picking is now being rewarded again. That had not been true for years. And that lends itself to active management, such as we do.Combined with low inflation, that favors the quality growth names where we do the bulk of our research.IBD: Tom, how do you and Coralie divide duties? Do you follow stocks in different sectors? Or do you backstop each other?Marsico: Our work is collaborative. We communicate multiple times a day. We don't follow different sectors. We come to agreement on names. We have dialogue and debate to increase our overall confidence and conviction in names we buy. That makes for a healthy process.IBD: You recently opened a stake in Facebook (FB), whose earnings per share growth jumped to 108% in the most recent quarter from 0% two quarters prior. What's its driver?James Marsico: We try to find companies that are aggressively going after specific trends in the technology space. And consumption of content, which is moving from desktop to mobile devices, is where we seek to target certain opportunities.One thing that's unique about Facebook is that mobile revenue growth has accelerated meaningfully as people move from desktop to mobile consumption.When the company went public (May 18, 2012), they had zero realized revenue from those mobile-device users. Now, in the most recent quarter, mobile revenue accounted for 41% of their total revenue base. So the company has solved a problem in 12 to 18 months and started capturing and unlocking value in their user base accessing the platform from a mobile device.IBD: Which of its acquisitions do you like?James Marsico: Facebook made a $1 billion investment in Instagram about a year ago. Recently some people saw that as a signal that user engagement was slowing on Facebook. Now it looks as if Instagram is taking disproportionate share away from other online websites and platforms. And the current valuation of about $10 billion on the Instagram platform shows significant return on investment, giving us confidence in the company's ability to understand the marketplace and recognize trends and where viewers are going.IBD: Facebook and Google's (GOOG) efforts are aimed at boosting advertising revenue.Witter: To tie those two ideas into themes that we're highlighting today, those two companies are competing in a large global market that is growing. They are taking share through the shift to online advertising, where consumer behavior is shifting. Both companies benefit from a network effect that their business models enjoy. They've created products that increase in value the more that people use it. That is the moat around their businesses. The opportunity set around both companies is tremendous.Google has less than 10% of the global advertising market and is growing at a 20% compound annual rate. Facebook, which is younger and smaller, is growing around a 50% pace this year. They are share gainers using investments they made to stay ahead of the competition and gain share in growing markets.IBD: Have you increased your stake in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR) because of its new products?Marsico: They're one of our smallest positions. Their new CEO came from Coke. He has a good understanding of how to manage a global beverage product.Green Mountain has 90% of the K-Cup market. But the current debate around this company is whether private label competitors that make coffee will gather more share. And there's interest in the short community, highlighted by David Einhorn's position at Greenlight Capital.But we believe Green Mountain's new management is executing well. They're finding new customers for their K-Cups, they have a relationship with Starbucks (SBUX), and we don't think (Starbucks' Chairman, President and CEO) Howard Schultz would have a relationship if he didn't think they had the best product. Starbucks tried to develop their own K-Cup, but then deferred to Green Mountain, which will have a new product next year (soup in partnership with Campbell's Soup). They've also done a good job of getting into stores similar to but smaller than Starbucks'.IBD: What about their upcoming new brewing machines for specialty coffees?Witter: What got us into the stock is the big picture. Single-serve is taking share from ground coffee. And 2014 should see acceleration in that trend when the company comes out with a new brewer and demonstrates the benefits of their manufacturing efficiencies.IBD: Speaking of Starbucks, what's the thesis there?Marsico: They have seven or eight drivers. They have a number of initiatives. Their same-store sales growth is accelerating. They are executing better within stores. Their service is getting faster. They keep coming out with new beverage innovations like pumpkin spice latte around the holidays. And they've improved their food, which increases the attachment of food to beverage items. They acquired a company called La Boulange, which takes their food quality up.On top of that, these guys are the poster boys of using Facebook and other digital media to drive more business into their stores. That's looped in with a Starbucks loyalty card. It started as a physical card, now it's an app.The third leg of their growth is in the consumer packaged goods area. They're getting close to the point where anything sold in the store belongs to Starbucks. And they can use their thousands of stores as a launch platform for new products.IBD: You've trimmed your Biogen Idec (BIIB) stake. Is that for risk management, or are you cooling on the stock?Machock: There's no change in our view. As share price increases, we trim positions.They've come up with a new (treatment) molecule for multiple sclerosis. Other (treatments) didn't cure the disease. They just slowed its progression.

4306,GOOG,"There are two keys to Frank Caruso's investment strategy.
"
4307,GOOG,"First, the lead manager of $2 billion AllianceBernstein Large Cap Growth directs his team to seek what he calls dynamic gaps.
"
4308,GOOG,"Those gaps are big differences between how fast Caruso's team expects a stock's earnings to grow and Wall Street's consensus expectation.
"
4309,GOOG,"The second key is where Caruso has his team look for that gap: four to five years out.
"
4310,GOOG,"Caruso is adamant about avoiding a focus on the near term.
"
4311,GOOG,"This approach had the fund up 32.46% this year through Nov. 30. That topped 78% of its large-cap growth peers, which averaged 29.96%. The S&P 500 was up 29.12%.
"
4312,GOOG,"Over the past three years the fund's average annual gain is 18.14% vs. 15.70% for its peer group and 17.73% for the big-cap bogey.
"
4313,GOOG,"Caruso, age 57, discussed his investment process with IBD from his office in Manhattan.
"
4314,GOOG,"IBD: How does your search for leading stocks differ from other growth investors'?
"
4315,GOOG,"Caruso: We think of equities generally (in terms of) a combination of growth and capital returns in the form of dividends and share buybacks, which support the valuations of equities over a long period.
"
4316,GOOG,"And we take a long-duration approach to investment opportunities. But most growth investors are dangerously focused on the moment, growth in the short term. We try to exploit this phenomenon where not a lot of analytical work is being done four to five years out.
"
4317,GOOG,"IBD: Give me some examples that show how your tack works, please.
"
4318,GOOG,"Caruso: In the spring of 2012, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) missed a couple of months of sales estimates and the stock was crushed. It went from about 440 to 230 a share. But our research let us be marginal buyers in that lurch. We were confident in the caliber of management. We bought a distressed stock in a great long-term franchise (between May and July 2012 between 380 and 400). Later, they began to execute and sales improved. (We added to our position) through the beginning of October 2012 at prices between 284 and 330.
"
4319,GOOG,"IBD: Is Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) another example? You added a big chunk to your stake a few quarters ago.
"
4320,GOOG,"Caruso: They have a great core competency in technologies that are increasingly desired by clients: in the cloud and in mobility. It's been growing in the high teens and low 20s for years. It has no debt, and it has excess cash.
"
4321,GOOG,"After putting up a strong quarter, they got caught up in the immigration debate. They rely on a lot of foreign visas to conduct their business. The stock went down about 25% in a heartbeat.
"
4322,GOOG,"That was an opportunity for us to reload. In the spring of 2012 we started initiating. The stock broke down into the high 50s (from 78). We met with Cognizant managers for three or four hours, and we left convinced they still had a great business and plan. The stock moved higher. The immigration debate percolated, and we bought in the 60s. Now it's in the 90s.
"
4323,GOOG,"IBD: Are you looking for investment opportunities created by the prospect of the Federal Reserve tapering its bond buys?
"
4324,GOOG,"Caruso: We don't try to overthink the macro environment. So our marching orders to our analysts are to focus on company fundamentals.
"
4325,GOOG,"But when (Fed Chairman Ben) Bernanke started the tapering discussion, after having underperformed the broad market and value in particular the prior 12 to 15 months, growth securities started to do well. So the market response to tapering seems to have catalyzed a shift on the margin to growth stocks.
"
4326,GOOG,"IBD: Is that because growth stocks tend to have more foreign exposure?
"
4327,GOOG,"Caruso: Yes, growth stocks generally have a little more exposure to foreign earnings growth. And U.S. value stocks have more exposure to, let's say, earnings that are fueled by Federal Reserve stimulus steps. This is speculation on my part, but the discussion regarding tapering might auger well for future growth stock performance.
"
4328,GOOG,"IBD: Computer services, software and systems are your largest category of holdings at 12.36% of assets. Why do you expect good things from them?
"
4329,GOOG,"Caruso: Cognizant is one, with close to a 4% weighting. The portfolio is built around companies like that and Google (GOOG). We think of Priceline (PCLN) as a service company. Some people think of it as a technology company.
"
4330,GOOG,"Ansys (ANSS) is an engineering simulation software company. People think of this as a company that benefits from innovation.
"
4331,GOOG,"In the old days, you had a team of engineers design a new product, build mockups, then software would run calculations that tested stress characteristics. It was on the tail end of the innovation. And it might take weeks to run those simulations.
"
4332,GOOG,"Today you can run millions of simulations before you even get to the real engineering side of things.
"
4333,GOOG,"IBD: Biotech is your second-largest industry group, with 5.45% of assets. Why are you focused there?
"
4334,GOOG,"Caruso: Biotech came out of a very long, severe stock price underperformance. Now we're seeing far greater pipeline productivity emerging from a couple of leaders. We've centered our investments on Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead (GILD). Each is in a different area of disease management.
"
4335,GOOG,"Biogen has been mostly a multiple sclerosis story. They've come to market with a new oral medicine called Tecfidera, which has experienced one of the most unbelievably successful product launches in pharmacology history. But (investors) have been so focused on MS that they haven't paid attention to some of the products that are in development.
"
4336,GOOG,"There is a hemophilia product (Eloctate) that we expect to launch in mid-next year. It has the opportunity to take share from Baxter (BAX) and drive growth. And there's upside left for Tecfidera for a long time to come.
"
4337,GOOG,"Gilead is basically an HIV and hepatitis C story. It has new product launches on the horizon. We expect Gilead to remain dominant in HIV in the near- to midterm. Their hepatitis C portfolio is starting to contribute meaningfully to corporate growth.
"
4338,GOOG,"Celgene is a multiple myeloma story, a cancer story. We see expanding use of the marketplace.
"
4339,GOOG,"All of these companies were coming off of pretty conservative valuations for the kind of growth we envision them experiencing for the next couple of years.
"
4340,GOOG,"IBD: Why did you trim your Facebook (FB) stake recently? You could not have foreseen the pullback that began in mid-October.
"
4341,GOOG,"Caruso: The stock had an amazing run after reporting Q2 earnings. They demonstrated great acceleration in their mobility business, which people got excited about. The stock doubled in a short time.
"
4342,GOOG,"We made a meaningful reduction in exposure in that euphoria. It had become close to 3% of the portfolio. So we cut our position roughly in half. It is roughly 1.5% today.
"
4343,GOOG,"Their 20% fall? The stock had gone up the day they reported earnings. Then management talked about the need to spend more on investing in people and their product. A lot of highly valued, high-growth companies have seen similar price corrections.
"
4344,GOOG,"I'm comfortable owning the stock. At the right price, we're getting back in.
"
4345,GOOG,"IBD: Michael Kors (KORS) is relatively new for you. Are you concerned that earnings-per-share growth has sharply decelerated in recent quarters?
"
4346,GOOG,"Caruso: We're always concerned about decelerating growth rates. But Kors' decline is to a less-than-extraordinary level. That's still better than a lot of companies. The stock is reasonably valued for the kind of growth we envision. They have opportunities in Europe and elsewhere overseas. Kors is seen as differentiated here and overseas.
"
4347,GOOG,"IBD: Any surprise to Starbucks' (SBUX) accelerating EPS growth?
"
4348,GOOG,"Caruso: No. They're just an unbelievable company. They're one of the few that has been able to consistently reinvent themselves. They've done a brilliant job of expanding their product offerings in small footprint stores, in being first to market in using new technologies to connect to their customers and their rewards programs are best in their class.
"
4349,GOOG,"IBD: Precision Castparts (PCP) is up this year, but you've done some trimming. What are your concerns?
"
4350,GOOG,"Caruso: They are persistent in acquiring businesses that let them leverage their own infrastructure. And they're an important supplier to Boeing (BA) on the 787. They generate about $10 million of content on every 787 that Boeing ships. Part of our reduction is that we own both companies. If we sell, it probably will be out of Boeing. Precision has lagged Boeing, so Precision has more upside.
"
4351,GOOG,"IBD: Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is way down this year. Yet you've added to your position in some recent quarters. Are you still optimistic?
"
4352,GOOG,"Caruso: This has been the most disappointing stock in the portfolio in 2013. The interest we had was centered on the uniqueness of their business. There are no competitors at their scale. Robotic surgery is here to stay and will continue to grow.
"
4353,GOOG,"Procedure growth continues to expand at a midteen clip year over year. The issue with execution relates to installation sales, which has slowed, especially in the U.S.
"
4354,GOOG,"We expect a couple more tough quarters. Procedure growth will continue in the 16% area. There's no competition. Unbelievably high margins, big share buyback, no debt. Hopefully, it will be a contrary growth stock that recovers.
"
4355,GOOG,"IBD: Are you concerned that LinkedIn's (LNKD) EPS growth has slowed for two quarters?
"
4356,GOOG,"Caruso: They've brought a new (advertising product for mobile devices) to market. It will help their growth rate re-accelerate into next year. Like we did with Facebook, we made decent sales in the summer on the market euphoria around this stock. We're more interested in finding a price to re-engage LinkedIn than Facebook.
"
4357,GOOG,"We think of it as a core holding, a business that's tough to replicate due to their network effect and LinkedIn managers who think of this as a business and want it to be profitable. It's a good business that is richly valued. It will grow into that. So getting the entry and trim points right is important.
"
4358,GOOG,"IBD: Noble Energy's (NBL) EPS growth has soared the past two quarters. But tumbling crude oil prices have doused energy producer stocks' spark lately. This stock has pulled back about 10% since Oct. 30. Why stick with it?
"
4359,GOOG,"Caruso: Noble is one of the best-positioned energy companies by way of its fracking inventory. Overseas — in Israel and Africa — they have unbelievable reserves. And they are really good operators, really focused on creating value.
"
4360,GOOG,"Energy firms are more volatile than what we typically engage, but this company's assets are special.
"
4361,GOOG,"We've seen a reduction in underlying commodity prices, so we would welcome an opportunity to buy some of this back, make it larger in the portfolio. It's not quite at a point where we would start buying it back.
"
4362,GOOG,"IBD: What's the biggest change you've made since taking this fund's helm in February 2012?
"
4363,GOOG,"Caruso: Basically, our perception of growth is linked to a company's ability to create long-term value. So our focus is further forward than many other investors' focus is. It's more on the economics of business and profitability than on the hunt for earnings growth, which is sometimes very episodic. We're still looking for opportunities in large-cap growth. But we're focused on the longer term.
"
4364,GOOG,"IBD: What was the fund's prior time horizon?
"
4365,GOOG,"Caruso: I can't say, but it was probably more consistent with most growth managers'. Annual turnover in growth portfolios is often 100% to 150%. We're trying to do closer to 50%. We want great franchises that have the ability to win over a very long time. I tell my analysts I want them to understand how companies are competitively differentiated. I don't want them spending their time trying to anticipate when a bad business is a good stock.There are two keys to Frank Caruso's investment strategy.First, the lead manager of $2 billion AllianceBernstein Large Cap Growth directs his team to seek what he calls dynamic gaps.Those gaps are big differences between how fast Caruso's team expects a stock's earnings to grow and Wall Street's consensus expectation.The second key is where Caruso has his team look for that gap: four to five years out.Caruso is adamant about avoiding a focus on the near term.This approach had the fund up 32.46% this year through Nov. 30.

We think of Priceline (PCLN) as a service company. Some people think of it as a technology company.Ansys (ANSS) is an engineering simulation software company. People think of this as a company that benefits from innovation.In the old days, you had a team of engineers design a new product, build mockups, then software would run calculations that tested stress characteristics. It was on the tail end of the innovation. And it might take weeks to run those simulations.Today you can run millions of simulations before you even get to the real engineering side of things.IBD: Biotech is your second-largest industry group, with 5.45% of assets. Why are you focused there?Caruso: Biotech came out of a very long, severe stock price underperformance. Now we're seeing far greater pipeline productivity emerging from a couple of leaders. We've centered our investments on Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead (GILD). Each is in a different area of disease management.Biogen has been mostly a multiple sclerosis story. They've come to market with a new oral medicine called Tecfidera, which has experienced one of the most unbelievably successful product launches in pharmacology history. But (investors) have been so focused on MS that they haven't paid attention to some of the products that are in development.There is a hemophilia product (Eloctate) that we expect to launch in mid-next year. It has the opportunity to take share from Baxter (BAX) and drive growth. And there's upside left for Tecfidera for a long time to come.Gilead is basically an HIV and hepatitis C story. It has new product launches on the horizon. We expect Gilead to remain dominant in HIV in the near- to midterm. Their hepatitis C portfolio is starting to contribute meaningfully to corporate growth.Celgene is a multiple myeloma story, a cancer story. We see expanding use of the marketplace.All of these companies were coming off of pretty conservative valuations for the kind of growth we envision them experiencing for the next couple of years.IBD: Why did you trim your Facebook (FB) stake recently? You could not have foreseen the pullback that began in mid-October.Caruso: The stock had an amazing run after reporting Q2 earnings. They demonstrated great acceleration in their mobility business, which people got excited about. The stock doubled in a short time.We made a meaningful reduction in exposure in that euphoria. It had become close to 3% of the portfolio. So we cut our position roughly in half. It is roughly 1.5% today.Their 20% fall? The stock had gone up the day they reported earnings. Then management talked about the need to spend more on investing in people and their product. A lot of highly valued, high-growth companies have seen similar price corrections.I'm comfortable owning the stock. At the right price, we're getting back in.IBD: Michael Kors (KORS) is relatively new for you. Are you concerned that earnings-per-share growth has sharply decelerated in recent quarters?Caruso: We're always concerned about decelerating growth rates. But Kors' decline is to a less-than-extraordinary level. That's still better than a lot of companies. The stock is reasonably valued for the kind of growth we envision. They have opportunities in Europe and elsewhere overseas. Kors is seen as differentiated here and overseas.IBD: Any surprise to Starbucks' (SBUX) accelerating EPS growth?Caruso: No. They're just an unbelievable company. They're one of the few that has been able to consistently reinvent themselves. They've done a brilliant job of expanding their product offerings in small footprint stores, in being first to market in using new technologies to connect to their customers and their rewards programs are best in their class.IBD: Precision Castparts (PCP) is up this year, but you've done some trimming. What are your concerns?Caruso: They are persistent in acquiring businesses that let them leverage their own infrastructure. And they're an important supplier to Boeing (BA) on the 787. They generate about $10 million of content on every 787 that Boeing ships. Part of our reduction is that we own both companies. If we sell, it probably will be out of Boeing. Precision has lagged Boeing, so Precision has more upside.IBD: Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is way down this year. Yet you've added to your position in some recent quarters. Are you still optimistic?Caruso: This has been the most disappointing stock in the portfolio in 2013. The interest we had was centered on the uniqueness of their business. There are no competitors at their scale. Robotic surgery is here to stay and will continue to grow.Procedure growth continues to expand at a midteen clip year over year. The issue with execution relates to installation sales, which has slowed, especially in the U.S.We expect a couple more tough quarters. Procedure growth will continue in the 16% area. There's no competition. Unbelievably high margins, big share buyback, no debt. Hopefully, it will be a contrary growth stock that recovers.IBD: Are you concerned that LinkedIn's (LNKD) EPS growth has slowed for two quarters?Caruso: They've brought a new (advertising product for mobile devices) to market. It will help their growth rate re-accelerate into next year. Like we did with Facebook, we made decent sales in the summer on the market euphoria around this stock. We're more interested in finding a price to re-engage LinkedIn than Facebook.We think of it as a core holding, a business that's tough to replicate due to their network effect and LinkedIn managers who think of this as a business and want it to be profitable. It's a good business that is richly valued. It will grow into that. So getting the entry and trim points right is important.IBD: Noble Energy's (NBL) EPS growth has soared the past two quarters. But tumbling crude oil prices have doused energy producer stocks' spark lately. This stock has pulled back about 10% since Oct. 30. Why stick with it?Caruso: Noble is one of the best-positioned energy companies by way of its fracking inventory. Overseas — in Israel and Africa — they have unbelievable reserves. And they are really good operators, really focused on creating value.Energy firms are more volatile than what we typically engage, but this company's assets are special.We've seen a reduction in underlying commodity prices, so we would welcome an opportunity to buy some of this back, make it larger in the portfolio. It's not quite at a point where we would start buying it back.IBD: What's the biggest change you've made since taking this fund's helm in February 2012?Caruso: Basically, our perception of growth is linked to a company's ability to create long-term value. So our focus is further forward than many other investors' focus is. It's more on the economics of business and profitability than on the hunt for earnings growth, which is sometimes very episodic. We're still looking for opportunities in large-cap growth. But we're focused on the longer term.IBD: What was the fund's prior time horizon?Caruso: I can't say, but it was probably more consistent with most growth managers'. Annual turnover in growth portfolios is often 100% to 150%. We're trying to do closer to 50%. We want great franchises that have the ability to win over a very long time. I tell my analysts I want them to understand how companies are competitively differentiated. I don't want them spending their time trying to anticipate when a bad business is a good stock.

4469,GOOG,"Mobile is hot. And LinkedIn, which just boosted a new stock offering above $1 billion, is well-positioned to jump on the bandwagon of mobile marketing, and into other promising areas.
"
4470,GOOG,"With 238 million registered members and new ones joining at a rate of more than two per second, the professional networking site has been expanding ways to monetize its various channels. Its $1.17 billion stock offering, detailed in SEC filings, will help fund the growth.
"
4471,GOOG,"""Marketing solutions is probably the biggest topic of conversation this year,"" said Randy Reece, analyst at Avondale Partners. ""Everyone noticed how Facebook (FB) went from zero mobile advertising revenue to having it be more than 40% of its total advertising revenue within a very short period of time.
"
4472,GOOG,"""And LinkedIn (LNKD) recently introduced its first significant efforts to sell advertising in the mobile format,"" Reece said. ""So, in 2014, whatever advertising revenue comes in from mobile will be incremental to what the company did this year.""
"
4473,GOOG,"Growth And Green
"
4474,GOOG,"The social networker has several areas of growth focus — among them mobile, collegiate and international expansion. LinkedIn's stock offering, to increase the company's ""financial flexibility,"" according to the prospectus, could go not only toward organic expansion and general purposes but also for strategic acquisitions. The offering priced at $223 apiece for 5.4 million shares late Wednesday, with option for underwriters to buy about another 807,000, which would boost the offering to a total as high as $1.35 billion. It's expected to close on Tuesday Sept. 10.
"
4475,GOOG,"During the most recent quarter, LinkedIn saw its mobile activity increase. Its mobile home page engagement rose over 40%, while social actions, article views and mobile profile edits also accelerated.
"
4476,GOOG,"It is continuing to ramp up sponsored updates on the mobile platform where advertisers can place relevant content within LinkedIn's mobile news feed.
"
4477,GOOG,"LinkedIn's marketing solutions represented 24% of total revenue in the past quarter. Mobile advertising took up an even smaller share.
"
4478,GOOG,"""The company is deliberately restraining its mobile ad inventory right now while it tests different aspects of the program,"" Reece said. ""Exactly how to sell this, how to price it, how much advertising to allow without annoying members — there are a lot of things to figure out. So, LinkedIn is trying to go slowly.""
"
4479,GOOG,"That said, analysts view LinkedIn as relatively better-positioned for the accelerating shift to mobile compared with many other Internet companies.
"
4480,GOOG,"An emerging theme is how the shift to mobile devices negatively impacts near-term monetization, says Tom White, analyst at Macquarie Research, in a research report.
"
4481,GOOG,"""Generally speaking, for many online advertising and e-commerce-focused companies, mobile Internet sessions monetize at significantly lower rates than desktop Internet sessions,"" he said. ""Google (GOOG) and Facebook are two of the more well-publicized recent examples of this trend.""
"
4482,GOOG,"The ability for customers to access various services while they are away from their desks via mobile devices increases the utility and value proposition of LinkedIn's various products, notes White.
"
4483,GOOG,"Mobile, however, isn't the only monetization avenue LinkedIn is pursuing.
"
4484,GOOG,"The largest revenue generator is the talent solutions division. This is where the company sells access to its data to recruiters, staffing agencies and human resource departments. Its revenue jumped 69% to $205 million in the last quarter vs. a year ago. It represented 56% of LinkedIn's total revenue.
"
4485,GOOG,"""That's really probably the crown jewel business of LinkedIn,"" White said. ""They really disrupted the legacy staffing model and recruiting model by enabling recruiters to run very targeted, pinpoint searches for candidates and really tap into passive job candidates at a scale that was much more difficult for recruiters to do in the past.""
"
4486,GOOG,"Its flagship product is the ""LinkedIn Recruiter."" In exchange for an annual seat license of approximately $8,000, it gives recruiters access to LinkedIn's entire database of 238 million professional profiles. As a result, hiring managers are not limited to the ""three-degree"" depth of connections that comes with a standard membership. Instead, they can perform searches by job function, geographic location, industry, education and other metrics.
"
4487,GOOG,"""This is by far the largest, freshest database of professional and technical workers in the world,"" Reece said. ""Virtually all of the competition appeals almost exclusively to active job seekers; and employers who want to hire the best-of-the-best need to be able to find not only people looking for a job, but also people who are already employed and excelling. LinkedIn is the best way to find them.""

"
4492,GOOG,"""This is another really interesting development that could have fascinating upside potential,"" Reece said. ""It is a natural fit.""

4493,GOOG,"International is another area where LinkedIn has opportunity to increase the monetization of its services. The company is present in over 200 countries and is available in 19 languages. Its major markets are the U.K., Western Europe, Australia and Canada. The fastest-growing regions are in Latin America, Southern Europe and Asia-Pacific.
"
4494,GOOG,"While 65% of its members come from outside of the U.S., that segment generates only about 36% of LinkedIn revenue.

"
4496,GOOG,"Analysts view the management as very strong. ""It's hard to argue with the execution in terms of the financials. These guys have consistently exceeded investor expectations quarter after quarter,"" White noted. ""Things are clearly volatile and dynamic in this industry. I think LinkedIn has been able to avoid a lot of the huge volatility in their stock,"" he said.

4566,GOOG,"""The reception of an IPO as high profile as Twitter would have a large impact on IPO activity overall,"" said Stephanie Chang, an analyst at IPO research and investment management firm Renaissance Capital.
"
4567,GOOG,"Private investments value Twitter at more than $10 billion. While that's a far cry from Facebook's current market cap near $100 billion and distant from Google's $285 billion, that puts Twitter in a whole other league from this year's tech IPO leaders. Tableau Software (DATA) leads this year's tech IPOs with a market cap near $4 billion. Most are well under $1 billion.

"

"
4589,GOOG,"Just five weeks later, as the buzz built, it revised that to raise $12 billion, at a market valuation of $100 billion. In its May 2012 IPO, it ended up raising $16 billion, with a market valuation of $104 billion.
"
4590,GOOG,"The IPO's first hours were marred by trading glitches on Nasdaq.

"
4592,GOOG,"Another IPO Twitter has surely studied is Google. While the stock quickly became a big winner, the Google IPO in 2004 wasn't deemed an immediate major success.
"
4593,GOOG,"Google used a so-called Dutch auction style of IPO, which enables a broad range of investors to buy initial shares, not just the favored clients of underwriters. It also seeks to reach an optimum initial price by selling via a public auction, but observers are mixed about how well that worked. Very few IPOs have used the Dutch auction style.
"
4594,GOOG,"The IPO raised $1.67 billion, but in its initial filing Google anticipated raising up to $2.7 billion. Early plans to offer 25.7 million shares were cut to 19.6 million. Google at first anticipated a price range of $108-$135 a share. But three days before the IPO, Google cut that to $85-$95.
"
4595,GOOG,"Analysts blamed the lowered range partly on Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, whom they said had been too cavalier in the road show presentations meant to drum up enthusiasm for the IPO.The market is ready for the next major Internet IPO: Twitter.And observers are hoping the microblog has learned a few lessons from difficult IPOs of the two biggest Internet IPOs, Facebook 's (FB) last year and Google's (GOOG) in 2004.""Twitter doesn't want to leave a bad taste"" in investor's mouths as did Facebook and, to an extent, Google, says Francis Gaskins, founder of IPOdesktop.com. ""You can be sure they'll want to put on a good performance.""Twitter has been mostly silent about any initial public offering, but speculation is rising that it could file for an IPO this year.""The excitement for a Twitter IPO is strong,"" said Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst at Wedge Partners.Said Gaskins: ""Twitter is probably working with the SEC right now. There's a lot of investor interest.""While there are no other Internet IPOs with Twitter's cache in the offing, a solid IPO from the microblog pioneer could open the IPO floodgates.""The reception of an IPO as high profile as Twitter would have a large impact on IPO activity overall,"" said Stephanie Chang, an analyst at IPO research and investment management firm Renaissance Capital.Private investments value Twitter at more than $10 billion. While that's a far cry from Facebook's current market cap near $100 billion and distant from Google's $285 billion, that puts Twitter in a whole other league from this year's tech IPO leaders. Tableau Software (DATA) leads this year's tech IPOs with a market cap near $4 billion. Most are well under $1 billion.Yet, Q2 marked the most U.S. IPOs in nearly six years. About 100 companies also have filed registration papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission for IPOs that would raise an aggregate $30 billion.""A successful Twitter offering could drive momentum and convert more of the pipeline to priced deals,"" Chang said.Twitter's revenue is expected to double this year to $583 million, according to research firm eMarketer.""Twitter might have a better potential for advertisers than Facebook,"" says analyst Pyykkonen.More than $1 billion has been invested in Twitter, based on various media reports of funding rounds.The company says its has more than 200 million active monthly users sending some 500 million tweets a day.Reports say Twitter has more than 500 million registered accounts, but the company won't confirm. Twitter supports more than 33 languages.The San Francisco-based company was founded in 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Biz Stone, Noah Glass and Evan Williams. CEO Dick Costolo, previously a group product manager at Google, took over from Williams in October 2010.Twitter users send messages, or tweets, that are limited to 140 characters in length. Users can attach links to websites, photos, charts and other images. Twitter subscribers can follow as many Twitter users as they want.500 Million-Plus SharesThe company has an estimated fully diluted share count of more than 528 million. It's not known how many shares Twitter might offer in an IPO, nor at what price.GSV Capital (GSVC), a publicly traded investment fund, disclosed owning 1.9 million shares of Twitter as of June 30, which it valued at $37.6 million. That implies a per-share value of $19.79 and a market valuation of $10.45 billion.Twitter makes money in several ways. Advertisers pay Twitter for promoting tweets. Twitter also sells live streams of tweets to companies that use that data to respond to trends. And the company also provides a data analytics service, informing clients about clicks, retweets, replies and more.The site is used by a wide range of people and businesses.

4596,GOOG,"Internet search engine Yandex (YNDX) has a strong growth record.Revenue grew 45% in 2010, then 62% and 41%. The Street expects sales to pop 32% this year.Earnings leapt 100%, 50% and 40% in the same years. Analysts peg EPS growth this year at 31%, though the last revision was downward.Yandex's search engine has the top market share in Russia, about 62% vs. Google's (GOOG) 26%.Although most of Yandex's operations are in Russia, the holding company is headquartered in the Netherlands. Low Dutch corporate taxes are a strong magnet, as even the Netherlands-based holding company for the Rolling Stones can testify.Is there an additional advantage for Yandex, such as avoiding Russia's intrusive and unpredictable government authorities?Not really. In its annual report, Yandex acknowledges risk factors it still faces in Russia.For example, Russia's legal system isn't based on precedent, which gives judges wide latitude and leads to inconsistent rulings.Also, financial groups, well-connected to Russia's government, have in the past gained control or minority stakes in successful companies. ""Our ability to thwart such efforts may be limited,"" Yandex notes in its 20-F report.Investors should also be aware that Yandex is indirectly vulnerable to crude oil prices. The Russian economy depends on strong oil prices. A decline in oil prices would hurt Russia's economy and pull down advertising spending as well.Advertising is how Yandex makes most of its money.One other risk: Unlike most Internet firms, Yandex carries neither insurance on its data centers nor business-interruption insurance. It also does not set aside reserves for such situations.On the plus side, Russia is still an early-stage Internet story, which holds promise for Yandex.

4604,GOOG,"If the digital economy has taught us anything, it's that connections scale.

"
4606,GOOG,"The challenge is turning those hits into business.
"
4607,GOOG,"Is it a true connection, one that will endure and spell opportunity, or will another fleeting, sugary distraction replace it the next day?
"
4608,GOOG,"A century before YouTube or Twitter or Facebook (FB), an unassuming Midwesterner launched his own connection economy, in a way that has brought lasting results to those in the fold.
"
4609,GOOG,"He was Ralph Smedley, the founder of Toastmasters International, who may — even still — have a wider influence than social media. After all, TI members have met in an ice cave in Antarctica.
"
4610,GOOG,"Toastmasters, headquartered in Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif., is a global nonprofit that delivers education for speaking and leadership skills.
"
4611,GOOG,"Its success — with 14,350 clubs, a 33% jump in revenue to $32 million in 2012 and 20 straight years of positive growth — is due to the bedrock principles Smedley (1878-1965) instituted from the beginning.
"
4612,GOOG,"""It's a culture of politeness, respect and professionalism,"" Daniel Rex, CEO of Toastmasters International, told IBD.
"
4613,GOOG,"The idea first took shape in 1903, when Smedley, a recent college graduate, was starting his career as the educational director at the YMCA in Bloomington, Ill.
"
4614,GOOG,"Boosting Boys
"
4615,GOOG,"Recognizing that the young men in his charge needed to build confidence and speaking skills, he designed a club where they could take turns presiding and presenting short speeches.
"
4616,GOOG,"Smedley provided evaluations of these speeches and, perceptively, encouraged the boys' peers to do the same, always with a spirit of helpfulness and consideration.
"
4617,GOOG,"They agreed to call the group Toastmasters because the setup was like a banquet with after-dinner speeches.
"
4618,GOOG,"When he was promoted to general secretary of the YMCA in Rock Island, Ill., Smedley started another club there, and it ballooned to a membership of 75.
"
4619,GOOG,"To his dismay, the first club in Bloomington dissolved after his departure, as did the Rock Island group, despite its popularity, and another club he started, in 1906, in Freeport, Ill.
"
4620,GOOG,"With his every rise up the ranks of the YMCA, and every transfer to a new city, the Toastmasters clubs he left behind faltered and died.
"
4621,GOOG,"Perhaps others were not as sold on the idea as he was.
"
4622,GOOG,"In ""The Story of Toastmasters: Reminiscences of the Founder,"" Smedley wrote, in his typically understated fashion, ""I observed a tendency among my fellow secretaries at the YMCA to regard the Toastmasters clubs as a sort of peculiarity, an idiosyncrasy, of mine.""
"
4623,GOOG,"Undeterred, Smedley introduced his idea on the West Coast after a career move to San Jose, Calif., in 1919. Although the failure pattern continued — launch, move, dissolve — so did Smedley.
"
4624,GOOG,"He persisted with his vision until finally, in Santa Ana in 1924, nearly 20 years after his first attempt, one group took root. Toastmasters International was born.
"
4625,GOOG,"That chapter, the Smedley No. 1 Club, still meets every first and third Tuesday.
"
4626,GOOG,"By the time his idea was germinating in California, it had expanded beyond a confidence-building experiment for YMCA youth.
"
4627,GOOG,"Business professionals saw that Smedley's approach could boost their ability to communicate — and to lead. ""That's the secret of Toastmasters,"" said Paul Clark, an Orange County, Calif., historian who carries the title Distinguished Toastmaster. ""Everyone thinks, 'Oh, I'll go there and learn how to speak.' But suddenly you're not only learning how to speak; you're learning how to be a leader.""
"
4628,GOOG,"Said Rex: ""At first that started as a byproduct of the program, but very soon Smedley realized that communication is a necessary part of leadership. You can be a good speaker without being a good leader. But you can't be a great leader without being a great communicator.""
"
4629,GOOG,"Public speaking is regularly cited as everyone's No. 1 fear. Three of four people rank it even more powerful than the fear of dying.
"
4630,GOOG,"As Jerry Seinfeld says, ""That means that the average person at a funeral would rather be in the casket than doing the eulogy.""
"
4631,GOOG,"In Smedley's philosophy, that fear turns into opportunity. Since strangers represent a threat (according to our biology), he simply transformed strangers into members of a tribe. They would convey support, cooperation, attention and help in a relaxed atmosphere, and everyone involved would benefit from the experience.
"
4632,GOOG,"""We learn best in moments of enjoyment,"" as Smedley put it.
"
4633,GOOG,"The ideal delivery, he found, was a conversational one — nothing bombastic or overly staged.
"
4634,GOOG,"Presidential Pitch
"
4635,GOOG,"He cited the fireside chats of Franklin Roosevelt and the folksy charm of Will Rogers as superior speechmaking, since they spoke to millions just as though they were speaking with a friend.

"
4637,GOOG,"""The culture of collaboration is just ingrained,"" Rex said. ""It is supportive enough to get someone to return to give another speech, but constructive enough to provide the value to help them improve over time.

"
4638,GOOG,"On the eve of Toastmasters' 90th anniversary, the connection economy that Smedley created is still working because the product is ongoing skill development.

4684,GOOG,"Verizon Communications (VZ) on Tuesday unveiled three new smartphones in its Droid lineup, made by Google's (GOOG) Motorola Mobility unit, which also is set to launch a much-anticipated Motorola ""Moto X"" phone on Aug. 1.The new Droid phones are the Droid Mini, Ultra and Maxx, each of which will be available starting Aug. 20, Verizon executives said at a launch event in New York.The phones run Google's Android mobile operating system, and each has the Kevlar-backed design that's become a staple of the Droid line. Available in the U.S. exclusively through Verizon Wireless, the new phones went on sale Tuesday, priced for two-year contracts.The Ultra has a 5-inch display and is just 7.2-millimeters deep. That's a bit thinner than the 7.6-mm iPhone 5, the newest model from Apple (AAPL). The ultra is priced at $199.The $299 Droid Maxx also has a 5-inch display, but it's thicker. That's because it has a battery that can be charged wirelessly and will last two days without a charge, according to Verizon.The $99 Mini has a smaller 4.3-inch screen and also has wireless charging.Shares of Verizon were up a fraction in afternoon trading in the stock market Tuesday.The big hype, though, is ahead, for the launch of the Moto X phone, almost surely at an event Google has planned for Aug. 1. Wall Street's watching that launch closely, because it'll mark the first Motorola phone that has ""Google DNA,"" Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian told IBD. Among other things, the Moto X — which will be assembled in Fort Worth, Texas — will be waterproof and drop-proof, and have a long battery life.Google bought handset-maker Motorola for $12.5 billion in May 2012, and the unit has posted losses each quarter since.

4730,GOOG,"New highs are showing encouraging signs, though they're not yet of an unmistakably bullish nature.If investors dig a bit, they will find either new highs involving breakouts or new highs representing good follow-up action from breakouts or, other times, new highs scored in an aggressive fashion without being near a recent buy point or buy zone.All this is good, although the tally of combined new highs — Nasdaq plus NYSE — isn't yet at strong levels.On Tuesday, Canada-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) became the latest stock to quit playing Hamlet around the buy point and thrust ahead confidently. The stock rose 12.73 to 125.35 in volume about triple its usual rate. Valeant made a new high and cleared a 115.50 buy point. The stock is now extended from the 5% buy zone that runs to 121.28.This means Valeant should not be bought because an extended stock can shake an investor out of a position with a normal pullback. The investor who buys near the ideal buy point has a much better chance of riding out a minor pullback. The pullback will often end before getting near the area (-7% to -8%) where an investor should cut losses.For those who buy extended stocks, however, there are no minor pullbacks. A decline can reach the nerve-wracking level in a flash.Stocks following up Tuesday on recent breakouts — with good gains and new highs in heavy volume — included: China-based JinkoSolar (JKS), up 92 cents to 36.48; Canadian Solar (CSIQ), up 2.84 to 38.57; clear dental braces provider Align Technology (ALGN), up 1.46 to 61.36; Amira Nature Foods (ANFI), up 74 cents to 18.93; MRI scanner developer Fonar (FONR), up 2.33 to 26.32; and China online social platform provider YY (YY), up 4.84 to 62.18.Other stocks moved to new highs with no recent breakout. They included: Google (GOOG), up 21.54 to 1,138.86; chip designer Ambarella (AMBA), up 1.55 to 35.61; and St. Jude Medical (STJ), up 1.26 to 64.90.If the major indexes can find the horsepower to jump higher, look for more new highs from highly rated stocks. Such a move could also bring the tally of combined new highs to 400 to 600, a level not seen yet this year.Click here to view the full list of 52-Week New Highs & Lows.

If in the future a customer wanted to, say, book a massage or a yoga class, then they could also do that through Yelp's website.Yelp's going to take a ""small percent"" of the transaction, which could result in about $1 in revenue per transaction, wrote Wedge Partners analyst Brian Blair.""We maintain a positive view of Yelp,"" Blair wrote in a research note, ""and believe this announcement offers a glimpse into a significant longer-term opportunity to monetize Yelp's traffic and brand beyond simple advertising.""Other big tech companies have been testing out local e-commerce and quick-delivery services, too. Notably, Google is testing Shopping Express, a same-day delivery service, where you can order, say, a bag of bagels. Amazon's reportedly testing a similar grocery service.RELATED: Google Trumps Yelp In Local Business Searches

If a big winner on hand goes on to form another good base and breaks out successfully, it's okay to buy more shares. In fact, even a second full-size position can be made if the stock has the makings of a great winner.Stocks that have turned out to be big-time stock market winners usually don't break out of a base and blast off without ever taking a breather. The majority of the time, it's not just one and done. Stocks will consolidate and go on to form new good bases.Take some precautions before you get in.First, make sure that the market is in a confirmed uptrend. Most stocks will move in the direction of the general market.Second, make that the stock you're holding is a top-tier leader. It should be No. 1 or No. 2 at what it does.Lastly, and probably most importantly, you should have a profit cushion of at least 20% in your current position before you think about buying again. Obviously, the bigger your prior gains, the more comfortable your buffer zone is. But if the new breakout doesn't work out, you'd still cut losses on the new stake at 8%.While the big money is usually made by concentrating a portfolio into a small number of positions, this can bring on extra risk.Yet the potential for compounding one's gains in the stock market increases sharply when one has two or more full positions in a true market winner.In ""How To Make Money In Stocks,"" IBD Chairman William O'Neil talked about how he accumulated a position in biotech Amgen (AMGN) in 1990 and 1991. ""If the market price was 20 points over my average cost and a new buy point occurred off a proper base, I bought more,"" O'Neil wrote.Google (GOOG) shaped several bases en route to huge gains in its first couple of years after coming public. The search engine leader formed two cup bases from November 2004 to April 2005. Technically, this was a base-on-base pattern. (1) Google's earnings vaulted 126% in 2005 as sales grew 92%.Google shaped a fresh cup with handle in July through September (2) and broke out. Another base is another buying opportunity. The stock hit 475 by January 2006, up 119% from the base-on-base entry.

4887,GOOG,"When Facebook last month started using the Twitter staple called hashtags, many of its users might have shrugged — but advertisers and market researchers didn't. They saw dollar signs.
"
4888,GOOG,"Hashtags can help better target ads, especially when coupled with the personal data that Facebook (FB) already collects — name, sex, age, location. Hashtags add one more data point for companies looking to target likely customers, says Joanna Belbey, a social media strategist at Actiance, a firm that helps companies comply with laws and regulations with its social and other communications.
"
4889,GOOG,"""If your customers are using hashtags, you can engage with them in conversation,"" Belbey said. ""And you can do pinpoint marketing.""
"
4890,GOOG,"Just what is a hashtag?
"
4891,GOOG,"It's a term — one word or several words — that has the pound sign — ""#"" — in front of it. When a user posts a hashtag on a social network like Twitter, Facebook, Google (GOOG) Plus or Yahoo's (YHOO) Tumblr, other users can click on the tagged word to search for all messages that have the same tag.
"
4892,GOOG,"Users posting a Twitter message from a San Francisco Giants baseball game, for example, might use the hashtag #SFGiants. Then, that message would post along with all other #SFGiants messages by others. Users can simply search for #SFGiants and get all messages with the tag.
"
4893,GOOG,"Also, other users (or advertisers or Twitter's data collectors) would know that user was interested in the Giants.
"
4894,GOOG,"Hashtagged words are sometimes used in the middle of sentences, or at the end of a message, as a sort of punctuation. They're usually on-topic, but can be used ironically, such as the hashtags #yeahright or #whatever, says Belbey.
"
4895,GOOG,"Twitter, Tumblr and Google+ have used hashtags for some time.

4897,GOOG,"But the company gave some indication of their potential with its June 12 hashtag announcement. Some 88 million to 100 million people are posting on Facebook during daily primetime TV, Facebook's Greg Lindley wrote in a blog post. A single ""Game of Thrones"" episode has gotten some 1.5 million mentions on Facebook, the company says. Now, if a fair number were using a #gameofthrones hashtag, well, that's a lot of hashtags and a big conversation about that popular TV show.
"
4898,GOOG,"""And this year's Oscars buzz reached an all-time high on Facebook with over 66.5 million interactions,"" wrote Lindley .
"
4899,GOOG,"Tapping into those networks of users with targeted ads could be valuable, says consultant Belbey.

4900,GOOG,"Facebook is looking into how it can add hashtags to some ads to further boost sharing and discovery of those ads, says Scott Ziegler, a social media strategist at PR firm Makovsky.
"
4901,GOOG,"Brands can — and do — simply log onto Twitter or Facebook and talk directly to users, identifying them via hashtags, and avoid paying for ads, says Aaron Everson, president of Shoutlet, a social marketing company. That's more work and harder to do than paying Twitter and Facebook for targeted ads, but doable.
"
4902,GOOG,"Ford Motor (F), for example, can safely assume that many posts with a #ford hashtag are fans of the company, or at least in some way are interested in the carmaker.
"
4903,GOOG,"Hashtags are great for ""raising awareness and driving word-of-mouth marketing around a new product,"" Everson said via email.
"
4904,GOOG,"And even non-paid-ad activity by a company can boost ad sales for Facebook or Twitter. The more time users spends on the network doing anything, the more ads the network can show them. More conversations and interactions equal more time spent on the network.
"
4905,GOOG,"But if brands are busy reading and responding to every post that has a certain hashtag, it could hurt the social network in the long run, argues Michael Thomsen, writing in Complex.com.

"
5097,GOOG,"Per-share profit fell to 35 cents from $10.17, but the year-earlier figure was inflated by a one-time $1.1 billion patent sale and licensing agreement with Microsoft (MSFT). Analysts expected Q2 EPS of 32 cents.

""It won't be a success overnight, so I'm happy with 23%.""Shares initially fell 10% after hours, but pared their late trading loss to about 4%. The stock rose 1.5% in the regular session.Mobile monthly users grew 57% vs. a year earlier, a slowdown from Q3's 67% gain.CEO Mark Zuckerberg told analysts on the post-earnings con ference call that Facebook is now a ""mobile first"" business and it will build new apps in 2013.""We aren't operating to maximize our profits this year,"" he said. ""We're doing what we think is best to grow our platform.""Analysts Still BullishStill, Zuckerberg said Facebook is building new multimedia mobile advertisements to add to the text-based ads it started posting in users' mobile ""News Feed"" in Q2 2012.It's still ""very early"" for predictions on how much it will grow in the coming quarters, wrote JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth. But it does look like it's doing well so far, wrote Anmuth.""We continue to believe that Facebook's ad platform is more differentiated in mobile than desktop,"" wrote Anmuth, who rates Facebook as overweight. ""And the company will continue to push high-quality ads toward the mobile news feed.""Mobile revenue could top desktop revenue by 2014, Anmuth says.Desktop advertising showed a ""slight acceleration"" in Q4, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Youssef Squali wrote in a post-earnings note. It grew 41% vs. 36% in Q3.Total Facebook user growth slowed to 25%, to 1.06 billion. Year-over-year growth had been 26% in Q3 and 29% in Q2.Facebook's adjusted operating profit margin was 46%, down from 55% a year earlier. That reflects heavier spending as the company takes product development seriously, says Pyykkonen.Facebook earlier this month rolled out ""Graph Search,"" a social search that analysts view as a challenge to Google (GOOG) Search.Zuckerberg reiterated Wednesday that Graph Search is ""not a Web search."" But it could boost Facebook users in 2013, even though it doesn't yet have any monetization, he said.""Down the line, if we do this well, this could become a meaningful business for us,"" he said.

5249,GOOG,"Google (GOOG) this month introduced paid subscriptions for its much-trafficked YouTube video site, a move that could draw more revenue from the lucrative video network.
"
5250,GOOG,"The new subscriptions allow Google-approved channels to charge 99 cents or more each month for access to videos.
"
5251,GOOG,"""I think it's an indication that they're serious about monetizing the business, and not just through advertising,"" said Wedge Partners analyst Martin Pyykkonen. ""I think it will take a long time to come to where the advertising on YouTube is today.""
"
5252,GOOG,"Channels are also able to offer discounted annual subscriptions, and those subscriptions can be viewed on PCs, smartphones, tablets and Internet-connected TVs. National Geographic Kids, for example, priced access to its video library at $3.99 per month or a discounted annual $29.99.
"
5253,GOOG,"Sales from the YouTube subscriptions probably are not going to lead to a boost in Google's revenue right away, but they could in the future, observers say.
"
5254,GOOG,"Initial Partners
"
5255,GOOG,"The subscription service is launching with about 50 channels. Those are the initial partners, but Google will open the program up to more YouTube producers within the next few weeks, the company wrote in a May 9 blog post. One of the most frequent requests that Google gets from users who post videos on YouTube is to be able to charge for content, the company says. Up until now, users have been able to partner with Google to run ads before or during their videos.
"
5256,GOOG,"Google didn't say what its cut will be from each channel subscription, but it probably won't be much. Rival video website Vimeo.com, which is owned by IAC/InterActiveCorp (IACI), started a similar pay-to-watch service earlier this year, and says it keeps only about 10% of each sale.
"
5257,GOOG,"YouTube may be a popular place for users to post videos of their cats and music videos, but it's also increasingly a place where original content is debuting. If video-posters know they can get paid by viewers, the quality will only get better, says Pyykkonen. Eventually, as avid teenage YouTube viewers grow up, the site's content could rival traditional TV viewing, he says.
"
5258,GOOG,"As of March, YouTube says it has 1 billion unique monthly users. The move to monetize those users with premium content puts YouTube into a potential rivalry with pay-to-watch sites like Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Hulu.com.

"
5260,GOOG,"YouTube and those other sites all are trying to figure out just what types of content they'll run, and how to effectively package it, observers say. Once Google figures out the best way to present and package those shows, YouTube subscriptions could be a material part of Google's business, says Global Equities analyst Trip Chowdhry.

5262,GOOG,"""Right now, from a Google perspective, it won't move the needle,"" Chowdhry said. ""If this project is successful, revenue is probably two, three years down the road.""
"
5263,GOOG,"Now, YouTube advertising likely brings in $3.5 billion to $4 billion in annual sales, according to observers. The company doesn't break out revenue for YouTube.

5264,GOOG,"And Google's YouTube subscription initiative isn't the only part of the company that's getting good buzz.

"
5266,GOOG,"If Google can figure out how to get advertising on that right-in-front-of-your-eye product, then it could potentially serve ads to users all day, observers say. But the form that those ads would take are seen as a tricky puzzle.

LG is the biggest of the three, with about 15% of global TV market share.""Based on settlements Rovi reached with CE OEMs in 2011, as well as Rovi's guidance for 2013, we expected LG and the others to generate catch-up payments of around $15 million,"" he wrote. ""Instead, they appear to have generated total catch-up payments of around $3 million. This suggests that Rovi has accepted lower overall economics than it did two years ago or has provided amnesty for previous infringement in the current round of settlements.""The settlements suggest diminished negotiating leverage and reduced patent value, he says, especially in light of Rovi's recent losses to Amazon in a U.S. district court and to Netflix/Roku before the the International Trade Commission.The ITC judge found three out of four Rovi patents involved were valid, but that Netflix and Roku had not infringed in the current case, Rovi said in a statement June 10.Rovi used to be digital rights management company Macrovision. It holds an IBD Composite Rating of 73 out of a possible 99.In other recent patent news, tech licensing firm Rambus (RMBS), known for litigation, struck its second-largest deal ever for $240 million with computer memory supply firm SK Hynix, which makes chips used in some Apple (AAPL) products and Asus Google (GOOG) Nexus 7 tablets. Rambus CEO Ron Black said on a conference call about the deal in early June that Rambus was going back to its roots with a ""preference not to litigate ... but settle.""RELATED: Tech Patent Firm Rambus Jumps On A Big Memory Deal

5366,GOOG,"The best big-cap stocks are flying as the broad market strikes new highs, just as you'd expect. Some are still within buying range, either from a recent breakout or on a rebound from a nicely rising 10-week moving average.Supermarket chain Kroger (KR) fell 49 cents, or 1%, to 33.95 in dull trade Monday. The stock has climbed 25% in the 17 weeks since its flat-base breakout. It logged one three-weeks-tight add-on point and a test of its 10-week line.Kroger now is nearly touching its 10-week line again. While this stock has been rising, it hasn't been a rocket. You may be better served by limiting your buy range to less than the usual 5% above the buy point.After years of subpar EPS growth, Kroger saw its net surge 39% and 76% in the two most recent quarterly reports. The April-ended quarter, Kroger's fiscal Q1, will show a 13% earnings rise, consensus says.We'd keep an eye on Kroger's debt-to-shareholder-equity ratio, which, at 146%, is uncomfortably high.Google (GOOG), the search-engine behemoth, fell 2.70 to 877.53. Shares are at the very limit of their 5% reach from a recent cup-shaped base. That breakout appeared May 3 and carried a disappointing 11% pickup in volume, a far cry from the 40% surge you really want to see.Remember, Google is no longer the young upstart it was in 2004, when it debuted. Today it's valued at $238 billion, and posted EPS gains of 12% and 15%.Look for just a 7% gain in Q2, consensus says.Las Vegas Sands (LVS) rose 46 cents, less than 1%, to 58.68. It, too, stands at its 5% reach from its most recent breakout. The stock pushed higher from its 56.04 cup-base buy point March 26. Like Google, Las Vegas Sands showed sputtery volume.Unlike Google, Las Vegas Sands' effort failed, with the stock triggering IBD's 8% sell rule April 5. On that day, Las Vegas Sands sliced below its 50-day line but reversed higher, paring a 5% loss to just 1%.The next day, it regained its 50-day line.So whether one saw this as a rebound from the moving average or as a stock regaining its original buy point (which it accomplished April 25 with robust volume), a buyer would have fared well.Las Vegas Sands sees most of its income from Macau and Singapore. After three straight quarters of shrinking EPS results, the company squeezed out a 1% gain in Q2. Look for a 50% improvement in Q2, consensus says.Celgene (CELG), one of several biomed names appearing on the Big Cap 20, is rebounding nicely from its 10-week line. The stock on Monday rose 2.20, or 2%, to 129.66 — a new high — in average trade.While Celgene is a bit extended from its 10-week line, it may pay to watch for a dip. Note that this rebound started May 2 with an upside reversal, but that move and subsequent gains have lacked any special volume.

"
5422,GOOG,"But after empire building in Europe and expansion in Asia since its 2007 acquisition of Agoda.com, Priceline is turning more of its focus to America.
"
5423,GOOG,"It acquired U.S. online meta-search site Kayak last month. At $1.8 billion, it was Priceline's largest acquisition by far, even larger than its 2005 buy of Booking.com in Europe.
"

"
5425,GOOG,"Until now, Booking.com has had a slim presence in America.
"
5426,GOOG,"Aiming For A Triumph
"
5427,GOOG,"""If they can build up a new brand in the U.S. online travel agency market with Booking.com, that would be a pretty significant win for Priceline,"" said analyst Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
"
5428,GOOG,"It's a big if. Unlike the fragmented European hotel market, which is dominated by small, independent properties, the U.S. is much more consolidated.
"
5429,GOOG,"Major hotel chains control two-thirds of the market. Though they do business with online travel agencies, they also sell directly to consumers through their own channels.
"
5430,GOOG,"A lot of competition exists in America, not the least of it involving leader Expedia (EXPE). Other players include privately held Travelocity and Orbitz (OWW).
"
5431,GOOG,"Orbitz continues to struggle due largely to its roots and focus on low-margin airline travel. Air travel has become a smaller slice of Priceline's mix in recent years.
"
5432,GOOG,"Orbitz's first-quarter gross booking in America fell 3% vs. the prior year to $2.4 billion. Expedia's grew 7% in the U.S. to $5.5 billion, according to research firm PhoCusWright.
"
5433,GOOG,"Priceline is the smallest in the U.S. of the three publicly traded online travel firms. But its domestic gross booking in the quarter grew the fastest at 9%, to $1.4 billion.
"
5434,GOOG,"Much of the growth came from rental-car reservations and improved hotel bookings, CEO Jeffery Boyd said in a post-earnings conference call.
"
5435,GOOG,"The rental car business has ""attractive unit economists and could be 5% to 10% of company profits within the next two years,"" Mahaney said.
"
5436,GOOG,"Meanwhile, hotels continue to drive Priceline's growth. Priceline's new focus on Booking.com in the U.S. is ""absolutely"" a good idea, said PhoCusWright's Lorraine Sileo, senior vice president of research.
"
5437,GOOG,"""The company has always been focused on Priceline in the U.S.,"" she said. ""Booking.com is another option. The brand is becoming a lot more recognized.""
"
5438,GOOG,"Mahaney says he sees no evidence that Booking.com is cannibalizing Priceline.
"
5439,GOOG,"But the launch of the company's first Booking.com TV ad campaign earlier this year pressured operating margins, management says. The operating margin in the first quarter fell to 35.1% from 35.8% a year earlier.
"
5440,GOOG,"Overall advertising, including substantial spending for online search placement on Google (GOOG), rose sharply in the quarter.
"
5441,GOOG,"Per-share earnings were still healthy, rising 35% to $5.76. Priceline's total worldwide bookings jumped 36% to $9.2 billion, making it a close second to Expedia.
"
5442,GOOG,"TV ads for Booking.com have continued in the second quarter, which will again likely affect margins. But CFO Daniel Finnegan said in the call, ""We believe that investing in the growth of our biggest brand in such an important market will yield a healthy return over the long term.""
"
5443,GOOG,"Asia and Latin America are also becoming more important. Last year, Priceline announced an alliance with Ctrip (CTRP), China's largest online travel agency.
"
5444,GOOG,"But Expedia has been expanding more aggressively in China and for a longer period, says analyst Scott Kessler of S&P Capital IQ.
"
5445,GOOG,"Expedia owns a stake in eLong, China's second biggest online travel agency.
"
5446,GOOG,"Profit Gains
"
5447,GOOG,"""There is a difference in owning a substantial stake and establishing an alliance,"" Kessler said. ""Asia remains an opportunity for Priceline, but frankly they are playing catch-up.""
"
5448,GOOG,"Priceline has posted strong double-digit profit gains every quarter for years, though at a slower pace more recently. And that's only because it's harder to grow as fast off a larger base, analysts say.
"
5449,GOOG,"Kessler said Priceline is ""one of the largest Internet companies on the planet"" in terms of market capitalization. He added that in America, consumers are more familiar with ""Name Your Own Price.""
"
5450,GOOG,"""There is an inherent lack of familiarity with the real kind of success the company has had abroad for a really long time,"" Kessler said.
"
5451,GOOG,"While he believes Booking.com has been gaining share in the U.S. off a low base, he thinks gains will be hard won.
"
5452,GOOG,"""We're not anticipating it's going to have a major impact on the company over the next couple of years,"" he said.
"
5453,GOOG,"Besides competition from peers such as Expedia, Google has enhanced its hotel search capabilities, and startups also are focused on the U.S. online travel space, says Kessler.
"
5454,GOOG,"How Priceline uses Kayak to its advantage other than just as a contributor to revenue is unclear. Analysts expect Priceline to expand Kayak into Europe and somehow leverage it to boost its other businesses in America.
"
5455,GOOG,"""Kayak is successful with mobile users, and it has a U.S.-facing footprint,"" Kessler said.Priceline (PCLN) lords over Europe's hotel kingdom with its industry-leading Booking.com.Booking.com also lords over Priceline, accounting for a majority of the company's international bookings.It's done well, even through the Continent's fiscal woes, as Europeans kept going on holiday no matter what.So it is no wonder the Norwalk, Conn.-based online travel company describes itself as a ""leader in global online hotel reservations.""What about the U.S.?

At $1.8 billion, it was Priceline's largest acquisition by far, even larger than its 2005 buy of Booking.com in Europe.What's more, Priceline has been aggressively promoting Booking.com in the U.S. Witness all those TV spots since January.Until now, Booking.com has had a slim presence in America.Aiming For A Triumph""If they can build up a new brand in the U.S. online travel agency market with Booking.com, that would be a pretty significant win for Priceline,"" said analyst Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.It's a big if. Unlike the fragmented European hotel market, which is dominated by small, independent properties, the U.S. is much more consolidated.Major hotel chains control two-thirds of the market. Though they do business with online travel agencies, they also sell directly to consumers through their own channels.A lot of competition exists in America, not the least of it involving leader Expedia (EXPE). Other players include privately held Travelocity and Orbitz (OWW).Orbitz continues to struggle due largely to its roots and focus on low-margin airline travel. Air travel has become a smaller slice of Priceline's mix in recent years.Orbitz's first-quarter gross booking in America fell 3% vs. the prior year to $2.4 billion. Expedia's grew 7% in the U.S. to $5.5 billion, according to research firm PhoCusWright.Priceline is the smallest in the U.S. of the three publicly traded online travel firms. But its domestic gross booking in the quarter grew the fastest at 9%, to $1.4 billion.Much of the growth came from rental-car reservations and improved hotel bookings, CEO Jeffery Boyd said in a post-earnings conference call.The rental car business has ""attractive unit economists and could be 5% to 10% of company profits within the next two years,"" Mahaney said.Meanwhile, hotels continue to drive Priceline's growth. Priceline's new focus on Booking.com in the U.S. is ""absolutely"" a good idea, said PhoCusWright's Lorraine Sileo, senior vice president of research.""The company has always been focused on Priceline in the U.S.,"" she said. ""Booking.com is another option. The brand is becoming a lot more recognized.""Mahaney says he sees no evidence that Booking.com is cannibalizing Priceline.But the launch of the company's first Booking.com TV ad campaign earlier this year pressured operating margins, management says. The operating margin in the first quarter fell to 35.1% from 35.8% a year earlier.Overall advertising, including substantial spending for online search placement on Google (GOOG), rose sharply in the quarter.Per-share earnings were still healthy, rising 35% to $5.76. Priceline's total worldwide bookings jumped 36% to $9.2 billion, making it a close second to Expedia.TV ads for Booking.com have continued in the second quarter, which will again likely affect margins. But CFO Daniel Finnegan said in the call, ""We believe that investing in the growth of our biggest brand in such an important market will yield a healthy return over the long term.""Asia and Latin America are also becoming more important. Last year, Priceline announced an alliance with Ctrip (CTRP), China's largest online travel agency.But Expedia has been expanding more aggressively in China and for a longer period, says analyst Scott Kessler of S&P Capital IQ.Expedia owns a stake in eLong, China's second biggest online travel agency.Profit Gains""There is a difference in owning a substantial stake and establishing an alliance,"" Kessler said. ""Asia remains an opportunity for Priceline, but frankly they are playing catch-up.""Priceline has posted strong double-digit profit gains every quarter for years, though at a slower pace more recently. And that's only because it's harder to grow as fast off a larger base, analysts say.Kessler said Priceline is ""one of the largest Internet companies on the planet"" in terms of market capitalization. He added that in America, consumers are more familiar with ""Name Your Own Price.""""There is an inherent lack of familiarity with the real kind of success the company has had abroad for a really long time,"" Kessler said.While he believes Booking.com has been gaining share in the U.S. off a low base, he thinks gains will be hard won.""We're not anticipating it's going to have a major impact on the company over the next couple of years,"" he said.Besides competition from peers such as Expedia, Google has enhanced its hotel search capabilities, and startups also are focused on the U.S. online travel space, says Kessler.How Priceline uses Kayak to its advantage other than just as a contributor to revenue is unclear. Analysts expect Priceline to expand Kayak into Europe and somehow leverage it to boost its other businesses in America.""Kayak is successful with mobile users, and it has a U.S.-facing footprint,"" Kessler said.

5547,GOOG,"Cups, cup with handles, flat bases and double bottoms are the most common price patterns that investors will find. But folks should also be on the lookout for the uncommon high, tight flag patterns.High, tight flags are extremely rare price formations that can lead to stellar gains. Only a few occur during bull markets.""This is the strongest of patterns, but it's also very risky and difficult to interpret correctly,"" wrote IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil in ""How To Make Money In Stocks.""The high, tight flag is a buy setup that allows investors to climb aboard stocks that already had a huge run-up. Investors will many times shy away from stocks that have already made sharp gains. But sometimes, there are more good things to come after the strong initial move.There are two key pieces to this pattern: the flagpole and the flag. The flagpole is a quick, sharp run-up from a consolidation. Look for a surge of at least 100% to take place within four to eight weeks. This fast and furious move in the flagpole needs to be studied carefully. Otherwise, some may read the price action as a topping signal.After the flagpole forms, the stock takes time to consolidate gains. Generally, it pulls back less than 20% over three to four weeks. The buy point in a high, tight flag is 10 cents above the high in the flag portion of the pattern.High, tight flags generally form on stocks of companies whose products or services have the power to really shake up an industry or even change the world. Monster stock market winners Google (GOOG), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Taser International (TASR) each shaped high, tight flags during their enormous runs.In the late 1990s, licensing company 4Kids Entertainment captured the attention of kids everywhere with its Pokemon television shows.4Kids broke out from a consolidation in the week ended July 9, 1999 and almost tripled. This surge helped form the flagpole. (1) The stock pulled back to its 10-week moving average in light trade over the next few weeks, forming the flag. (2) The pullback of 28% was a little deeper than norm. Still, 4Kids cleared the 37.85 entry in the week ended Oct. 8, 1999, in higher trade. It popped 146% before retreating.

5550,GOOG,"When Rhassan Fernandez took over operational control of Sam's Log Cabin, a diner in Albany, Calif., in 2010, the place had accumulated a string of poor Yelp reviews under the previous owners.
"

"
5552,GOOG,"This lets a business owner respond directly to Yelpers who write reviews about their stores.
"
5553,GOOG,"Fernandez saw that his Sam's got a low review, one out of five possible five stars. Even then, he resisted responding to a message after he logged onto his Yelp (YELP) for Business Owners account.

"
5557,GOOG,"The new reality, in which a bad experience can be broadcast through cyberspace, has brought with it an equal and converse truism for small businesses: Many of them are aware of their online reviews, even if executives don't handle them the same way.

"
5559,GOOG,"The reviewer also publicly praised Fernandez for his outreach and deleted his original commentary.

5574,GOOG,"Darnell Holloway, manager of local business outreach for Yelp, says restaurant owners benefit from the advertising.
"
5575,GOOG,"To nail that point home, the company commissioned a recent study from Boston Consulting Group that concluded that business owners who unlock their Yelp pages to engage with reviewers see an average annual revenue increase of $8,000. That figure jumps to $23,000 when a business advertises, the study found.

Now they want to make us move to super HD, 4K televisions,"" Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, told IBD.4K TV For $1,000Ultra HD televisions have been at CES the past two years, but were prohibitively expensive.This year, manufacturers will debut more reasonably priced 4K TVs. At least one vendor will show off a $1,000 Ultra HD TV, but most will have sets in the $2,500 to $3,500 range, he says.Today, 4K sets go for $3,500 to $12,000, Bajarin says.The consumer electronics industry is positioning Ultra HD as an evolution of TV, just as HD was, says Marjorie Costello, editor and publisher of Consumer Electronics Online News.The industry's last attempt to spark an upgrade cycle for television was 3D TV, but that failed.The current lack of 4K content for Ultra HD TVs is a problem, Costello says. Sony and Samsung are offering home media servers with Ultra HD content.But Blu-ray Disc backers have yet to announce a standard for delivering 4K on packaged media.""The big question for Ultra HD is whether anyone will announce an Ultra HD streaming service at the show,"" Costello said. Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) have announced general plans to stream their original shows in 4K video.LG, Samsung and perhaps others will be showing off curved-screen TVs at CES this year. LG will display a 105-inch curved-screen set that is ""stunning,"" Bajarin said. Samsung reportedly will have a similar TV at the show.""They're trying to deliver on the concept of a true cinematic experience,"" Bajarin said. TV makers also want to show that they can be innovative with design.One problem with curved-screen TVs is that you can't hang them on the wall, Costello says.Ultra HD and curved-screen TVs are likely to help brick-and-mortar retailers such as Best Buy (BBY) because consumers will want to check them out in person.""It helps the (consumer electronics) industry when people go to stores,"" she said.Another major trend at CES will be wearable devices for fitness, health monitoring and computing.Digital health applications for wearables are seen as a growth market. ""The aging baby boomer population has gotten health conscious after all the years of abusing their bodies,"" Bajarin said.Fitness Makes A RunNike's (NKE) FuelBand, Jawbone's Up and Fitbit are a few of the better-known wearable fitness products on the market. These products are designed to get you moving and track your progress day after day. Dozens more will be shown at the upcoming CES.Other wearable devices are for health monitoring — checking such things as blood pressure and blood glucose levels. Some will have a fashion component with sensors embedded into clothing.Wearable computing devices such as smartwatches and headsets will make a splash at the show too. They include smartwatches that wirelessly connect with your smartphone to display alerts and other information. Google's (GOOG) Google Glass headset has inspired imitators. Epson and Vuzix will be among those showing augmented reality headsets.Last year, 3D printers from 3D Systems (DDD) and MakerBot, now a unit of Stratasys (SSYS), made a big impression at CES. They're back along with competitors, including makers of low-cost printers.Two 3D printers costing $499 will be shown at CES, Bajarin says. At that price, they're likely to appeal to mainstream hobbyists.Other printers at CES will target the professional and high-end consumer markets with systems in the $999 to $1,299 range, he says.Other products likely to make headlines at CES are self-driving cars, connected cars, Bluetooth speakers and home automation technologies.

5605,GOOG,"Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund has had a challenging year. The high-quality stocks that its portfolio managers pursue lagged those that hold up well in iffy markets.But the managers are sticking to their guns.Columbia Large Cap Growth likes high-quality companies that are leaders in their fields, with prospects for durable earnings growth. That worked well in 2012.Last year the $2.6 billion fund topped 91% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.This year the fund is outperforming only 33% of its peers.""This year has been tougher,"" said lead manager John Wilson. ""Many more defensive sectors led the market this year until very recently. We've seen more strength from health care and consumer staples than you'd expect to see in a fund like ours.""Many investors have also favored higher-yielding stocks over growth-oriented stocks, he adds.But don't expect to see the fund try to take advantage of market fads. ""We're not changing our stripes to fit the flavor of the day,"" Wilson said.The fund was up 7.24% this year going into Tuesday. Its large-cap growth peers averaged 8.45%. The S&P 500 was ahead 11.43%.Over the past three years the fund's average annual gain was 14.45% vs. 13.87% for its peer group and 16.04% for the S&P 500. With a 4.13% weighting, Apple (AAPL) was still the fund's largest holding as of May 31. But Wilson says he and co-manager Peter Deininger have been trimming for a year.Leadership In InnovationApple is down 43% from its 705.07 all-time high on Sept. 21. Earnings have decelerated the past three quarters as rivals like Samsung have produced competitive products. Apple EPS went from 23% three quarters ago to 0% and -18%.Also, as Apple grows in size, it's harder for earnings to leap based on sales by any one product.Still, shareholders welcome Apple's recent hikes in dividends and share buybacks, he says.The managers like Google (GOOG), which is the fund's second largest holding. ""They've done a nice job answering some questions that held the stock back for the past couple of years,"" Wilson said.Mainly, Google has shown that it can monetize its service in mobile devices and mobile search.The company has also done a good job developing its YouTube business. ""They're cagey about disclosing how profitable it is, but the business is growing quite rapidly,"" he said. ""There's more growth potential. Now it's getting traction from an advertising standpoint and from users.""In addition, the company has integrated its Motorola acquisition.""Activities that were a drag on earnings are receding into the past,"" Wilson said.MasterCard (MA) is another favorite. It benefits from the global shift to digital payment, away from cash and checks.The stock is up 31% in the past 52 weeks and is testing support at its 10-week moving average.The managers still like Gilead Sciences (GILD) despite having taken profits in recent months. Shares rose 33% in the first quarter.""Longer term, they are introducing new products in the hepatitis C area in 2014 and especially 2015,"" Wilson said. ""So there should be strong acceleration of revenue and earnings growth.""

Jares uses a core strategy approach with a tilt toward growth. Wellington takes a core approach with a tilt toward growth that is more mindful of valuations than Jares' tack.Barrow Hanley uses a value-oriented strategy.""We let the managers find the best opportunities, given their processes and records,"" said Wasif Latif, who oversees the fund for USAA.Despite its name, the fund does not emphasize income. The fund's overall dividend yield is 0.94% vs. 1.95% for the broad market in the form of the $137.5 billion Vanguard 500 Index Fund .""We aim for long-term growth through capital gains, supplemented with income,"" Latif said.And the fund lets managers invest in stocks of any market capitalization. Now they're looking for most opportunities in the large-cap space.This flexible, diversified game plan has resulted in a 19.21% gain by the fund this year going into Tuesday. Its large-cap blend rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. averaged 18.69%. The S&P 500 was up 19.32%.In the past three years the fund has averaged 14.96% a year vs. its peer group's 16.14% and 17.84% for the big-cap bogey.Joltin' JavaOne of Jares' stocks is Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR). Earnings per share rose 27% and 45% the past two quarters. Shares are up 311% in the past 52 weeks, although the stock is trying to recover its 10-week moving average line as it consolidates recent gains.The company is best known for its Keurig single-cup brewing system. Coffee prices tumbled the past year. So Green Mountain's margins should be able to rise. New CEO Brian Kelley's experience at Coca Cola (KO) is expected to help Green Mountain's branding strategy.Google (GOOG) is another Jares stock. With a 65% to 70% share of the online search market, Google is a near monopoly in that field, he says.He likes how Google invests cash flow from search and advertising into new fields like Google Maps. That app not only helps a user find a location. The GPS function lets Google charge a company like Starbucks (SBUX) for an ad that flashes on your smart phone as you approach one of its coffee shops.Google Glass and Moto X are other innovations whose potential he likes.Taste For ChipsDutch-based NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) makes chips used in a variety of devices. He especially likes their automobile applications.Once they're designed in to a vehicle, they are rarely designed out, he says. And the auto industry is poised for growth, with low inventory and rising demand.Shares are up 61% over the past 12 months. Q1 earnings beat estimates but sales came in flat.Jares has trimmed his state in Apple (AAPL), which is trading 38% off its high. Jares' next move depends largely on the impact of Apple's next big product.

Investors question its ability to shift to mobile advertising from desktop computers. And the media have mocked the company's pratfalls, says Focused Growth lead manager Scott Migliori.But Allianz's latest survey of Facebook users, a month ago, found many are enthusiastic about features such as its photo-sharing app Instagram. ""Instagram is a hidden asset,"" Migliori said. ""It's getting traction with new video feeds.""Insights like that give the fund conviction in its Facebook stake. The fund boosted its position 3% in June to over 686,000 shares. The stock is up 16% from its June 6 low vs. about 8% for the S&P 500.Migliori's team has run the fund since Sept. 24. The biggest change it made was to make the fund more concentrated.The fund has 37 stocks, about the midpoint of its range of 25 to 45. Previously the fund typically held 50 stocks.When volatility drops and the market is poised to rise, the fund wants to be more focused. The fund is likely to expand its portfolio soon.

""Both have had good runs,"" Migliori said. ""We took profits and reallocated to other areas.""The fund sold the last of its Oracle (ORCL) stock in June after two months of trims. The analytics software maker's Q4 earnings fell 2% as the company reported its sales fell short of analysts' expectations.""Oracle has been negatively impacted by cloud pure plays like Salesforce.com (CRM) and WorkDay (WDAY),"" Migliori said. ""So Oracle's fundamentals are not progressing.""The fund also owns Salesforce.com. The fund began its current stake in February. It boosted its position in June to nearly 309,000 shares, up 26% from May.Stock in the enterprise software company has regained roughly half of what it lost in a sell-off that began in late May when it gave guidance that just missed views and released Q1 earnings that just met expectations.The fund upped its stake in Biogen Idec (BIIB) by 57% in June. Biogen bought an interest in multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri. Migliori expects the deal to be accretive to Biogen earnings.He also likes MS drug Tecfidera despite some investors' concerns about Biogen's ability to win patent protection in Europe.The fund was up 16.59% this year going into Monday vs. 16.94% for its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. and 19.16% for the S&P 500.

"
5749,GOOG,"IAC is the seventh-largest site network in the world. Its websites get over 1.1 billion visits and more than 346 million unique visitors per month. The company is headed by longtime entertainment figure Barry Diller.

""You don't necessarily know the IAC name or brand, particularly if you're a consumer in the marketplace. But it's a huge number of interesting and compelling Web properties.""
"
5751,GOOG,"The company has been around since the mid-1980s and has gone through various growth spurts, involving many acquisitions and spin-offs. In the early days, its acquisition strategy was pretty aggressive. But that strategy was fraught with risks, says Kessler.

And I think, most importantly, perhaps, operationally the company seems to continue to execute on a regular basis.""

5755,GOOG,"One way IAC is different from other large Internet companies is that it tends to operate all the businesses autonomously.
"
5756,GOOG,"Its stock, after hitting a high last October, went through a soft patch, but has been recovering since. The reason for the softness? The market's perception of the impact of changes to Google 's (GOOG)advertising policies on IAC's Ask.com.

So, they really want to make sure that their message is getting articulated to the Street.""

"
5764,GOOG,"""Match.com is subscription-based. Some of the acquisitions they've done over the course of the years, such as Meetic, were more advertising-centric.

5771,GOOG,"MENLO PARK, Calif. — In an effort to please both users and advertisers, Facebook announced a new look to the most important piece of its social networking website.
"
5772,GOOG,"Facebook (FB) on Thursday unveiled changes to its News Feed. This is the center element of its site, where friends post updates on what they are doing, thinking, listening to or watching.
"
5773,GOOG,"Company CEO Mark Zuckerberg made a rare press appearance to unveil the redesign. It was only the second time Facebook has hosted a press event at company headquarters since its May IPO.
"
5774,GOOG,"Zuckerberg presented the idea that News Feed will evolve from a single stream of content into a broader platform. He compared it to a local newspaper, where some might read the front pages while others will jump to the sports or entertainment sections.
"
5775,GOOG,"""The best newspaper has a broad diversity of content,"" with social and relevant updates for readers and the ability to drill down to specific items, he said.
"
5776,GOOG,"Losing Some Users?
"
5777,GOOG,"Some observers, though, say Facebook is losing some teenagers and young users to other sites such as Tumblr, and that some seasoned users are growing weary of the site. The News Feed changes aim to keep users more engaged with more relevant content.
"
5778,GOOG,"Facebook will let users filter content more to individual preferences, letting users click tabs that will bring up posts on specific topics such as music, films and games. Facebook also will spotlight the most talked about stories from users' closest friends, with larger photos and video images.
"
5779,GOOG,"The changes have begun and will be rolled out gradually, starting on PCs and laptops and then on to tablets and smartphones.
"
5780,GOOG,"The changes also will provide more room for advertisers to target users with relevant ads. If a user is focusing on what music their friends like, for example, Facebook might supplement that with information on where certain musical artists will be playing in concert.
"
5781,GOOG,"""It's a positive change,"" said Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst at Wedge Partners. ""It's more personalized and provides a better chance to monetize ad revenue in a way that won't alienate users.""
"
5782,GOOG,"It's unclear how much the changes will appeal to advertisers, ""but I don't have any hesitation in saying it will be incrementally positive for revenue growth,"" Pyykkonen said. ""I just don't know by how much.""
"
5783,GOOG,"Shares of Facebook rose 4.1% on Thursday.
"
5784,GOOG,"Increasing the size of images on Facebook will help advertisers, says Pyykkonen.
"
5785,GOOG,"Noticeable Changes Already
"
5786,GOOG,"""It's already very noticeable that Facebook is deliberately presenting bigger and richer images,"" he said. ""We think if the ads are sharply targeted with images, they will be tolerated and embraced by users.""
"
5787,GOOG,"It also means Facebook will likely be able to charge advertisers higher fees for placement, he says. But another observer says more improvements are still needed.
"
5788,GOOG,"Ophir Tanz, founder and CEO of GumGum, an online advertising services provider, said presenting ads on social networks in a way that satisfies both the user and advertiser remains a challenge.
"
5789,GOOG,"""Facebook has always been user-centric and resisted the urge to develop it for advertisers, which is the right thing to do,"" Tanz said. ""But they face pressure to monetize.
"
5790,GOOG,"""With this redesign, they have a larger canvas to play on. But they need to balance out the user and advertising experience. They have not yet hit the nail on the head.""
"
5791,GOOG,"Facebook has been boosting its advertising offerings via acquisitions. It's also stepping up its use of data analytics software to more deeply mine user preferences.
"
5792,GOOG,"Last week, Facebook acquired Atlas Advertiser Suite from Microsoft (MSFT). It's an online ad serving and measurement service. Terms weren't disclosed.
"
5793,GOOG,"Atlas could help Facebook create an ad network to better compete with Google's (GOOG) AdSense platform.
"

""It's more personalized and provides a better chance to monetize ad revenue in a way that won't alienate users.""It's unclear how much the changes will appeal to advertisers, ""but I don't have any hesitation in saying it will be incrementally positive for revenue growth,"" Pyykkonen said. ""I just don't know by how much.""Shares of Facebook rose 4.1% on Thursday.Increasing the size of images on Facebook will help advertisers, says Pyykkonen.Noticeable Changes Already""It's already very noticeable that Facebook is deliberately presenting bigger and richer images,"" he said. ""We think if the ads are sharply targeted with images, they will be tolerated and embraced by users.""It also means Facebook will likely be able to charge advertisers higher fees for placement, he says. But another observer says more improvements are still needed.Ophir Tanz, founder and CEO of GumGum, an online advertising services provider, said presenting ads on social networks in a way that satisfies both the user and advertiser remains a challenge.""Facebook has always been user-centric and resisted the urge to develop it for advertisers, which is the right thing to do,"" Tanz said. ""But they face pressure to monetize.""With this redesign, they have a larger canvas to play on. But they need to balance out the user and advertising experience. They have not yet hit the nail on the head.""Facebook has been boosting its advertising offerings via acquisitions. It's also stepping up its use of data analytics software to more deeply mine user preferences.Last week, Facebook acquired Atlas Advertiser Suite from Microsoft (MSFT). It's an online ad serving and measurement service. Terms weren't disclosed.Atlas could help Facebook create an ad network to better compete with Google's (GOOG) AdSense platform.Google accounted for 41% of all digital ad revenue in the U.S. last year, with Facebook's share just 6%, according to research firm eMarketer. Yahoo's (YHOO) share was 8.4%.Facebook also is developing a search platform called Graph Search, which is still in a test phase announced Jan. 15.

ABI also forecasts that the wearable computing device market will grow to 485 million annual device shipments by 2018.Reports Thursday say Apple made a patent filing with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in August 2011 that hints it's developing a flexible touch-screen device that fits around a user's wrist. Some analysts say an ""iWatch"" rollout will come this year, as IBD has reported. Google (GOOG), meanwhile, is launching an augmented-reality smart-glass product called Google Glass.""Apple's curved glass-based watch could prove to be a revelation in the wearable technologies market. The major question is whether the digital timepiece will act as a complimentary device to the company's iPhone smartphones or as a standalone product with other functionalities like health or activity tracking capabilities,"" Josh Flood, an analyst at ABI Research, said in the firm's report.ABI says sports and activity trackers account for the largest chunk of wearable technologies shipped today. It notes that smart activity trackers are widely available, and the device's trendy and stylish appearance makes them popular with a broad range of customers.The report estimates that 61% of the wearable technologies market is tied to sport/activity trackers. It notes smartphone compatible watches are beginning to emerge and that ""we will see the arrival of the much anticipated smart glasses later this year.""ABI added that smart watches offer extra usages for an item most people already own and commonly purchase. It may become universally expected for watches to include this functionality as a feature. Furthermore, the capabilities of smart watches could lead to the device being used as a wearable remote for home automation systems. A quick shake of your wrist to turn off/on room lights could be a convenient tool.RELATED: Will Google Glass be the next Segway?.

5888,GOOG,"When a market uptrend is under pressure, it can mean several things for the top stocks.One, many of the individual leaders could be taking a break. This is normal. After all, the average length of time for a big winner to complete its price run ranges from 12 months to 18 months. You can expect a stock to make several mild declines over that period.Two, some leaders may actually be falling faster than the major indexes and are working on a new base.In the first scenario, the stock may have fallen for a few weeks in a row. But the uptrend is still well intact, and the stock may still be holding firmly above its 10-week moving average.In the second scenario, you typically see a stock sink below the 10-week line, one of the most important price areas where bullish institutions buy shares and support the stock. You can expect the stock to also form a base such as the flat base (which must be at least five weeks in length), a cup with handle or double bottom (at least seven weeks) or others including the ascending base and the saucer.What do the best issues in the Big Cap 20 show today?Six of the top 10 names are rising steadily. The rest appear to be poised to form a new base.Celgene (CELG) fell below its 10-week moving average on Monday with a 2% drop in above-average volume. If it finishes the week under the 10-week line, it would be the first time for the cancer treatment firm to do so since it cleared a cup base entry at 81.34 at the start of the year. Since then, Celgene had risen as much as 62% to a high of 131.82.Such a character change would indicate that buying demand has diminished. At that point, it's worth seeing how far it will drop from its high. Sideways action and a decline of no more than 10% to 15% would yield a flat base. Deeper declines may result in a cup or a double bottom. Be wary of cups that show a decline of 35% or more; a stock needs to rally a lot just to get back within breakout territory.It's worthwhile watching how other leaders in IBD's Medical-Biotech/Biomedical group are faring. On Monday, industry peer Biogen Idec (BIIB), No. 7 in the Big Cap 20, gapped down in big volume for the first time since a breakout past a 155.40 buy point in late January.Google  (GOOG) has fallen two weeks in a row, but it trimmed losses on Monday. The stock still trades above its 10-week moving average. It remains 3% above an 844.10 cup-without-handle entry point.The Internet search giant is not only a force in online video (via YouTube) and mobile web search and advertising, but is also expanding into hardware via its low-priced PC and its Web-enabled wearable camera ""Google Glass.""Also in the top 10, LinkedIn (LNKD), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are currently below their 10-week lines.

"
5894,GOOG,"People love to save money on goods and services with coupons.
"
5895,GOOG,"Finding and collecting coupons has gotten a lot easier with the advent of online computing. Research firm eMarketer estimates 48% of U.S. adult Internet users redeemed a digital coupon for shopping last year.
"
5896,GOOG,"While print coupons are still the most widely used, digital coupons have caught on as a mainstay activity, as eMarketer estimates 97 million U.S. adults will access coupons via the Internet by the end of this year, growing to 100 million in 2014.
"
5897,GOOG,"An early entrant in the market was RetailMeNot, which aims to raise $191 million by selling 9.2 million shares in an initial public offering expected to launch next week.
"
5898,GOOG,"But there are questions as to whether RetailMeNot is approaching its expiration date.
"
5899,GOOG,"""They were the early adopters of digital coupons, but now it's very competitive and there are no barriers to entry,"" said Francis Gaskins, founder of research firm IPO Desktop.
"
5900,GOOG,"The market for digital coupon solutions is highly competitive, fragmented and rapidly changing. This includes competition from cash back and loyalty websites, search engines like Google (GOOG), social networks like Facebook (FB) and comparison shopping websites. Online competitors include Groupon (GRPN), Amazon (AMZN) and Amazon-led Living Social.
"
5901,GOOG,"The good news is it's in a fast-growing market and as such, the IPO will likely collect some buzz when its retail road show begins this Thursday in New York.
"
5902,GOOG,"""We are encouraging retail and institutional investors to look at this offering,"" said Scott Sweet, senior managing partner at IPOboutique.com. ""But RetailMeNot needs to make a clear distinction that they are not like the many other companies out there.""
"
5903,GOOG,"THE COMPANY
"
5904,GOOG,"RetailMeNot claims to operate ""the world's largest digital coupon marketplace."" In 2012, it featured digital coupons from more than 60,000 retailers and brands. These include coupons for Walmart (WMT), Kohl's (KSS), Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD) and many more. The company has contracts with more than 10,000 retailers.
"
5905,GOOG,"Coupon categories include clothing, electronics, home and office, travel, health and beauty, shoes and food.
"
5906,GOOG,"Total visits to the website topped 464 million in 2012, up 32.5% from the prior year.
"
5907,GOOG,"The original founding company was WhaleShark Media, which entered the digital coupon market in 2009 and has received more than $300 million in venture capital funding. In 2010, WhaleShark acquired Australia-based RetailMeNot. That was followed by the acquisition of a U.K.-based coupon firm, three France-based coupon companies and one based in the Netherlands. It also competes in Germany. The company now lists eight primary websites.
"
5908,GOOG,"Three of those sites, including RetailMeNot, also support Apple (AAPL) iPhone and Google Android applications. WhaleShark took on the RetailMeNot brand as its corporate name last March. It expanded into Canada last month.
"
5909,GOOG,"The company lists several trends driving the industry.
"
5910,GOOG,"It starts with consumers increasingly using the Web to make purchase decisions and shop online. Another is the growth in mobile shopping, with the proliferation of smartphones and tablets.
"
5911,GOOG,"Then there is the mindset of consumers always looking for savings. In addition, retailers are increasingly ramping up their online presence.
"
5912,GOOG,"RetailMeNot provides several solutions to enhance the online shopping and coupon-using experience, connecting consumers with retailers and brands.
"
5913,GOOG,"""We believe that our strong brand recognition has allowed our marketplace to become the leading destination for consumers looking to save money on retail purchases,"" according to the company's S-1 prospectus filing with the SEC.
"
5914,GOOG,"In 2012, RetailMeNot had more than 24 million monthly unique visitors to its website, ""more traffic than the majority of our retailer's own websites attract,"" it said.
"
5915,GOOG,"About 97% of net revenue in 2012 came from commissions earned when consumers made purchases using digital coupons featured on its websites and mobile applications.
"
5916,GOOG,"RISK/CHALLENGES
"
5917,GOOG,"RetailMeNot is an early-stage company, which makes it difficult to fully evaluate its current business and future prospects. And as is sometimes the case with young companies like this, the storefront may look prettier than what is inside. Case in point is Groupon, which RetailMeNot has sometimes been compared to, though perhaps unfairly.
"
5918,GOOG,"Groupon, before it launched its IPO in November 2011, was pounded by critics for its accounting methods and business model. Nonetheless, the buzz on Groupon was strong as shares rose 31% on its first day of trading. But from that point on for the next 12 months shares fell and fell. In April 2012 auditors disclosed a ""material weakness"" in financial reporting at the company.
"
5919,GOOG,"And as more competitors entered the market, Groupon spent more on marketing to maintain its growth, but business continued to slip. In March of 2013 its CEO was replaced.
"
5920,GOOG,"As RetailMeNot listed in the ""Risks"" section of its S-1, several factors could affect business performance, including the loss of existing retailers or the inability to add new ones, or new customers.
"
5921,GOOG,"""With the introduction of new technologies and the influx of new entrants to the market, we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future, which could harm our ability to increase sales and maintain our profitability,"" according to RetailMeNot.
"
5922,GOOG,"THE RESULTS
"
5923,GOOG,"Revenue in 2012 rose 80% to $144.7 million. Net income of $26 million was an increase of 53% from the prior year.
"
5924,GOOG,"For the second quarter ended June 30, which are preliminary and not yet finalized, RetailMeNot expects to report revenue of about $42.3 million, up 41% from a year ago, but net income is expected to fall 17% from the year-ago quarter.
"
5925,GOOG,"In the first quarter, revenue rose 37%, to $40.6 million. That compares with 50% growth in the fourth quarter.
"
5926,GOOG,"""They had a tremendous growth rate from 2011 through 2012,"" said Gaskins. ""Their growth rate is now slowing as sales and marketing costs are increasing. It's risky.""
"
5927,GOOG,"USE OF PROCEEDS
"
5928,GOOG,"The company is selling 9 million shares, of which half are being sold by the company and the other half by insiders and early investors. Gaskins calls that a red flag.
"
5929,GOOG,"""Normally, if it's a good deal the venture capitalists do not show signs of wanting to get out,"" he said.
"
5930,GOOG,"About $80 million of net proceeds will go to selling stockholders, executive officers and others.
"
5931,GOOG,"RetailMeNot expects to use $52.5 million of the proceeds from the IPO to pay unpaid dividends and $6.6 million to repay notes that mature on Aug. 31. It expects to use the balance of its proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

"
5965,GOOG,"But to lure staff, Jessica Aptman, a senior PR manager at New York-based ZocDoc, says creating a fun, dynamic culture is critical to keeping the young company staffed with the best talent.
"
5966,GOOG,"Aptman identifies three appealing incentives offered. ZocDoc covers 100% of medical costs of all employees and their families, except for co-pays and medications. Moreover, it offers an ""unlimited vacation"" policy where staff can take off for extended periods after consultation with their manager.
"
5967,GOOG,"Its culture promotes ""owning"" issues so people are encouraged to ""to act as though you are the owner of the company and respect it as your own,"" Aptman said. She herself took about 15 days off last year, a rather typical vacation period at ZocDoc.

5968,GOOG,"Each day lunch is delivered from various eateries to the ZocDoc office, free of charge, so staff can dine together and get to know one another.
"

"
5971,GOOG,"Employee perks can also be geographic. St. Louis-based online investing firm Scottrade's put an opposite twist on the notion that workers move to where the jobs are. If an employee is good, the company may open a branch office in a city or locale where the staffer is moving — just to keep him or her. Fortune magazine reports that Scottrade has opened as many as 20 offices for employees, just to boost retention.

"
5974,GOOG,"Nelson also advises that companies ask employees what extra benefits they'd like to see before nailing down perks. Some employees would opt for free yoga rather than storing Cokes in the refrigerator. Tailoring perquisites to suit individual needs can also be effective.
"
5975,GOOG,"Choosing the right incentives also generates favorable buzz about the company. ""It helps them stay competitive."" Nelson said.
"
5976,GOOG,"These perquisites send a message that the company ""cares about us."" Nelson said. But he also noted that they also have their limitations.
"
5977,GOOG,"Most perks aren't ""specifically tied to performance,"" Nelson said. Most are doled out without regard to specific corporate goals. This is something that employers can correct. If perquisites were aligned more with strategic objectives, cost-saving efficiencies and core values, they'd exert more meaningful impact, he said.

6097,GOOG,"Yahoo (YHOO) CEO Marissa Mayer continues to be aggressive, embracing billion-dollar acquisitions to get the buzz — and ad dollars — building at the big Web portal.
"
6098,GOOG,"Yahoo has committed $1.1 billion to buy social blogging site Tumblr, but that deal hasn't slowed its willingness to spend maybe $800 million for video site Hulu. It's looking like it might have to spend more to win the video firm, however, testing how far the new CEO is willing to go.
"
6099,GOOG,"But Hulu would be a more important immediate acquisition than Tumblr, observers say.
"
6100,GOOG,"""Hulu makes a lot more sense strategically than Tumblr,"" said Vertere Group CEO Tim Hanlon, a Chicago-based consultant and investment adviser. ""It comes with a well-understood advertising mechanism, which is the 30-second commercial.""
"
6101,GOOG,"Internet video site Hulu last week reportedly received several takeover bids, perhaps sparked by word of Yahoo's offer, which AllThingsD reported was for $600 million to $800 million.
"
6102,GOOG,"(The blog on Thursday made a case why Yahoo might also consider buying local check-in site Foursquare.)
"
6103,GOOG,"But satellite TV firm DirecTV (DTV) has offered more than $1 billion for Hulu, and No. 2 cable firm Time Warner Cable (TWC) is looking as well, according to Bloomberg News.
"
6104,GOOG,"And AT&T (T) and the Chernin Group investment firm are considering a bid, AllThingsD reported Thursday. Hulu and AT&T both declined to comment on that report.
"
6105,GOOG,"Yahoo is interested in Hulu, but it likely won't be the highest bidder in part because of all the money it just spent on Tumblr, wrote Wedge Partners analyst Martin Pyykkonen in a Wednesday research note.
"
6106,GOOG,"Hulu, however, has a targeted advertising network and would generate revenue for Yahoo right away. That's a goal for a company that despite attracting as many visitors as almost any Web property hasn't seen a significant rise in revenue since 2006.
"
6107,GOOG,"The blogging network Tumblr, on the other hand, has stepped only lightly — and somewhat reluctantly — into advertising.
"
6108,GOOG,"Tumblr CEO David Karp, who will remain in his position after the acquisition, in 2010 told the Los Angeles Times that advertising ""turns our stomachs,"" but later softened his views and started putting some small ads on Tumblr last year.
"
6109,GOOG,"Tumblr, with 300 million unique monthly visitors, has also started rolling out ""sponsored"" blog posts on users' mobile apps.
"
6110,GOOG,"Yahoo declined to comment on its Tumblr ad plans. The acquisition is expected to close this year.
"
6111,GOOG,"Tumblr Rolls Out Ads
"
6112,GOOG,"Tumblr last week rolled out new desktop ads, just two weeks after Yahoo announced the acquisition.
"
6113,GOOG,"It could take months for Yahoo to ramp up targeted ads on Tumblr. While Hulu and all video sites have their issues as to how many ads to run, for how long and at what point, for Tumblr the ad issues go deeper. Ads on Tumblr remain largely an unknown commodity.
"
6114,GOOG,"Yahoo can't expect to see much revenue from Tumblr until maybe 2014, says Ben Straley, a vice president with Rio SEO, a company that builds ad campaigns around social and search.
"
6115,GOOG,"Tumblr will want to build ""native"" advertising, says Straley. Such ads are not intrusive but instead ideally are similar in tone and in context with the site's normal content. Properly targeting native ads to Tumblr's audience will take much testing, he says.
"
6116,GOOG,"""If they just wanted to slap up banner ads all over the place, they could,"" said Straley, but he says that's not the best tack.
"
6117,GOOG,"With Tumblr likely far from profitability, Yahoo's $1.1 billion acquisition is a premium based on future valuation forecasts by Yahoo, Hanlon says.
"
6118,GOOG,"""Independently or as part of Yahoo, Tumblr's advertising value remains to be seen,"" Hanlon said. ""Tumblr doesn't have an ad business of any consequence.""
"
6119,GOOG,"Neutral Reaction
"
6120,GOOG,"Wall Street analysts seem neutral on the Tumblr acquisition.
"
6121,GOOG,"BMO Capital Markets analyst Daniel Salmon, in a research note, said the deal will boost Yahoo's ""stagnant audience figures"" but not much else near term.
"
6122,GOOG,"""We believe CEO Mayer has earned the right to make this bet after a series of small and patient moves that have been greeted positively by investors,"" wrote Salmon, who rates Yahoo stock as market perform, or hold.
"
6123,GOOG,"Yahoo's ads will likely be ""tolerated"" by Tumblr's 300 million monthly users, wrote analyst Pyykkonen.
"
6124,GOOG,"""The ad load needs to be carefully planned to not overload Tumblr users with ads,"" he said.
"

"
6131,GOOG,"""Very few of these Yahoo acquisitions have netted any business over the years,"" Hanlon said.Yahoo (YHOO) CEO Marissa Mayer continues to be aggressive, embracing billion-dollar acquisitions to get the buzz — and ad dollars — building at the big Web portal.Yahoo has committed $1.1 billion to buy social blogging site Tumblr, but that deal hasn't slowed its willingness to spend maybe $800 million for video site Hulu. It's looking like it might have to spend more to win the video firm, however, testing how far the new CEO is willing to go.But Hulu would be a more important immediate acquisition than Tumblr, observers say.""Hulu makes a lot more sense strategically than Tumblr,"" said Vertere Group CEO Tim Hanlon, a Chicago-based consultant and investment adviser. ""It comes with a well-understood advertising mechanism, which is the 30-second commercial.""Internet video site Hulu last week reportedly received several takeover bids, perhaps sparked by word of Yahoo's offer, which AllThingsD reported was for $600 million to $800 million.(The blog on Thursday made a case why Yahoo might also consider buying local check-in site Foursquare.)But satellite TV firm DirecTV (DTV) has offered more than $1 billion for Hulu, and No. 2 cable firm Time Warner Cable (TWC) is looking as well, according to Bloomberg News.And AT&T (T) and the Chernin Group investment firm are considering a bid, AllThingsD reported Thursday. Hulu and AT&T both declined to comment on that report.Yahoo is interested in Hulu, but it likely won't be the highest bidder in part because of all the money it just spent on Tumblr, wrote Wedge Partners analyst Martin Pyykkonen in a Wednesday research note.Hulu, however, has a targeted advertising network and would generate revenue for Yahoo right away. That's a goal for a company that despite attracting as many visitors as almost any Web property hasn't seen a significant rise in revenue since 2006.The blogging network Tumblr, on the other hand, has stepped only lightly — and somewhat reluctantly — into advertising.Tumblr CEO David Karp, who will remain in his position after the acquisition, in 2010 told the Los Angeles Times that advertising ""turns our stomachs,"" but later softened his views and started putting some small ads on Tumblr last year.Tumblr, with 300 million unique monthly visitors, has also started rolling out ""sponsored"" blog posts on users' mobile apps.Yahoo declined to comment on its Tumblr ad plans. The acquisition is expected to close this year.Tumblr Rolls Out AdsTumblr last week rolled out new desktop ads, just two weeks after Yahoo announced the acquisition.It could take months for Yahoo to ramp up targeted ads on Tumblr. While Hulu and all video sites have their issues as to how many ads to run, for how long and at what point, for Tumblr the ad issues go deeper. Ads on Tumblr remain largely an unknown commodity.Yahoo can't expect to see much revenue from Tumblr until maybe 2014, says Ben Straley, a vice president with Rio SEO, a company that builds ad campaigns around social and search.Tumblr will want to build ""native"" advertising, says Straley. Such ads are not intrusive but instead ideally are similar in tone and in context with the site's normal content. Properly targeting native ads to Tumblr's audience will take much testing, he says.""If they just wanted to slap up banner ads all over the place, they could,"" said Straley, but he says that's not the best tack.With Tumblr likely far from profitability, Yahoo's $1.1 billion acquisition is a premium based on future valuation forecasts by Yahoo, Hanlon says.""Independently or as part of Yahoo, Tumblr's advertising value remains to be seen,"" Hanlon said. ""Tumblr doesn't have an ad business of any consequence.""Neutral ReactionWall Street analysts seem neutral on the Tumblr acquisition.BMO Capital Markets analyst Daniel Salmon, in a research note, said the deal will boost Yahoo's ""stagnant audience figures"" but not much else near term.""We believe CEO Mayer has earned the right to make this bet after a series of small and patient moves that have been greeted positively by investors,"" wrote Salmon, who rates Yahoo stock as market perform, or hold.Yahoo's ads will likely be ""tolerated"" by Tumblr's 300 million monthly users, wrote analyst Pyykkonen.""The ad load needs to be carefully planned to not overload Tumblr users with ads,"" he said.Tumblr users log in to use the service, which does make it easier to target ads, Straley points out.

6189,GOOG,"As the Q2 earnings season starts, tech companies in the S&P 500 are expected to post their second quarter in a row of year-to-year EPS declines, hit by weak PC sales.
"
6190,GOOG,"Hardware companies and chipmakers are getting hit the hardest, while software and Internet firms are healthier.
"
6191,GOOG,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the 70 tech firms in the S&P 500 to post a combined 3.8% decline in earnings per share in the June quarter vs. Q2 2012. Their EPS fell 1.2% in Q1.

6193,GOOG,"PC Shipments Down Again
"
6194,GOOG,"Global PC shipments fell 11.4% to 75.6 million units in the second quarter, research firm IDC reported Wednesday. It marked the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year declines. In the first quarter, PC shipments fell 14%, the steepest quarterly drop since IDC began tracking this metric in 1994.
"
6195,GOOG,"Earnings among the S&P 500 chipmakers, which include Intel (INTC), are expected to fall a combined 18%. The three PC makers in the group, Apple (AAPL), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and Dell (DELL), are expected to see EPS drop 22%. But chip gear makers are expected to take the biggest hit, down 31%.
"
6196,GOOG,"Intel is set to report results on Wednesday, as is another tech bellwether, IBM (IBM). Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS of 39 cents for Intel, down 32%, the fourth straight quarter of double-digit declines.
"
6197,GOOG,"Falling PC sales aren't the only problem for techs. The sluggish global economy remains a nagging issue. Oracle (ORCL) and Accenture (ACN) last month pointed to this in reporting results for their fiscal quarters ended May 31.
"
6198,GOOG,"Database leader Oracle missed expectations, as its hardware revenue continues to fall. Tech services provider Accenture also disappointed investors with revenue below guidance. Accenture CEO Pamela Craig described the situation as ""challenging and volatile.""

6205,GOOG,"The tech trend might not be as bad as it seems, says Harrison, because the biggest of the techs — Apple — puts a heavy weight on the group as a whole.
"
6206,GOOG,"Analysts expect Apple's EPS to sink 21%, which would be its worst showing in at least four years. Sales of Mac computers are one thing, but Apple's vaunted smartphone business is seeing slower growth amid market saturation and intense competition from Samsung and others.

"
6218,GOOG,"The software giant, along with Intel (INTC), Cisco (CSCO) and Dell (DELL), led one the greatest bull markets in history. From the middle of 1994, Microsoft raced more than 2,600% higher to its peak.

"
6223,GOOG,"But growth is slowing as consumers shift from PCs to tablets.

6249,GOOG,"Mike Scott bounced back from the Californian defense industry slump in the 1990s.How? Using IBD, he became a full-time investor and learned to spot great stocks with radarlike accuracy.He's picked and profited from some nice winners along the way, including Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR) during its more-than-3,300% rise from a November 2006 breakout to its peak at 115.98 in September 2011.The Los Angeles resident also excels at teaching the CAN SLIM system at a monthly IBD Meetup group in Thousand Oaks, Calif.""Most beginning traders tend to overtrade; I did too,"" Scott told IBD. ""I got rid of the five-minute intraday charts.""He keeps his daily stock charts a small size on his computer screen and his weekly charts big.Why? ""You can trade more calmly,"" Scott said.The former nuclear submarine engineer for the U.S. Navy launched a consulting business after a successful stint at what was then called Rockwell International. But the business ""slowly dried up as the industry left California,"" he told IBD.Scott looked set to go back to work for a company, then remembered about a book he received years earlier — the hardcover first edition of IBD founder William O'Neil's ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""With the help of Lee Tanner, a friend and fellow colleague in the Navy and at Rockwell, Scott became immersed in the IBD method of picking stocks and following the market's trend.Scott — who is featured in the recent book ""How to Make Money in Stocks Success Stories: New and Advanced Investors Share Their Winning Secrets"" — became an IBD subscriber sometime between late 2000 and 2001. Then he attended a full-day IBD workshop in Los Angeles.After that, he decided to invest seriously in his education. He's attended every level of IBD workshop since, from the introductory one to Market School.Through these workshops, and by chatting with IBD founder Bill O'Neil, Scott was struck by the fact ""that he always used weekly charts to make his points.""Scott also learned not to fear buying top-rated stocks that gap up right at the breakout.Sometimes, a powerful market leader will gap up in price and automatically surge more than 5% or 10% past the proper base entry on good news.In a poor market, such price gaps tend to get filled. But if the market is in a solid uptrend, Scott has found that the companies with the fastest growth in sales and earnings become a magnet for institutional investors.On March 10, 2011, Green Mountain Coffee blasted 41% to 61.71. (1) Volume shot up to 42 million shares, the heaviest amount in more than a year. (2) The excellent action followed the Keurig system maker's breakout — also on a gap up — from a two-month base in February.In the March 11 newspaper, Green Mountain was featured right at the top of the Stocks On The Move table for Nasdaq issues. It boasted a 97 Composite Rating, a 99 EPS, a 98 RS, and a B for Accumulation-Distribution.Scott said he did not buy on that day because the market was in a correction. Over the next several sessions, though, Green Mountain refused to budge lower. Scott began buying shares four sessions later on March 16.Scott bought more shares when the stock gapped up again, this time vaulting more than 18% on May 4. Like in March, Green Mountain did not even come close to filling the upward gap.He fashioned a gain of nearly 50% on his initial shares in the position by using the 10-week moving average as a strength gauge.During the run, the stock held nicely above this key support level. But by summer's end, Scott noticed the action got choppy. He sold the stock at 90.62 when Green Mountain sliced through the 10-week line (3) and closed below it for the first time since the early 2011 breakout.""It seemed to be trading a little looser,"" the U.C. Berkeley physics grad said. ""It used to respect the 10-week line, then it stopped.""Google (GOOG) was another solid winner in Scott's portfolio, although he says he got ""only 50% of the Google move, where there was a lot more money to make.""The big-cap tech roared out of a narrow consolidation on Sept. 15, 2004, not long after a key market follow-through and after its market debut at 85 on Aug. 19. (4)Scott didn't buy at the IPO-base entry point of 113.58, though, because he didn't know how to interpret such unusually narrow patterns. Indeed, Google's IPO base was too short to be a flat base or a cup base. But the company had superior fundamentals. Its Web search engine represented the N in CAN SLIM.""I now use it as the quintessential IPO base. It's the model,"" said Scott. He grabbed shares as Google broke out again in April 2005.Scott sharpened his knowledge in buying, holding and selling by attending the Santa Monica, Calif., Meetup group from 2003.

6251,GOOG,"With its Big Data crunching and shareable online charts, recent IPO Tableau Software (DATA) is ""reshaping the analytics market,"" says Pacific Crest Securities analyst Jesse Hulsing in a new research note initiating coverage.But investors apparently already think that: As Hulsing writes, the company's ""high-growth, market-leader potential"" is reflected in its current stock price, and he rates the stock sector perform, or hold.Tableau shares were down 2.5% in afternoon trading in the stock market Monday, but at 61.40 are still almost double the $31 IPO price. The stock debuted May 17.The company has an online platform for turning data into all sorts of chart visualizations, using a freemium business model: Some things are free for some users while other features come at a price. The company makes most of its money serving the Big Data analysis and business intelligence (BI) needs of corporations. It says it has more than 12,000 customer accounts. But the Seattle company notes that tens of thousands of people use the public part of its services to share data in their blogs and websites.""Tableau can disrupt and expand the $12.8 billion BI and analytics market,"" Hulsing said in a Monday research note. ""Our conversations with customers, partners and competitors indicate significant demand for products that empower more users to leverage analytics to support day-to-day business processes and decision making.""Tableau goes up against some offerings from business software firms IBM (IBM), Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP). Hulsing writes that Tableau Software's products let nontechnical business users analyze business data and create analytic applications ""with less help from the IT department relative to most legacy BI and analytics products."" And he says that many organizations have yet to adopt tools like those from Tableau, which ""spreads almost virally"" once adopted.As to the kind of things a business user can do, Hulsing mentions as examples exploring Web traffic data in order to understand customer behavior and managing sales pipelines.Before its IPO, the social media buzz about Tableau Software introduced it as an online platform for readily building all sorts of charts from spreadsheets, and then sharing them easily. It provided a modern, cloud computing twist on the kinds of things Microsoft's (MSFT) Excel program handles. Google (GOOG) Sheets and Google Charts do that as well, but Tableau has heavily emphasized the social-sharing approach. It markets Tableau Desktop as business analytics anyone can use, Tableau Server as a Web-based business intelligence platform and Tableau Public, for storytelling on the Web.Tableau joined the Russell Global Index and Russell 3000 Index on June 28. It's slated to report Q2 financial results after the market close Aug. 8. The stock has a 58 Composite Rating, out of a possible 99, from IBD.Related: New Analyst Reports Weigh In On Hot Tech IPOs.

"
6255,GOOG,"Executives at Google have been in talks with European regulators for about seven months, and the first reports of a possible settlement go back nearly that far. Now, European regulators say a settlement — or a ruling — is expected in early this year.

6317,GOOG,"Long-term pyramiding in a true leader can help you build staggering profits while limiting your downside exposure.Savvy investors and more than a few massive funds have long relied on this simple technique to enhance their own portfolios.Pyramiding gets its name from the ancient tombs of Egypt: They're wide at the base and taper off at the top. That's what your position in a great stock that has a long run ultimately will look like.First, find a fantastic stock that's embarking on a long run to much higher prices. Let the IBD 50, Research Tables and other market features be your guide.While just a few of your stock choices will likely end up being a Google (GOOG) or a Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR), it does happen. For that rare occasion when it all comes together, take advantage.Establish your initial position. Find that first-stage breakout and do what you've been learning to do.Let's say you bought 1,000 shares of Green Mountain in November 2006 at 45.22. 1 It broke out from a 27-week saucer in screaming volume. Lovely.Green Mountain advanced, then paused long enough to build a flat base. You're watching carefully and you add, say 20% of the size of that first position, to your holdings in January 2007, as it triggers its 53.70 buy point. 2Ultimately, the size of the follow-on buy depends on your level of conviction and comfort level. Just make sure it's smaller than the original stake.You also should raise your mental stop price on your initial position to no lower than break-even. You can't let that gain turn into a loss. In this way, you've added to your total investment but enjoy less downside exposure.Four months later, you add another smaller wad of shares as Green Mountain pushed above a 66.10 cup-with-handle entry. 3 You're also raising your stops on your older, profitable shares.Green Mountain posted a failed breakout in December 2007. Did you buy into it? You could have, with 100 shares, or 10% of your initial buy. No great harm. You wouldn't lose more than 8% on that last purchase.And, assuming you notice the serious sell signals in January (such as a high-volume drop below the 10-week moving average), you would have sold your entire stake for a very nifty overall gain.

6331,GOOG,"Microsoft has something of an unhealthy fixation when it comes to Google. It's pushing antitrust cases against Google with regulatory agencies in the U.S. and Europe and frequently knocks its rival publicly when it has the chance. The two companies have been at each other's throats for years, but have little to show for all their posturing.Microsoft (MSFT) has made its mission to educate the world about how evil Google (GOOG) is.That's the unspoken message behind the desktop software giant's latest salvo this week against the Web search leader.Microsoft on Wednesday launched a marketing campaign designed to inform people about Google's practice of searching the contents of Gmail users' email to sell and target ads. Microsoft is advertising its new Outlook.com as an alternative, saying it doesn't go through the content of users' email to show ads.""If you write a friend to let her know you are separating from your husband, Google sells ads against this information to divorce lawyers, who post ads alongside it,"" Microsoft said in a press release. ""Or if you ask a friend for vacation suggestions, Google uses this information to target you with ads from travel agencies or airlines that want your business.""Google has been open about this aspect of Gmail and says the system is automated, so no humans read your email, Bloomberg reported. The targeted ads allow Google to offer Gmail for free, a company spokesman said.Microsoft's attacks on Google direct people to its anti-Google website called Scroogled. There, visitors are encouraged to sign a petition to tell Google to stop going through personal emails to sell ads.Microsoft has slammed Google before for scanning user emails, most notably with its parody video Gmail Man in July 2011. It followed up that video in February 2012 with another called ""Googlighting,"" which mocked Google Docs, which competes with Microsoft's Office 365 productivity suite.Microsoft launched its Scroogled website during the holiday season to criticize Google Shopping for skewing search results to its advertisers.

6350,GOOG,"For Scotty Parrish, Facebook (FB) was a literal lifeline.
"
6351,GOOG,"The Kansas City, Mo., resident and writer spent the last three years of his life being ravaged by the symptoms of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, otherwise known as Lou Gehrig's Disease. His speech abilities disappeared, but his hands worked until his death in 2010 at the age of 48, and during those painful years, Facebook was his primary window into the world.
"
6352,GOOG,"He posted updates about his condition, shared his final experiences and communicated with friends who otherwise would have been out of reach. And when he could sense his time was coming and he shared as much on Facebook, he received more than 100 posts from loved ones saying their good-byes, every one of which his family read aloud to him.
"
6353,GOOG,"Then, after his death, Scotty Parrish's Facebook page became his world's window into him. For instance, just before he died, he'd given his prized golf clubs to a friend's teenage daughter, and when she later won her first high school tournament with them, the friend posted, ""Scotty, Alex won with your clubs today."" There's little doubt that being able to do so provided some level of consolation to the friend, not to mention Parrish's family.
"
6354,GOOG,"Yet a closer look at posthumous Facebook pages reveals that the window into the deceased is more like a crack. In Parrish's case, his ""memorialized"" page remains, allowing those who knew him to post tributes and remembrances on his wall. But when his sister, Rhonda Parrish, wants to look back over her brother's posts, she can only access a small, random sampling. Facebook won't allow her or other loved ones to see any more.
"
6355,GOOG,"The company also won't provide digital downloads of a deceased user's data to next of kin.
"
6356,GOOG,"It's something Rhonda Parrish would like to see change. She's well aware that countless details of her brother's struggle, all painstakingly documented on Facebook, might be gone forever. She hopes that stories like hers might cause people to put a lot more thought into the topic, and perhaps lead to social media data one day becoming part of a person's estate.
"
6357,GOOG,"""You'd have their whole life at their fingertips,"" said Rhonda Parrish. ""We should make sure people can get to it later.""
"
6358,GOOG,"Death and social media don't have a long history together. LinkedIn (LNKD), the granddaddy of today's social media sites, was founded in 2002, Facebook started two years later, and Google's (GOOG) Google+ was introduced in 2011. Most users haven't had enough time to accumulate the kinds of histories surviving relatives would be desperate to retain. But what about in 20 years?
"
6359,GOOG,"Family History Archives
"
6360,GOOG,"Facebook is likely to become the biggest family history archive ever, and yet there are no laws shaping this end-of-life conundrum. Instead, social media sites are left to establish and enforce their own policies.
"
6361,GOOG,"""The legal landscape is pretty much barren,"" said Chris Pothering, a partner with the Seattle law firm Short Cressman & Burgess. She has blogged about social media estate planning.
"
6362,GOOG,"Pothering says that while the law says that estates are entitled to the deceased's digital assets, the contracts social media sites require are specifically between the site and the user, not the estate, resulting in what Pothering terms ""conflict.""
"
6363,GOOG,"The sites — which have often come under fire for perceived violations of consumer privacy — say they're standing firmly behind the privacy rights of the dead. Sharing their data, they say, would violate their agreements with deceased users.
"
6364,GOOG,"""In those rare cases where the family of the deceased seeks access to the contents of their loved one's account, we will respond in a way that is sensitive to their loss and is consistent with applicable law, which limits a provider's ability to disclose data to third parties,"" Andrew Noyes, Facebook's manager of public policy communications, said via email.
"
6365,GOOG,"LinkedIn spokeswoman Erin O'Harra was more direct in her email response. ""We do not make a practice of making the data available to other people,"" wrote O'Harra. ""Our belief is that a member's professional profile belongs to that person only.""
"
6366,GOOG,"Google, meanwhile, will release a user's data to an ""authorized representative,"" but only after completion of a two-part process that includes obtaining a court order. And even then, the company maintains that it can decline the request out of concerns for the user's privacy, and that ""we will not be able to share further details about the account or discuss our decision.""
"
6367,GOOG,"(All of the social media sites contacted for this story, while providing comments from spokespersons, declined requests to interview executives.)
"
6368,GOOG,"Social media sites haven't been acting in a total vacuum, as a handful of states have attempted to define the after-life rights to digital assets more clearly, Pothering says. Connecticut and Rhode Island have a law governing email accounts; Oklahoma and Idaho have laws addressing social media, microblogging and email; and Oregon, Massachusetts and Nebraska are considering all-encompassing laws this year.
"
6369,GOOG,"Digital Asset Estate Law
"
6370,GOOG,"But Pothering says trying to legislate an evolving target like digital asset estate law even at the federal level is proving to be an uphill battle. ""Technology moves faster than the law,"" she said. ""Even if we were able to pass a law this year, five years from now we'll be behind again.""
"
6371,GOOG,"Given the movement on the state level, the legal community is looking to guide state laws via the Uniform Law Commission, which has been helping states draft more consistent laws for more than 120 years. Pothering says the group is working on a model social media estate law that states will be able to use as a template for legislating the handling of the digital assets of the deceased.
"
6372,GOOG,"Laws aside, Pothering says enabling social media users to assign ownership of their pages to their estates would help those families that want to retain their loved ones' social media records. But it's not enough to put such instructions in one's will, she says, as doing so does nothing to address the conflict with the social media site's contract.
"
6373,GOOG,"""Maybe that needs to be something that the public needs to push, so that the terms and conditions can be changed,"" she said. ""They should allow for the option. That would allow the providers the legal right to (share the data).""
"
6374,GOOG,"Rhonda Parrish certainly wishes her brother Scotty had had that option. She says she would have liked a digital download of his Facebook history, especially one part of it.

"
6420,GOOG,"That decline at Meetic stems from a shift in strategy, he says. IAC's dating sites seek long-term subscribers, or those that sign up because Match.com and Meetic are better products. As a result, IAC in Q1 cut marketing costs for its dating websites.

6427,GOOG,"Shares of TripAdvisor were up more than 17% in early trading Wednesday, at an all-time high, after the company late Tuesday reported Q1 sales and earnings that handily beat analyst forecasts.For the first quarter, TripAdvisor said it earned 35 cents a share on a GAAP basis, unchanged from 35 cents in the year-earlier period but 6 cents higher than the average estimate of 17 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Q1 sales rose 33% to a record $183.7 million vs. views of $174.40 million.Minus items, TripAdvisor said it earned 38 cents a share, unchanged from a year earlier but 4 cents higher than analyst expectations.The company didn't issue a specific numerical forecast for the current quarter or the full year. But TripAdvisor CFO Julie Bradley said on a conference call with analysts late Tuesday that the company expects 2012 revenue growth ""to trend above the midpoint"" of its earlier issued prediction of 2012 revenue growth in the ""mid- to high teens.""Nomura Securities International analyst Brian Nowak said the beat was driven by a higher-than-expected 20% increase in cost-per-click, or CPC, advertising revenue. He says this was primarily due to larger-than-expected revenue from companies other than Expedia (EXPE), which spun off TripAdvisor in an IPO in December. The company said non-Expedia revenue surged 40% in Q1. Some analysts expected a lower figure.Nowak is keeping his neutral rating on the stock but has raised his target price to 34 from 32 on the company's more upbeat revenue guidance for 2012. Shares are trading Wednesday near 43.JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth credited the beat to hotel shoppers' strength, which lifted CPC revenue growth, as well as a generally more favorable spending environment for online travel agencies. He also said improvements in TripAdvisor's website lured more traffic in Q1.Anmuth is keeping his neutral rating on the stock but raised his price target to 38 from 29.Analysts also said an expected drop in advertising revenue from Expedia was not as deep as expected. TripAdvisor said related-party revenue from Expedia totaled $51.6 million in Q1, a decrease of $2.4 million, or 4%, from a year earlier vs. the first quarter of 2011.JPMorgan's Anmuth expects TripAdvisor stock to be strong in the near term as Q1 results ""should quiet most concerns"" related to Expedia spending, competition from Google's (GOOG) rival travel review business and flagging CPC revenue.

Rowe Price (TROW) — featured in this column on Jan. 24 and Tuesday, respectively — as well as Motorola Solutions (MSI).Motorola, one of the nation's oldest technology companies, changed its name to Motorola Solutions in 2011 while spinning off its mobile phone and set-top box operations as Motorola Mobility, now part of Google (GOOG).Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola Solutions makes telecom equipment that ranges from two-way radios to bar-code scanners, selling the gear to businesses and government agencies. It has billed itself as the ""worldwide leader in mission-critical and business-critical applications.""The company has delivered three straight quarters of big growth in EPS, with gains of 30%, 27% and 26%. Its quarterly revenue increases have been more modest, coming in between 3% and 8% over the past three quarters.Motorola Solutions sports a strong up-down volume ratio and a B+ for its IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating — signaling that some big investors are buying shares. However, throughout 2012, the number of U.S. mutual and hedge funds with a stake stayed flat or even declined.In terms of chart action, Motorola Solutions is somewhat extended after rallying off support at its 10-week moving average in late January, when the company posted its latest quarterly results.You also could view the stock as still in a possible buying range after etching a three-weeks-tight pattern with a buy point at 59.58. But note that volume wasn't as strong as you generally want to see with a breakout. Also, the stock tends to trade calmly, which makes the tight formation less distinctive.Motorola Solutions pays a quarterly dividend of 26 cents per share, having raised its payout last year from 22 cents per share. That works out to an annualized yield of about 1.8%.

6467,GOOG,"If you're looking for stocks that provide a dividend, growth potential and steadier action, the IBD Big Cap 20 is worth checking out.The latest lineup, which appeared in Tuesday's IBD, offers a few stocks that fit the bill.They include BlackRock (BLK) and T. Rowe Price (TROW) — featured in this column on Jan. 24 and Tuesday, respectively — as well as Motorola Solutions (MSI).Motorola, one of the nation's oldest technology companies, changed its name to Motorola Solutions in 2011 while spinning off its mobile phone and set-top box operations as Motorola Mobility, now part of Google (GOOG).Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola Solutions makes telecom equipment that ranges from two-way radios to bar-code scanners, selling the gear to businesses and government agencies. It has billed itself as the ""worldwide leader in mission-critical and business-critical applications.""The company has delivered three straight quarters of big growth in EPS, with gains of 30%, 27% and 26%. Its quarterly revenue increases have been more modest, coming in between 3% and 8% over the past three quarters.Motorola Solutions sports a strong up-down volume ratio and a B+ for its IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating — signaling that some big investors are buying shares. However, throughout 2012, the number of U.S. mutual and hedge funds with a stake stayed flat or even declined.In terms of chart action, Motorola Solutions is somewhat extended after rallying off support at its 10-week moving average in late January, when the company posted its latest quarterly results.You also could view the stock as still in a possible buying range after etching a three-weeks-tight pattern with a buy point at 59.58. But note that volume wasn't as strong as you generally want to see with a breakout. Also, the stock tends to trade calmly, which makes the tight formation less distinctive.Motorola Solutions pays a quarterly dividend of 26 cents per share, having raised its payout last year from 22 cents per share. That works out to an annualized yield of about 1.8%.

6469,GOOG,"Shares of Expedia rose 4% in after-hours trading Tuesday, after the online travel firm posted a record increase in hotel rooms booked and handily beat Q4 sales forecasts.The company's earnings per share, however, missed Wall Street's forecast.Bellevue, Wash.-based Expedia (EXPE) reported EPS minus items of 63 cents, up 9% but shy of the 65 cents analysts had expected.Sales jumped 24% to $974.9 million from $787.1 million, the company reported. Analysts had been expecting $930.7 million, according to Thomson Reuters.Besides sales, Expedia's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, beat expectations, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Naved Khan wrote in a research note. He rates the stock a buy. Expedia said EBITDA rose 14% to $184.6 million.While the average daily rate for a hotel room booked through Expedia fell 3%, room nights booked jumped 33% from the year-earlier quarter, which the company said was a record. U.S. room nights rose less, at 19%, but that was the most in two years, the company said.This also marked the fourth straight quarter of accelerating year-over-year sales growth, from 7% in Q4 2011 to 12%, 14%, 17% and now 24%.""Much of our improved results have been the result of our investment in technology and content,"" Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told analysts on a conference call.But he also said the company expects ""competitive intensity"" to increase both in the U.S. and abroad.Expedia's expenses rose 26% in Q4, a quicker pace than its sales. That's expected to continue throughout 2013, ""especially in the first half,"" Mark Okerstrom, Expedia's chief financial officer, said on the call. Expedia doesn't give financial guidance, but Okerstrom said marketing expenses and costs will rise more quickly than revenue.Technology and content led Q4 growth with a 32% cost increase, the company said. That spending helped Hotels.com boost its ""production speed"" by 30% and develop a new Expedia Facebook (FB) app, the company said.""Please note that as we introduce new technology, we also experience significantly higher depreciation expenses,"" Okerstrom said.Expedia is the No. 1 online travel company by visitors, ahead of No. 2 Priceline (PCLN).Expedia had 16 million unique U.S. visitors in December, says market tracker ComScore, to Priceline's 12.3 million. But Expedia's unique U.S. visitors that month rose just 3% year over year, to 19% for Priceline, says Susquehanna Financial analyst Deepak Mathivanan.Expedia, Priceline and other online travel sites face a growth threat from Google (GOOG), Ascendiant Capital Markets analyst Edward Woo wrote in a research note last month.Google's 2011 acquisition of flight information software provider ITA Software, a $700 million deal that regulators reviewed for nine months before granting approval, signaled a ""big push into travel information and commerce,"" Woo pointed out.Keeping Eye On GoogleGoogle probably won't become an online travel agency anytime soon, Woo wrote last month, but he also said ""Google could use its dominance in search to direct traffic to its own products, which may lower traffic to Expedia websites.""The U.S. Federal Trade Commission in December ended an investigation by determining Google doesn't break any antitrust laws by at times favoring its own content in search results, if that content is pertinent to the search.Expedia is keeping an eye on Google, Khosrowshahi told analysts. ""We'll be working with them, while watching to see how their products evolve,"" he said.Expedia's also taking an ""aggressive"" stance on growing traffic in Europe, Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju wrote in a note, signaled by its December deal to buy a majority stake in German online travel metasearch firm Trivago, expected to close before July. Trivago could help Expedia gain ground vs. Priceline, Ju wrote in a December note. And since Trivago is a ""known brand"" in much of Europe, it won't be ""as dependent on Google for its organic traffic,"" he said.Expedia, though, already has been growing more quickly in Europe than in the U.S. International sales jumped 35% in Q4, while U.S. sales increased 15%.Hotel revenue jumped 20% in 2012, but flight sales fell 7% because ticket prices fell about 14% from 2011, Expedia said.Expedia shares rose 3.6% in Tuesday's regular session to their highest close since August 2003. Shares are up nearly 14% this year.

6484,GOOG,"Google Maps, ads on social networks like Facebook and even — looking down the road — Apple's Siri voice assistant are all seen as catalysts for a Federal Trade Commission warning to search engines.
"
6485,GOOG,"Search engines aren't doing a good enough job telling consumers when they're being served paid ads, a problem that is growing alongside skyrocketing mobile and targeted ads, the FTC said in letters sent late Tuesday to search engines.
"
6486,GOOG,"""Regardless of the precise form search may take in the future, the long-standing principle of making advertising distinguishable from natural results will remain applicable"" in mobile apps, social media and other platforms, Mary Engle, the FTC's associate director of advertising practices, wrote in the letter sent to the search firms .

6487,GOOG,"This update to a similar 2002 letter was sent to Google (GOOG), Yahoo (YHOO), AOL (AOL), Microsoft (MSFT) and 20 other search engines. The FTC say it's seen a ""decline in compliance"" in keeping paid ads out of ""natural"" results.
"
6488,GOOG,"The ""guidance"" letter in part stems from ads being more seamlessly integrated into content. The FTC doesn't mention any apps by name, but it warns that not clearly identifying ads on a social network like Facebook (FB) or on a ""voice assistant"" like Apple's (AAPL) Siri might violate the act that requires that consumers know when they're seeing an ad.

6548,GOOG,"The big growth engine for IAC's search segment is Mindspark, says Benchmark Co. analyst James Dobson. Mindspark creates and distributes downloadable toolbars through which users can access search services. Also, applicants can express themselves and interact online.

"
6551,GOOG,"""IAC, through Mindspark, has been very successful in driving consumer downloads,"" said Dobson. ""Every time a consumer downloads a toolbar to do a search, it comes with search ads, which are hosted by IAC. The toolbar's lifetime value is fairly long. IAC has found a way to continually create new products that refresh the constant downloads of these toolbars.""
"
6552,GOOG,"Rice concurs that the toolbar business has been a big growth driver for the search segment.
"
6553,GOOG,"But, he said: ""It will become more challenging for them to grow the search business, particularly the toolbar business, at the same rate, given the strong growth over the last year. The company indicated on its 1Q12 earnings call that it expects search revenue to be flat in Q2, Q3, and Q4. However, we believe that this growth expectation could prove conservative.""
"
6554,GOOG,"Another challenge is to reverse the decline in subscribers at Meetic.
"
6555,GOOG,"""Their goal is to return it to growth by year end,"" said Dobson. ""We feel fairly confident they will be able to do it, given their track record with their domestic business.""Love is in the air 24/7 at IAC/InterActive  (IACI).If not at IAC, where else? Romance is big business at the owner of the No. 1 U.S. dating website, Match.com, and other personal meeting sites like Chemistry.com and OkCupid.com.And it keeps getting bigger.IAC has been busy tying the knot with other dating sites, thanks to the handiwork of media mogul and Chairman Barry Diller.In last year's third quarter, the company bought a 20% interest in China-based online matchmaking service Zhenai and upped its stake in Europe's No. 1 online dating site, Meetic, to 81%.IAC's online love connections have really struck a chord with the singles crowd. The company's Match unit, which includes all of IAC's online dating properties, saw first-quarter sales pop 56% vs. a year ago to $174.3 million, or 27% of total sales. The number of paid subscribers grew 47% to 2.8 million.Core BusinessIts core personals business, which includes Match.com U.S., Chemistry.com and the People Media unit's targeted dating sites, grew sales 17% to $108.9 million, driven by a 12% boost in paid subscribers to 1.8 million.IAC is feeling the love on other fronts. Diller, who owns all of IAC's class B common stock and 43.4% of the company's voting power, has built a network of more than 50 Internet businesses across 30 countries. IAC's biggest revenue generator is its Search segment, which consists of destination sites like Ask.com and Dictionary.com and its Mindspark digital consumer products.IAC also has media brands such as Vimeo and Newsweek/Daily Beast as well as other sites, like restaurant guide Urbanspoon.The segment's first-quarter sales grew 47% to $343.2 million, or 55% of total sales.But IAC's online personals segment is its most profitable business, with the highest operating income before amortization margin, says Needham analyst Kerry Rice.""They've really done a good job of consolidating the online dating market and gaining share, ""said Rice.""They're the only company out there with the currency to make acquisitions. That gives them a significant competitive advantage.""IAC has also done a good job assembling an array of personals sites beyond Match.com, says Rice.The lineup includes People Media's more than 20 targeted dating sites, such as OurTime.com, which caters to singles over 50. Another personals site is advertising-supported OkCupid.com.But Match.com, which pioneered online dating in 1995 as the first dating site, remains a powerful force in the online dating scene. It operates subscription-based online dating sites in 25 countries, eight languages and across five continents.And it's not resting on its laurels. Soon Match.com will try to forge love connections offline.This month, Match.com will start to roll out the Stir, a service that brings single people together in organized local events. The events, available to Match.com subcribers and their friends, range from large-scale happy hours in a bar to more intimate gatherings, such as cooking classes.Each event is customized through Match.com's group matching algorithms in terms of age, gender and interests.Subscribers can learn about and sign up for the gatherings on the website.

6616,GOOG,"The coffee maker has agreed to pay about $16 million a year in U.K. taxes for the next two years.Goldman Sachs (GS) bowed to pressure from the Bank of England and British media and said it will not postpone annual bonus payments so employees could save money on taxes.Goldman is just the latest of several U.S. companies who have come under attack in the Britain for their efforts to avoid paying taxes.In December, a parliament accounting committee criticized multinationals like Starbucks (SBUX), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG) for taking advantage of loopholes to avoid paying taxes.According to sources, Goldman was considering delaying bonus payments until after April 6, the day the U.K.'s top income tax rate will drop to 45% from 50%.Goldman's plan was harshly attacked by U.K. newspapers, and perhaps more notably by an official with the Bank of England.""I find it a bit depressing that people who earn so much seem to think that it's even more exciting to adjust the timing of it to get the benefit of the lower tax rate,"" Bank of England Gov. Mervyn King told a panel of British lawmakers last week.The Daily Mirror and Times of London played up editorials criticizing Goldman's plan.Seeking to quell critics, Goldman announced it would not push back bonus payments.Its shares edge up 0.5% intraday Tuesday.Starbucks last month, after being berated by U.K. lawmakers and drawing public protests, promised to pay more taxes in the U.K. In the past 14 years, the coffeehouse giant has only paid $13.8 million in U.K. taxes for the 700 shops it operates in the country.

6617,GOOG,"So, what about Day 2?Review website Yelp (YELP) was down more than 8% shortly after midday Monday on its second day of trading after a sizzling stock market debut in its IPO on Friday, when the stock popped 64%.Yelp's stock, which analysts say has been lifted in part by optimism ahead of Facebook's IPO expected within two months, priced at $15 late Thursday, raising $107 million for the company. It priced above its expected pricing range of $12 to $14 a share.Analysts say another reason Yelp jumped so fast in its debut is that it's a well-known brand, and many users of the site wanted to buy some shares. At last report, Yelp said it had 66 million unique users.But many analysts are cautious. Yelp hasn't yet made money. And it will face big rivals in the fight for online ads, companies such as Facebook and Google (GOOG), among many others.Morningstar analyst Rick Summer wrote in an investor note on Saturday that he's concerned ""local businesses may not see enough value in (Yelp's) advertising platform to increase spending and justify"" the price of the IPO. He also sees a ""dual threat"" from Google and Facebook grabbing more local advertising from Yelp, limiting its growth and profitability.Other social networking stocks were struggling Monday on a bad day for the market overall. Angie's List (ANGI), a professional services review site, fell nearly 4% in early-afternoon trading. Zynga (ZNGA) slid more than 5% to 13.92 after J.P. Morgan downgraded the Web gaming firm to neutral on valuation reasons. LinkedIn (LNKD) lost about 1%.RELATED: Yelp IPO Pops 64% As Stock Debuts; Facebook Nears

6707,GOOG,"So, what about Day 2?Review website Yelp (YELP) was down more than 8% shortly after midday Monday on its second day of trading after a sizzling stock market debut in its IPO on Friday, when the stock popped 64%.Yelp's stock, which analysts say has been lifted in part by optimism ahead of Facebook's IPO expected within two months, priced at $15 late Thursday, raising $107 million for the company. It priced above its expected pricing range of $12 to $14 a share.Analysts say another reason Yelp jumped so fast in its debut is that it's a well-known brand, and many users of the site wanted to buy some shares. At last report, Yelp said it had 66 million unique users.But many analysts are cautious. Yelp hasn't yet made money. And it will face big rivals in the fight for online ads, companies such as Facebook and Google (GOOG), among many others.Morningstar analyst Rick Summer wrote in an investor note on Saturday that he's concerned ""local businesses may not see enough value in (Yelp's) advertising platform to increase spending and justify"" the price of the IPO. He also sees a ""dual threat"" from Google and Facebook grabbing more local advertising from Yelp, limiting its growth and profitability.Other social networking stocks were struggling Monday on a bad day for the market overall. Angie's List (ANGI), a professional services review site, fell nearly 4% in early-afternoon trading. Zynga (ZNGA) slid more than 5% to 13.92 after J.P.

6823,GOOG,"Sometimes great stocks approaching their peaks flash too many sell signs to ignore. Sometimes they flash subtle ones.One such sign is a fast series of big stock splits. Many investors see splits bullishly. Companies use stock splits to lower share prices. But you should treat them with caution.Theoretically, lower prices mean more demand. A 2-for-1 split halves the price of a stock from $100 to $50 while doubling the number of shares outstanding. Investors who previously couldn't afford a share might now be tempted. (Companies can effect splits in ratios of up to 10-to-1 or more.) But a split does not change the current value of the company in any way.There are reasons that companies like Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG) and  Priceline.com (PCLN) have share prices of $439 to $820. (The grandpappy of the stock split resistance is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), with its Class A share price now topping $160,000.)These stocks attract investors willing to pay for quality. That might narrow the potential audience, but it tends to increase the smart-money sponsors that are backing the stock. Stock splits attract smaller investors. In effect, they change the neighborhood.To be sure, early stock splits are often not a problem.Stocks can and often do move higher after initial splits — particularly when they happen early in a bull market. But problems occur when companies enact multiple big splits — say, a 2-for-1 and a 3-for-1 — in a one- to two-year period.This floods the market with a company's shares. IBD research shows a stock will often reach a price peak around its second or third split. Research also shows that only 18% of history's biggest winners had even a single stock split in the year preceding the start of their run.One good example of a hot stock tripping on a stock split is  Monster Beverage (MNST), once named Hansen Natural. Monster, one of the original energy drink success stories, jetted more than 4,000% from 2003 to 2006.The company enacted its first stock split in August 2005 (1) , just a month after the stock first touched $100 per share (chart is split-adjusted). The stock's response shows why a single stock split, like most sell signals, is not a sign to cut and run.Just after the split, Monster shares dropped through their 10-week line in heavy trade, but stopped a short distance below the line. The stock formed a new base, then broke out and moved higher.The second, truly monster 4-to-1 split, occurred just after the stock punched through the 210 pre-adjusted price level in July 2006. (2) Shares responded immediately with a pullback to the 10-week line in heavy trade. Monster dived a few weeks later en route to a 53% correction.

7040,GOOG,"LAS VEGAS — When Microsoft (MSFT) finally enters the tablet business later this year with Windows 8, it may find itself shut out of a market ruled by Apple's (AAPL)  iPad and Google (GOOG) Android devices.
"
7041,GOOG,"Industry leaders at the Consumer Electronics Show this week debated the role Microsoft could play in tablets. Some said Microsoft could carve out a niche selling tablets to corporations and other enterprise users. Others said it was game over for Microsoft.
"
7042,GOOG,"""Android is just getting started. It's going to be very dominant,"" said Bill Gurley, a general partner with Benchmark Capital. Since Google's open-source Android operating system is free to use, that's sparked a lot of experimentation and cost reduction, he says.

7079,GOOG,"What do Larry Page, Sergei Brin, Jeff Bezos and Jimmy Wales have in common? The founders of Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Wikipedia spent their early learning years in Montessori schools.
"
7080,GOOG,"Learning experts say those formative years at Montessori — a private organization whose tuition runs from $7,000 for full-day preschool to $12,000 for grade 6 — were key to their wildly successful careers.
"
7081,GOOG,"""The greater freedom afforded to children in these nontraditional, learner-centered educational philosophies ensures that their natural instincts to explore and create are not constantly being suppressed,"" Bhaskar Krishnamachari, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Southern California and blogger of An Academic's Freedom, told IBD. ""The more freedom they experience as children, the more in-tune and connected grown-ups can be with their naturally inventive and exploratory instincts.""
"
7082,GOOG,"Is it too late for adults to benefit from a learning method mostly used with children? No, said Krishnamachari: ""I think it's not so much a matter of offering additional school-like training as it is a matter of how the workplace environment is set up, to allow play, interaction, autonomy, and encourage a sense of personal ownership.""
"
7083,GOOG,"• Stimulate senses. Montessori children learn grammar via colored shapes representing nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. The idea is that we all learn differently, so the materials used in teaching children and adults must stimulate their eyes, ears and hands. ""There are many different ways people learn: some auditory, some visual and some are tactile learners,"" said Dayani Nawagamuwa, founder of Hill Point Montessori in West Hills, Calif. ""If materials are presented to stimulate all senses, adults are able to absorb better as they focus with interest.""
"
7084,GOOG,"• Self-direct. Montessori students research subjects and write reports in their own way, Nawagamuwa said: ""They are thinking outside the box. This way of education will motivate students to think creatively and invent.""
"
7085,GOOG,"For adults in the workplace, Krishnamachari said employers should seek ways to offer greater flexibility: ""Empower employees at all levels to have a greater say in what they do and how they go about doing it (so long as they can make a convincing case to their colleagues that they are doing something meaningful and useful).""
"
7086,GOOG,"• Loosen up. At free schools like Summerhill in England and Sudbury Valley in Massachusetts, play is encouraged to boost creativity.
"
7087,GOOG,"Laid back is also the order of the day at Google and Facebook (FB) headquarters. Krishnamachari applauds this sense of playfulness: ""Workplace environments that are relaxed and informal and allow employees opportunities to show their personal side ... are likely to foster greater creativity.""
"
7088,GOOG,"• Open dialogue. Montessori children are encouraged to speak their mind and make logical, convincing arguments. They are taught early on that their opinions count and deserve respect. Try that at work, says Krishnamachari said: ""Brainstorming sessions in which ideas are solicited without fear of judgment from peers and superiors are one way to unleash and leverage employee creativity.""
"
7089,GOOG,"• Learn from mistakes. By pushing tests, traditional education cultivates a fear of failure, Krishnamachari said: ""In contrast, learner-centered educational approaches try to ensure that mistakes are not seen as penalties to be avoided but rather as opportunities for growth . .. (likelier) to result in fearless, self-motivated individuals who can make bold and innovative discoveries.""What do Larry Page, Sergei Brin, Jeff Bezos and Jimmy Wales have in common? The founders of Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Wikipedia spent their early learning years in Montessori schools.Learning experts say those formative years at Montessori — a private organization whose tuition runs from $7,000 for full-day preschool to $12,000 for grade 6 — were key to their wildly successful careers.""The greater freedom afforded to children in these nontraditional, learner-centered educational philosophies ensures that their natural instincts to explore and create are not constantly being suppressed,"" Bhaskar Krishnamachari, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Southern California and blogger of An Academic's Freedom, told IBD. ""The more freedom they experience as children, the more in-tune and connected grown-ups can be with their naturally inventive and exploratory instincts.""Is it too late for adults to benefit from a learning method mostly used with children? No, said Krishnamachari: ""I think it's not so much a matter of offering additional school-like training as it is a matter of how the workplace environment is set up, to allow play, interaction, autonomy, and encourage a sense of personal ownership.""• Stimulate senses. Montessori children learn grammar via colored shapes representing nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. The idea is that we all learn differently, so the materials used in teaching children and adults must stimulate their eyes, ears and hands. ""There are many different ways people learn: some auditory, some visual and some are tactile learners,"" said Dayani Nawagamuwa, founder of Hill Point Montessori in West Hills, Calif. ""If materials are presented to stimulate all senses, adults are able to absorb better as they focus with interest.""• Self-direct. Montessori students research subjects and write reports in their own way, Nawagamuwa said: ""They are thinking outside the box. This way of education will motivate students to think creatively and invent.""For adults in the workplace, Krishnamachari said employers should seek ways to offer greater flexibility: ""Empower employees at all levels to have a greater say in what they do and how they go about doing it (so long as they can make a convincing case to their colleagues that they are doing something meaningful and useful).""• Loosen up. At free schools like Summerhill in England and Sudbury Valley in Massachusetts, play is encouraged to boost creativity.Laid back is also the order of the day at Google and Facebook (FB) headquarters. Krishnamachari applauds this sense of playfulness: ""Workplace environments that are relaxed and informal and allow employees opportunities to show their personal side ... are likely to foster greater creativity.""• Open dialogue. Montessori children are encouraged to speak their mind and make logical, convincing arguments. They are taught early on that their opinions count and deserve respect. Try that at work, says Krishnamachari said: ""Brainstorming sessions in which ideas are solicited without fear of judgment from peers and superiors are one way to unleash and leverage employee creativity.""• Learn from mistakes. By pushing tests, traditional education cultivates a fear of failure, Krishnamachari said: ""In contrast, learner-centered educational approaches try to ensure that mistakes are not seen as penalties to be avoided but rather as opportunities for growth . .. (likelier) to result in fearless, self-motivated individuals who can make bold and innovative discoveries.""

7125,GOOG,"The International Consumer Electronics Show, known simply as “CES,” is one of the biggest events in the world of technology. CES has grown in prominence and importance every year since it began back in 1967, and the 2018 iteration is already off to a hot start.Game-changing products, including Bill Gates’ introduction of Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Xbox in 2001, have made their debuts in previous years.

7126,GOOG,"The Senate has finally passed the budget blueprint for fiscal 2018, ironing out difficulties in the path of President Trump’s historic tax reform plan. Trump believes that such an opportunity to benefit the middle class by slashing corporate tax rates comes once in a lifetime. Markets rallied after this development as investors believe that a tax cut will boost the U.S. economy over the long term.Tax Reforms to Boost GDPThe latest report from Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) reveals that the new tax plan will drive the economy to new heights. According to the report, a cut in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% will lift the annual GDP growth rate to as high as 5%; the projected range lies between 3% and 5%.As per Business Insider, the U.S. GDP growth rate was 7.4% in 1984, after which it never touched 5%. In fact, since 1980, the rate crossed the 4.5% mark only thrice. It should be noted that with a lower corporate tax rate, companies will accumulate more disposable income to invest in the domestic market and thereby create more jobs. This will pave the way for further economic growth.Tech & Bank Bigwigs Set to GainAccording to Moody's, as much as $1.3 trillion in cash has been stored by U.S. firms overseas in order to avoid paying the stiff corporate tax rate. The five top cash hoarders in the country — Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report), Alphabet Inc. , Cisco Systems, Inc  and Oracle Corp. (ORCL  -  Free Report)  — have stockpiled 88% of their cash outside the country, notes CNNMoney. A cut in rates will encourage these companies to repatriate cash, boosting the U.S. economy substantially.Banks also bear a huge tax burden. Among all the sectors representing the S&P 1500 index, financials contribute 25% of tax liabilities, per KBW Research. The investment banking firm believes that the tax rate cut will help Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) boost their earnings by 20%.Per Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices, the consumer staples sector paid the second highest taxes in the S&P 500 index last year — at a rate of 29.1%. Thus, lower taxes will massively benefit consumer staples companies like Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report), Unilever PLC (UN  -  Free Report) and Sysco Corp.  (SYY  -  Free Report). Tyson Foods sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Tax Plan Might Increase Debt BurdenThere has been a prolonged debate on whether the baby boomers generation will become a major burden for the Social Security system. Baby boomers are all those who were born between 1946 and 1964, accumulating almost 76 million people at present, according to media resources. Media reports also claim that this generation will make it to the list of full retirement benefits by 2031.Meanwhile, CNBC claims that Trump’s tax reform will lower revenues by $1.5 trillion in the next 10 years for the U.S. government. Investors should know that, according to The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, out of $3.9 trillion spent in fiscal 2016, more than $3.3 trillion was funded by the government. Hence, only a nominal amount was borrowed.However, in the coming years, the government will need to borrow more to support Social Security. In other words, Trump’s tax plan to stimulate the domestic economy will increase the debt burden considerably, raising questions about its sustainability.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

7127,GOOG,"Shares of Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) opened slightly higher on Wednesday as the company looks to rebound from some brief volatility related to hardware concerns in its new Pixel 2 phones.  Nevertheless, investors should certainly still expect the company’s earnings announcement to hog the headlines this week.While a shift to mobile computing once threatened Google’s traditional search business, management has successfully adapted to changing consumer trends by expanding its operations into nearly every corner of the modern tech world.Today, Google and the other subsidiaries under the Alphabet umbrella sit on the cusp of dominance in several booming industries, including cloud computing, mobile payments, ecommerce, and artificial intelligence. Of course, search is still the company’s bread and butter, but there’s plenty more to be excited about if you’re an Alphabet investor right now.Shares of GOOGL have gained nearly 25% year-to-date, and the stock is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). What’s more, Alphabet has met or surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in four out of the five trailing quarters.Heading into Alphabet’s report date, our current consensus estimates are calling for the company to post earnings of $8.43 per share and revenues of $21.94 billion. While GOOGL’s profits are projected to slump about 6.9% year-over-year, the company’s top line growth is expected to hit an impressive 20.1%—underscoring the potential for its expansion efforts to pay off down the line.Of course, earnings and revenue are just two of the many things investors will be looking at when Alphabet reports on Thursday. Check out these three additional things to expect:These important stock drivers are from our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file. These estimates are updated daily and are based on the independent research of expert stock analysts. Learn more here>>>First up, we should note that Google’s advertising revenues are projected to swell by more than 18% in the quarter. Interestingly enough, Google’s ad business has been a cause for some concern over the past few years. Advertisers tend to value mobile ads less, so a shift to a mobile-first world meant lower cost-per-click figures for Google.Nevertheless, growth in total paid clicks has outpaced the decline in cost-per-click and led to rising advertising revenues. Last quarter, Alphabet narrowly edged our consensus estimate in this category and notched growth of 18.4%. If the company’s core business can outperform our expectations again, investors should be ecstatic.Still, Alphabet’s most exciting growth prospects come from its “Google other revenues” category. This unit includes revenues from the company’s Google Play Store, as well as its Google Cloud offerings and hardware initiatives.Based on our latest consensus estimates, we expect Alphabet to report Google other revenues of $3.43 billion. That would represent growth of more than 41% from the $2.43 billion recorded in the year-ago period.Finally, we should see impressive growth in Alphabet’s mysterious “Other Bets” unit. The company uses this segment to lump together its smaller projects, and for the most part, these projects don’t generate much revenue.But some of the Other Bets subsidiaries—including Google Fiber, Nest, and Verily—are adding to Alphabet’s top line. According to our consensus estimates, we expect Alphabet to report Other Bets revenues of $267 million this quarter, up from the $197 million seen last year.Make sure to check back here for our full analysis of Alphabet’s actual results tomorrow!Want more stock market analysis from this author?

What’s more, Alphabet has met or surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in four out of the five trailing quarters.Heading into Alphabet’s report date, our current consensus estimates are calling for the company to post earnings of $8.43 per share and revenues of $21.94 billion. While GOOGL’s profits are projected to slump about 6.9% year-over-year, the company’s top line growth is expected to hit an impressive 20.1%—underscoring the potential for its expansion efforts to pay off down the line.Of course, earnings and revenue are just two of the many things investors will be looking at when Alphabet reports on Thursday. Check out these three additional things to expect:These important stock drivers are from our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file. These estimates are updated daily and are based on the independent research of expert stock analysts. Learn more here>>>First up, we should note that Google’s advertising revenues are projected to swell by more than 18% in the quarter. Interestingly enough, Google’s ad business has been a cause for some concern over the past few years. Advertisers tend to value mobile ads less, so a shift to a mobile-first world meant lower cost-per-click figures for Google.Nevertheless, growth in total paid clicks has outpaced the decline in cost-per-click and led to rising advertising revenues. Last quarter, Alphabet narrowly edged our consensus estimate in this category and notched growth of 18.4%. If the company’s core business can outperform our expectations again, investors should be ecstatic.Still, Alphabet’s most exciting growth prospects come from its “Google other revenues” category. This unit includes revenues from the company’s Google Play Store, as well as its Google Cloud offerings and hardware initiatives.Based on our latest consensus estimates, we expect Alphabet to report Google other revenues of $3.43 billion. That would represent growth of more than 41% from the $2.43 billion recorded in the year-ago period.Finally, we should see impressive growth in Alphabet’s mysterious “Other Bets” unit. The company uses this segment to lump together its smaller projects, and for the most part, these projects don’t generate much revenue.But some of the Other Bets subsidiaries—including Google Fiber, Nest, and Verily—are adding to Alphabet’s top line. According to our consensus estimates, we expect Alphabet to report Other Bets revenues of $267 million this quarter, up from the $197 million seen last year.Make sure to check back here for our full analysis of Alphabet’s actual results tomorrow!Want more stock market analysis from this author?

7129,GOOG,"Move aside traditional bankers, Humanoid Robots are here!As customers embrace new technology, banks are also trying to meet client expectations by digitizing their operations with the help of latest technology including artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual assistance.  So, for the first time in the United States, HSBC Holdings (HSBC  -  Free Report) has unveiled seven humanoid robots — Pepper — at its flagship Fifth Avenue branch in New York. Developed by SoftBank Robotics Group, the humanoid robots are expected to reduce wait time at branches, assist and encourage customers to use available technical tools and platforms, and make clients aware of HSBC products and services. All these efforts are expected to draw more business.If the robots are able to enhance customer experience, HSBC will roll these out to its 228 U.S. branches. Further, the bank intends to gradually increase Pepper’s capabilities and allow customers to complete product applications on its tablets. Notably, the company has spent nearly $131 million on robots and other technology upgrades.Pablo Sanchez, regional head of retail banking and wealth management segment for HSBC in the U.S. and Canada, said, “We’re focused on developing the ‘branch of the future,’ and our use of Pepper will streamline branch operations and delight our customers, allowing bank staff to have deeper, more high-value customer engagements.”HSBC is not the only bank using AI to interact with customers. In 2016, Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) introduced Erica, the AI-enabled financial assistant. This along with Zelle (which allows consumers make payments to one another using their smartphones) is helping this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to win new customers.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) are also using virtual assistance to interact with clients. Further, banks are trying to utilize already familiar AIs including Amazon's (AMZN  -  Free Report) Alexa, Apple's (AAPL  -  Free Report) Siri and Google's  Assistant to assist customers to transfer money, pay bills and check balances.While digitizing of banking operations is nothing new, use of humanoid robots in branches is expected further enhance customer experiences. Also, these will also give the branches, which are gradually experiencing lower footfall, a new lease of life.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

7130,GOOG,"Make no mistake about it, the Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) shorts are going to be covering.  We saw the first wave of shorts cashing in on a recent share price tumble, but what followed was only the start of what could be an epic run.The stock succumbed to a fabulous short ploy who called for bankruptcy in “a few months” – even though this was clearly a very low probability event.  Still, you have to hand it to Vilas Capital and their CEO, CIO and CFA charter holder who went on a PR campaign to help increase the value of his puts.That short term trade worked well for Vilas, but those that are short the stock are going to be feeling some pain soon.  Let’s take a look at the upcoming catalysts that will likely send shares of TSLA to new all time highs.Car Sales DataThe shorts won’t be helped if Tesla misses sales estimates.  I know that flies in the face of common sense, but the fact is that TSLA has come up short of expectations far more than it has beaten the number.Tesla announces quarterly car sales on or about July 6, 2018 – but the numbers don’t really matter.  To be clear, the numbers kind of matter, but we already know they are pretty good.  They will show solid growth for all models, but that isn’t the story.The story is all about getting the Model 3 to production levels of roughly 5,000 per week. As we get to the final two weeks of June, the company is ramping up its efforts to make more cars and meet this goal.  But let’s face it, Wall Street will not punish them if they don’t!5,000 A WeekWhether or not 5,000 comes in June or July or August, people want a new TSLA.  There is demand for these cars, far more than any other model being built (at these price points).The end idea is the cars are coming and buyers are there.  So when the company announces sales and does… or more likely doesn’t reach that level, the shorts will scream ‘bloody murder!’What the shorts seem to have forgotten is that 5,000 a week is only a stepping stone to 7,500 a week and then 10,000 a week.  But let’s not get ahead of ourselves.  It was only a few short months ago that the Model 3 was breaking 1,000 a week consistently.Sales EstimatesI would tell you that Model 3 sales numbers are the be all and end all if that were true, but they are not.  Each and every Model 3 TSLA makes in the year 2018 is basically already sold. They will not be able to satiate the demand for the car.News outlets like Bloomberg have produced a fancy model to track the VIN’s and ask buyers of the car to register it with them so they can more accurately forecast the production level.  If you go by their estimates you will come to around 24K cars made this quarter… give or take.That give or take is the idea that the model isn’t perfect and the numbers change on a daily basis.  Plus there is the idea of the final two weeks of the quarter likely to be the strongest so even if they just average 4K per week in those last two weeks the number balloons to 32K for the quarter.In TransitIt is important to note that TSLA is conservative with how it counts cars as actually being sold. They have to be delivered to the owner with all the paperwork being properly filled out. Over the last several quarters the in transit number has been a few hundred to a few thousand.This time around we should expect to see a number closer to 10K.  Maybe not more than 10K, but something close to that level. Why is that?Well with the production ramping up at the end of the month, it is rather unlikely that more than 10% of the cars made in the final week of the month will be counted as sales.  The week before will also have a solid production number but we should only expect 75% of those to reach their final destination.That in transit number from the prior quarter will help, but next quarter it will become MEANINGFUL.Summer SqueezeSo now that the shorts realize the number doesn’t matter, let’s focus on what is important.It really comes down to production consistency.  As that improves, and if the past is any indication that it will, then we could see another big squeeze.With 39M shares short, we could see the stock blister over $400 before the end of July.The 39M number was where we stood at the end of May.  The next time the number is updated will be after the close on 6/26 for shares short as of 6/15.Beyond that there is another update that will reflect the true panic of shorts as the sales number is about to hit.  On June 29, expect a healthy cover trade as brokers will have to report shares short and then release that data on July 11.  There was a big cover trade day on June 12, the day after the most recent report was released.  The stock closed at $332 the day before and rallied to close at $342 as volume spiked to 22M shares. The reason for that rally was the idea that the shorts were still holding their positions, or as we like to say, they were keeping their shorts on.  Fearing further exposure they covered in a blizzard of volume only to see shares continue to surge.What Lies AheadOf course there is an early August earnings release, and that will likely be a positive catalyst.  I say this because of comments from management that led Wall Street to believe the company will be nearly breakeven or better.Elon Musk has also suggested that a massive squeeze is coming and he has done this before… and been right. But what else could come to propel those shorts to cover?The small version of the Model X is coming, but that is further down the road.  So I thought about some more immediate potential catalysts for Tesla.PartnershipsI floated the idea that Google parent Alphabet  could make a strategic investment in the company.  GOOG has its own autonomous driving unit, which hasn’t had much in the way of breakthrough announcements.  Google Maps is already a big part of the Model 3 so there are reasons to believe that they come in and buy any future debt or equity offering.Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) or John Deere (DE  -  Free Report) also make sense from a partnership perspective. The heavy equipment makers have taken note of the potential for greater efficiencies for their vehicles, so a partnership would make a lot of sense.Another idea would be a supplier in the ecosystem stepping up. I mean how ironic would it be if Goodyear Tire (GT  -  Free Report) made a financial commitment to TSLA to remain the supplier of tires for the next few years … basically the complete opposite of what Vilas Capital proposed. My guess is that Elon Musk has an even bigger bunny in his hat.  The last few times he talked about massive short covering it came to fruition.  At the end of the day, that is what investors should really be paying attention to.Disclosure: Brian Bolan is long TSLA in his trading and retirement account.

7131,GOOG,"U.S. equity markets are shrugging off a contentious meeting of the G7 over the weekend, apparently focused on optimism for a successful outcome from the meeting between President Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.Who are the potential winners if the summit is successful? Chinese companies, including internet giants Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report) and Alibaba Group (BABA  -  Free Report).In a busy week of economic data - including a two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve with a rate announcement scheduled for Wednesday afternoon - all eyes are on Singapore where the President and the Supreme Leader of North Korea will hold the first ever in-person meeting between leaders of the two countries on Tuesday morning.CME Fed Funds futures contracts predict a 95% chance of a 25 basis point hike in short term interest rates and the equity markets seem to be treating the results of the meeting as a foregone conclusion.The European Central Bank, which, like the U.S. staved off economic decline with low interest rates and a 2.5 trillion bond buying spree, will meet on Thursday to discuss the end of quantitative easing. Just like the Fed meeting in the U.S., the equity markets seem sanguine about the probable end of ECB stimulus, with the broad markets up fractionally and the VIX hovering near 12% at mid-day Monday.The much bigger wildcard is the North Korea Summit.At stake in Singapore – beyond the concept of de-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula or a peace agreement between North and South Korea – is the relaxation of sanctions against North Korea which could have wide-ranging economic benefits on the peninsula and across Asia.With 25 million citizens, even if North Korea were to join world markets unhindered, its economic output would barely move the needle, but successful negotiations would be a positive sign for trade relations with China, reducing the likelihood of a tariff-fueled trade war.Chinese internet search company Baidu is often referred to as “Chinese Google” and the comparison is not far off the mark. Just like its American counterpart, Baidu is far and away the most used search engine in China and also offers extensive web and app development services and is investing in Artificial Intelligence technologies and Autonomous driving automobiles.Baidu has been a strong earnings performer, bettering the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last 15 quarters. Predictions for 2018 has been rising lately with 5 upward revisions in the past 60 days, with the company expected to post $10.52/share this year and $12.45 in 2019, increases of 7% and 18% respectively.  Baidu is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).If Baidu is the Chinese Google, the Chinese equivalent of Amazon is the Alibaba Group. After becoming China’s largest internet retailer with revenues of $63B and growing, Alibaba now operates all over the globe, including taking on Amazon head-on in another of the world’s largest potential markets – India.Through a series of acquisitions and strategic partnerships, Alibaba now has deep penetration in the Indian market, including a majority stake in Indian online grocer BigBasket, which sells a wide variety of foodstuffs and household goods.Thanks to revenues that are expected to grow 65% in the current fiscal year, BABA shares have been on a tear recently hitting an all-time high of $211 recently, giving the company a market capitalization of $525B – making it the 6th biggest company in the world. BABA is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).As major negotiations occur that will shape global economic policies for years to come, it’s important for investors to focus on potential winners even when they lie outside of our shores, and Alibaba and Baidu stand to gain handsomely from more accommodating U.S. – China trade relations.   The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

7132,GOOG,"FANG, an acronym created and popularized by CNBC‘s Jim Cramer, is an investors’ darling this year. These stocks — (Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Alphabet L) — have returned more than 20%. The emergence of cutting-edge technology is acting as key catalysts.Additionally, a combination of factors like improving global fundamentals, strong corporate earnings, a rising interest rate scenario, and Trump’s proposed corporate tax reform have added to the strength (read: Everything You Need to Know About FANG Stock Investing).Let’s take a look at the fundamentals of each of these four stocks:FacebookFacebook has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a top Growth and Momentum Style Score of A each.

7133,GOOG,"Premium technology company, Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (UBNT  -  Free Report), recently rolled out its compact wearable camera, FrontRow, which can easily rival action camera maker, GoPro’s (GPRO  -  Free Report), Hero5 line. This also marks a bold move on Ubiquiti’s part to break away from the mould of an established enterprise networking equipment provider.Touted as “fully autonomous”, FrontRow weighs only 55 grams and can help consumers capture pictures and videos seamlessly. Powered by the Snapdragon 625 chipset, the monocle-shaped camera comes with 1.96-inch LCD display, 32 GB storage and 8-megapixel main camera & 5-megapixel front camera. FrontRow has been made Android-compatible.FrontRow can be worn using multi-purpose magnetic clip and third-party chains and Ubiquiti has plans to roll out other accessories including a car window mount and flexible coil mount. Also, it features three third-party live streaming apps including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. The device can be linked to other popular applications like Dropbox and Spotify.FrontRow comes with a price tag of $400, comparable to GoPro’s Hero5 cameras which can be purchased for $399.  Also, Snapchat’s economically priced wearable camera sunglasses, Spectacles, which were launched last year, is likely to put up a tough fight against Frontrow. Other tech biggies including Alphabet Inc.  and Samsung have tried their luck in wearable tech, meeting with moderate to low success.According to latest numbers, Snapchat’s Spectacle sales have shrunk 35% during the second quarter, placing its future in jeopardy. It remains to be seen whether Ubiquiti’s FrontRow can carve out a niche of its own in the highly dynamic wearable tech space. FrontRow comes from the company’s consumer product division, Ubiquiti Labs, which offers mesh Wifi systems.Luckily for Ubiquiti, strategic product launches at disruptive prices have helped it trump rivals to a great extent. Ubiquiti ended fiscal 2017 on a high note and set an ambitious goal for the next year, driven by robust demand across segments. The company remains upbeat on the market traction of the newly launched products. Ubiquiti recorded an average return of 37.1% in the past three months, miles ahead of the industry''s flat trend.We believe that Ubiquiti’s excellent global business model, which is highly flexible and adaptable to any kind of change in markets, has helped it steer past challenges and maximize growth. Over the past few quarters, Ubiquiti has made significant investments in inventory to reduce lead times, meet increasing demand and support the growing number of customers. These efforts are also likely to stoke growth for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.A better-ranked stock in the sector is Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report). The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has an average earnings surprise of 3.4% for the trailing four quarters, beating estimates all through.

7134,GOOG,"In the high-tech space, hardware manufacturers have enjoyed the lion’s share of the news and commentary recently.  Semiconductor stocks in particular have had a wild ride in 2018, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rising 19% between February 8th and March 12th, only to retrace the rally as it sank 14% by April 25th.Concerns about a global demand slowdown, reduced cryptocurrency mining and tightening margins due to commoditization - especially in DRAM and flash memory - spooked investors.    A number of positive earnings reports alleviated the fears and semiconductor stocks have staged a partial comeback, led by Micron Technologies (MU  -  Free Report), which is up 28% in the past month.With action like that, it’s no wonder hardware has dominated the financial news cycle.Quietly, several major producers of software have posted strong earnings and guidance and had estimates revised upward.  Investors are taking notice as shares of these three strong performers are starting to rise.Citrix Systems (CTXS  -  Free Report) provides business virtualization solutions to business through three major product lines, XenApp, NetScaler and Citrix Workspace.  Partners with Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet  and twelve other large technology companies, Citrix allows users to transform the traditional workspace by providing secure access to applications, desktops and data on any device.In Q1, Citrix delivered earnings of $1.29/share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05/share, its fourth consecutive earning surprise in a row.  The company also raised full year earnings guidance  to a range of $5.20 – $5.30/share.  12 analyst upward revisions followed and the 2018 consensus estimate now stands at $5.27/share.  Citrix is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Cadence Design Systems Inc (CDNS  -  Free Report) provides design technologies to the producers of high tech equipment, including the semiconductor industry.  While announcing strong Q1 results in which Cadence beat the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate of $0.38/share by $0.02, CFO John Wall stated “We are pleased with results of all of our key operating metrics including revenue, operating margin, EPS and operating cash flow.  On the strength of our first quarter business and continuing momentum, we are raising our outlook for the year.”The company now expects 2018 Revenue in the range of $2.05B - $2.1B and Earnings of $1.57 - $1.65/share.  The shares, which formerly closely tracked the Consumer Software Services market as a whole, are beginning to break out, up 5.6% this year versus an industry average of -3.1%.  Cadence is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Famously founded in the San Francisco apartment of ex-Oracle executive Marc Benioff in 1999, Salesforce.com (CRM  -  Free Report) is now the worlds leading provider of “Software as a Service”, allowing businesses of all sizes to build their own applications either on their own architecture or in Salesforce’s cloud environment.Salesforce provides its CRM (customer resource management) software services to over 100,000 customers worldwide.  Salesforce shares are up 24% in 2018.After modest earnings beats in the past 14 quarters, Salesforce is expected to report revenues of $2.94B and earnings of $0.46/share when it releases fiscal Q4 results on May 29th.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year earnings has risen almost 25% over the past 90 days to $2.13/share, earning Salesforce a Zacks rank #1 (Strong Buy).  The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

7135,GOOG,"According to a Bloomberg report, Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) is mulling to exit the market for production of high-end processors for data-center servers in order to focus on its core businesses. The strategic move is likely to benefit Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), which reportedly has a stranglehold of the market with 99% market share.Qualcomm is one of the largest manufacturers of mobile-phone chips in the world. With increasing saturation levels in the mobile-phone market, the company began developing chips for processors used in large data centers of firms like Alphabet Inc.’s  Google and Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Amazon Web Services. Although the chipsets used in smartphones and other mobile devices are shipped in large numbers compared to those used in large data center processors, they are priced much less relative to the premium price range of the latter and thereby generate lower margins.Qualcomm sourced technology from ARM Holdings Plc, a leading manufacturer of microprocessors and one of Intel’s fiercest competitors, to develop a server chip titled Centriq 2400. The product reportedly offered comparatively better results than Intel Xeon Platinum 8180 processor based on energy efficiency and cost, and created a buzz in the market after its launch last year.However, according to persons familiar with matter, Qualcomm is currently exploring options like winding down of the operations or finding a new owner for the business in order to reduce operating costs and focus on its core businesses. While the endeavor would help the company save millions of dollars through reduced R&D expenses, it would also increase its dependence on slow-growing market for mobile-phone chips.Moreover, aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market is likely to hurt profits in the future. Although the global smartphone market is expected to maintain its momentum in the next four to five years, a major part of this growth is likely to come from low-cost emerging markets, which is likely to exert pressure on margins.Qualcomm has underperformed the industry in the past three months with an average loss of 19.5% compared with a decline of 4.1% for the latter.Whether a core business focus can indeed help the company to turn the tables and improve its sagging shares remains to be seen. Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

7136,GOOG,"After four months of solid economic data, low inflation and unemployment, historically strong earnings reports and an all-around “goldilocks” economy, the broad markets remained in the doldrums, basically unchanged on the year.  Volatility has reigned as investors struggled to decide which direction stocks would go next.All of that changed when Warren Buffett spoke on Thursday.Speaking to the media prior to the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder’s meeting, Buffett disclosed that he had purchased an additional 75 million shares of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) in the in the first quarter of 2018, adding to the 165 million shares that Berkshire already held. Their total position is now valued at more than $43 billion.Employing his traditional folksy-genius logic, Buffett outlined his plan to hold Apple for the long term – 10 or 20 years – and implored investors to ignore noisy data like the number of iPhones sold in any given quarter and focus on the fact that Apple sells products that have become ubiquitous. The “Oracle of Omaha” laid out a convincing bull case for the world’s biggest company, pointing out their $60 billion in annual earnings is almost twice as much as the second most profitable company in the U.S, pointing out “It’s a wide, wide gap.  It’s an amazing business.”Apple stock, languishing of late due to less than rosy predictions about sales growth in phones, reported a big earnings beat last week, raised guidance, raised the dividend and announced an additional $100M in stock buybacks. Buffett pointed out the simple math behind the aggressive buybacks.  “We own about 5%,” he said “But I know I don’t have to do a thing and probably in a couple years we’ll own 6% without laying out another dollar.”  He went on to say that not only did he not care about short term price performance, but that he would actually prefer for the stock to trade lower so that the buybacks would pack a bigger punch.  That’s the thinking of a true long-term investor.Already buoyed by the strong earnings announcement, Apple stock rallied to new all-time highs and pulled the markets along with it.  Coupled with great Q1 earnings at Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Alphabet  and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), the indexes shrugged off their recent malaise and resumed their bull run, with the S&P 500 gaining 3% in the last two trading sessions and the Nasdaq 100 gaining more than 4%.With a market Capitalization of $912B, Apple represents more than 12% of the Nasdaq 100 index and the recent rally – thanks to the popularity of indexed investing – has pulled the entire market with it.In uncertain times, all investors can learn a valuable lesson from Buffett, one of the greatest investors of all time, do your homework and treat short term dips in the companies you want to own as buying opportunities. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.

7138,GOOG,"The FANG stocks (Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Alphabet  have been investors’ darlings this year, returning more than 20%. But these were beaten down lately on overvaluation concerns. The dip could offer a solid buying opportunity for these fast-growing companies (read: Tech Face Off: Amazon Versus Alphabet ETFs).In order to capitalize on the current situation and the strong momentum in the tech space, AdvisorShares, a leading provider of actively managed ETFs, last week rolled out New Tech and Media ETF (FNG  -  Free Report). It offers exposure similar to investments in high-performing technology and media leaders as characterized by the FANG stocks acronym. This is expected to lead to their superior long-term performance.FNG in FocusThe new fund is actively managed and focuses on companies that are driving economic growth in the modern era. Also, these can adapt to changing leadership by maintaining the ability to invest in the next generation of technology and media companies leading the equity markets.It seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing primarily in U.S. equities, and even internationally through American depositary receipts (ADRs), of technology and technology-related companies including social media and internet retail companies within the information technology and consumer discretionary sectors. The fund employs a quantitative process to select equities with a technical analysis overlay for entering and exiting individual positions in the portfolio (read: 5 ETFs & Stocks to Ride the Tech Mania).The ETF currently holds 30 stocks in its basket with heavy concentration on NVIDIA (NVDA), Facebook and Amazon.com that account for over 8% share each. Other firms hold no more than 5.14% of assets. Since the fund is actively managed, it comes with a high expense ratio of 0.85%.How does it fit in today’s portfolio?This ETF could be an intriguing choice for investors seeking concentrated exposure to the fastest growing segment of the broad stock market. Betting on high-growth technology stocks is a beneficial strategy in the current modest economic growth environment, where Trump’s pro-growth policies are being delayed.   Additionally, the extensive adoption of new technology such as cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, wearables, drones, virtual reality devices, and artificial intelligence will provide an edge to this ETF. The combination of other factors including improving global fundamentals, strong corporate earnings, a rising interest rate scenario, and Trump’s proposed corporate tax reform will further act as additional catalysts (read: How to Build a Winning ETF Portfolio for Second-Half 2017).ETF CompetitionThere is an appetite for this fund despite a good number of choices already in the space. The ultra-popular Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF (XLK  -  Free Report) has been the most successful product with AUM of over $16.1 billion and expense ratio of 0.14%. It has key holdings in some of the future tech & media leaders like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft (MSF  -  Free Report)T). Another ETF — First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index (FDN  -  Free Report) — targeting internet stocks like Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet has amassed nearly $4.5 billion in AUM and charges 54 bps in annual fees.Apart from this, other tech funds that could provide stiff competition are Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT  -  Free Report), ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK  -  Free Report) and ARK Web x.0 ETF (ARKW  -  Free Report) (see: all the Technology ETFs here).Bottom LineGiven the strong fundamentals for big technology stocks, the new product from AdvisorShares could see large inflows and garner solid investor interest. Its aggressive growth strategy and disruptive innovators’ focused theme could make it outperform in the space over the long term though a high annual fee could be an issue.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

7139,GOOG,"Get ready for some upward revisions to the earnings estimates of Alarm.com ((ALRM  -  Free Report)).  The stock is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now but reported earnings after the close on Wednesday, March 15.  The company posted revenues of $69.79M compared to the consensus of $63.95M.  EPS of $0.19 was $0.06 better than the Wall Street consensus estimate.In the release, the company guided Wall Street higher.  FY2017 is now expected to produce revenue of between $322M to $325.5M and that is comfortably higher than the $300M consensus estimate.  The company expects to earn $0.73 to $0.75 for the year and that is also above the $0.65 consensus estimate.In late after hours trading, I see the stock at $33.39 up $2.76 or about 9%.Estimates Likely Moving HigherWhen a company raises guidance over the consensus you can expect the analysts to adjust their models.  These models help them derive their earnings estimates which are used in the Zacks Rank.  Since there haven’t been any earnings revisions over the last 60 days, ALRM is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  In the coming days I anticipate the stock to see several upward revisions which should help boost the Zacks Rank for this stock to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).AcquisitionsALRM made a few recent acquisitions and they were touched on during the conference call.  During the call, management talked about how the ObjectVideo acquisition will allow customers to track cars and license plates or even customers in a store.The Icontrol Networks deal closed in the quarter and the company mentioned how the Piper unit powers a portion of the ADT platform.  The industry had been viewed as “we versus ADT” but that has changed with the advent of customer home protection services offered by cable companies.An analyst questioned if the company was looking to a product offering around cars, and while the company would not commit on a specific answer, it was clear that it could be something coming down the road.  Many times during the call management noted that they were maintaining a healthy level of spending for R&D.  Having an expandable platform is key because the security business has been changing very rapidly.Follow Brian Bolan on Twitter @BBolan1OutlookAs we think about the changes in home security, it is clear that people are adding devices and services thanks to the relative ease of the internet.  Management noted on the call that people want these products and services to come from one source. As an example, I have a Google Cam (formerly Dropcam) and while it is accessible via its own app I would like to see it be usable via my Amazon echo.  Yes the Google Nest is controllable via the voice recognizing tool, but I would like more functionality.  I often search on Amazon for devices that are compatible with Alexa since I have power out that is controlled by another company.  It too has its own app and with only a few devices having multiple apps is already a pressure point for me.With the strong revenue guidance, management believes that its products and services will be well received by customers. Analysts Notes ComingAs I look at where most recommendations are, I see a few potential upgrades tomorrow.  Goldman Sachs started coverage of the stock with a Neutral rating on January 31 and a $31 price target. The analyst for the firm asked about the potential for organic growth from Icontrol which allowed management to talk about how they were going to hold their cost structure constant and could expect about $66M in EBITDA which translates to better than 20% margin.  It is possible that Goldman Sachs ups the stock to “Buy” tomorrow.Raymond James downgraded the stock back on August 16 as the moved their rating to Market Perform from Outperform.  Imperial Capital has the stock as “In-line” with a $30 price target.Roth Capital started coverage on October 3 with a buy and a $33.50 price target.  Don’t be surprised to see that price target moved to $37.50 range.Maxim Group initiated with a buy rating and $37 price target on December 1.  They are clearly the most bullish on the stock and for good reason.  I would look for the Maxim price target to expand to $40 or more given the recently posted results. Trading Range?The stock has a 52 week high of $34.43, but don’t be too surprised to see a new level reached tomorrow.  Why do I say this?  Well back on October 31, 2016 some unusual call buying was spotted in ALRM.  The call was a $35 strike with a March expiration.  At the time, the stock was $29 and change so it was a pretty big reach.  I see those same calls closing at $0.17 with open interest of 856 – so not anything to get too excited about.What did catch my eye on the option chain was all the puts that moved the day of earnings.  The 27.5 strike that expires on Friday saw 729 contracts vs open interest of 898.  Check that open interest level tomorrow to see if those were all premium sellers as the put was paying $0.42. I like the chances of several price target increases coming tomorrow.  There is an outside chance we get an upgrade on the stock as well.  Throw in the idea that some mildly aggressive calls were bought several months ago I and I like the chances of this stock trading over $35 on March 16 or soon thereafter.  Either way, look for this stock to become a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in a day or two.Alarm.com Holdings, Inc.

7140,GOOG,"When Donald Trump first began gaining some momentum in the presidential race, it looked to be pretty fantastic news for Twitter ((TWTR  -  Free Report)), and investors in the social networking giant too. After all, Trump would frequently go onto the site to announce new plans or fight back against his detractors. It was (and continues to be) an incredible resource for political updates.Now that Trump is President, his tweets move markets. His attacks on companies can send share prices lower in a heartbeat and are an important thing to consider for investors these days. Some have  set up apps to track his tweets  and how they relate to the market. Others do a tweet analysis in order to get better insight into the mind of the President, including The Atlantic’s  Trump Tweet Tracker  .But beyond Trump, Twitter also managed to become the single greatest collection of primary sources of all-time. When breaking news happens, it is almost always reported first hand on Twitter, and then it is disseminated out from there.You’d think that these factors alone would make Twitter an unstoppable media juggernaut. A must for journalists and those seeking to stay up-to-date on the news alike. So how has Twitter capitalized on this incredible timing and presidential stroke of luck? Well, in short, it hasn’t.Bad Earnings Report AgainThe company posted yet another disappointing quarter for Q4, missing expectations on the revenue front and posting shockingly poor active user figures. It remains stuck around the 320 million active monthly user mark, and can’t even seem to grow revenues either. Add in disappointing adjusted earnings guidance, and it isn’t a great situation by any stretch for TWTR investors these days, especially given that the company has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).And let’s remember, these figures are with the leader of the free world literally using the service to clarify policy and goals on a regular basis. The environment cannot possibly get any better for Twitter. Its product is in the news on a near hourly basis at this point and it still can’t find a way to get the job done.Clearly, Twitter needs a shakeup and it needs a bit of a Hail-Mary in order to get back into investors’ good graces. So, what can the company do?Twitter Needs to Copy YouTube. Now. Fortunately for Twitter, the path to relevancy and growth is already laid out before them. The good folks at Alphabet ((GOOGL  -  Free Report)) () have already done all the hard work in their YouTube division and Twitter needs only to copy their best practices.First and foremost is capitalizing on the incredible missed opportunity of getting an ad right on to tweets. As you can see in the picture below, there is always a big white box at the bottom right hand corner of each tweet.Why not fill that with a small advertisement? Sure, some people are not going to like that, but people will adjust accordingly. We saw something similar with YouTube where at first only certain videos had ads, and now nearly everything has an advertisement before the video. People have adapted and it has become the norm to see this before a video. People will do the same with Twitter (and embedded tweets) and this will help with casual users (much the same way embedding helped with casual YouTubers).After all, these casual users who mostly see tweets embedded somewhere else make up a huge base of people and are arguably the key to Twitter’s success. Finding a way to make money off these people—much like how YouTube doesn’t need you to be signed in or making videos to make revenue off of you—should be paramount in Twitter’s near term plans.According to Twitter,  embedded tweets reach more than a billion people  each month across the web, a truly massive figure. And that number is actually from before Donald Trump burst onto the scene and tweets were on the nightly news on a regular basis.But what if people hate this idea and recoil from the service? Well, an easy way to placate people will be to pay the content generators for the work they are doing. Giving tweeters a slice of the ad revenue that they generate would go a long way to getting people and small businesses to tweet more, and it is pretty much akin to what YouTube does with their stars. And  Twitter has even looked to do this on the video side  , so why not extend it over to their bread and butter anyway?Bottom LineAre some of these ideas going to be popular? Definitely not. But Twitter needs to try something in order to jumpstart its floundering share price and lackluster growth. Everything needs to be on the table, and now is the time to do it.The company finds itself in a truly historic position and it is an opportunity that isn’t going to come around every four years. The confluence of Trump and the increased desire for real-time (and unfiltered) news from around the globe should be a godsend for Twitter, but the company has completely failed to capitalize on the trend.Taking some of YouTube’s best practices might be a good place to start in order to return to relevancy though. It certainly has a better shot of reviving the stock than anything Twitter has come up with recently, and it could push TWTR back towards growth too.And a position of growth would make Twitter a much better candidate for a takeover, perhaps from a company like Alphabet. Such a partnership makes a lot of sense and it would allow better integration between Google search results and tweets, while the melding of tweets and YouTube comments would be a great match as well.So, if Twitter wants to get to this end—which seems like the best possible outcome for TWTR investors at this point—take a page out of YouTube’s book and start thinking about ways to get more ads out there, and how to benefit creators in the process. Because if Twitter can’t take some risks and find a way to make things work when their service is at the forefront of news and popular culture like it is now, they never will.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

7141,GOOG,"Control4 Corp (CTRL  -  Free Report) is one of those story stocks that is just about to take off.  The connected home is an idea that is coming... trust me, I know it.

"
7152,GOOG,"Earnings History
"
7153,GOOG,"I like the earnings history for CTRL as the company has topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 7 of the last 8 quarters.  The most recent miss was a big one, it came on the March 2015 quarter as the company reported a loss of $0.12 per share when the Zacks Consensus Estimate was looking for a loss of $0.07.  That miss of five cents was a -71% negative earnings surprise and the stock fell by more than 23% in the session following the report.
"
7154,GOOG,"Those times see to be over, as the company swung from a loss to a gain in the next quarter.  The $0.10 reported for the June quarter was fully $0.04 ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a 66% positive earnings surprise.  The company also beat on top, something that had not been achieved since the March 2014 quarter was reported back in May of last year.
"
7155,GOOG,"Earnings Estimates
"
7156,GOOG,"The Zacks Consensus for 2015 had been sliding for much of the year for CTRL.  The number was as high at $0.54 at the start of the year, but then slipped to $0.40 in February and then all the way down to $0.02 in May.  After the most recent report, the Zacks Consensus vaulted higher to $0.10 so the number is starting to look back up.
"
7157,GOOG,"The 2016 number hasnt seen quite the same rebound just yet, as it moved higher by only 1 cent in August.  It should be noted that the earnings report in May of this year didnt crush the 2016 number  at least not as bad as the 2015 number was hit.  The 2016 number fell from $0.65 to $0.20, so a big smack, but not quite as large as the hit applied to the current year.

7159,GOOG,"The most recent quarter was not really met with much excitement despite the big beat.  The focus was still on the previous quarter and the slew of downgrades that the stock received.  Only Needham maintained their buy rating, while Raymond James, Canaccord, Dougherty and Imperial Capital all downgraded the stock.
"
7160,GOOG,"This sets up a host of analysts that are very familiar with the story and some solid execution could drive multiple recommendation upgrades. Right now the highest target price on the street is from Needham who has a $15 target, with Canaccord the second highest at $13.

7185,GOOG,"Rumors have been flying about who is going to be the next CEO of Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report). Plain and simple, Wall Street does not like the uncertainty at the top of the management chain.  Further, there are plenty of talented executives that would be perfect for the role of a company that just cant seem to capitalize on the immense potential it is capable of.
"
7186,GOOG,"Before I name my top three picks who are not named Jack Dorsey, lets review the recent events that got the company in this situation.
"
7187,GOOG,"Dick Ousted
"
7188,GOOG,"Dick Costolo joined Twitter in September of 2009 in the COO role. During another management shakeup at the young firm, Costolo took over the role of CEO from exiting founder Evan Williams. On June 11 he announced that he was stepping down as of July 1 with Jack Dorsey stepping in as interim CEO.
"
7189,GOOG,"Since that time, three board members have been searching for a new permanent CEO for the company. They noted they would look at both internal and external candidates.  In the month or so that followed the departed of Costolo, reports circled that Jack Dorsey could become the CEO.
"
7190,GOOG,"Early Candidates
"
7191,GOOG,"A research report from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey names three candidate for the job, most of the seem to be logical fits for the top spot at Twitter.  First is Mike McCue the CEO of Flipboard.  Flipboard is a social networking site that bills itself as your personal magazine.  
"
7192,GOOG,"Instagram founder Kevin Systrom was also mentioned as a candidate for the top spot at Twitter.  This one seems like a pretty big stretch as Instagram is a huge business for its parent Facebook (FB  -  Free Report).  Finally, Medium CEO Evan Williams was also named.  Williams is a co-founder and is already on the board and part of the search committee.  That makes it very unlikely that he would steer the search to his own front door.
"
7193,GOOG,"Who Should Be Pursued
"
7194,GOOG,"I am not part of the team trying to help find a new CEO at Twitter, but I use the service every day and I want to see some stability brought to the top spot.  Honestly, I want more than stability, I want top tier tech know-how combined with the intangibles that come with great leadership.  
"
7195,GOOG,"John Legere (@JohnLegre) is the CEO of T-Mobile and to call him brash would be an understatement.  His recent spats on Twitter with rival CEOs are just what the company needs. He has Wall Street credibility and experience in managing a growing company.  He would be perfect for this role as he has shown a great ability to innovate and drive consumer growth and adoption.
"
7196,GOOG,"T-Mobile (TMUS  -  Free Report) is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock that trades at a robust 45x forward earnings. The loss of this charismatic leader would be huge for the mobile carrier.  At the same time, it would an even bigger coup for Twitter.  I would guess the odds of Legere taking over Twitter at 50-1.
"
7197,GOOG,"Former Googler
"
7198,GOOG,"One of the men that made Google (GOOGL) Google is Omid Kordestani (OmidKordestani).  He joined the search giant in May of 1999 and was instrumental in driving the development and implementation of the companys initial business model. He basically helped the company monetize search, so I would think that he would be able to help better monetize the tweets of 300 million users.
"
7199,GOOG,"This is another moon-shot type hire as he was the highest paid executive at Google in 2014.  The thing he, he was recently passed over for the role of CEO at Google after a recent re-org there, so the challenge of taking Twitter to the next level could be what brings him back.  Mr. Kordestani is not a frequent user of the service, making it is hard to gauge his interest in the service.
"
7200,GOOG,"Google is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and recently promoted an executive to fill the role Kodestani was in.  This means that he is available, but again the question is his interest.

7202,GOOG,"Another possibility is the former interim CEO of Yahoo, Ross Levinsohn (@RossLevinsohn).  He was took over the top spot at Yahoo while the company was in some serious turmoil.  When the Scott Thompson era was over, Levinsohn was there to pick up the pieces and keep the focus on improving the company, not just the top spot.  The company eventually hired Marissa Mayer to head the company.
"
7203,GOOG,"An executive with vast media experience Levinsohn has the credentials that make him an ideal candidate for the top role at Twitter.  Given the attachment that the world of television has with Twitter, Levinsohn could deepen those relationships even further and drive innovation in this key segment.
"
7204,GOOG,"Yahoo (YHOO) is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
"
7205,GOOG,"Who Do I Really Want to Decide?
"
7206,GOOG,"Since I am long Twitter, I really have a little bias on what I would like to see happen.  I want the person to decide who will run Twitter next to be Larry Page.  This is totally selfish of me, but the best case scenario is for the company to be sold to Google and let Larry install a CEO that will help better align the company with the search giant.
"
7207,GOOG,"There were rumors in the past about Google buying the micro-blogging service, so their interest is real.  A simple search of Google rumored to buy twitter gives a plethora of articles that mention this rumor and its not from a single time period.  Google looked at buying the company before it came public and the rumor was around only a few short months ago.

7234,GOOG,"Option spreads are a great way to take a position based on your expectations for how a stock will perform after the release of earnings. The beauty of this strategy is that you can know with certainty what you stand to make and lose before you enter the trade.  Speculating on what’s going to happen to a stock price after an earnings announcement is clearly just that – speculation. Obviously, we can’t know for sure. But if we combine the Zacks Rank and an understanding of the pattern of earnings beats (or misses) for a company in the recent past, we can make an educated guess about what’s likely to happen and devise a sound options trade to profit if our hypothesis is correct.Volatility in the price of a stock tends to increase right after the announcement of quarterly earnings.  While this presents an opportunity for a successful trade, it also means that losses will be magnified in the event that we are incorrect. Simply taking a long or short position in the stock can be painful when we’re on the wrong side of an earnings beat or miss, but smart options trading can let us mitigate the damage when we’re wrong – and profit when we’re right!When a Butterfly Flaps its WingsThe options spread that’s perfect for taking a position on what will happen to a stock price after announcing earnings is the butterfly. Professional options traders often design their positions around this concept.The idea is really fairly simple. For simplicity, we’ll talk about a call butterfly (bullish expectation), but the exact same strategy could be applied to puts (bearish expectation) as well.To trade a butterfly, a trader buys one call option, sells two call options at a higher strike price and buys one more call at an equidistant higher strike.The maximum loss on the position is the total premium paid for the options. No matter what happens to the price of the stock, the worst-case scenario is that the spread expires worthless.The maximum profit from the trade is the difference between the strike prices, minus the premium paid to enter the position.We will generally use the shortest dated options available. These usually offer the most “bang for your buck” in that you’re paying for the least amount of time premium.  A Real-World Example:Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) reports Q1 earnings on Monday April 16th.  With a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), NFLX tend more often than not to surprise to the upside.  During the last 6 quarters, the average price movement in the 2 days immediately preceding and following an earnings announcement is +$12.60.  If your hypothesis is that earnings are likely to come in slightly higher than expected and that the stock price will rally 2-4%, you could construct this butterfly trade:(We will use the options that expire Friday April 20th. The current stock price is approximately $297. For the purposes of this example, we will ignore commissions and fees.)Buy one 300 call (Current ask $15.25)Sell two 310 calls (Current bid $10.70)Buy one 320 call (Current ask 7.45)For this spread, we have paid a total of $1.30.* This is the maximum amount we can lose. If the stock price is less than 300 or greater than 320 when our options expire, the spread will be worth zero and we will have forfeit the entire amount we paid.If, however the stock behaves as we expect and rallies $13 to $310, our spread will be worth $10. (The 300 call we own will be worth $10, and all other options will be worthless.)Subtract the $1.30 we paid for the position and we have a whopping profit of $8.70!  Standard options contracts represent 100 shares of the stock, so this equals $870 per spread.Even if we’re not exactly correct about the price movement, as long as the stock ends up between $301.30 and $318.70, we at least breakeven on the trade.  Everything in between those prices provides us with some profit, with the maximum coming if the stock settles right at the strike we’re short.This strategy is best suited to stocks that have a history of moving significantly after announcing quarterly results.  All the FANG stocks report in the next 3 weeks. Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) on April 25th, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Alphabet  on April 26th.  You can use the analysis tools on Zacks.com to make your own estimate about where the stocks are likely to end up after the announcements and buy a butterfly to profit if the stock proves you right, while limiting your exposure if you get surprised.*A note on execution – This example uses the current bids and offers available in the marketplace.  The net is the worst price available at which we could execute the trade.  In reality, if using a broker with spread-trading order entry capabilities, it’s likely that we could buy the butterfly for considerably less, for instance $1.10 or $1.20 if we bid on it as a spread rather than “legging” the individual options.

7235,GOOG," Indexed investing has been great for the broad markets for years.  Investors buying ETFs have driven one of the longest bull markets in history and the rising tide has tended to lift all boats…until it didn’t. Lingering unsettling news on the biggest names has led to selling that is driving the indexes down as fast as they rose, with the tech-heavy NASDAQ down over 200 points just today and now negative for the year. Stock Picker’s MarketThe big headline FANG stocks, Alphabet , Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) all down between 3% and 6% just today, does that mean they’re a bargain now?  Maybe.  But it’s going to be a little more difficult than simple buy and hold in the ETFs.  We’re going to have to work a little harder…All of the FANGs are down more than 10% from their respective 52-week highs (Facebook is down almost 20% in just 2 months) and it’s certainly tempting to consider adding some or all of them to the portfolio while they’re being battered.  The problem is that these famous and widely held mega caps are so sensitive to the news cycle that that they get sold off together and drag the indexes down with them.  The selloff can be painful to watch, but in the long run, the sun will come up tomorrow and well managed companies will continue selling goods and services and making money.  We just have to identify them so we can get on board.Hidden Value under the Radar.Wise investors can benefit from finding lesser known tech names that have been beaten up through no fault of their own and now represent solid value, as if they’re “on sale.”  Let’s take a look at a couple of strong companies with accelerating earnings outlooks that have been sold off with the rest of the market in recent weeks.  This is how we can make the recent downturn actually work for us.Down 20% from recent highs in February - despite a surprise earning beat two weeks ago - Micron Technologies (MU  -  Free Report) is starting to look like a great opportunity.  With a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), the maker of DRAM, memory chips and other semiconductor supplies has a great profit outlook for 2018.  Revenues are expected to be up nearly 50% from 2017 (the Zacks Consensus average for 2018 is $29.2B vs $20.3B last year) and net earnings are forecast to more than double year over year at $10.99/share vs just $4.96/share in 2017.  That Consensus earnings estimate is up from $9.83/share just 60 days ago, the result of 9 straight upward revisions during the exact same period that the markets were punishing tech. At its current price of $50.12, Micron is trading at a rock bottom forward P/E ratio of just 4.8. It’s much the same story at Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report).  The industry leader in semiconductor wafer technology is down 15% from 52-week highs also earns a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy.) Seven out of the nine analysts making up the Zacks Consensus estimate have raised their outlook in the past 2 months, bringing the average from $4.08/share up to $4.41, a big increase over the $3.25/share the company reported for 2017. With a forward P/E ratio of 12.6 (versus the industry average of 16.4) AMAT is a growth stock that’s priced like Value.  Today’s nearly 5% selloff make it an extremely attractive addition to the portfolio.
"
7236,GOOG,"NeoPhotonics (NPTN  -  Free Report) is benefitting from a 
"
7237,GOOG,"long term trend in the tech sector.  Big companies like Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Google 
"
7238,GOOG," and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) are all building very large data centers that cost 
"
7239,GOOG,"billions of dollars each.  NPTN is part of the supply chain for these huge 
"
7240,GOOG,"investments.  Analysts have recently increased their earnings estimates and that 
"
7241,GOOG,"has helped push the stock to a Zacks Rank #1 
"
7242,GOOG,"(Strong Buy) and today it is the Bull of the Day.
"
7243,GOOG,"Data Center Thesis
"
7244,GOOG,"I have identified several stocks that benefit from the recent trend of tech 
"
7245,GOOG,"companies building out massive data centers.  This is one of those companies as 
"
7246,GOOG,"the data center needs to be able to hand the massive amounts of data that comes 
"
7247,GOOG,"in on fiber optic lines.
"
7248,GOOG,"Description
"
7249,GOOG,"NeoPhotonics makes hybrid photonic integrated optoelectronic modules and 
"
7250,GOOG,"subsystems for bandwidth-intensive, high-speed communications networks. Its 
"
7251,GOOG,"products include transmitter, receiver, and switching products for 100 gigabits 
"
7252,GOOG,"per second (Gbps) optical transmission applications over distances of 2 to 2,000 
"
7253,GOOG,"kilometers. NeoPhotonics was founded in 1996 and is headquartered in San Jose, 
"
7254,GOOG,"California.
"
7255,GOOG,"Earnings History
"
7256,GOOG,"The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters 
"
7257,GOOG,"so that is great, but the best part is the last two quarters saw 200% positive 
"
7258,GOOG,"earnings surprises.
"
7259,GOOG,"In the most recently reported quarter, which hit the wire back on May 7, the 
"
7260,GOOG,"company posted a gain of $0.06 when the Zacks Consensus was looking for a loss 
"
7261,GOOG,"of $0.06. So that was a 200% positive earnings surprise, and as a result, the 
"
7262,GOOG,"stock was up more than 24% in the session following the release. That is what I 
"
7263,GOOG,"am talking about!
"
7264,GOOG,"The company reports again on or about August 6, and Wall Street is looking for 
"
7265,GOOG,"$85M in revenue and EPS of $0.15. The Zacks EPS number is $0.11 due to how we 
"
7266,GOOG,"treat options expenses.
"
7267,GOOG,"Earnings Estimates
"
7268,GOOG,"This story is something that will catch on pretty soon. I see that the Zacks 
"
7269,GOOG,"Consensus Estimate was calling for a loss of $0.25 back in February, but that 
"
7270,GOOG,"saw a huge swing to a gain of $0.08 the next month. In May the number launched 
"
7271,GOOG,"again to $0.30 and then added a nickel in June. The number has held still in 
"
7272,GOOG,"July, but earnings are right around the corner.
"
7273,GOOG,"The 2016 numbers saw a similar move and are resting at $0.45 for now. I would 
"
7274,GOOG,"not be surprised to see that number move much higher after the next earnings 
"
7275,GOOG,"release.
"
7276,GOOG,"Growth
"
7277,GOOG,"Topline growth is crucial to long term success, especially for a small cap 
"
7278,GOOG,"company like NPTN. I see they posted revenue growth of 8.5% in 2014 and are 
"
7279,GOOG,"expected to improve on that this year to 9.2%. Those are nice numbers, but I 
"
7280,GOOG,"really want to see double digit revenue growth. Right now, analyst are calling 
"
7281,GOOG,"for 7.4% revenue growth, but again, I think that number will move up after some 
"
7282,GOOG,"time and the next earnings report.
"
7283,GOOG,"EPS grew 22% last year and is exploding this year to 170%. That is great to see, 
"
7284,GOOG,"especially when we will have two quarters of that huge growth. Next year 
"
7285,GOOG,"analysts are calling for EPS growth of 29% on top of the 170% move for this 
"
7286,GOOG,"year so that is good to see.
"
7287,GOOG,"Chart
"
7288,GOOG,"Zacks has developed a chart that helps investors see how 
"
7289,GOOG,"earnings estimates have  
"
7290,GOOG,"impacted 
"
7291,GOOG,"the price of the stock over the last several years.  We call 
"
7292,GOOG,"this chart the  
"
7293,GOOG,"price and 
"
7294,GOOG,"consensus chart, and each color coded lines represents 
"
7295,GOOG,"analyst estimates over a 
"
7296,GOOG,"designated year.  As estimates increase, the stock tends to 
"
7297,GOOG,"follow.  The Zacks  
"
7298,GOOG,"Rank is 
"
7299,GOOG,"impacted by earnings estimate increases, beats and 
"
7300,GOOG,"incorporates the idea of  
"
7301,GOOG,"analyst 
"
7302,GOOG,"agreement and magnitude.  As a 
"
7303,GOOG,"Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) we see that estimates are moving

"
7318,GOOG,"I am a heavy user of Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), and I get more out of the service than I put  
"
7319,GOOG,"into it, which more or less makes it a no-brainer.  Despite the need that I  
"
7320,GOOG,"and many others have, the fact that the company has been mired in  
"
7321,GOOG,"leadership void for several years has not been lost on the stock price.
"
7322,GOOG,"The Book
"
7323,GOOG,"Around the time of the IPO, we at Zacks streamed a live show about TWTR as  
"
7324,GOOG,"it was the hottest IPO of the year.  In preparation for the event, I read  
"
7325,GOOG,"the book ""Hatching Twitter"" by Nick Bilton.  The story he told was truly  
"
7326,GOOG,"amazing.
"
7327,GOOG,"Maybe it was the Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) movie that has installed the wrong idea for  
"
7328,GOOG,"future generations.  ""The Social Network"" almost made it seem cool to stab  
"
7329,GOOG,"your friends in the back for the ultimate quest for power and cash.   
"
7330,GOOG,"""Hatching Twitter"" basically showed how four friends that were named as  
"
7331,GOOG,"co-founders all did the same thing to each other. 
"
7332,GOOG,"Now that basically all the main characters in the book have had a turn at  
"
7333,GOOG,"being the CEO, history is repeating itself.  The CEO is stepping down and  
"
7334,GOOG,"Jack Dorsey is coming in again.  
"
7335,GOOG,"Square
"
7336,GOOG,"Jack is the CEO of Square, a mobile payment solution that has seen some  
"
7337,GOOG,"great growth.  The story also goes that they are trying to find a buyer for  
"
7338,GOOG,"the company because the financials are said to be ""ugly."" Jack is now  
"
7339,GOOG,"taking over as interim CEO of Twitter, an opportunity that was described as  
"
7340,GOOG,"an incredible one.  The question remains, if the opportunity is so  
"
7341,GOOG,"incredible, why not come out and say you want to be the permanent CEO?
"
7342,GOOG,"Jack will not be CEO until July 1, so his return means that the company  
"
7343,GOOG,"won't be sold before then... or will it?
"
7344,GOOG,"The Board
"
7345,GOOG,"Placing blame on the leadership is what this article is all about. The  
"
7346,GOOG,"thing is the CEO position has been a revolving door over the last few years  
"
7347,GOOG,"and the blame for that lays right at the feet of the board of directors.
"
7348,GOOG,"The inconsistency at the top is the core problem with TWTR and that idea  
"
7349,GOOG,"alone makes Google the best potential acquirer. The leadership at GOOG has  
"
7350,GOOG,"been nothing short of a blueprint for all others to follow.  
"
7351,GOOG,"The question becomes will the board be able to get out of its own way and move to sell the company before Jack comes back to the helm?  Part of me thinks that they would do it if the promised Jack that they wouldn't.  The other part of me thinks there is no way the board could make the right decision even if a gun was put to their heads.
"
7352,GOOG,"Just Sell It
"
7353,GOOG,"The market clearly doesn't have faith in the current management and to be  
"
7354,GOOG,"honest, the execution just isn't there.  Yes, the Periscope app is a great  
"
7355,GOOG,"new idea, but they were late on the deployment as Meerkat beat them to it.  
"
7356,GOOG,"To make things worse, Periscope was simply not ready for prime time and  
"
7357,GOOG,"felt like a product that was rushed to the market to prevent becoming a  
"
7358,GOOG,"distant second mover in the space.
"
7359,GOOG,"Now there is word that the company is going to focus on ""Live Events"" where  
"
7360,GOOG,"the company will focus on event-based curated content for the platform that  
"
7361,GOOG,"will help bring off line users online.  They suggest that its a brand new  
"
7362,GOOG,"way to look at tweets... but it really sounds like more of the same.  Ideas  
"
7363,GOOG,"that lead nowhere.
"
7364,GOOG,"Twitter is already the live feed for news and information.  It is the  
"
7365,GOOG,"replacement to the chat rooms that made AOL so very profitable way back  
"
7366,GOOG,"when. Now the chat room is open to everyone... but if they cannot figure  
"
7367,GOOG,"out how to monetize it, we will see this story become AOL part II.  No one  
"
7368,GOOG,"wants to see that.
"
7369,GOOG,"Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)
"
7370,GOOG,"Analysts estimates are the key driver behind the Zacks Rank... and I am

"
7373,GOOG,"This table clearly shows that earnings estimates are headed the wrong way.

7376,GOOG,"What is worse is that this doesn't seem to be a problem that is confined to  
"
7377,GOOG,"2015.  The 2016 numbers are also moving lower, as that loss is also seen  
"
7378,GOOG,"moving from $0.42 to $0.58.  
"
7379,GOOG,"A company that is growing revenue like TWTR is and seeing the bottom line

"
7382,GOOG,"Help Us Larry Page, You Are Our Only Hope
"
7383,GOOG,"There was a rumor not too long ago that Google  was looking to buy Twitter  
"
7384,GOOG,"for more than $98 per share.  At the time, the premium would have been  
"
7385,GOOG,"close to 100%... which made it seem like it wasn't going to happen.
"
7386,GOOG,"Google doesn't pay up that much for its acquisitions and they prefer to buy  
"
7387,GOOG,"smaller companies that they can help grow.
"
7388,GOOG,"Reports of Google not looking to make a move right here might be out of  
"

"
7393,GOOG,"Cut Off The Head
"
7394,GOOG,"I am calling for an activist investor (I am looking at you, Bill Ackman) to  
"
7395,GOOG,"take a big position in Twitter and re-work that board of directors.  It is  
"
7396,GOOG,"clear to most that if you want real change here, the board needs to go. 
"
7397,GOOG,"Yes I think the easiest route is just a sale to Google... but the board  
"
7398,GOOG,"needs to approve such a deal. All I am saying is that Ackman has a knack of

7429,GOOG,"The double whammy of data breach and the European Union’s new tax plan thrashed the big tech names this week. Tech-heavy Nasdaq-100-based fund PowerShares QQQ ETF (QQQ  -  Free Report) has lost about 2.1% so far this year (as of Mar 19, 2018), while Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK  -  Free Report) shed about 2% on the day.Inside Data BreachReports of Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that was associated with President Trump in the 2016 elections, gaining unauthorized access to 50 million Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) user accounts in one of its largest breaches yet hit the social-media giant hard on Monday. Facebook is now under the scrutiny of U.S. Congress and facing questions about the safety of personal data.The allegation came as a huge blow to the company at a time when it is already under pressure from reports of “Russians' use of Facebook tools to sway American voters with ""fake news"" posts before and after the 2016 U.S. elections.”While it is unclear if Republicans would take steps against Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, the calls point at growing ‘bipartisan concern’ in Washington over Internet firms’ fair execution of user data.Facebook shares declined as much as 6.8% on Monday on four times higher the regular average volume. This marks the largest intraday decline since August 2015 and resulted in about nearly $35 billion of market-cap loss. FB shares lost another 1.5% after hours.Europe’s Planned Revenue Tax on Digital CompaniesThe European Commission is likely to target Silicon Valley’s tech titans with a plan to refurbish how these are taxed in the foreign region. The bloc reportedly believes that tech companies contribute less than what these should to public funds. The EU estimated that an average effective tax rate of digital businesses is only 9.5% against 23.3% paid by traditional businesses.Per the likely rule, big tech companies operating in the European Union, such as Alphabet Inc. L) or Twitter Inc. (TWTR  -  Free Report), may be subject to a 3% tax on their gross revenues based on where they derive revenues from instead of where there are headquartered. Many tech giants are based out of low tax-charging countries like Luxembourg or Ireland.According to the latest draft, this new tax will be imposed on tech companies with global revenues of more than €750 million ($920 million) and total taxable annual revenues from offering digital services in the EU of more than €50 million. The plan is likely to be proposed on Mar 21.Stocks & ETFs Under Pressure Since companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Twitter are likely to come under pressure from the latest turn of events, cautious investors may shy away from ETFs heavy on these stocks in the near term.

7430,GOOG,"Shares of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) sunk 1% on Wednesday morning after one of the e-commerce power’s longest-serving executives left the company to a take a roll at Airbnb. However, Amazon shares have since rebounded after reports surfaced that it invested in another home electronics startup and will offer steep discounts on its Prime membership to select customers.Top Exec Out The former VP of Amazon Prime, Greg Greeley, who helped create the business and was also involved in integrating Whole Foods, announced recently that he was set to move on to pursue a new challenge. Vacation rental super startup Airbnb just introduced Greeley as the new president of its “Home” business.Greely joined Amazon just a few years after the company went public and has been an integral part of one of its biggest consume-facing business operations.Smart Thermostat Amazon, through its Amazon Alexa Fund, was reportedly part of the $62 million series C round of funding for smart thermostat brand Ecobee, according to a CNBC report.

However, the company also noted that it hopes to give more people access to additional “aspects of the digital economy — some conveniences and benefits — that I think a lot of us take for granted,” Amazon executive Aaron Perrine told Recode.If widely adopted, Amazon could expand the reach of its hugely popular e-commerce business and delivery services and further encroach on Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) by grabbing more lower-income customers.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

7431,GOOG,"Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) picked Miami-Dade County as the new testing ground for its self-driving vehicles, per Associated Press. This association with a county government is in sync with the auto giant’s strategy to roll out fully autonomous vehicles on the road by 2021.Per the news, Ford and its partners – restaurant chain Domino’s Pizza, ride-hailing company Lyft and on-demand delivery-service startup Postmates – are mulling over a pilot program to understand the reactions of the consumers on semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles. Beside this pilot program, Ford also planned to set up its first-ever autonomous vehicle terminal in the county.Dearborn, MI-based Ford is not the only automaker conducting a test run of self-driving vehicles.

(NSANY  -  Free Report) is likely to conduct such services very soon.However, the partnership between Ford and Miami-Dade County is likely to help the hugely congested Miami city to solve some specific problems and it will also aid in moving people effortlessly from suburbs to the downtown.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

"
7435,GOOG,"As you can, analysts have become increasingly negative in their earnings outlook over the past year.

"
7437,GOOG,"""After almost 3 years Mozilla is changing its strategy in Russia and will now pre-set Yandex as default search on its Firefox browser, replacing Google . We view the development as long-term positive for Yandex, but note that the incremental impact on Yandex traffic share is likely to be small, given the success of Yandexs own browser and dominating positions of Chrome/Android on the Russian browser market.""
