Results in the U.S. could also be a focus as that segment laps easy comparisons.Monster's biggest growth prospects lie outside the U.S., analysts say, in large part through the expanded access to Coca-Cola's (KO) bottling and distribution network that the company gained via a deal announced in 2014.The company earlier this year began distributing through Coca-Cola bottlers in parts of the Caribbean and in nations like Jordan and Pakistan. In August, Monster said it would expand in Africa and that it continued to ""make progress"" toward a relaunch in India planned for this year.Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said she'd be watching for updates on those regions as well as plans to begin distribution via Coca-Cola bottlers in Taiwan and Vietnam. Trends surrounding Mutant, an ultra-caffeinated response to PepsiCo's (PEP) Mountain Dew, and Hydro, an ultra-caffeinated response to water, are also points of interest.Monster's results also come as soda demand wanes amid a wellness boom. Cannabis also appears likely to grow as a rival to alcohol and caffeine in the beverage industry. Some companies already use THC and CBD in coffees, teas and sports drinks.

This inaugural column ran in the May 2, 2012, edition of IBD.Do you like to see movies? Do kids like movies? Sure. A few years ago, I did a study of themes in the market that occurred in nearly every cycle. One of the five recurring themes was the leisure and entertainment industry.For example, in the 1950s, Diners Club created America's first credit card, Brunswick's new automatic pin-spotter set off a bowling boom, and Polaroid's new ""picture-in-a-minute"" cameras gave people instant photos.Then in the '60s came all the color TV stocks, Disney (DIS), Winnebago's (WGO) motor homes, and McDonald's (MCD) fast food in the '70s. This Can't Be Yogurt and International Game Technology's (IGT) computerized casino gaming were new innovations of the '80s and '90s for consumers.More recently we've seen Apple's (AAPL) iPods, iTunes, iPhones and iPads, Priceline's (PCLN) ""name your own price"" for vacation travels, and Hansen Natural (now Monster Beverage (MNST)).These new, innovative leisure companies all had stock available that soared from 300% to as high, in some cases, as a mind-boggling 10,000%.People old enough to have lived during some of these periods will remember many of these companies and will have used many of their products — and yet they never stopped to think and buy these stocks that increased in price by 3, 10, 50 or 100 times.And this was just one industry sector in America! There are dozens of other sectors. They too had exciting new leaders pop up in new market cycles.I'll cover in detail how you can learn to recognize the many future outstanding big leaders that in the past may have been right under your nose, but you never capitalized on them.We'll use fundamental rules, charts and historical precedents to guide you to, perhaps in time, financial independence — if you work at it and not let yourself become discouraged.The more you learn the facts of past innovative leaders, the more you'll be able to recognize the next crop of winners. They will be there, so never give up — if you want to succeed.

52,MNST,"Apple (AAPL) initially fell more than 1% Monday but trimmed its losses to around 0.6% at 156.70 as the major indexes continued to avoid an eclipse of their strong year-to-date gains.XBy late afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 were nearly break-even, while the Nasdaq composite limited its loss to 0.2%. The Nasdaq 100 was also off 0.2% and is trying to stay near its flattening 50-day moving average.Volume was running sharply lower on both main exchanges; Friday saw the expiration of weekly and monthly equity and index options.Apple on Aug. 2 cleared a 156.75 flat-base entry and only has gained roughly 3.7%. As seen on a daily chart, the stock has shown zigzagging action, briefly slipping below the proper entry three times already. However, no sell signal has triggered for now.At 156.68, shares are just 3% below the all-time peak of 162.51, while small-cap indexes have dipped more. The S&P SmallCap 600, off 0.1%, has fallen 6% below its all-time peak of 878.At 5779, the Nasdaq 100 is up 18.8% since Jan. 1, far outstripping the S&P 500's 8.4% lift.Losing stocks are edging out winners on the Nasdaq by a 4-to-3 margin. But on the NYSE, advancers are leading decliners by a slim margin of fewer than 100 issues.As e-commerce activity does not show signs of letting up anytime soon, at least five top operators in the retailing space have fallen much more than the major equity benchmarks. All but one have triggered new sell signals.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) continued to fade, sinking nearly 4% to 235.49. The cosmetics and hair care products chain has broken through support at the 200-day moving average near 270 and failed to lift back above the long-term support line. Notice, too, how the stock's 50-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day line. That's bearish.Wall Street expects July-ended fiscal Q3 earnings rising 24% to $1.78 a share. That's a decent gain, but a little shy of the 25% increase one would expect from a CAN SLIM market leader. Plus, it would mark a considerable slowdown from EPS gains of 26%, 33% and 41% in the prior three quarters.Target (TGT) (18 Relative Price Strength) is trying to bottom out after falling as much as 17.6% in the past three months. Check out the week ended July 28, when the giant discount chain fell hard during the week but ended it with a solid 1% gain in sharply higher gain. Such reversals at the bottom of a stock's decline are bullish.But Target, which still depends a lot on consumers to visit their stores to keep sales flowing, needs to rise back above the 40-week moving average (roughly equivalent to a 200-day moving average on a daily chart) to show that institutional investors are seriously accumulating shares. For now, Target is just 11% below the 52-week high.Target is forecast to grow FY 2018 earnings by 11% to $3.92 a share. But the 1.8% annualized dividend yield is inferior to the S&P 500 (around 1.9%).Home Depot (HD), the biggest gainer in the 30-stock Dow, rose more than 1.3% to 149.62 and is currently forming a new base. It recently posted a 14% EPS increase for the second quarter, marking a 14th quarter in a row of double-digit earnings-per-share growth.The IBD Big Cap 20 doesn't currently hold any traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. However, consumer-oriented firms help pack the list, including Mastercard (MA), PayPal (PYPL), energy drink marketer Monster Beverage (MNST) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL).Michael Kors (KORS) and Five Below (FIVE) are trying to buck the general sell-off in the apparel and discount retail sectors, respectively.Michael Kors, famous for its jet set-styled handbags and clothing, may be working on a new bottoming-base pattern, which would be first stage. The stock had collapsed more than 60% from a February 2014 peak near 101. But shares are now up more than 15% in August so far and are on track for a third monthly advance. Quiet action from here would possibly yield a new buy point near recent upside resistance, at 46.Kors' Q2 profit dropped 11% to 80 cents a share, but that was a far smaller decline than viewed. Sales fell 4% to $952.4 million, marking a fourth quarter in a row of shrinking sales.Five Below, which sells toys, accessories and clothing for $5 each or less, rallied more than 3% to 48.58. A cup-with-handle base is forming. For now, the Philadelphia-based retailer shows a legitimate entry of 51.62, 10 cents above the two-week handle's high. The base barely passes the midpoint test (handle's midpoint is 49.29, base midpoint 49.21).Five Below holds a decent Composite Rating of 87 on a scale of 1 to 99 from Stock Checkup, second only to group peer Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI). Five Below shows an excellent A grade for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + ROE) but the 54 RS Rating needs more work.RELATED:Here Is The Easy And Fast Way To Spot Major Market Tops Before Stocks CrashIBD Sector Leaders: Why YY Is Leading The Market, Fundamentals And Technicals-WiseStocks Near A Buy ZoneThe Best Large Cap Growth Firms Today: Inside Big Cap 20

54,MNST,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average fell Wednesday morning on rising U.S. tensions with North Korea and negative news for several key companies.Walt Disney (DIS), Netflix (NFLX), Priceline[PCLN], Monster Beverage (MNST) and Zillow (Z) were among the notable stocks retreating on after-hours earnings and other news following the late-afternoon market retreat on North Korea concerns.XPresident Trump said Tuesday that North Korean threats will be met with ""fire and fury like the world has never seen."" That follows published reports that the rogue communist nation has created a small nuclear weapon that can fit in its missiles.The S&P 500 index and Dow industrials, which had hit record highs, reversed to close down 0.2% on Tuesday.

Apple is still in buy range from a 156.75 flat-base buy point cleared last week following its better-than-expected earnings and guidance. Apple fell 0.4% in premarket trading.Tesla advanced 2.8% to 365.22, in the upper half of its range. Tesla has been surging since outpacing Q2 estimates last week and remaining bullish on Model 3 production. Tesla is building the right side of a cup base with a 387.09 potential entry. Tesla fell 1% in premarket trading.Walt Disney reported mixed results, but the real news was its announcement that it will end its movie distribution pact with Netflix as it prepares to launch a streaming service of its own in 2019. Disney also announced that it will buy a controlling stake in streaming service BAMtech, adding a 42% stake for a 75% total. But a planned ESPN streaming option has been pushed back to 2018.As for Netflix, there will be little near-term impact, but the Disney relationship was among the internet TV service's most important. Losing or weakening that alliance will be a blow to Netflix's content, and a sign that other content providers aren't dependent on Netflix.Netflix shares fell 3.7% to 171.50 before Wednesday's open in the stock market today, though still above its recent 166.97 entry. Disney slid 3.7% to 103.Priceline reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings, but the travel booking giant plunged 7% to 1,905 in premarket trading on a weak Q3 outlook.

56,MNST,"Snack and beverage giant PepsiCo (PEP) reported second-quarter earnings on Tuesday that topped analyst forecasts. So did sales growth.X Estimates: Earnings per share of $1.39, a 3% increase, as revenue advanced a percentage point higher to $15.59 billion, according to analysts tracked by Zacks Investment Research.Results: Pepsi earned $1.50 a share, including 6 cents from a one-time Britvic sale. That's an 11% gain. Revenue climbed 2% to $15.71 billion. Organic revenue, which includes currency swings and structural changes, advanced 3.1%. Organic volume rose 2% for snacks and other food but fell 2% for beverages.Outlook: Pepsi sees 2017 adjusted earnings of $5.13 a share. Analysts expect $5.12, according to Zacks.Pepsi sees foreign exchange cutting full-year core profit by 2 percentage points vs. its prior estimate of 3 percentage points. The dollar weakened at the end of Q2. The weakening dollar likely will be a notable factor in multinationals' results and guidance during the current earnings season.Shares fell 0.5% to 113.69 in the stock market today. The stock on Monday pierced through support at its 50-day line in heavy volume.PepsiCo, whose brands include its namesake soft drink as well as Mountain Dew, Tropicana, Doritos and Quaker, has tried to offer more ""guilt free"" products to an increasingly wellness-focused population with a deepening distaste for soda.More than 45% of the company's net revenue comes from those products, the company said during its first-quarter earnings call in April. Meanwhile, U.S. soda sales more broadly have fallen for 12 straight years, according to Beverage Digest, an industry trade publication.PepsiCo has introduced healthier, non-carbonated drinks, tested natural sweeteners in sodas, tried out new frying methods to cut fat in potato chips, and offered up healthier, grain-based snacks, Zacks notes. Emerging markets abroad, where consumption is still low, and a growing middle class in some nations could also drive growth and help demand, Zacks said.But turmoil and currency swings internationally risk cutting into sales figures. Pepsi has tightened up its pricing, which can help protect revenue and make up for weaker volumes. But that tactic's durability could become a bigger issue over time.Volumes in the company's large Frito-Lay North America division fell 1.5% in the first quarter. That marked the first decline in some five years, Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy said in a report, according to Bloomberg. Management said in April that the dip was temporary and partly a product of shifts in holidays, and that volume had begun to rebound.But Amazon (AMZN) looms over consumer products too. The Amazon-Whole Foods Market (WFM) deal raises the prospect of more private-label goods vs. branded packaged consumer products from the likes of General Mills (GIS), Mondelez (MDLZ) and Pepsi's Frito-Lay. Packaged goods firms are cutting market spending, Marketwatch reported, citing James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt to support profits. Cakmak wrote in a Monday note that the cuts are in part reflect less of an emphasis of fighting for shelf space in the age of Amazon and other e-commerce options such as Jet.com and Walmart.com from Wal-Mart (WMT). But cutting ads and marketing may only spur the push to commoditize packaged goods, reducing margins further.Coca-Cola (KO) dipped 0.1%. Coca-Cola fell below its 50-day line last week.Monster Beverage (MNST) slid 0.1%. Monster Beverage recently found 50-day support after a failed late June breakout. Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) rose 0.2%.National Beverage (FIZZ) edged down 0.2%. National Beverage, fueled by its Lacroix sparking water, shot up nearly 7% to 103.28 on Monday, now extended from Friday's breakout from a 96.15 buy point of a flat base.RELATED:Is This Unique Soda Maker Set To Pop Its Top, Or Fizzle?Thirsty Investors Drive Coca-Cola Shares Higher As Buy Point FormsNot Your Father's PepsiCo: Company Expands Into Healthy Fare

That compared with consensus estimates for EPS of 38 cents per share and revenue of $109.8 million, according to Zacks Investment Research.Revenue from consumables, which generate the bulk of SodaStream's business, grew 6% to $72 million as unit sales of gas refill units increased 12%, which the company described as ""the strongest quarterly gain in several years."" In Q4, consumables revenue rose 5% and gas refill unit sales grew 10%.Meanwhile, revenue from sparkling water maker starter kits increased 37% to $40.6 million, holding steady vs. Q4's gain of 37%.Gross margin rose to 52.7% vs. 50.7% a year ago, which the company attributed to ""our continued production optimization, the leveraging of our fixed infrastructure for increased production volume and the introduction of the higher margin 'Fizzi' machine."" Shares fell 7% to 52.86 on the stock market today, paring losses after earlier diving as much as 13.2%. But the stock found support at its 50-day moving average and is now below the high end of the buy range, which maxes out at 53.92. Last month, SodaStream cleared a 51.35 buy point from a flat base but rose above buying territory soon after.Despite Wednesday's sell-off, shares of SodaStream have more than tripled in the last 12 month and are up by over 30% since the start of 2017. The top-notch price momentum contributed to a very solid IBD Composite Rating of 95, making it the No. 2 stock in the household-appliances industry group. By comparison, beverage giant Coca-Cola (KO) has slipped 4% in the last year amid shifting consumer tastes away from sugary drinks. Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) and Monster Beverage (MNST) have been choppy but are also down from a year ago.SodaStream stock has ridden the wave of consumer demand for fizzy water. Its home carbonation systems allow customers to turn tap water into flavored drinks for cheap.Last year, SodaStream revamped its marketing strategy — playing down ""soda"" — to court new, health-conscious consumers, according to news reports.RELATED:Is This Consumer Play The Biggest Growth Stock Turnaround Of 2017?

60,MNST,"The process of identifying supply and demand in a stock starts by analyzing price and volume in daily and weekly charts.Are up days or weeks happening in heavy volume? Does the stock close in the upper half of the trading range, either on a daily chart or a weekly one? And on the down days, are they happening in light volume? If some are in heavy volume, does the stock close in the upper half of the trading range? These examples strengthen the overall quality of the base.But price action might be volatile as the base takes shape, resulting in a ""wide and loose"" pattern. There might be too many signs of institutional selling in the base. Both are negatives and can keep a lid on a stock's breakout.One of the most critical skills is recognizing when a base is showing more accumulation (institutional buying) than distribution (institutional selling). Weekly gains in above-average turnover generally count as accumulation weeks; above-average volume declines are distribution weeks. But don't ignore the nuances.If a stock rises, say, 5% midweek but ends the week up just 0.2%, you could count it as an accumulation week, but it's not a strong example as sellers clearly sought to exit the stock.What if the stock had been down 4% for the week but closed virtually at its high for a tiny loss?Don't count it as a distribution week; buyers were around, lifting the stock off lows. William O'Neil, founder and chairman of IBD, has noted that if a stock finishes in the upper 60% of the weekly trading range and volume is above average, it can count as a ""support week,"" similar to an accumulation week — particularly when the stock is forming the left side of a new base. Such support weeks tend to see a wide move between the week's low and high.Monster Beverage (MNST) offered a base that showed net signs of distribution. Monster lost only 1% in heavy weekly volume during the week ended Feb. 12, 2016 — a nice showing after being down by as much as 8.6% during the week (1). In this case, it's not a distribution week. Instead, call it a ""support week"" because the stock ended near its weekly high.The prior week, however, was an unequivocal distribution week (2) as Monster sank 8.4% for the week and finished nearly at the low of the week's trading range. Monster dropped hard in the week ended Jan. 29 and volume shot 99% above its 10-week average (3). Yet since the stock finished in the upper 60% of the week's range, you could consider it to be a support week.Monster soared 17% during the week ended April 29, but the stock had problems making meaningful progress after that. By the time the stock tried to break out in June, Monster showed seven distribution weeks and four accumulation weeks. The up week that ended May 13 (4) doesn't have the look of a true accumulation week and thus is not counted. The overall negative count was a hint to astute traders that a breakout might not have legs.Monster gained just 8% from a split-adjusted 51.41 buy point. It didn't take long for sellers to gain control. Monster soon gave up its 10-week moving average and dropped 21% below the 51.41 entry.RELATED:Investor's Corner: Why This Top Medical Play Peaked After Forming 5 BasesWhen To Sell A Stock: Does It Break Through The 50-Day Line, Then Struggle To Rebound?How To Invest: Maintain The Focus, Discipline Of A World-Class Racing Pilot

The economic headline for the day, the Labor Department's April payrolls report, blew past expectations but with some mixed details. Nonfarm employers hired 211,000 workers during the month, more than double the initial March estimate of 98,000 new hires and a giant step above economist projections for 185,000 new jobs. But the department also revised its March estimate downward, to 79,000 from 98,000.The unemployment rate dipped to 4.4%. Consensus views projected an increase to 4.6%. Average hourly earnings climbed 0.3%, up from 0.2% in March and in line with estimates.Markets also are bracing for the final round of France's presidential election, set for Sunday, which could determine the future of the European Union.

Earnings were hurt by distributor terminations as the company continues the integration in its partnership with Coca-Cola (KO). But revenue rose 9%, stronger than forecast, and the company reported a strong pipeline of new products for 2017. Monster shares have been trading tightly below their 200-day moving average since March, but moved above the line Friday.Universal Display (OLED) sailed 18.5% higher, reporting first-quarter results after Thursday's close that trashed analyst targets. The stock made a new high, and is now extended after a rebound from support at its 50-day line.Sierra Wireless (SWIR) bolted ahead 10%. A 200% earnings gain and a 13% rise in revenue topped expectations, and management boosted its second-quarter earnings and revenue guidance past views. The stock is in the sixth week of a consolidation. Shares climbed back above the 50-day moving average Friday.Herbalife (HLF) rattled off an 8.5% gain. The diet supplement marketer's first-quarter earnings and revenue slipped less than forecast. Second-quarter guidance was weak due to sales shifted into Q1 from China, but full-year earnings guidance was at the high end of expectations. Herbalife shares closed on Thursday just below a 62.60 buy point in a two-month cup base within a larger pattern.Fiber-optic networking gear maker Applied OptoElectronics (AAOI) flashed up 9%. The Sugar Land, Texas-based outfit reported late Thursday big earnings and revenue gains that met or beat expectations. The stock sold off alongside other fiber-optic issues in early April. It climbed back above its 10-week moving average Friday as it works on a new base.Zillow (Z) zipped up 7% in early action. The online real estate data mapping site's first-quarter earnings jumped 185% on a 32% rise in revenue, both easily clearing analysts targets.

70,MNST,"""The best defense is a good offense"" doesn't just apply to football, war or a game of ""Risk."" It applies to investing, too.Even the strongest stocks can get knocked down by a choppy market. That's why it's important not just to adhere to strict buy and sell rules, but also to tighten them if need be.The market could be in the midst of a bullish uptrend, but if you don't pay attention to distribution days, that could quickly change. A distribution day occurs when the Nasdaq or S&P 500 drops 0.2% or more in heavier volume vs. the prior session. That implies a high level of selling by institutional investors.By itself, a distribution day or two spread out during an uptrend isn't a big deal. But if they begin to occur more frequently — usually a cluster of five or more in several weeks — it may be time to get defensive by locking in profits and cutting losses short.That means investors should cut their losses even shorter than normal, selling at a loss of 2.5% to 3% instead of the usual 7% to 8%. In such an uncertain market, it also makes sense to take profits at 5% to 10% instead of holding out for the typical 20% profit that most leading stocks can produce from buy points.After a late-June to early-August run-up, the Nasdaq suffered its third day of heavy selling on Aug. 2, giving up 0.9% in rising turnover. The next week, it eked out a 0.2% gain and closed in the lower half of its intraday range, a stalling day, which is a type of distribution that sometimes happens when an index closes low in its daily price range. On Aug. 16, the Nasdaq gave up 0.7% to add another distribution day. And on Aug. 24, it fell 0.8% in heavier trade.IBD'S TAKE: The Big Picture and accompanying Market Pulse help investors keep tabs on distribution days and other key events affecting the market. Read this Investor's Corner column for further details.IBD downgraded its market outlook to ""Uptrend under pressure"" that day, indicating that risk was higher and investors should pare their exposure.Monster Beverage (MNST) gained 8% from a June 6 breakout from a cup with handle before heading south in early August. On Aug. 23, the stock slipped below its 50-day moving average (1), but in lower-than-usual trade. So it didn't trigger a sell signal — yet.But the market outlook was changed to ""Uptrend under pressure"" the next session. On Sept. 9, shares fell more than 3% below the 51.41 (split-adjusted) buy point (2). Volume was only about average. But with the market racking up distribution days, it would have been prudent to sell when the loss was smaller than 7%.Monster has only sunk further since and is now well below the buy point.RELATED:Know This Sell Rule: When Distribution Days Pile Up In The Stock MarketWhy A Stalling Day Signals Institutional Selling

But the Labor Department also sharply revised higher job gains in the prior two months by an additional 44,000 jobs. Plus, economists heralded the 10-cent hike in average wages, noting that gives the Federal Reserve more reason to raise interest rates during its final meeting of the year (Dec. 13-14).Other big-cap techs also fell for the week, including Qualcomm (QCOM) (down 2.4%), Activision Blizzard (ATVI) (down 3.7%) and Intel (INTC) (down 3.1%).Qualcomm held steady at its 10-week moving average.

76,MNST,"Do you know your sell rules?If you are going to be one of the great investors in growth stocks, this is an absolute must.Pundits, talking heads, your friends at the gym and your hard-to-shut-up neighbor will continually feed you ideas on what to buy and when to buy it.But do they ever alert you to the right time to sell?If you don't have a proper exit strategy with each stock in the market, your chances of making money consistently are likely no better than when a thrill-seeking greenhorn sits at the blackjack, baccarat or roulette tables. You can boost your profits by selling near the top of a big stock's run, but the first step is to know the signs.That's where the use of high-quality charts comes in.Crucially, a stock will often give you a sell signal so clear that you can only ignore it at your peril. Consider the failure of a late-stage base as a stock's way of saying it's done.First things first. How do you count bases?When a stock has risen at least 20% from a proper buy point in a base, then starts to correct, a new base is forming. But if a stock rallies, say, only 10% or 15% after breaking out, then begins work on a new base, the count does not go up. Those two bases would count as a single ""base on base"" pattern.Three or four bases could be considered ""late stage."" And five or six? Definitely.Imagine what you risk by extending the stock some leeway. Maybe you bought the stock as it formed that late-stage base.Why would you do such a thing? A late pattern is itself a flaw. Well, maybe the base was especially tight, and the price-volume action looked ideal. Or the group was hot. But failure is failure. And failing from a late-stage base suggests that there's lots of room on the downside after a long run-up.Perhaps yours was a long-held position. So you have a bigger profit cushion than recent buyers. So what? That you have ""some room"" when the stock starts misbehaving is no reason to surrender a substantial portion of your hard-fought gains.The story of Monster Beverage (MNST) is classic. Maybe you bought the stock at 27.47 (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in February 2012) as it broke out from an early-stage flat base in January 2011. (See a long-term weekly chart; that entry point is not seen in the accompanying weekly chart.) It was the latest in a string of tight bases that proved, collectively, to be a long base-on-base pattern.The next base appeared in the seven weeks through the week ended Aug. 19, 2011 (1). A five-week flat base appearing a few months later (2) was tighter -- and, as a base on base to the August pattern, kept the base count relatively low.From this latter pattern, the stock soared 72% to 83.96, with an ugly downside reversal in the week ended May 4, 2012 (3).That negative reversal, along with the highest volume of any session since the breakout, was itself a major sell signal.The sideways to higher drift seen in the ensuing seven weeks was the stock's attempt to build another base. The attempt was poor, the pattern hard to define -- except that it was a late-stage structure.The final straw appeared in late June 2012, with the stock slicing its 10-week line in monster volume (4). Why might you have given Monster some room after such a show of weakness? Perhaps because the stock ended the week in the upper half of that trading range? Well, that was, strictly speaking, an upside reversal.But you had ""Monster"" profits in this stock, which you started accumulating either at 19.15 or at 27.47. And it was failing from a late-stage base. Enough said.(Editor's Note: This column was originally published in the April 25, 2013, edition of IBD. The Investor's Corner will highlight some of the most important sell rules for growth stock investors over the next few weeks.)RELATED:Why The Late-Stage Base Also Produces A Great Short Selling OpportunityYou Know The Golden Sell Rule; How About The Platinum Rule?How To Get Started: Learning IBD's Key Sell Rules

78,MNST,"Selling picked up in the stock market Wednesday after the Fed left rates unchanged as expected and left the door open for a possible rate hike in December.The Nasdaq slumped 0.9%, the S&P 500 shed nearly 0.7% and the Dow Jones industrial average gave up 0.4%. Volume was mixed vs. Tuesday, lower on the NYSE and higher on the Nasdaq, according to preliminary data.Consumer lenders, hospitals and oil stocks led the decline in the stock market today, as West Texas intermediate crude futures fell nearly 3% to $45.48 a barrel. The Energy Information Administration reported a much higher than expected weekly rise in U.S. oil inventories. Medical stocks outperformed, as did gaming software.After the close, Facebook (FB) climbed slightly after reporting Q3 adjusted earnings of $1.09 a share (up 91%) and a 55% rise in revenue to $7.01 billion, both above views for 97 cents on $6.92 billion. The social network's shares fell nearly 2% in the regular session, closing below its 50-day moving average for the first time since early July. Paycom Software (PAYC) gapped down and plunged 16% in tremendous volume. Shares broke below the bottom of a flat base and breached the 200-day moving average, before paring losses to close above the support line. The software maker's Q3 results topped views late Tuesday, but the stock sold off amid concerns of slowing sales growth.On the upside, video game maker Electronic Arts (EA) jumped 3% at the open but pared gains to 1.7% by session's end. Shares have closed well below their 50-day line the past week. The ""Battlefield 1"" publisher late Tuesday reported better-than-expected fiscal Q2 earnings and revenue and raised its full-year sales guidance. Several analysts boosted their price targets following the results.Activision-Blizzard (ATVI) finished flat, stemming a six-session slide. The stock has slipped slightly below a 43.15 flat-base entry.

80,MNST,"Sometimes great stocks approaching their peaks flash too many sell signs to ignore. Sometimes they flash subtle ones.One such sign is a fast series of big stock splits. Many investors see splits bullishly. Companies use stock splits to lower share prices. But you should treat them with caution.Theoretically, lower prices mean more demand. A 2-for-1 split halves the price of a stock from $100 to $50 while doubling the number of shares outstanding. Investors who previously couldn't afford a share might now be tempted. (Companies can effect splits in ratios of up to 10-to-1 or more.) But a split does not change the current value of the company in any way.There are reasons that companies like Apple (AAPL), Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) and Priceline Group (PCLN) have share prices that range from $115 to almost $1,500. If Apple had not split its shares 7-for-1 back in June 2014, the stock today would be trading near Alphabet's price of 814 as of Monday's close. (The grandpappy of the stock-split resistance is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), with its Class A share price now topping $216,000.)These stocks attract investors willing to pay for quality. That might narrow the potential audience, but it tends to increase the smart-money sponsors that are backing the stock. Stock splits attract smaller investors. In effect, they change the neighborhood.To be sure, early stock splits are often not a problem.Stocks can and often do move higher after initial splits -- particularly when they happen early in a bull market. But problems occur when companies enact multiple big splits -- say, a 2-for-1 and a 3-for-1 -- within a one- to two-year period.This floods the market with a company's shares. IBD research shows a stock will often reach a price peak around its second or third split. Research also shows that only 18% of history's biggest winners had even a single stock split in the year preceding the start of their run.One good example of a hot stock tripping on a stock split is Monster Beverage, once named Hansen Natural. Monster, one of the original energy-drink success stories, jetted more than 4,000% from 2003 to 2006.The company enacted its first stock split in August 2005 (1), just a month after the stock first touched $100 per share (chart is split-adjusted). The stock's response shows why a single stock split, like most sell signals, is not a sign to cut and run.Just after the split, Monster shares dropped through their 10-week line in heavy trade, but stopped a short distance below the line. The stock formed a new base, then broke out and moved higher.The second, truly monster 4-to-1 split, occurred just after the stock punched through the 210 pre-adjusted price level in July 2006 (2).Shares responded immediately with a pullback to the 10-week line in heavy trade. Monster dived a few weeks later en route to a 53% correction.(Editor's Note: This column originally published in the May 3, 2013, edition of IBD.)RELATED:Know This Sell Signal?

81,MNST,"In an era when more than 80% of the active managers fail to beat their benchmark index, finding a mutual fund that consistently achieves the elusive element of alpha is akin to finding the Holy Grail.USAA Growth Fund (USAAX) is one of those funds. This portfolio of large-cap growth stocks has beaten its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. year to date, as well as in the past one, three, five and 10 years. And it has beaten the S&P 500 stock index in the past one, three, five and 10 years. In 2015, it returned 5.63% vs. the S&P's 1.38%.Lately much of its outperformance has been driven by such stock market leaders as Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alibaba (BABA).The portfolio managers are Michael Schroer of Renaissance Investment Management and Aziz Hamzaogullari of Loomis Sayles. They each separately manage half the portfolio. Schroer has been with the fund since 1991 and Hamzaogullari since 2010.The fund's strategy is to look for high-quality companies that can generate sustainable and profitable growth. When the managers see stocks selling at a significant discount to their estimate of intrinsic value, they snap them up. This leads to a small portfolio of just 92 companies. The fund also has a very long-term investment horizon, seen in its 31% portfolio turnover rate.Still, even a fund that consistently outperforms has moments when it doesn't. So far this year, it's underperforming the S&P 500 5.90% to 6.61%.""We favor companies that are high quality growth selling at a reasonable valuation,"" said Schroer. ""In the first half of the year lower P/E growth didn't do well. Higher P/E companies led the market, but by the later part of the year that reversed and lower P/E companies are doing better and we've benefited from that. We're in the sweet spot for the market where lower P/E, higher quality are doing better.""Another part of the strategy, this one favored by the Loomis Sayles team, is described as high ""active share."" Active share is a way of measuring how much a portfolio differs from its benchmark index. ""Our active share has been at or above 80%,"" Hamzaogullari told IBD late last year. ""While it does not ensure outperformance, we believe it is a necessary condition for generating alpha and outperforming the benchmark, net of fees, over the long term.""U.S. stocks make up 90% of the fund, with the rest in foreign equities. Technology makes up 27% of the portfolio.Amazon as of July 31 stood as USAA Growth's largest holding, at about 4% of assets. The stock made up the entire retail-internet segment of the fund. Amazon is up 21% this year, sitting just above support at its 50-day moving average after pulling back 3% from its all time high set Oct. 6. Analysts expect Amazon to post Q3 earnings 371% higher than a year earlier when it reports results Thursday.Facebook is the No. 2 holding also at about 4% of assets. The social networking and media leader is up 24% year to date near the 28.43 buy point of a flat base. Fiscal Q1 earnings are expected to rise 70% from a year earlier when results are reported, expected Nov. 2 after the market's close.Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giants and another top fund holding, is up 28% so far this year. The stock has found support at its 50-day moving average, 6% below its 52-week high. The company is expect to show a fiscal Q2 earnings increase of 23% when it reports Tuesday.Not all USAA Growth top holdings have been barn burners. Database bellwether Oracle (ORCL) is up 5% this year. It's been in the fund since 2007.The rest of the top 10 holdings and their percentages are: Cisco Systems (CSCO), 3.24%; Visa (V), 3.11%; Qualcomm (QCOM), 2.89%; Monster Beverage (MNST), 2.52%; Alphabet (GOOGL), 2.48%; United Parcel Services (UPS), 2.37%.""We think technology and consumer discretionary look attractive,"" said Schroer. ""Health care still looks attractive. Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) still look very cheap. In this market there are still high quality companies.""Schroer likes Foot Locker (FL). The athletic shoe retailer posted very good second-quarter sales and still trades at a ""very reasonable multiple of 14."" The stock is up only 4.4% this year.""Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) and both are doing well over the last several months,"" said Schroer. ""They had sold off on fears of the Zika virus hurting tourism, but they didn't suffer too much. Now bookings for next year are running high and multiples are very attractive, Royal's trailing P-E is 13 and Carnival's is 14.""We've taken some things off the table, but we still think there are selective opportunities in this market,"" he said. ""We've gone through six quarters of negative earnings growth and we're watching this quarter carefully for signs of a rebound.

82,MNST,"Several top stocks from IBD's Leaderboard, a curated list of growth stocks to watch, could provide actionable trading opportunities in the coming week: Alibaba (BABA), Monster Beverage (MNST), Diamondback Energy (FANG) and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX).Among big-name tech stocks, Facebook (FB), Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) still remain within buy range.Alibaba was added to Leaderboard as an options play ahead of its quarterly report last Thursday. Shares entered buy range from a long consolidation on Wednesday, gapped up to a 15-month high after the report and then continued higher Friday in heavy volume. If the stock quickly continues its run, it could soon enter the 20% profit-taking zone, but if it pulls back, as some leaders do, it could provide another buying opportunity.Monster Beverage first cleared a cup-with-handle buy point of 154.06 on June 6, and it is currently flirting with the top end of the 5% buy range after finding support at its 50-day line. Despite missing EPS estimates earlier this month, shares are trading just 3% below their high reached in the wake of the report.Diamondback Energy is currently trading within buy range from a buy point at 92.92, and it's also forming a flat base with an entry at 96.11. The oil and gas exploration company is not a typical Leaderboard pick since it's a turnaround stock, but analysts expect profit to soar 126% next year.Mining company Freeport-McMoRan is another turnaround name that has performed well in 2016. Shares attempted a breakout past a cup-with-handle base on July 27, but they have since pulled back. Still, the declines have been relatively mild, which leaves open the possibility of another breakout. In the meantime, the stock is looking for support at its 50-day line.IBD'S TAKE: Besides Leaderboard, IBD has several other sources for finding winning stocks primed for taking profits. The computer-generated IBD 50 highlights the top 50 growth stocks based on fundamental and technical factors, including earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance. With MarketSmith, you can find out which stocks are currently breaking out, are near buy points and more. And SwingTrader is a curated list of actionable trades that take advantage of short-term trends.Facebook is also a member of Leaderboard and leads its two peers with a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. Shares cleared a flat-base buy point of 121.18 on July 20, and they are currently trading up only 3% from that level.Alphabet earns a 98 Composite Rating and is still in a buy zone after clearing a 791.05 buy point after gapping up on earnings. It is, however, extended 7% past a double-bottom entry at 753.58.Microsoft, which has posted sales declines for the past five quarters, has a 59 Composite Rating. Shares are up 2% from a consolidation entry at 56.95.Keep an eye on this sideways action, especially as the major indexes continue to climb to new highs.And two highly rated small-cap stocks, Alarm.com (ALRM) and Fabrinet (FN), are showing notable action ahead of their earnings reports after the close on Monday.Alarm.com hit a new all-time intraday high Friday in heavy volume and is extended 27% past a consolidation base buy point at 24.32. Now is the time to take at least partial profits if you haven't done so already -- especially ahead of earnings.Fabrinet re-entered buy range Friday from a flat base with a 39.15 buy point initially cleared on July 25, rising to a new all-time high in intraday trade in heavy volume.
"
83,MNST,"Monster Beverage (MNST) should report strong second-quarter earnings and revenue growth when it reports results Thursday, despite some analyst warnings.Analysts see Monster's second-quarter earnings jumping 30.4% to $1.03 per share and sales up nearly 16% to $804.1 million.But last month, Wells Fargo downgraded Monster Beverage to market perform from outperform, warning on lower-than-expected sales and no new products until the fourth quarter.Monster is planning to launch its products in China later this year but warned during its first-quarter conference call that the launch could be delayed by regulatory approvals and finalization of distribution agreements.Monster has been expanding its presence abroad and during the first quarter made market share gains in Germany, France, Denmark, Belgium, Hungary, Ireland, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden as it continues to battle for market against European favorite Red Bull.IBD'S TAKE: Monster Beverage shares are in buy range despite a mini-selloff on the Wells Fargo note as energy drinks continue to gain popularity in the U.S. and overseas. The company has held a place on IBD's Leaderboard since early June. Much of Monster's international growth has come from Coca-Cola's (KO) ownership stake in the company.But the U.S. has the biggest energy drink market in the world. Adam Fleck, director of consumer equity research at Morningstar, said in an earlier interview that U.S. energy drink volumes will continue to grow in the high-single to low-double digits in the foreseeable future.Monster Beverage stock rose 0.3% to 161.08 on the stock market today, just in range from a 154.06 entry point.
"
84,MNST,"Stocks finished mixed Thursday, with a few notable earnings reports punctuating an otherwise sleepy day in the stock market today as investors braced for Friday morning's jobs report.Before the market opens Friday, economists are expecting nonfarm payrolls to rise by 185,000 jobs in July, down from an impressive 287,000 in June. The unemployment rate is expected to drop a tick to 4.8%, while average hourly wages are forecast to rise 0.3% compared to a 0.1% increase the month before.The jobs numbers are being closely watched for clues to whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, although Fed watchers are betting they will hold fast for months to come. Overnight, the Bank of England cut its key short-term rate to 0.25%, the first reduction since 2009. It also pledged to buy $79 billion in government bonds in the next six months to stimulate a U.K. economy on the brink of recession.The Nasdaq finished Thursday ahead 0.1%, with the S&P 500 closing up a tick, and the Dow Jones industrial average dropping a tick. Volume was lighter than Wednesday's on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq exchange, according to preliminary data.Priceline (PCLN) jumped after hours. It reported Q2 EPS of $13.90 compared with estimates of $12.69. Revenue came in at $2.56 billion vs. estimates of $2.58 billion.Monster Beverage (MNST) was volatile after hours, rising 2% after it missed on earnings and sales, but the company announced it would buy back $250 million in stock. Earnings were 99 cents a share vs. estimates of $1.03. Sales were $743.5 million compared with estimates of $804 million.Activision Blizzard (ATVI) reported Q2 earnings of 45 cents, 3 cents above estimates, and revenue of $1.57 billion vs. estimates of $1.46 billion.

90,MNST,"Some things are best judged if they aren't regarded in isolation. A film advertisement, for instance, once boldly trumpeted ""an endearing romantic comedy"" across a page and attributed the seemingly high praise to a movie review in a newspaper.The review actually read, ""political propaganda wrapped into an endearing romantic comedy that starts losing its laughs,"" but that was conveniently left out of the ad.Investing data can also be misleading if you are viewing only out-of-context facts.If a company reports a jump in revenue growth, an experienced investor will ask two questions: Is the company slashing prices to step up sales growth? Did the company make an acquisition that's boosting sales?Sales growth from an acquisition can be positive, especially if the acquisition is adding a higher-margin business.But sales growth driven by lower prices suggests the company's products are seeing weaker demand or that the products are being commoditized.Many products start out being high-margin items. But as more competitors emerge, they become lower-margin commodities. You want to catch a stock on the right end of that trend.So, when an investor notices an increase in sales, the first thing to check is IBD's SMR Rating, which stands for sales, margins and return on equity.IBD combines those three elements into one rating because they are interrelated. You can find the ratings at Investors.com in the stock quotes area and in Stock Checkup, and on the MarketSmith charts.The SMR rating's scale runs from A to E, with A being the best. Generally, you should avoid buying stocks with an SMR rating of D or E. Sometimes a turnaround candidate will have a C rating, but most top-rated stocks carry an A or B.The gauge is useful because sales growth built on low margins will hurt the SMR Rating. Return on equity is relevant because it measures how efficiently a company is using its net assets to make a profit.After the Dec. 20, 2011, follow-through day confirmed an uptrend was underway, the market remained in the uptrend for 67 sessions.In the first month after the follow-through, a number of quality stocks cleared buy points. They included InvenSense (INVN), Michael Kors (KORS), Monster Beverage (MNST), Sturm Ruger (RGR), Tractor Supply (TSCO) and Visa (V). Some of those entries were triggered by breakouts from bases and others from three-weeks-tight patterns. One was a short-stroke pattern.All of the companies mentioned above went on to rally 27% or more from their breakout points.(Editor's Note: This column originally published in the July 10, 2012, edition of IBD.)
"
91,MNST,"Talk about a tricky balancing act. That's what MFS Mid Cap Growth Fund (OTCIX) performs.The market has gone up and down like a kid on a trampoline for the past six months. Yet the $2.1 billion mutual fund's marching orders are to find companies that have the best opportunities for growth two to three years in the future and whose valuations underplay those growth prospects.So how does the mutual fund pursue those goals without getting crushed in the market's volatility in the meantime?""The benefit of a longer-term time horizon is that you can look through the market's short-term noise,"" said co-manager Paul Gordon, who runs the fund with colleagues Eric Fischman and Matthew Sabel. ""We also tend to look for companies that are heavily in control of their own fate, so events in the world shouldn't disproportionately impact them. They can grow through those issues.""It's not that the fund is looking for stocks that play dead for two or three years, Gordon says. What the fund wants is stocks whose earnings keep on growing for at least two or three years more. ""We're willing to trade a stock with a high current rate of growth for one where we can be confident in the duration of its (slightly slower) growth,"" Gordon said.That approach has enabled the fund to keep its footing during the market's gyrations. Going into Friday, the fund was up 6.23% so far this year, topping 72% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc., which averaged 4.54%. By comparison, the S&P 500 was up 7.49%. Over the past three years, the fund's 11.43% average annual gain beat 92% of its direct rivals, which averaged a 7.74% gain, while the big-cap bogey advanced at a 10.98% yearly pace.Also, the fund's IBD 36-Month Performance Rating is A. That means the its performance is among the top 10% of all mutual funds in that time.Helping to drive that record? Nine of the fund's top-10 holdings as of June 30 had a strong IBD Composite Rating of 80 or better. The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Price Strength Ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Composite Rating.The portfolio also includes Mobileye (MBLY), Vulcan Materials (VMC) and Monster Beverage (MNST). The latter two are on IBD's Leaderboard.Mobileye stock is up 9% this year, though 28% off its 52-week high.IBD'S TAKE: Mobileye dipped sharply last week, despite beating Wall Street's Q2 expectations. The downer was news that Mobileye will not extend its relationship with Tesla Motors. IBD's Paul Whitfield recently explained that Mobileye still has other irons in the fire, including a deal with BMW.The Israel-based developer of software and related technologies for camera-based advanced driver assistance systems -- which play a central role in the rise of self-driving robo-cars -- has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 96.""Tesla is one of many Mobileye customers,"" Gordon said. ""They are not a significant percentage of sales currently."" Mobileye's pullback Tuesday was due to investors' fears that Tesla had found another supplier to provide autonomous driving chips at a lower price. Gordon doubts that's the case. ""And it's more difficult to imagine that a Ford (F), GM (GM) or even BMW (BMWYY) can do what Mobileye can.""Vulcan Materials, a building materials company, is up 26% so far this year. It pays a dividend yield of 0.6%, and it has a 97 Composite Rating from IBD, the second-highest possible.""Aggregates are a good business,"" Gordon said. ""It is highly localized, and Vulcan has a significant market share in its regions. As such, it has positive pricing (power), including through the last downturn.""With product volumes near all-time lows in a cyclical business, ""that tells us that Vulcan's risk-reward potential is skewed to the upside,"" Gordon said.The stock plunged 5% Monday to its 50-day moving average after Q2 revenue and earnings came in below analyst expectations.Monster Beverage is up 8% so far this year, having rallied from a steep decline in February.EPS growth rebounded 25% in the latest quarter, bouncing back from a 6% decline the prior quarter.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Gillian Rich says Monster is riding a caffeine high, fueled by rising consumption of energy drinks.""Energy drink consumption continues to gain share of total beverage consumption,"" Gordon said. ""And their deal with (Coca-Cola (KO)) lets them significantly increase distribution internationally with little operational risk or costs to Monster.""Teen-targeting discount chain Five Below (FIVE) is up about 58% so far this year. EPS rose 26% and 50% the past two quarters, respectively.Shares have trended lower in recent years amid investor concerns about same-store sales, Gordon says. ""What's changed is that same-store sales have recovered,"" Gordon said, while the chain still has a large opportunity to open new stores. ""Another point,"" Gordon said, ""is that Five Below has the potential to be one of the longest duration growth names in the portfolio.""Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) is up about 70% this year. EPS growth has accelerated for three quarters.""They've traditionally had very strong market share in PC gaming,"" Gordon said. ""Now they are focusing that same technology on new growth markets, including data centers and automotive. They have big opportunities in virtual reality and autonomous driving.""""We love to own stocks for five years or more,"" Gordon said."" That's why duration of growth is so important to us.""
"
92,MNST,"Coca-Cola (KO) slashed its outlook for the year, while its soft-drink peer Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) did quite the opposite and gave full-year earnings guidance a boost.Coca-Cola reported an adjusted 60 cents in per-share earnings, down 5% from the prior year's Q2 but 2 cents above views.However, a 5% revenue decline to $11.52 billion was worse than expected, with CEO Muhtar Kent citing in a statement ""challenging macroeconomic conditions, structural changes and foreign-exchange headwinds"" as weighing on the quarter, as well as ""difficult external conditions"" in emerging markets. Analysts had projected $11.64 billion.That marks the fifth straight quarter of year-over-year earnings and revenue declines for Coca-Cola.Global unit case volume was flat for the quarter.Coca-Cola now expects a 4%-7% EPS decline and 3% in organic revenue growth in 2016, down from prior guidance for 4%-6% EPS growth and 4%-5% in organic revenue gains. Organic revenue excludes currency shifts. Wall Street sees a a 3% EPS decline and 4% revenue dip for the year.Shares closed down 3.3% to 43.40 on the stock market today, tumbling through the 200-day moving average. Coca-Cola hasn't closed below that support line since Oct. 2, 2015.IBD'S TAKE: The Beverages-Non-Alcoholic group ranks 136 out of 197 of IBD's industry groups. Coca-Cola has only earned a 39 Composite Rating. A non-boozy beverage stock that is currently in buy territory and boasts an 89 Composite Rating, however, is Monster Beverage. The New America takes a detailed look at the energy drink maker.""(Coca-Cola) delivered a solid Q2 above our expectations despite flat volume growth, as it was able to leverage solid performance in developed markets and positive pricing, together with ongoing productivity initiatives to deliver bottom-line results,"" wrote Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog.""While we are disappointed with the outlook, we continue to believe that the outlook for fiscal 2017 and beyond will improve with KO's revised business model once refranchising is complete,"" Herzog said.Meanwhile, Dr Pepper Snapple earned $1.25 in adjusted Q2 per-share profit, up 11%, coming in a nickel above estimates. Revenue grew over 2% to $1.7 billion, topping expectations for $1.68 billion.The beverage maker now sees $4.27-$4.35 in adjusted per-share profit, up from prior guidance for $4.20-$4.30 EPS and vs. current consensus for $4.35.Shares of Dr Pepper fell 1% to 96.20, dropping just below a recent 95.97 buy point.
"
93,MNST,"Monster Beverage (MNST) is getting a boost from consumers' need for speed, but company's stock and energy products could easily fall from their caffeine high.Known for its distinctive tall can and ripped M logo, Monster is helping lead the energy-drink revolution as sodas and other carbonated drinks fall out of favor with Americans and consumers in many developed markets.Carbonated soft-drink volumes in the U.S. fell 1.54% in 2015, on top of a 0.97% drop in 2014, according to Beverage Marketing Corp. Meanwhile energy-drink volumes have risen dramatically, up 7.94% in 2015 and 7.34% in 2014, on top of double-digit increases in recent years.""Energy drinks have had very strong growth for over a decade now and the primary reason for that is there is a huge demand for energy and the products are well-formulated to deliver on that,"" said Gary Hemphill, managing director of research at Beverage Marketing.Monster cans come in 16 fluid ounces and contain two servings. Each serving has 86 milligrams of caffeine vs. 95 milligrams found in a typical cup of coffee. The drinks often contain other stimulants like guarana, taurine and B vitamins.""Consumers gravitate more toward things that are healthier for you, and consumers want variety and a change of pace,"" Hemphill said.Monster declined requests for an interview.But the company offers a variety of products including a low-carb version, Muscle Monster energy shakes and a football-themed version inspired by Rob Gronkowski, the energetic New England Patriots tight end who manages to simultaneously maintain a fun-loving lifestyle and still set National Football League records.Monster and Austria's Red Bull are the two global leaders in the energy drink market. Red Bull has more market share in Europe, as it tapped into the EU market before Monster did.But Monster leads in the U.S., the largest energy-drink market in the world with volumes at 629.3 million gallons last year, Beverage Marketing says. Monster is typically sold in the U.S. in a can twice the size as Red Bull, but at the same price.Smaller players in the energy beverage spectrum include Rockstar, along with Rip It by National Beverage (FIZZ) and 5 Hour Energy shots by capital management firm Innovations Ventures.Monster generally has been a highly rated stock, but Wells Fargo downgraded it to market perform from outperform this past Monday. That sent the stock tumbling as the analyst warned on lower-than-expected sales and no new products until the fourth quarter.But shares have gained back some ground since then, and remain in buy range. Shares ended trading up at the close Friday and were down fractionally at the close Monday to 160.07.Monster was founded under the name Hansen Natural in 1935 before switching its name to Monster Beverage in 2012 to emphasize its focus on energy drinks. During its first-quarter conference call in April, Monster said that according to Nielsen data, U.S. sales of its energy drinks grew 10.8% while sales of Red Bull increased 4.1% and sales PepsiCo's (PEP) Amp decreased 8.1%.Monster also is making headway overseas and saw market share gains during the first quarter in a slew of European nations. They include: Germany, France, Denmark, Belgium, Hungary, Ireland, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden.Much of Monster's international growth has come from Coca-Cola's (KO) ownership stake in the company. Last year Monster completed a deal to move its bottle and distribution to Coke bottlers and sold its non-energy drink assets, including Hansen's soda, to Coke. Coke sold its energy products such as its Burn drink, to Monster.""This opens up new channels, new areas to get product into more storefronts,"" said Adam Fleck, director of consumer equity research at Morningstar.""There have been lawsuits and continuing regulator concerns around the product,"" Fleck said. ""A company the size of Coke has some concerns about going all in on energy drinks. Instead they have chosen to take a minority stake in Monster and get out of the business entirely.""Fleck believes U.S. energy drink volumes will continue to grow in the high-single to low-double digits in the foreseeable future.Monster consumers tend to skew younger and male, Fleck said. Monster sponsors extreme sporting events and athletes in motocross, BMX, mountain biking, surfing and snowboarding. It also has an athlete development program for kids ages 13-21.IBD's TAKE: Monster shares are trying to recover from a mini-selloff after tumbling in the wake of an analyst's downgrade this past Monday, and remain about $4 short of a new high. The strongest player in the nonalcoholic beverages group is National Beverage. Its Stock Checkup is available here.But with the addition of a line of Java-themed products that include coffee, cream and a ""Monster energy blend"" the brand is looking to expand its reach past its key demographic.Monster is planning to launch its products in China later this year but warned during its first-quarter conference call that the launch could be delayed by regulatory approvals and finalization of distribution agreements.Monster settled two wrongful-death lawsuits last year after teenagers died of cardiac problems after drinking the energy drinks.Studies have shown that increases in blood pressure after drinking energy drinks can make people more susceptible to cardiovascular problems, and the World Health Organization said high caffeine levels can cause heart palpitations, hypertension and heart attacks in extreme cases.Middlebury College in Vermont has banned the sales of energy drinks on campus as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say mixing energy drinks with alcohol makes people three times more likely to binge drink.Because Monster relies so heavily on one product Fleck said investors need to have ""a larger margin of safety"" than with a more diversified beverage company like Coke, which relies on its signature drink along with bottled water and juices.""Health concerns are a real downside risk in the Monster story,"" he said. ""While the international growth rates remain pretty good, a U.S. slowdown will be a big risk.""

95,MNST,"Major stock indexes capped the week with solid gains Friday, helped by news of robust job growth in July.Merck (MRK) was the best percentage gainer in the Dow Jones industrial average, rising 10%, followed by financials like JPMorgan (JPM), American Express (AXP) and Goldman Sachs (GS), which showed gains of better than 2%.The Nasdaq composite rose 1.1% to a record close. The S&P 500 also marked an all-time closing high, up 0.9% and the Dow picked up 1%. Preliminary data showed volume on the Nasdaq coming in slightly higher than Thursday's levels. Volume on the NYSE was slightly lower.Merck was a beneficiary of bad news from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY). The latter crashed 16% after its blockbuster drug Opdivo, already approved to treat some forms of cancer, did not meet its primary endpoint. Merck's competing drug Keytruda succeeded in a similar trial recently.IBD's super regional banks group was one of the day's top performers, rising more than 3%. Big gainers included SVB Financial (SIVB), KeyCorp (KEY) and Regions Financial (RF). Utilities lagged across the board.Meanwhile, the economy added 255,000 jobs in July, the second straight month of robust job growth.Despite the strong data, fed funds futures traders still aren't optimistic about a rate hike in September. According to the CME Group FedWatch tool, the odds for a September hike are currently around 18% but rise to 40% at the December meeting.Gold slumped and treasury yields jumped on the jobs data. Gold for December delivery settled at $1,344.40 an ounce, down $23 or 1.7%. The 10-year Treasury yield rose 7 basis points to 1.57%.In earnings news, Priceline (PCLN) has made several breakout attempts in recent months to no avail, but one came to fruition Friday on the heels of a strong earnings report. It gapped up over a 1,367.09 buy point, rising 4%.Leaderboard member Monster Beverage (MNST) added 2.5%. Earnings per share reported late Thursday missed expectations, but sales growth accelerated nicely from the prior quarter, rising 19% to $827.5 million.Monster was in buy range from a 154.06 buy point ahead of the results, but the stock is slightly extended now.IBD'S TAKE: Two stocks in Monster's industry group, Beverages-Non-Alcoholic, have higher Composite Ratings than Monster. See who they are with IBD Stock Checkup.

96,MNST,"Consumer-related stocks helped the major indexes sprint ahead Friday, following a much better-than-expected July payrolls report. Plus, earnings results continued to beat Wall Street views overall.Burger King chain owner Restaurant Brands International (QSR), Wingstop (WING), Leaderboard member Monster Beverage (MNST) and Electronic Arts (EA) were just some of the companies padding strong weekly gains following robust profits in their latest quarter.The Nasdaq composite led, up 1.1%, as big-cap techs continued to flourish. Apple (AAPL) jumped 1.5% to 107.46 in brisk trade, getting closer to a potential double-bottom buy point at 112.49. Keep in mind that the stock has been stuck in an even longer consolidation since topping at 134.54 in the spring of 2015.IBD'S TAKE: It's critical to view both a daily and weekly chart for a stock to understand its true price strength and potential. Go to the Research section at Investors.com to view charts; up days or up weeks are highlighted in blue, down days and down weeks in red. The Relative Strength line, drawn in blue, helps you compare a stock's action vs. the S&P 500. Prefer those stocks with a rising RS line.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rallied 0.8% and 0.9%, respectively. Volume was running sharply higher on the Nasdaq just after 12 noon ET vs. the same time on Thursday; on the NYSE, turnover was edging slightly faster.Restaurant stocks got a badly needed shot in the arm with big gains by both Restaurant Brands and Wingstop. The former, which also operates the Tim Hortons coffee and doughnuts chain, added nearly 0.6% to 46.59, following Thursday's 3.3% jump on the back of a 37% surge in second-quarter earnings per share despite flat revenue growth.  In constant-currency terms, the company's Burger King franchise saw 5.9% growth in the top line, and revenue for the Tim Hortons unit increased 4.8%. Same-store sales also edged higher for both chains. Total Q3 profit is seen growing 105% to 39 cents a share.Restaurant Brands is nearly 6% past a 44.06 flat-base buy point, so it's narrowly extended from proper buy range.Dallas-based Wingstop blasted more than 14% higher to 30.63 in volume that jumped more than six times its usual level. The chicken wing chain reported a 36% rise in Q2 profit, beating views by 7%, as sales rose 18%. Sales have now increased 14% to 22% vs. year-ago levels for the seventh quarter in a row. The small-cap stock cleared a 27.96 handle entry on a yearlong cup.Wingstop went public on June 12, 2015, at 19 a share. The stock's float of 15 million shares is very small, meeting the S factor (or supply) in IBD's CAN SLIM investment criteria for finding outstanding growth stocks. Wingstop also has 29 million shares outstanding, meaning that as much as 14 million are held by management or insiders. It is rather thinly traded, with an average daily volume of 353,000 shares, but that has been rising rapidly.Travel booking and airline stocks also paced the market's upside following better-than-expected Q2 results from the industry's online giant Priceline (PCLN).On the downside, Installed Building Products (IBP) sank further, falling more than 7% to 31.75 in quadruple normal volume. On Thursday, the insulation supplier triggered a key signal by posting its biggest single-session point drop since its May 5 breakout past a 28.28 handle pivot point.Installed Building also broke sharply below the 50-day moving average for the second time in four sessions, another important sell signal that has been discussed in past Investor's Corner columns.

100,MNST,"The jobs report pushed stocks toward fresh all-time highs in a busy week. Tesla Motors (TSLA) announced a deal to buy SolarCity (SCTY) as tech M&A was strong. General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) fueled a sell-off in consumer-related stocks, while oil prices briefly undercut $40 a barrel. Also, the Bank of England cut rates and revived bond buying.The major averages were little changed through Thursday, but rallied Friday on the strong jobs report.

Merck (MRK) had succeeded with a similar patient group in a trial of its competing drug Keytruda, though it was aiming at a smaller potential market. Merck stock jumped 10.4%, hitting its highest level since June 2001.Earlier, Merck was reported to be talking with Biogen (BIIB) about a possible Biogen buyout, as was Allergan (AGN). This further boosted Biogen's stock a day after its partner Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) announced the unexpected success of a clinical trial of nusinersen, a treatment for a rare spinal disease with blockbuster potential. Biogen rose nearly 9% for the week.Meanwhile specialty drugmakers Mallinckrodt (MNK) and Shire (SHPG) rose 19% and 3.5%, respectively, after they beat estimates and raised guidance, while Pfizer (PFE), Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) slipped after they beat Q2 numbers but issued so-so guidance. Animal-health company Zoetis (ZTS) also rose after beating and raising.General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) led auto stocks lower after reporting slower U.S. sales for the month of July, with Ford projecting U.S. industry sales to fall in 2016 and 2017 after years of big gains. Department stores, grocery stores, restaurants and airlines also declined, but recovered somewhat by week's end.The sell-off among consumer stocks triggers a warning for the broader U.S. economy amid falling business investment and homebuilder spending. Consumer spending rose at a strong 4.2% annual rate in Q2, but if that falters, the economy may not be able to match its anemic Q2 GDP growth of 1.2%.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) beat Q2 earnings estimates, with EPS up 57% to 47 cents, but revenue growth of 12% to $508.8 million missed views. The steakhouse chain also said early Q3 same-restaurant sales growth had slowed from Q2.The outlook comes amid growing worries about the restaurant sector overall. Starbucks (SBUX) and McDonald's both recently reported weak U.S. comps amid warnings from analysts about the retail sector.But pizza delivery chains including Papa John's (PZZA) are bucking the trend. Papa John's said EPS jumped 30% to 61 cents to top views, and raised guidance for the rest of the year. Also, chicken-themed El Pollo Loco (LOCO) and Wingstop (WING) rallied on their results, while Jack In The Box (JACK) soared on its earnings.Separately, Monster Beverage (MNST) reported weaker-than-expected earnings growth, but topped on revenue forecasts.

IBD Leaderboard is a premium service that provides detailed chart analysis of leading stocks. See what other top-rated growth names are at or near buy points.The Bank of England cut interest rates by a quarter-point to 0.25%, as expected, as the U.K. economy slows in reaction to the Brexit vote. But policymakers went further, reviving government bond purchases and announcing that the BOE would buy corporate debt. They also signaled that a rate cut to near-zero is likely by year-end, but BOE Gov. Mark Carney said he's opposed to negative rates and ""helicopter"" money.Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), which makes crushed stone, sand and other aggregates used in construction, fell short of second-quarter forecasts.

Revenue rose 12.7% but also missed. All three blamed bad weather and said they expect better results in the second half.

Shares of the trio fell hard on the earnings misses but recovered some lost ground by the end of the week.Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported a 7% decrease in passenger unit revenue for July, saying the drop was in line with its expectations.

Earnings climbed 34% to $1.22 per share. The FBI reported that firearm background checks, seen as an indicator of future gun sales, rose 3% in July from June and were up 37% from July 2015.

101,MNST,"Monster Beverage (MNST) has paid two top executives a combined $449 million in exchange for about 2.88 million shares purchased as part of a tender offer announced last month.The Corona, Calif.-based company paid CEO Rodney Sacks and CFO Hilton Schlosberg $156 per share, according to regulatory filings. The two jointly own most of their stakes in the energy-drink maker through a number of limited partnerships.Monster announced last month that it would spend as much as $2 billion on a modified Dutch auction to buy back shares at prices ranging from $142 to $160.

103,MNST,"Stocks showed mild action Friday, but the Dow snapped a four-week winning run. In general, the market maintained a positive bent amid a week jam-packed with earnings reports and a data showing weaker-than-expected growth in the U.S. economy.But the Q2 advance GDP report didn't seem that horrible beyond the headline number. While the overall 1.2% gain far missed the Econoday consensus forecast for an increase of 2.6%, the government also revised the figure for Q1 of 2015 sharply higher from 0.6% growth to 2.0%.Plus, in the latest reading, consumer spending jumped 4.2%, strongly reflecting the positive impact of relatively high employment and lower gas prices in the world No. 1 economy.The Dow Jones industrial average slipped less than 0.1%, lagging gains of nearly 0.3% for both the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500. The latter hit a new all-time high, rising as high as 2,177.09 during the stock market today.The Dow's 0.1% loss for the week pales in comparison with gains of 3.2%, 1.1%, 2% and 0.3% in the prior four weeks, respectively. The Nasdaq rallied 1.2% for the week -- a fifth straight weekly advance. The S&P 500 edged lower by fewer than 2 points, or less than 0.1%.Which stocks are performing best in the Dow?One way to view this is by comparing the Relative Strength Rating, which measures a stock's performance over the past 12 months vs. the rest of the stock market. Action over the past three months carries a higher weighting. On that score, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) lead the Dow's 30 components with RS ratings of 83 and 81, respectively.J&J rose 0.6% to 125.23, padding its impressive gains since clearing a long saucer with handle near 105. Even with that large advance, J&J's annualized dividend yield of 2.6% still exceeds the S&P 500's 2% payout.J&J continues to rise after recently posting a third quarter in a row of modest earnings growth. Q3 earnings are seen rising 11% to $1.66 a share, which would be an acceleration from the 2% increase which the medical and personal care products titan saw in the second quarter.For the year, J&J's earnings per share are seen rising 8% on a 3% pick-up in revenue to $72.07 billion.UnitedHealth has had a masterful performance since it broke out of a shallow double-bottom base at 121.19 in late February. The managed care behemoth rose 0.3% to 143.20, up 18% from that proper pivot point.Ranking third in RS Rating among the Dow components is DuPont (DD). The chemicals giant is cozying up to the 70 price level, where it's had trouble piercing higher. Earlier this week, DuPont marked a 14% jump in Q2 earnings, the best result in 10 quarters. Sales slid 8%, however.Investors who seek companies with faster growth need to look at IBD's various high-growth screens, including today's IPO Leaders column.

104,MNST,"The $5.1 billion Columbia Select Large Cap Growth Fund (UMLGX) has hit a rough patch. Its year-to-date loss of about 8% going into Thursday lags the average 2.96% setback by its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the S&P 500's 2.45% gain.But you're highly unlikely to hear sounds of panic from the fund's quarters. That's because this is not the first lobster bake for the Boston-based fund managers. They've encountered market volatility before. And they have a way of rebounding.Right now, the fund's IBD 36-Month Performance Rating through May is A+, the highest available. That means the fund's performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Around the start of that period, the fund was also battling rough seas. In the second quarter of 2013, the fund lost ground while both its peer group and the broad market romped ahead.Usually, the fund makes the opposite happen. In the more than 53 quarters since the start of lead manager Thomas Galvin's tenure on Feb. 28, 2003 -- he's the longest tenured of three current managers -- the fund has outperformed both its direct rivals and the big-cap bogey 28 times. It has lagged both two quarters in a row only once.That helps explain why this fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, shining in three categories: U.S. stock funds, growth funds and large-cap funds. It outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.So how has the fund positioned itself for the future? How will it maneuver through a market that is widely expected not to favor a lot of growth names and to be volatile amid a slow-growth U.S. economy? And don't forget the additional headwind from Brexit.Buys and sells are based on which individual securities appear most promising. But it's clear where the managers expect to find most opportunities. They had 41% of their shareholders' money at work in the technology sector as of May 31. Another 34% was in health care. And 12% was in consumer discretionary.Amazon (AMZN) -- to many investors, both a tech and a consumer discretionary name -- has helped fund performance by trending higher since early February. After declining for four quarters, earnings per share have climbed for four frames at a triple-digit pace. EPS growth has accelerated, rising 118%, 122% and 992% in the past three quarters.Amazon was the fund's third-largest holding as of May 31.Amazon is no longer just an online retailer. It also has become a major cloud computing player. And it recently announced a new video streaming service that will compete with Netflix and Hulu. Amazon's Prime video streaming service will be available for $8.99 per month.Amid severe selling pressure in the general market after the Brexit vote, Amazon has climbed from a 603.34 buy point and from an alternate entry of 638.11, as IBD's market coverage has noted. Shares are trading around 725. A stock will often begin to consolidate after rising 20% to 25% past a buy point.Monster Beverage (MNST) is the thirteenth-largest holding. EPS grew 25% in Q1, rebounding from a 6% decline in the fourth quarter.Trading around 160, shares are getting extended from a 154.06 cup-with-handle entry.The stock's six-month base began forming in December.Monster benefits from distribution by its strategic partner and global beverage powerhouse Coca-Cola (KO). Coke bottlers have also boosted the number of outlets where Monster energy drinks are available.And Monster recently debuted a soda called Mutant to compete with PepsiCo's (PEP) Mountain Dew.The value of Monster to Coke? Coke's sales have declined three straight calendar years. Pepsi's fell last year and were flat in 2014. Monster's sales rose 10% each of the past two years.Sherwin-Williams' (SHW) EPS grew 18%, 39% and 31% in the past three quarters. Trending sideways since late April, shares are forming a flat base with a 309.10 buy point.Annual return on equity has grown six years in a row, gaining 43.3%, 64.8% and 113.1% in the past three years. The company is acquiring rival Valspar.Anna Rathbun, director of research for CBIZ Retirement Plan Services, recently told IBD, ""We have seen delayed spending by consumers since the 2008 crash and recession. But if they can spend on things that build equity like homes, they do. We've seen a lot of home improvement projects.""
"
105,MNST,"Some pockets of the stock market invariably do well when investor optimism is wobbling. Several consumer staples ETFs are making new highs or trading near highs as heightened uncertainty raises the sector's appeal.It's easy to see why it does. Consumers are going to need their soft drinks, bleach, cereal and flour no matter how the economy goes.The consumer staples sector generally outperforms during recessionary periods and, to a lesser extent, late in a market cycle, writes Morningstar analyst Robert Goldsborough. It tends to underperform in the early innings.""As such, investors interested in this fund should hold a strong belief that the economy is at least headed toward a recessionary environment,"" Goldsborough noted. Unless, of course, it's part of a diversified portfolio where its role is to help limit portfolio volatility.Investors have hardly been dashing for the stock market exits in recent sessions, but Europe is a niggling worry. The fear is that the U.K's vote to leave the European Union could stoke a regional recession and even perhaps a broader economic slowdown.Against that backdrop, Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples (RHS) climbed on the stock market today to its best level in more than two years. This exchange traded fund holds 36 large-cap stocks in the consumer staples sector.As its name implies, the ETF veers away from the traditional weighting of stocks by market capitalization (or, the total value of all a company's shares of stock). Instead, each stock gets an identical weight in the portfolio.Procter & Gamble (PG) accounts for roughly 3% of portfolio assets. So does Whole Foods Market (WFM).By contrast, Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP), a cap-weighted rival holding the same stocks, gives a 12% weight to Procter & Gamble, its largest stock holding. It has 0.6% weight in Whole Foods Market, its smallest holding.The top 10 holdings in XLP account for 62% of its portfolio assets vs. 29% in RHS.The equal-weighting method followed by the latter prevents a small handful of stocks from having an unduly large impact on performance.That may sometimes work in an investor's favor. But an investor can be sure they'll always get less of a bias toward large companies and a shot at outperforming traditional, cap-weighted rivals with lower volatility.RHS has delivered on that promise both year to date and over the longer run. It's up 11.7% in 2016 through July 1 -- far outpacing the S&P 500 -- and produced an average annual 17.5% gain over the past five years.By comparison, larger peers XLP and Vanguard Consumer Staples (VDC) gained roughly 10% and an average annual 14.8% over those same periods.VDC holds 101 cap-weighted stocks, including Coca-Cola (KO), tobacco giant Philip Morris (PM) and Monster Beverage (MNST), a top-rated IBD Leaderboard stock.Both XLP and VDC also made new multiyear highs on the stock market today.A potentially stronger dollar post-Brexit could act as a headwind for multinational firms such as Procter & Gamble, whose earnings rely on overseas sales. At the same time, investors are discounting the odds of a near-term rate hike. That should boost this dividend-paying sector.""Consumer staples stocks tend to be sensitive to interest-rate hikes because most experience less earnings growth during economic expansions to offset the negative impact of rising interest rates,"" Goldsborough writes.Guggenheim recently launched the 15th in its equal-weighted ETF suite. Guggenheim S&P 100 Equal Weight (OEW) invests in 100 of the largest and most stable companies in the S&P 500, giving each stock an equal portfolio weight. The cap-weighted S&P 100 Index (OEX) is widely used for derivatives and underlies OEX options.The oldest ETF in this innovative suite, S&P 500 Equal Weight (RSP), has, since its 2003 inception, outperformed the cap-weighted S&P 500 in 100% of 10-year monthly rolling periods, 86% of five-year monthly rolling periods, and 81% of three-year monthly rolling periods, according to Guggenheim.Guggenheim's equal-weighted strategies are helped by a disciplined quarterly rebalancing to target weights, which helps them buy stocks low and sell high.

106,MNST,"Stocks added to last week's gains Monday with the Nasdaq leading the key market indexes as Apple (AAPL), ARM Holdings (ARMH) and Tesla (TSLA) scored big gains. But Netflix (NFLX) fell sharply after hours.The Nasdaq rose 0.5%, the S&P 500 added 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average edged 0.1% higher. Volume was slightly lower across the board vs. Friday, according to preliminary data.Netflix fell sharply in extended trading after the subscription streaming service reported Q2 earnings that beat, but revenue that missed, forecasts. It earned 9 cents on nearly $2 billion in sales. Views were for 2 cents on $2.11 billion. Netflix added 1.7 million subscribers during the quarter, well below the 2.5 million expected.Automakers, discount retailers and chip stocks outperformed in the stock market today, while toymakers, nonalcoholic beverage and truck stocks lagged.ARM Holdings gapped up and soared 41% to an all-time high after Japan's SoftBank (SFTBY) said it would buy the chipmaker for $32 billion. ARM makes chips for Apple's iPhone and other mobile devices.Apple, up 1%, was one of the Dow's biggest winners. Shares climbed past 100 intraday but again met resistance there and closed slightly below. The stock has run into upward resistance near that level since late May.Tesla rose 3% to end a four-session slide. The stock has regained both its long-term support lines, but the 200-day moving average is now above its 50-day line, a bearish sign. The electric car maker hired Chester Chipperfield, a former Apple executive, as its global creative director.Discount retailer Five Below (FIVE) and networking gear maker Gigamon (GIMO) led IBD 50 stocks with 5% jumps each.

107,MNST,"Despite the volatility, it's surprising how many members of the Big Cap 20 list of large-cap growth stocks are extended and at new highs. Most of those have a defensive flavor, such as AT&T (T) and J.M. Smucker (SJM). Both braved the two-day sell-off following the Brexit vote with barely a hiccup, then rocketed to new highs on the recovery…

108,MNST,"Want to buff up your portfolio? Check out this top-performing mutual fund for ideas about stocks and using the fund's diversification.The $11.9 billion MFS Growth Fund (MFEGX) has grabbed an A+ 36-month performance rating from Investor's Business Daily, which means that its performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Its 1.60% gain over the 12 months going into Friday topped 94% of the large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the S&P 500, which was up 1.70%.At a time when its typical peer is down nearly 4% for the past year, how does MFS Growth do it? Foremost, the fund aims for companies that are positioned for years of growth. It looks for companies with high sustainable earnings growth and the ability to keep improving their fundamentals. And it prefers companies whose value is not fully appreciated by other investors.Also, right now its portfolio is virtually all U.S. stocks.Monster Beverage (MNST) is one of the names that fulfills that wish list. In March the fund began its current stake in the maker of canned energy drinks. It was a top new buy for the fund in the first quarter.Share price is up 39% since its Feb. 11 low. First-quarter earnings per share rose 25%, rebounding from a 6% decline in the fourth quarter.Revenue was $680.2 million, which beat the consensus analysts' estimate of $656.9 million. Monster topped analyst estimates in only one of the four quarters in 2015.Trading just above 155 early Friday, Monster remains in a buy range from a 154.06 cup-with-handle entry.Monster benefits from distribution by its strategic partner and global beverage powerhouse Coca-Cola (KO). Coke bottlers have also expanded the number of outlets in which Monster Energy drinks are available.IBD's markets team has noted that Monster's revenue increases of 7% and 9% in the past two quarters were subpar based on CAN SLIM criteria. But Wall Street sees full-year sales picking up 14% in 2016. Also, Monster achieved a sharp bump up in after-tax margin to 24.4%, the highest in at least 19 quarters.Facebook (FB) was the fund's top holding as of April 30.The social media network titan's EPS growth has accelerated for three quarters, growing 16%, 33%, 46% and 83% in the past four frames. Revenue grew 39%, 41%, 52% and 52% the past four quarters.Trading around 113, Facebook is below its 50-day moving average and a 117.09 buy point. The stock gapped up over the buy point in late April on strong earnings, but hasn't made much progress since then.It could be forming a new flat base with a 121.18 entry, the markets team noted. Facebook's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a worst-possible E.The number of daily active Facebook users has topped 1 billion. Facebook's growing mobile platform draws in the bulk of the company's ad revenue.Facebook is launching its Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset. On March 4, Facebook said shipments of some of its Oculus Rift virtual-reality headsets will be delayed due to parts shortages. The company is also looking for ways to monetize its WhatsApp mobile messaging service.Earlier this month, Facebook's executive board announced a plan that would prevent Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg from retaining majority control of the company if he exits from management. One key reason for the plan is to make it easier to attract a high quality successor to Zuckerberg.Vulcan Materials (VMC) is up 51% since its Jan. 20 low. It held its own during Friday's early broad market sell-off and actually gained ground.Vulcan supplies raw materials -- crushed stone, sand, gravel -- for road and highway construction.Earnings per share growth is speeding up. It advanced 14%, 76%, 139% and 262% in the past four quarters. Revenues rose 13%, 19%, 14% and 20% in those periods.With profit growth like that, it's little wonder that 1,190 mutual funds owned the stock as of March 31, up from 1,011 as of June 30, 2015. Investors included top-notch funds like $107.8 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) and $2.6 billion Invesco Mid Cap Growth (VGRAX).In April, MFS Growth added shares, tweaking its Vulcan weighting to 1.2%, up from 1.16% from March.Vulcan has bounced off support at its 50-day moving average. That sets up a follow-on entry.In its May 3 report, Vulcan said most of its businesses have rallied and that its customers are winning more construction projects lately. New federal funding for road and bridge projects is aiding the industry. Better weather than last year also helped. In Q2, profits are seen rising 138% to $1 a share.Broadcom (AVGO) is up 39% from its Feb. 11 low. Trading near 151, the stock has pulled back in mostly light volume and is now sitting below its 159.75 entry.Such declines so soon after a breakout are frustrating but also common in an uncertain market, IBD's markets team notes. The low of the pattern undercut the low of a prior shallow base, which served to reset the base count.Broadcom took over LSI Logic in 2014. That gave it access to the networking and storage chip space. In February, Avago completed its acquisition of Broadcom. The company uses Broadcom's name and Avago's ticker.During the fiscal second quarter, the company has been paying off debt by selling its wireless infrastructure unit to MaxLinear (MXL) and its internet of things segment to Cypress Semiconductor (CY). Proceeds could help pay for future mergers and acquisitions. On June 13, Nomura raised its price target to 200 from 190. Nomura said the next iPhone benefits Broadcom because it has more components in the new model.Earnings per share popped up 26% in the fiscal second quarter. It gained 15% in the prior quarter. Second-quarter revenues jumped 119%. They grew 8% in the previous stanza.MFS Growth Fund's bets on its best ideas are fairly bold. Its top 10 accounted for nearly 31% of assets as of May 31.Technology was the fund's largest sector, with a 23% weighting. Retailing was second, at 15%. Health care was next, with just under 15%.Managers Eric Fischman and Matthew Sabel had just shy of 97% of their shareholders' money at work in U.S. stocks. Most of the balance was in cash.

109,MNST,"Despite the Brexit volatility, sparked by the U.K.'s June 24 vote to withdraw from the European Union, U.S. diversified stock mutual funds eked out a 1.79% gain on average in the second quarter, even as they lost 0.52% in June alone, according to Lipper Inc.The S&P 500 tacked on 2.46% in Q2, after inching up 0.26% in June.That's it for the good news. Stock fund managers are seeking durable-growth stocks as a hedge against the uncertainty, volatility and slowdown in corporate earnings that several told IBD they see in the months -- or longer -- ahead.Click Here To See A List Mutual Fund Quarterly Leaders""Before Brexit, the (investment) world was almost back to normal,"" said Matthew Ward, co-manager of Schroder U.S. Large Cap Equity strategy, which is run as a separate account. The Federal Reserve was edging toward an interest rate increase. First-quarter panic over the pace and sustainability of China's growth was subsiding. U.S. economic indicators were OK, with jobs and wages growing, home values inching up and consumers feeling confidence.""Then, Brexit,"" Ward said. ""We're back to uncertainty, and the market hates uncertainty.""As a result, going forward Ward says the stocks he wants are in a narrow group that have shown an ability to grow earnings regardless of the macro environment.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month Leaders""Our biggest overweight is in consumer discretionary,"" he said. ""It reflects our confidence in consumers. And in some durable secular trends. Amazon (AMZN) is at the top of our list.""Similarly, James Abate, sole manager of $156 million Centre American Select Equity (DHAMX) and of $53 million Multi-Asset Real Return (DHMUX), sees the best prospects for growth increasingly concentrated within an elite group. ""We're concentrating in names that somehow can buck the trend in terms of economic malaise,"" said Abate, who is also Centre's chief investment officer. ""The names in the new Nifty 50 bucket include Amazon, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK), Nvidia (NVDA) and General Mills (GIS).""Jim Swanson, lead manager of $3.4 billion MFS Diversified Income (DIFAX) and chief investment strategist of MFS Investment Management, was already bearish on stocks pre-Brexit.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance The outlook was already dim for corporate earnings growth, he said. He added that companies globally had already lost purchasing power. U.S. selling and general administrative costs, as well as labor costs, are rising. Productivity here, in Europe and in China is falling.Post-Brexit, the dollar is up vs. the Chinese yuan, which will hurt U.S. exports and U.S. multinationals' earnings, he said. A global movement toward trade protectionism, if realized, would also hurt earnings.""Brexit or not, we need to see excess capacity come out of the world manufacturing system and the return of some inflation so that companies can pass along price increases,"" Swanson said.Despite the threats to U.S. corporate earnings, Swanson is overweight in U.S. stocks vs. their Japanese and European peers, which have growth outlooks that look even dimmer to him. And he is underweight in stocks vs. bonds and cash.""U.S. corporate bonds are the place to be,"" he said. He's favoring a mix of high-grade and high-yield debt.Small-cap growth funds led market-capitalization and style groups among U.S. diversified stock funds in Q2, gaining 3.85%.World equity mutual funds barely advanced in Q2, edging up 0.27% while losing 0.64% in June. Latin American funds led all foreign regions, advancing 8.72% in Q2 and 10.72% in June.Up 26.16% year to date, Latin American funds have benefited primarily from a rebound from an excessive sell-off last year, as well as a rebound in the Brazilian real vs. the U.S. dollar and a bounce for oil and other commodities, according to Peter Taylor, a manager of $7.4 billion Aberdeen Emerging Markets (ABEAX) and $3.5 million Latin American Equity Fund (ALEAX). Brazilian stocks have also benefited from the ouster, at least temporarily, of President Dilma Rousseff and in market-friendly fiscal reforms, he says.The quarter's volatility enabled precious metals funds to lead sectors by soaring 40.63% in Q2, more than half of that in June.Going forward, Swanson feels best about the technology sector among U.S. stocks. ""Its free cash flow is the highest of all 11 S&P 500 sectors,"" he said. ""Despite talk of bubbles, the sector is trading cheaper than utilities in Ohio. Yet tech companies change the world.""Software is due to benefit from an overdue upgrade cycle, he says.His second-favorite sector is health care. ""Health care spending keeps rising as a portion of U.S. GDP,"" he said. ""It's priced fairly, not cheaply. It has the best profit outlook after tech.""Consumer discretionary is his third-favorite sector. ""Forward price-earnings ratios are high, but we're seeing year-over-year profit growth that's almost as good as tech's,"" he said.Among tech stocks, Facebook (FB) is one that Ward likes. ""They have exceptional top-line growth,"" he said. ""And they're growing their opportunities."" For one, viewers are tolerating a tripling of videos being shown by advertisers, which allows Facebook to triple the number of ads it inserts among videos.In health care, Ward says share prices have been beaten down, largely by investor concerns that drug pricing will draw additional regulatory scrutiny. But he still likes individual stocks in the sector, including Amgen (AMGN).""It is the cheapest with pharmaceuticals,"" he said. And it is creating market opportunities with a number of biosimilars, which are harder than previous generation treatments for rivals to replicate.Among consumer discretionary stocks, Ward likes Amazon because of top-line growth and its use of Prime to draw new site users. He also likes Amazon's use of its warehouse for storing inventory without the expense of purchasing it.Tractor Supply (TSCO) is another consumer discretionary name he likes. It caters to customers whose income is double the national average and who pursue a rural lifestyle, he says. Its sales are triple its next six competitors combined. Its scale enables Tractor Supply to customize inventory for different regions.In staples, he likes Monster Beverage (MNST). Its new carbonated drink, Mutant, and its distribution arrangement with partner Coca-Cola (KO) should keep growth in the high single digits or low double digits, he says. Wall Street expects low single digits, which makes the stock attractively valued, he says.David Harden, president of Summit Global Investments and lead manager of two of its funds -- $125 million U.S. Low Volatility Equity (LVOLX) and $11 million Small Cap Low Volatility (LVSMX) -- says that amid volatility he likes stocks with stability of revenue and earnings. ""These companies offer downside protection,"" he said.One trait shared by stocks he likes is stability of revenue and earnings. ""These companies offer downside protection,"" he said.Another trait is low two-year beta. Each one's beta is below 1.0, which means each is less volatile than the overall stock market.

110,MNST,"The stock market was broadly lower Thursday morning, as its three-week advance moderated some more.The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones industrial average were all off 0.3%.

Volume was tracking three times more than normal. The resort company beat profit estimates but revenue of $647.5 million missed views.

The stock has made a big advance over the past several months and has been up for…
"
112,MNST,"Stocks were higher Monday afternoon, initially paring after Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen spoke but then marching higher. Oil and gas stocks helped fuel decent gains for the major averages while Monster Beverage (MNST) traded around a buy area.Yellen said that rate hikes will be appropriate as the economy improves, noting that wage gains seem to be starting to strengthen. But she said Friday's May jobs report was ""disappointing"" and omitted any reference for when the next tightening may occur. Several Fed officials suggested early that a June move was unlikely after Friday's employment data.Transocean (RIG) and Helmerich & Payne (HP) led the S&P 500, while Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) outperformed in the Dow Jones industrial average.The Dow industrials and Nasdaq rose 0.5%, while the S&P 500 added 0.4% each. Small caps did well, with the Russell 2000 up 0.9%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking lower than Friday's levels.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil for July delivery jumped 1.8% to $49.50 a barrel amid a weak U.S. dollar and news of lower output in Nigeria.In the stock market today, volume was heavy in Monster Beverage as shares rose 1% to 154.34. The stock is trying to clear a cup-with-handle base with a 154.06 buy point. After three straight low-volume gains, volume in the shares Monday was tracking about 55% higher than Friday's levels.Elsewhere, fast-growing homebuilder LGI Homes (LGIH) gave back early gains but still rose more than 2% on news that home closings in May jumped 69% from the year-earlier period. In April, closings rose nearly 28%.See who the other leaders in IBD's home-building group are with IBD Stock Checkup.Inside the IBD 50, Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) outperformed after Friday's down session. Shares rose nearly 2%, moving just above a 37.58 cup-with-handle buy point.Decliners included Tyson Foods (TSN).

It was a good day for the stock market Monday, but bulls looking for meaningful signs of institutional buying were left largely disappointed because gains came in lower volume.

"
136,MNST,"The food and beverage sector is serving up plenty of red meat to investors looking for top-rated stocks near a buy point.The sector was ranked No. 6 out of 33 on Wednesday. It's been strong all year thanks to healthy earnings and dividend growth among leading companies in the sector, a big plus in a market that still favors defensive stocks to a good extent.B&G Foods (BGS) leads with a best-possible 99 Composite Rating, but the maker of jellies and hot sauces is extended after gapping up past a 40.60 cup-base entry April 29 following a strong quarterly earnings report.The stock sports a long-term dividend growth rate of 14%, according to IBD calculations, and the annualized dividend of $1.40 a share yields 3.2% at the current share price, well above the S&P 500 average.A more timely choice is Blue Buffalo (BUFF), which cleared a 26.08 buy point of a long cup-with-handle base Wednesday. The breakout came after the maker of premium dog food reported that Q1 profit rose 19% to 19 cents a share, beating Wall Street estimates. Revenue rose 12% to $279.8 million, also above views. Volume was heavy, but the stock pared gains.The base is the first since Blue Buffalo went public last July at 20 a share. The 47%-deep correction in the pattern may normally be a flaw, but some IPO bases can be unorthodox.Profit at the Wilton, Conn.-based company has increased sharply from 12 cents a share in 2010 to 62 cents last year. Earnings for this year are expected to rise 19% to 74 cents a share, followed by a 15% increase in 2017.Meanwhile, Monster Beverage (MSNT) pulled back below a 150.80 cup-with-handle entry Wednesday after breaking out the previous day on better-than-expected earnings. The maker of energy drinks boasts strong profit margins. Also, an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B+ points to strong demand for the shares.Neither Blue Buffalo nor Monster offers a dividend, but Cambpell's Soup (CPB) and Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) have long-term dividend growth rates of 4% and 13%, respectively. Campbell's is trying to clear a 65.58 flat-base buy point , while Dr Pepper is just below a 95.97 potential entry.
"
137,MNST,"Monster Beverage (MNST)  shares jumped Friday after the beverage maker reported first-quarter results above Wall Street views and announced a buyback program.The energy drink maker earned 80 cents a share during the quarter, six cents above forecasts. Revenue rose 16% to $680.18 million, above views for $656.8 million.Case sales rose 25.6% to 72.6 million. Gross sales rose 9.5% to $777.5 million. Gross sales to customers outside the U.S. rose 31% to $184.4 million and overall gross profit widened to 62.2% from 58.9%.Monster also announced a $2 billion share repurchase program via a modified ""Dutch auction"" tender offer.Monster shares soared 12.8% to close at 144.22 in the stock market today, jumping over its 50-day and 200-day lines.""The continued strength of the U.S. dollar, distributor transitions and uncertainties in portions of our international non-Coca-Cola (KO) distribution network also impacted our results,"" said CEO Rodney Sacks, in the earnings report.Monster completed the acquisition of its principal flavor supplier, American Fruits and Flavors, on April 1. The move ""secures our ownership of the unique intellectual property of many of our key flavors,"" according to Sacks, who added that the company's distribution deal with Coca-Cola bottlers abroad is progressing well. Monster Energy drinks will be on shelves in New Zealand and Australia in May through a partnership with Coca-Cola Amatil.""In the United States, the Coca-Cola bottlers have expanded the number of outlets in which Monster Energy drinks are available, and we are seeing improvements in our levels of distribution,"" Sacks said.Coca-Cola, which distributes Monster's drinks, took a 17% stake last year. Coca-Cola and Monster swapped drinks, with Coke giving Monster its energy drinks and Monster handing over its non-energy offerings.Coca-Cola shares rose 0.4%.
"
138,MNST,"Stocks traded near session lows Wednesday afternoon, dragged down by weak earnings at Walt Disney (DIS) and other consumer-related companies, while breakouts Blue Buffalo Pet Products (BUFF) and Monster Beverage (MNST) faded. But Amazon.com (AMZN) continued to climb.The Dow fell 1% as Walt Disney tanked following weaker-than-expected quarterly results. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq each lost 0.7% in the stock market today. Volume was running above Tuesday's levels on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq.Amazon bucked the downtrend, rising nearly 2% to a new high in heavy volume as it continues to soar following a blowout Q1 earnings report April 28. The stock is 19% past a 603.34 cup-with-handle buy point.Those who bought at the breakout should consider taking some profits when the gain reaches 20% to 25%, as most stocks correct to form new bases at that point. Those with conviction that the online retailer can continue to rise may choose to hold on, however.How does Amazon rank in the Internet retail group?

141,MNST,"Monster Beverage (MNST) had an energy crash late Thursday, badly missing Q4 forecasts as it continues to transition distribution of its energy drinks to strategic partner Coca-Cola (KO).Monster's earnings per share fell 6.9% to 67 cents. Analysts expected a 14% increase to 82 cents. It was the third time in the past five quarters that Monster has reported lower-than-expected earnings.Net sales grew 6.6% to $645.4 million, well below analyst consensus of $698.4 million.Shares sank 8% in after-hours trading in the stock market today despite Monster also announcing a $1.75 billion addition to its share buyback plan, bringing the current total to $2 billion. Coca-Cola was flat in late trading.Sales were hurt as customers rushed to buy ahead of a price hike in Q3, reducing Q4 sales by about $11 million. Sales were also affected by destocking in certain Europe-Middle East-Africa markets.“Distributor transitions and uncertainties in portions of our international non-Coca-Cola distribution network limited further revenue growth during the quarter,"" Monster CEO Rodney Sacks said in a statement, adding that currency rates also jarred results.Last year, Coca-Cola acquired 17% of Monster in a strategic partnership in which Coke transferred its global energy drink business to Monster and took over the energy drink maker's nonenergy brands, including Hansen's Natural Sodas.The deal gave Monster access to Coke's global distribution network, which should give it a lift as it expands internationally.Earlier in the week, Monster announced that it's agreed to buy longtime flavor supplier American Fruits & Flavors for $690 million. After the deal closes, which is expected this quarter, Monster plans to ""further enhance (American Fruits) flavor development and global flavor footprint capabilities.""Monster said it expects the acquisition to add to earnings in 2016.Among other large beverage makers, Coke's archrival PepsiCo (PEP) rose 1% to 100.67.

142,MNST,"The stock market is always a case of, ""OK, that was nice, but what have you done for me lately?""IBD's soft drink group has outperformed both major indexes since the bull market began in March 2009. Going into Wednesday's market, soft drinks were up 406% vs. 228% for the Nasdaq and 166% for the S&P 500.What, though, has the Beverages-Non-Alcoholic group done for investors lately?Year to date, the soft drink group has retreated 6% -- less than the Nasdaq's 11% drop but about in line with the S&P 500. However, beginning with Feb. 11's closing lows, soft drinks are back to outperforming (up about 7% vs 4% to 5% for the major indexes).Let's look at what's happening among the highly rated soft drink stocks.Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) cleared an 81.55 buy point in strong volume in August, but the stock immediately rolled over and triggered the 8% sell rule. The decline turned into a new pattern.The new pattern featured an entry at 83.67. The stock broke above that in low volume Oct. 9.However, let's back up a little because this gets tricky.  On Oct. 5, the stock retook the previous buy point at 81.55 in volume 37% above average. The previous buy point was probably a more natural area of resistance because that's where the failure occurred.Individual investors who re-entered on the retake are sitting on a 12% gain -- not bad in this market.Dr Pepper currently has shaped a flat base-like structure on top of the prior base; the potential new buy point is 95.36.The stock has a Composite Rating of 96, putting it in the top 4% among all the stocks in IBD's database. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number.Coca-Cola (KO) is known as one of Warren Buffett's long-term holdings. Coke is the third-largest holding in the Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) portfolio, making up 13% of assets.The stock has a Composite Rating of 85, which is decent for a conservative blue chip.Coke is working on a flat base with a potential buy point at 44.01.Two other stocks in the group need to do some work on the right side.Monster Beverage (MNST) undercut its August low when the stock bottomed Feb. 11.The current consolidation is 30% deep, which is about twice as deep as the market's recent pullback. For growth stocks, a sell-off fiercer than the major indexes isn't unusual.Monster has a Composite Rating of 92 but needs to retake its 200-day and 50-day lines.Coca-Cola Bottling (COKE) has retaken its 200-day line but remains just under its 50-day line.If a new base develops now, the pattern would be late stage.As a stock climbs, it pause to consolidate or form a new base. Breakouts from the first two stages are more likely to work than those from later stage patterns. The stock's Composite Rating is a best possible 99.

(KO).Monster's shares closed down 1.7%.Telsey Advisory Group raised its PT to 38 from 35 on consumer electronics retailer Best Buy after it reported better-than-expected Q4 results on Thursday, though its guidance missed Wall Street estimates.Best Buy's shares ended up 0.65%.Telsey Advisory Group raised its PT to 54 from 49 for value-priced department store operator Kohl's, which posted a decline in Q4 earnings on Thursday, though they were better than expected. Sales fell short of views and it gave weak guidance for the full year.Shares of Kohl's rose 0.3%.FBR Capital lowered its price target on apparel retailer Gap to 27 from 29 following the company's Q4 results on Thursday.

154,MNST,"With Frank Caruso at the helm since mid-February 2012 -- almost exactly four years -- the $2.7 billion AB Large Cap Growth Fund (APGAX) has topped 98% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. through Jan. 31.The fund notched a 14.55% average annual gain in that time vs. 10.71% for its direct rivals and 12.08% for the S&P 500. It garners an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, meaning it's performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Lately, the mutual fund has shown it can outperform in ugly markets as well as in beautiful ones. By losing less than its peers and the broad market over the turbulent past three months, the fund ranked in the top 8% of its category. It fell 6.08% last month, a little better than the average U.S. diversified stocks fund's 6.25% decline.Caruso, who is 59 years old, is a member of the AB fund complex, which last year changed its name from AllianceBernstein. Caruso, the lead manager on this fund, discussed with IBD at his Manhattan office how his team invests.IBD: How have you achieved outperformance in bad markets as well as good?Caruso: It's our focus on great businesses, our obsession with the fundamental integrity of holdings and the way we manage risk. Looking at data from March 31, 2012, through Dec. 31, in the 28 up months in that time we were in the 23rd percentile of our peers. In the down months, we were in the 2nd percentile, beating 98% of our peers. The risk-adjusted performance of the portfolio is extremely good.IBD: Business cycles are not your focus, right?Caruso: I don't want people to associate with us any overarching concern about business cycles. We look for consistent performance. That's particularly important in growth stock investing. Companies we want need to have the kind of business that has a long runway to invest those high returns and earn returns in excess of their cost of capital. So it's a combination of persistence and duration that creates and unleashes the power of compounding. Rather than saying we look for high-growing companies, we look for returns and look for that in these really good businesses.IBD: You are looking for companies that can meet your requirements for several years, right?Caruso: Our window is three to five years. For companies in the Russell 1000, you've got a high-teens number of earnings forecasts for this year and next, then it falls off a cliff. As you get fewer estimates three, four, five years out, the variability about forecasts increases a lot. Longer time horizons lead to inefficiency in growth stock investing.IBD: In other words, by having a longer time horizon than most other investors, it's easier for you to find companies that are priced inefficiently?Caruso: It is. Absolutely.IBD: What's a recent example, please?Caruso: Most investors look at Nike (NKE) and see one of the most efficiently priced stocks in the market. But that changes longer-term. What's provocative is that they've been experimenting with new manufacturing technology, a weaving technology. Most people would say Nike's biggest cost is labor. But it's not. It's shipping, tariffs and duties. You can eliminate a lot of those if you localize manufacturing. Weaving technology might let them do that. Instead of (needing a lot of low-paid) workers cutting, banging, stitching, gluing, coloring and packing products, what if they have . . . smaller factories all over the world, decreasing those shipping, tariff and duties costs?So when we model Nike, we can push the profitability up by hundreds of basis points. That gives us confidence in the long term. It informs us about how we might want to behave in the short term if there's volatility.IBD: For a manager who pays little attention to the short term, you're doing well in the short term. Luck or design?Caruso: The fact that stocks go up and down doesn't impact the way we manage the portfolio. Having said that, a year ago we had had good, consistent performance for the last four years. We started to see a lot of risk exposure to momentum (stocks), and we spent the entire year managing that down to more conservative levels. And we have seen reversion to the mean.IBD: In the recent months of volatility, what have you trimmed and what have you added to?Caruso: Part of why we've done well in 2016 is that the market continues to be concerned about earnings, and our portfolio is delivering. But we've reduced our size in excess winners last year and redeployed into more, not defensive, but more edgy, controversial companies that had not been leadership stocks. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is one of those names.IBD: Which of the FANGs do you own, and which have you trimmed?Caruso: We don't own Amazon.com (AMZN) or Netflix (NFLX). We have Facebook (FB) and Google (Alphabet (GOOGL)), and haven't trimmed them.We've been more inclined to trim some discretionary stocks. We took profits and reduced positions in Starbucks (SBUX) and Nike because we thought in the moment it was pretty fully valued. But we would welcome an opportunity to build that back through volatility.Disney (DIS) was trimmed. Monster (MNST) and Staples (SPLS) -- which has been a phenomenal performer -- were trimmed.What we've added to: Last summer, we were basically market weight in health care, a little overweight. Those were put through the grinder in late summer, early fall. Into and emerging from that correction, we started increasing our exposure there. We added to Intuitive Surgical last summer. We rebalanced into Biogen (BIIB). We introduced (a position in) Edwards Lifesciences (EW).We did a number of things in tech. We introduced Adobe (ADBE) and Cognizant (CTSH), and we did some adds to longer-term positions, such as ServiceNow (NOW).IBD: Why do you like Intuitive Surgical?Caruso: The company has unbelievable returns. It has $3 billion in enterprise cash and no debt. We’re seeing the utilization of robotics in an ever-increasing number of procedures.For this company to win long-term, we must see more surgeon adoption of robotics, and we’re seeing that. The stock suffered a fair amount of underperformance the past couple of years. But we stuck to our knitting. We added to our stake opportunistically, and we’re starting to see a contribution to fund performance from this stock.IBD: You weren’t in on Facebook’s IPO, but you bought when many others were fleeing. What’s your thesis?Caruso: We were controversial buyers when the rest of the Street was puking it out. We’re proud of that.If you go back to the IPO in the summer of 2012, every banker that bought them had a five-year forecast model -- 2016 was the terminal year. Now their current forecasts are 40% to 60% higher than they were back then. My point is that fundamentals overachievement is really hard to model. But Facebook has potential to drive tremendous excess performance.IBD: Go back to Monster Beverage: Why did you trim it?Caruso: They were on the verge of deploying a lot of capital to be able to sell overseas. Then Coke (KO) took a strategic position in the company. As shareholders, we appreciated before many others that Monster would not have to spend $1 billion to become a global company. They would be able to leverage Coke’s best-on-the-planet global distribution platform. They would get to profits we thought they'd see in 2017-18 in the year 2016.The growth opportunity is increasing exponentially. So the sizing decision was really another one of those Starbucks-type decisions, where these have been unbelievably successful stocks. But the valuations got a little uncomfortable in the short term, so we reduced our exposure. There’s no diminution of our long-term conviction.IBD: You boosted your current stake in Cognizant in between September and November. What’s the attraction?Caruso: They bring a level of expertise in software-as-a-service and mobility solutions to companies that are trying to figure out how to get their IT architecture to the next level.Positioning in key technologies interests us. Cognizant was a stock we talked about at the end of 2013. We stepped away and more recently started to build it back.IBD: Adobe posted earnings-per-share gains for five quarters after suffering EPS declines in seven of the eight prior stanzas. What’s the crux of why things are working?Caruso: They used to put a product in a shrink-wrapped box and sell it. They’ve switched to a subscription model. That allows them to be consistent in how upgrades are managed and deployed. Customers don’t have to wait for upgrades. That model is destined to compress the ups and downs of their business. The lower volatility that results is good from a valuation point of view. And this model lets them manage the risk of piracy in a more head-on fashion. So the long-term value of their subscription model is more attractive than their old model.IBD: Are you among the investors who started to like Alphabet more when the company brought in Ruth Porat as CFO?Caruso: Yes, we became excited when they brought in Porat from Morgan Stanley (MS).Google had a great business, focused on search. But they used cash flow to fund a variety of initiatives that in many cases didn’t appear to make a lot of sense.With the appearance of a strong CFO, we hoped there was finally an adult in the room who would bring financial discipline to the way they thought about allocating capital. So far, she’s done that.Now they’ve got two companies, basically. One is focused on advertising, whether it’s YouTube, which is growing into an economically handsome property, or search.Then you’ve got essentially all of these call options about driverless cars, robotics. They’ve been deploying capital to build out telecom networks in cities. So it’s a portfolio of early-stage companies, some acquired, some nurtured, some ready for prime time, some needing more incubation.The split in the company lets investors have more transparency to properly value the businesses.

156,MNST,"Warmer weather, online shopping and heavy discounting have made retail a tough space to be in right now, but at least five stocks on the IBD 50 list are bucking the trends.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) has held off Amazon (AMZN) better than its retail peers, partly because of the experiential nature of buying beauty products and partly because of the dedicated customer loyalty that companies like Ulta and Sephora have built, according to analysts.Notably, specialty beauty retailers have the benefit of not being in a seasonal industry, say experts, which means that they are not subject to the promotional pressures that department stores and clothing retailers face.Ulta, a member of IBD's Retail-Specialty industry group, has risen 35% over the last year. The group has collectively lost 6%.Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA) have also fared well amid a struggling retail backdrop as ""athleisure"" continues to make its way out of the gym and into offices and even major fashion houses.Health and wellness trends -- think juice bars, cleanses and the much-anticipated SoulCycle (SCYL) IPO -- have worked in both companies' favor, and Under Armour's push into wearable technology has inserted itself into the tech conversation alongside Fitbit (FIT) and the Apple (AAPL) Watch.Nike's stock has climbed 31% and Under Armour has grown 17% since Jan. 29, 2015. Shares of the Apparel-Shoes and Relating Manufacturing group and Apparel-Clothing Manufacturing have risen 5% and declined 15%, respectively.Both companies are not the only two activewear companies on the list.

The java giant is expanding assertively into the country, with a goal of operating 3,400 stores there by 2019.Starbucks missed Q1 revenue and guided Q2 below consensus estimates when it reported on Jan. 21, but CEO Howard Schultz expressed enthusiasm about bringing Starbucks' mobile-order-and-pay feature to Chinese consumers. He anticipates that it will be a ""runaway success.""Domestically, its mobile efforts have yielded success, with over a fifth of all U.S. transactions now made via smartphone.Starbucks shares have grown 36% while IBD's Retail-Restaurants group has tumbled 15%.Ross Stores (ROST) doesn't even have an e-commerce presence, but the chain of off-price stores has been labeled ""un-Amazonable"" by Cowen analyst Oliver Chen, citing the appeal of the ""treasure hunt"" experience that compels shoppers to visit brick-and-mortar stores.Amid a shift to off-price retailers, analysts agree that there's room for square-footage growth as Ross expands into other regions stateside.Ross Stores' stock has risen 20% over the last year, compared to the Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories group, which has declined 14%.A number of other consumer stocks abound on the IBD 50 list, including energy-drink maker Monster Beverage (MNST), discounters Five Below (FIVE) and Dollar General (DG), and baby-clothing merchant Carter's (CRI).RELATED:Why Under Armour’s Market Share May Be Bigger Than You ThinkThink We’re In A Recession?

157,MNST,"For Dennis Lynch, investing is a family affair. The 45-year-old lead manager of $3.5 billion Morgan Stanley Growth is following in the footsteps of his father, who was a money manager and co-founder of Lynch & Mayer, starting in the 1970s.The elder Lynch (also named Dennis) can be proud. Morgan Stanley Growth was the 25th-best-performing U.S. diversified stock fund in 2015. It outperformed 95% of its peer mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past five years.And with a 9.4% gain in the fourth quarter that topped 97% of his direct rivals, Lynch was again among the top-performing mutual fund managers.With Lynch at the helm since mid-2004, the fund has focused on its managers' best ideas rather than on overdiversifying. It has aimed for securities in the stock market that benefit from competitive advantages such as a network effect among site visitors and from a steady flow of subscription-based revenues.And in an industry that employs battalions of analysts who are experts at diving into the details of earnings reports, a key member of Lynch's team is a futurist whose job is to spot emerging investment trends years before they generate revenues and profits.Lynch talked with IBD about his investment approach from his office in Manhattan.IBD: Dennis, your fund has outperformed in 2015 and long-term. But in 2012 and 2014 it was middle of the pack. What went against the fund's approach in those years?Lynch: We try to add value through stock picking and identifying what we think are mispriced or undervalued companies, companies that are undervalued because investors don't understand the quality of their business or how they can grow over time.Along the way, there can be periods when specific ideas are not working or the market is not in agreement with our ideas. We had a challenging period in 2012. In the back part of the year we did poorly, given a large allocation to Facebook (FB). It came public with a lot of public enthusiasm, then went through a vicious and challenging period when the stock price more than halved.We actually added to our position during that challenging period, then later on we benefited as the stock price rebounded.Generally, when we have ups and downs relative to the market or peer groups, sometimes it's because we're going through a period when the market thinks we're wrong. And we also make mistakes from time to time.IBD: Your concentrated portfolio is the flip side of your long-term approach, right?Lynch: Yes. Why we do well in any given year reflects decisions made in previous years rather than anything we do in the current year.Amazon.com (AMZN) is a company we've owned continuously for roughly 13 years. The reasons we got involved were a combination of the online advantages that made them tough to beat. They offer inventory that they don't necessarily possess themselves, but which they have access to.At the same time, they've slowly built a very large logistical infrastructure in the physical world.And they target increasingly technology through their Amazon Web Services.IBD: Is there anything that could disrupt a juggernaut like Facebook?Lynch: You don't have to worry that another social network will get bigger. That's highly unlikely.But is there something out there that can take people's attention away, like virtual reality or some other technology that still in its early stages now?In the absence of something like that, it's unlikely that Facebook's network effect will be challenged anytime soon.IBD: LinkedIn's (LNKD) third-quarter profit jumped 50%, a nice rebound from Q2. This is another network-effect play, isn't it?Lynch: Both holdings have strong network effects of users connected to each other.Both have users who cross-connect. It's hard to displace them. Even though both have that at their core, they make money in different ways. So we're not exposed to the same end markets or even the same spending patterns.Earlier in the year, LinkedIn made changes to its workforce that surprised people. But each quarter, results have seen the fruits of LinkedIn's longer-term thinking.IBD: The key to Monster Beverage (MNST) is how their deal with Coke (KO) gives them a shot at foreign expansion, right?Lynch: With Coca Cola becoming a substantial owner, it opens opportunities for distribution to become more efficient in the U.S. and increases chances of capturing more global share. They've had less success outside the U.S.IBD: Is Salesforce.com (CRM) one of those subscription-revenue companies you like?Lynch: They provide customer relationship management services that in the past were sold on a high license-fee basis. They had a novel approach of offering those services in a subscription format rather than requiring large upfront fees, which can be costly.It gives customers the ability to benefit from upgrades to the whole system rather than having to buy a new version of the software for each upgrade cycle.As a result, they built a high recurring-revenue business. On an annual basis, revenue renewal is over 90%. So that gives their revenue a lot of visibility.They are figuring out how to meet other important needs for large organizations. They're expanding into marketing.IBD: Why has Athenahealth's (ATHN) share price been choppy recently?Lynch: Athenahealth is the dominant provider for doctors to get reimbursed by insurers.And the way their system works, every doctor can learn (about methods for improving insurance reimbursements) from the experience of other doctors on the platform.Once Athena figures out how to apply new rules for one doctor, all doctors benefit.So it's hard for a doctor not to join the network. This is an inherent network effect. But their penetration is still less than 10% of the overall doctor market, so they've got a lot of room for growth.And they've diversified into electronic health records. Once you get a lot of doctors to join, you can provide other services, which draws in more doctors.IBD: After a rough patch,Intuitive Surgical's (ISRG) earnings-per-share growth is accelerating again. Is this improvement for real?Lynch: That rough period was when they were transitioning from a first-generation platform to the next generation.And it's a razor-and-razor-blades model. There are a lot of consumables that need to be reordered each time.So it's a high recurring revenue model. It continues to take share.When a company has an upgrade cycle, customers wonder if they should order the old system or the new one. Sales can slow. It happened a couple of years ago. Now things are heading back in the right direction.IBD: Dennis, how does your team differ from its rivals?Lynch: One thing I try to emphasize when I talk with people who are thinking about whether to put money in the fund is what skin in the game do people running a product have?Here, we're not going to do well every quarter or every 12 months. There can be periods when things go badly, but through Morgan Stanley's deferred compensation program, the vast majority of team pay is deferred, and most goes into our products.We have significant personal exposure through co-ownership with our clients in the products we make for them.IBD: Tell me about the person on your team whose job is to scout ahead for emerging trends or disruptive new technologies.Lynch: Yes, in addition to our expert work, meetings with companies, looking at financial statements — those conventional activities — we've dedicated one person to research topics that have the potential to be disruptive in industries or sectors.IBD: What is your change researcher looking at these days?Lynch: More recently, he's been focused on Bitcoin and virtual reality. These are potentially powerful emerging themes and disruptive trends.IBD: Who is your disruptor expert?Lynch: Stan Delaney.IBD: How do you and the five other managers on this fund — David Cohen, Sam Chainani, Alexander Norton, Jason Yeung and Armistead Nash — divide your workload? Is each manager responsible for different industrial sectors, for example?Lynch: I act as a generalist. Outside of me, everyone has a sector and industry expertise. Sam follows the Internet and financials. David follows consumer, which sounds like one industry but is really multidimensional. Jason follow health care and some consumer staples. Armistead follows business services and software. Alex does technology — we think of technology differently than the Internet. Companies use the Internet to create. They are not selling semiconductors or software. Alex focuses on those kinds of business models and things like industrials.My dad managed large- and midcap growth stocks, starting in the 1970s in a time when managers tended to be generalists. Today people tend to be experts in a category but lacking the perspective of knowing multiple categories and being able to compare. We believe we benefit from taking the generalist approach, and we can leverage the experts.

213,MNST,"Kimberly-Clark (KMB) has had a good week so far, helped by a Barclays upgrade to buy from neutral and a price target hike to 155 from 121. The stock is finding support at its 10-week moving average for the first time after a breakout over a 118.05 buy point.It's not a particularly glamorous area of the market — maybe even a bit boring — but consumer staple stocks continue to be a nice pocket of leadership, with many in technical setups that could yield further gains.Consumer staple firms offer products that are always in demand, no matter how well the economy is performing. Primary lines of business include food, beverage, tobacco and basic household items.Many have been on the prowl for acquisitions, too.Headed into Thursday, IBD's Food/Beverage sector was perched near the top of IBD's sector rankings, No. 3 out of 33 that IBD tracks. Several top-rated names in the sector are showing favorable price and volume trends and are worthy of a closer look.Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPS), with a Composite Rating of 96, remains under accumulation after a base breakout in early October. It's still in a buy range after clearing a flat base with a 91.05 buy point.Volume was heavy during the week that ended Dec. 4, when the stock broke out.Besides its namesake brand, other brands in the company's stable include 7UP, A&W, Squirt, Crush, Mott's and Schweppes. Last month, Dr. Pepper Snapple declared a quarterly dividend of 48 cents a share, giving it an annualized yield of around 2%.Elsewhere in the sector, J.M. Smucker (SJM) is trading tightly above its 10-week moving average. It's near the high end of a buy range from a 118.60 cup-with-handle buy point.Perhaps best known for its jellies and preserves, Smucker also has a large stable of brands, including Jif, Folgers and Pillsbury. Earlier this year, Smucker expanded into the fast-growing pet business with its $5.8 billion acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brands.After a breakout during the week ended Nov. 27, Campbell's Soup (CPB) is showing some tight weekly closes. It's still in a buy range from a 52.47 entry.One of the more liquid ETFs in the staples space is the SPDR Consumer Staples ETF (XLP). Its current flat base shows a 51.23 buy point. On Wednesday, XLP rose nearly 2% in strong volume but ended just pennies above the buy point.Top holdings in the ETF in interesting setups include Dow component Coca-Cola (KO). It's not far from its all-time high of 45 as it works on a base with a 43.95 buy point.Coke owns a stake in Monster Beverage (MNST) and Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR). Coke's initial investment in Keurig wasn't looking too good until Keurig agreed to be taken private earlier this month in a $13.9 billion deal.

215,MNST,"Is Monster Beverage (MNST) poised to pop and stay energized into 2016? Here are three reasons that may be the case.  Coca-Cola Deal Paying Off Earlier this year, Coca-Cola (KO) acquired almost 17% of Monster's stock in a strategic partnership, in which Coke transferred its global energy drink business to Monster. In exchange, Coca-Cola took over Monster's non-energy drink…

216,MNST,"AllianzGI Focused Growth Fund makes success look easy. In May, when fund lead manager Scott Migliori spoke with IBD, the now-$756 million portfolio was up about 8% for the year, topping 89% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the S&P 500's 4% gain.Now, going into Tuesday, the fund, which carries an A+ 36-Month Performance Rating from IBD, is up 11.1% for the year, outperforming 93% of its peer mutual funds and the S&P 500's gain, stuck at 3%.That good trend has required hard work and savvy moves.""If anything, the stock market today is more narrow,"" Migliori said. ""Fewer names are making newer highs. I wouldn't call it the Nifty 50. There are maybe 10 to 15 stocks that are consistently performing well, mainly in the tech and consumer discretionary spaces. We've owned enough of those to generate outperformance, but it's gotten tougher.""How? The health care sector has rolled over. ""It had been in leadership for a number of years,"" Migliori said. ""But it's fallen off the last few months because earnings revisions were not as strong as investors wanted, and because of potential political challenges over price controls.""The fund has cut exposure to drugmakers and biotechs, including Gilead (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB).Proceeds from those trims have been rotated into names like Palo Alto Networks (PANW).Trading around 187, shares in the next-generation firewall and security software maker are close to a 189.82 buy point.Since going public in 2012, revenue has swelled nearly 1,800% to $928 million. And the firm, which is on IBD's Leaderboard, has notched three quarters of triple-digit earnings per share gains.""The security area is fast growing, given the cyberattacks that governments and corporations are facing,"" Migliori said.The fund recently started its stake in Accenture (ACN), which performs consulting and provides IT services. Many investors were concerned that Accenture's business would be hurt as customers shifted to cloud-based software.""But what we've seen is fairly robust business for Accenture in integrating cloud-based services with (customers') existing IT infrastructures,"" Migliori said. ""The cloud has not only not been negative; it's been a positive growth driver.""Increasingly, amid a slow-growth economy and the prospect of rising interest rates, the fund looks for companies that can boost earnings in any market.Monster Beverage (MNST) is one of those. ""Energy drinks are taking share of the overall beverage market,"" Migliori said. ""Their partnership with Coke (KO) will let them grow more quickly. They'll be able to expand distribution more quickly.""Still Likes FacebookThe fund is high on Facebook (FB), yet recently took some profits. Why? Because the stock had enjoyed a big run and because its growth rate had slowed slightly.""But we still like it,"" Migliori said. ""They're just starting to monetize Instagram. The amount of their capital spending is not as bad as people had feared. They're consolidating after a big run, but there's nothing to fundamentally derail the story at this point.""Amazon (AMZN) is another name that Migliori thinks can carve out growth in any macro environment.Also, last year's spending on warehouse improvements is contributing to this year's operating efficiencies. ""And AWS (Amazon Web Services) is growing faster than people realize,"" Migliori said.

218,MNST,"Columbia Select Large Cap Growth Fund has rewarded loyal investors. Since Tom Galvin became the $7.3 billion fund's lead manager in 2003, it has handily topped its benchmark.Galvin manages the fund with a focused strategy. ""We maintain a high-conviction portfolio of companies with quality earnings that grow consistently at a high level,"" he said. ""We think the market is efficient over long periods of time, and companies with excess earnings power will ultimately garner excess investment returns.""Galvin and his team typically hold 25 to 35 companies. ""We have a longer-term time horizon and generally low turnover because of the high conviction,"" he said. ""We also utilize risk-awareness tools like cross-correlation to consider how we can have more independent outcomes for the portfolio.""Columbia Select Large Cap Growth gained 8.23% so far this year going into Wednesday, vs. 5.63% by its large growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. The fund has topped the annual average of returns in the category by 455 basis points over the past three years and 211 basis points during the last 10 years.Galvin says the unit growers that he seeks are more in control of their own destiny. ""For the first nine months of the year, the average company in our portfolio saw approximately 15% year-over-year revenue growth and 20% profit growth,"" he said. ""S&P 500 profits have been about flat this year.""Monster ReturnsSelect Large Cap Growth's top holding as of Sept. 30 was Monster Beverage (MNST). ""It does not manufacture its products, so it has an asset-light business model that generates very strong returns on invested capital,"" Galvin said. ""Energy drinks are the fastest-growing category in the beverage industry, and Monster is a play on this opportunity. Its recent deal with Coca-Cola (KO) will serve to nearly double Monster's international volumes over the next several years.""Shares of Monster have climbed 41% this year.LinkedIn (LNKD) was the fund's No. 2 holding; it's been a part of the portfolio since 2012. ""It is a very disruptive force, changing the way companies recruit workers,"" Galvin said. ""It has a base of over 400 million registered users, which provides a significant amount of information to recruiters.""The company has seen its stock price rise 7.5% year-to-date.Another top tech-sector holding that Galvin has also owned since 2012 is Facebook (FB). ""Facebook's size and scale is very attractive to advertisers, so it continues to gain significant market share of ad spending budgets,"" he said. The stock has rallied 36% on the year.The Columbia Select team sees Visa (V) as a key beneficiary of a global shift from cash and checks to plastic and online payment. ""We're expecting double-digit unit volume growth and continuing operating leverage to sustain double-digit EPS growth for the next several years,"" Galvin said. Visa shares have spiked 22% in 2015.Galvin recently added Fitbit (FIT) to the portfolio. ""Fitbit is benefiting from the growing interest in better health and wellness monitored through wearable devices, of which it is the market leader,"" he said. ""It's a secular lifestyle shift and not just a fad.""

"
284,MNST,"A leading stock's 50-day moving average is a key support level to watch after the stock breaks out of a base. The strongest stocks tend to ride the average higher after an early-stage breakout.You can use the 50-day line as a vital tool to screen stocks as well.When building your watch list of stocks using growth screens like the IBD 50 (updated every day in Leaderboard ), IPO Leaders (in IBD on Tuesday and Thursday) and the Big Cap 20 (most Tuesdays), make sure that the stocks are consolidating gains above their 50-day moving averages. (Mini charts in IBD are weekly charts and therefore show a stock's 10-week moving average.) These stocks have a better chance of breaking out successfully than those basing below their 50-day or 10-week lines.Stocks trading comfortably above their 10-week lines are showing relative strength, and that's important to see as a stock is building a base. It's common for a stock to fall below its 10-week line as it builds a base; but as it starts to regain momentum, make sure that it's above its 10-week line as it nears a breakout area. At that point, the only resistance level it has to overcome is its prior high. If it's below its 10-week line, overhead supply becomes an issue; the 10-week line can turn into a resistance level.A buy point in a flat base should appear above the 10-week line. The same holds true for a double-bottom pattern and a cup-with-handle pattern. A handle area that forms below the 10-week line is a no-no. This is another case where the 10-week line could be a difficult price area for a stock to punch through.Amazon.com (AMZN) has been a solid performer this year after clearing a series of bases that showed supporting action at the 10-week moving average. The first breakout occurred during the week that ended April 24; the second one was during the week ended July 17; and the third one was during the week ended Oct. 23, soon after the S&P 500's follow-through day on Oct. 2.Today, several other top-rated growth names are building bases above their 10-week lines. They include Monster Beverage (MNST), Alliance Data Systems (ADS) and LogMeIn (LOGM). Regeneron (REGN) recently cleared a double-bottom buy point of 557.97, but it added a handle area that shows an alternate buy point of 588.15.LinkedIn (LNKD) is working on the right side of a deep, jagged base. Shares soared nearly 15% in the week that ended Oct. 30. It has yet to overtake its 276.18 high.

312,MNST,"A wild run-up in a stock you own is exciting, but what you ideally want to see while the stock is basing is just the opposite type of action. When a stock is consolidating after a pronounced advance in price, the calmer the action, the better.Instead of wide and loose price action on big spikes in volume, look for stocks with tight weekly closes in calm, quiet trade.""On a weekly chart, tightness is defined as small price variations from high to low for the week, with several consecutive weeks' prices closing unchanged or remarkably near the previous week's close,"" IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""""If the base pattern has a wide spread between the week's high and low points every week, it's been constantly in the market's eye and frequently will not succeed when it breaks out,"" he wrote.Tight weekly closes signal accumulation by the big money: mutual funds, pensions, banks and other institutional investors.Let's say the market is selling off, but a leading stock on your watch list is trading tightly, with small price changes from week to week. That's a sign that some big money managers may be building a position in the stock but spreading purchases out over weeks or months, instead of causing a big price and volume spike by buying a stake at once.If large-fund managers are dumping shares, a stock will go down in heavy volume. Likewise, if they are snapping up shares, the stock will rise in brisk turnover.Tight trading is easier to spot in a flat base, due in part to the pattern's nature. The correction from a price high is contained within 15% from the base's peak to the trough. But it's a bullish trait that can occur in cup, cup-with-handle and double-bottom bases, too.Monster Beverage (MNST) saw some wild and loose overall price action in 2012 and into 2013, but trading began to tighten up in subsequent bases. The stock cleared a cup-with-handle base in December 2013, and rose 19% before consolidating again.The new pattern, which kicked off in February 2014, featured several areas of tight trading with a weekly change of less than 1%.Shares rocketed nearly 35% in the week ended Aug. 15, triggering the eight-week hold rule for winners that rally more than 20% in three weeks or less. That week, Coca-Cola (KO) said it would take a 16.7% ownership stake in Monster as part of a deal in which Coke would transfer its energy drink portfolio to Monster.The next week, shares fell 7.6% to start the left side of a new base. Weekly price action stayed in a fairly narrow range for the seven-week duration of the flat base, including a 1% or smaller price change for four straight weeks (1).Volume was light in the base, which is ideal. Monster cleared the 95.03 buy point Oct. 10, but heavy trade didn't kick in until the week ended Nov. 7, when the stock rallied 7% in above-average volume (2).The tight trading in calm volume helped set Monster up for a big run. Shares advanced as much as 64% from the entry to its early August peak of 155.83.

317,MNST,"Monster Beverage (MNST) flexed its muscles with double-digit sales gains across retail channels last month as more consumers opted to quench their thirst with its energy drinks.Monster's dollar sales were up a solid 11.2% from a year earlier during the four-week period ending Sept. 5, according to a report on beverage sales by Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog, citing Nielsen's ""all channel"" data — including grocery, drug, mass, and convenience stores.Monster's unit sales were up 12.6% from a year earlier during the period and its average unit pricing was down 1.3%.Monster's lineup of energy drinks now include Coca-Cola (KO) energy brands as a part of a partnership deal with the soft drink giant that closed in June. Under the pact, Coke transferred ownership of its energy drink business to Monster and in return, Monster transferred its non-energy drink business to Coke. Coke has also become Monster's preferred global distribution partner.Coke now owns about 16.7% stake in Monster.The energy drink category overall remained strong during the month with dollar sales up 11.1% vs. a year earlier, Herzog noted in her report.Rockstar led the pack with a hefty 29.5% gain in dollar sales for the month.Energy drink hot shot Red Bull saw a 9.4% increase in dollar sales for the four-week period.But total carbonated soft drink dollar sales (excluding energy drinks) in all channels fizzled with a 1.0% decline for the month, noted Herzog.Coke's dollar sales overall were up 2.2% vs. a year earlier for the four-week period amid ""solid growth"" from juices, water, and teas, which ""partially offset declines"" in carbonated soft drinks, Herzog noted.Pepsico (PEP) saw dollar sales rise 0.9% during the month, according to the report. ""Soft"" results in carbonated soft drinks were ""offset"" by ""slight growth"" in snacks and by ""solid"" growth in water, sports drinks, and shelf-stable juices, Herzog noted.Pepsi recently expanded an alliance with home-based Sodastream (SODA). That comes as Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR) and Coca-Cola are developing Keurig Kold device for soft drinks. Coke also owns a significant stake in Keurig Green Mountain.Dollar sales for Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPS) were up 2.2% during the four-week period, driven by ""modest growth"" in carbonated soft drinks and ""strong"" results in juices and teas, Herzog noted.Monster is part of IBD's Beverage-Non-Alcoholic industry group, where it ranks No. 2 with a Composite Rating of 95 out of a possible 99. Coca-Cola Bottling (COKE) ranks No. 1 with a Composite Rating of 99.Monster's stock closed up 1.1% to 133.93 Wednesday in the stock market today. Coca-Cola Co. closed up 1.7% to 39.15, Pepsi closed up 1.1% to 93.07 and Dr Pepper closed up 0.6% to 77.26 . Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR) closed up 3.5% to 60.15 and SodaStream (SODA) closed up 3.7% to 15.59.Correction: The original article misidentified Rockstar's owner.

504,MNST,"Monster Beverage's (MNST) stock surged Tuesday after Citigroup added the energy-drink maker to its U.S. Focus List and said the company was its top U.S. beverage stock, citing international growth potential as well as earnings and sales acceleration in the years to come.Citi kept its buy rating on the stock with a 155 price target. Over the next five years, analysts there see Monster turning in ""outsized"" earnings and sales growth.""We are adding MNST to our U.S. Focus List as we believe there is considerable upside to the stock from current levels,"" Citi analyst Wendy Nicholson said in a note, according to Benzinga.Shares rallied 3.7% to 131.64 in the stock market today. Monster's stock gapped down May 8 after reporting disappointing Q1 results a day earlier, beginning a stint below its 50-day moving average that persisted through Tuesday.Nicholson said that decline was due to research indicating that Monster's market share had ""come under a bit of pressure,"" Benzinga reported.Looking ahead, Citi sees Monster's stock price rising due to a variety of factors.Among them: the possibility that Coca-Cola (KO) will raise its stake in the company, new products, opportunities to get into new markets such as China, new distribution deals in nations like Brazil and indications ""that U.S. distribution transition has stabilized,"" according to StreetInsider.Coca-Cola on Friday completed a $2.15 billion purchase of a 16.7% stake in Monster. Under the terms of that agreement, Coke handed over its energy-product business to Monster in exchange for Monster's nonenergy drinks.

"
537,MNST,"Dull. Boring. Do-nothing. They are not great adjectives to call someone. But if you see those traits in a stock chart, it might actually be a good thing. That lackluster action may turn into a flat base, which can be the launching pad to big stock market winners.Like its name suggests, the flat base has a flat appearance. It should look like a rectangular box with a correction from high to low of no more than 15%. The stock looks like it's just going sideways, not doing much. This is fine, especially if a stock has had a strong prior run. It gives the stock time to catch its breath and not overheat.The flat base is one of CAN SLIM's shorter base patterns . It only needs five weeks to take shape vs. seven weeks for the cup with handle or double bottom. To count the number of weeks, typically start counting from the first down week after a high.The flat-base pattern shows that a stock is moving within a defined trading range. There's a certain area where the price will rise to and then back off. That's the ceiling or resistance level. There's also a level where price will fall to and then rise from — a floor or support level.To make it easier to see the pattern, investors can draw separate horizontal lines connecting the highs and lows. MarketSmith , which requires a separate subscription, will identify a flat base and other chart patterns for you, which can be great for beginners or even seasoned investors.The buy point in a flat base is 10 cents above the left-side high.Sometimes, the bottom part of the pattern will be more rounded, making it look like a cup base instead. This is fine; whether it's a flat base or cup formation, the buy point will be the same.Just like other bases, you want to see volume bulge at least 40%-50% above average when a stock breaks out of the flat base.The flat base is usually not a first-stage structure. It tends to form after a stock breaks out from a prior pattern such as a cup, cup with handle or double-bottom. This makes sense: The sideways action marks a digestion period for the stock.During market corrections, stocks that vacillate and form flat bases are actually showing you strength. They are not going down like most other issues under tough market conditions.Monster Beverage (MNST) shaped a flat base in September to October 2010 (1). The five-week pattern corrected by just 7% and formed after the stock broke out from a cup with handle in July.The stock cleared the 48.06 buy point from the flat base in the week ended Oct. 15, rising 6% that week. Shares of the maker of the widely popular Monster energy drinks rose 14% before pulling back and settling into what became another flat base (2).For more free lessons on chart patterns and other investment topics, check out our newly redesigned IBD University on Investors.com.

Weak wage growth is partly due to low inflation, which gives the Federal Reserve leeway to keep interest rates near zero longer to keep stimulating the economy.Molina Healthcare (MOH) led the IBD 50, jumping 12% in heavy volume and retaking its 50-day moving average following a strong Q1 earnings report. The provider of managed health care services for low-income families gapped above its 10-week moving average as a potential base takes shape.Paycom Software (PAYC), another IBD 50 stock, climbed 3% and cleared a 35.96 buy point en route to a new high. Volume was running nearly four times the stock's daily average, boding well for the breakout.On the downside, Monster Beverage (MNST) plunged 9% after a weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings report. The energy drink maker fell more than 8% below a flat-base buy point of 144, triggering a sell rule.

"
572,MNST,"Talk about caffeine highs and lows. After negative publicity surrounding the health risks of consuming too much caffeine slowed growth in 2013, the energy-drink market resumed its run last year.Health risks apparently weren't shown to be strong enough to hold back core energy-drink consumers for too long.""The fact is, a lot of core consumers of energy drinks — young males — don't tend to pay a lot of attention to health concerns,"" Amit Sharma, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, told IBD.Industry watchers say the category is poised for healthy growth the next few years at least.That's good news for the two dominant players in the energy-drink market: Corona, Calif.-based Monster Beverage (MNST) and its chief rival, the Austrian company Red Bull.Sharma, for one, recently assured his clients that it was safe not only for most people to consume energy drinks, but also to invest in Monster Beverage.Energy-Drink Safety BuzzIn a client note, Sharma pointed to ""mounting scientific evidence"" that consuming energy drinks in moderate amounts is safe. Together with Monster Beverage's voluntary labeling and marketing changes, he said, the risk of adverse regulatory action is largely removed.Monster now displays its total caffeine on packaging and an advisory warning that its energy drinks are not recommended for children, caffeine-sensitive people and pregnant or nursing women. It also reduced marketing programs to consumers under 18.How does Monster view health risks related to its energy drinks? Company executives declined to comment on any aspect of the business. But the first comment from CEO Rodney Sacks in a Feb. 26 conference call following its fourth-quarter report said it all: ""We reiterate that our products are safe.""Monster's gross sales in the quarter grew 12.1% vs. the prior year to $696.3 million. Earnings shot up 63% to 72 cents per share, sending Monster's stock up 13% to 141.Earnings for the full year jumped 42% over 2013 to $2.77 per share vs. 5% year-over-year growth in 2013. Gross sales for the year grew 9.3% to $2.8 billion.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect 2015 earnings to rise 22% to $3.37.""We think there is more upside to the stock,"" said Sharma, who has an outperform rating on it.The energy-drink market peaked in 2011 and 2012 on double-digit sales growth, according to the Mintel Group, a global market research agency. Mintel forecasts that energy-drink sales in the U.S. will grow around 40% from 2014 to 2019, or nearly 7% a year on average, as new users join the core cohort of 18- to 34-year-old males.Red Bull is the market leader in energy drinks worldwide. It's been selling energy drinks overseas longer and in more countries than Monster. But in the U.S., where Monster derives most of its sales, Monster and Red Bull are running neck and neck.""Monster has been pulling up on Red Bull, and they are almost tied now,"" said John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest.Monster Beverage was called Hansen Natural until the name got changed in 2012 to reflect the company's greater sales from Monster energy drinks than from natural soda and tea.Hansen launched its first energy drinks in 1997 and followed five years later with Monster Energy, which still comes in supersized, 16-ounce black cans featuring neon claws and Goth lettering on the outside and various vitamins and herbs on the inside — in addition to a blast of caffeine.Brand Grows RapidlyNearly 80% of Monster's sales are in the U.S., where Monster is growing faster than the overall energy-drink market.Red Bull is growing a little faster than Monster this year, however, due to the launch of new flavors, Sharma says. But he expects Monster's U.S. sales this year to grow in double digits.Monster is rolling out at least a couple of new products this year, such as recently launched Monster Energy Ultra Citron and Monster Rehab Peach Tea + Energy.But the biggest change will come from a deal with Coca-Cola (KO), set to close in the current quarter. Coke will acquire a 16.7% stake in Monster and become its preferred distribution partner worldwide.Under terms of the $2.15 billion transaction, Coke will transfer ownership of its energy-drink brands, including NOS and Full Throttle, to Monster. And Monster will transfer to Coke its nonenergy drinks business, such as Hansen's Natural Sodas and Peace Tea.""Monster gets access to the powerful Coke bottling system,"" said Sicher. ""Coke gets a significant equity stake in a very fast-growing beverage company, and its bottlers get more distribution of Monster.""Coke's new role ""will certainly accelerate the timeline for Monster's expansion into international markets,"" Sharma said.Going For The GlobeMonster's international sales have already been growing faster than domestic sales. Sacks said in the call that Japan is ""becoming one of our largest international markets."" He added that expansion in Germany, Great Britain, Greece, the Netherlands and Chile is also going well.One potential new market is China, Sharma says.""You could argue that over time, Coca-Cola will help Monster go into that market,"" he said. ""It's one of the biggest energy-drink markets, and Monster is not in that market today.""In a recent research report, analyst Theo Brito of BTIG suggested that at least $1.2 billion in new revenue opportunities could be up for Monster under the Coke ""brand swap"" from expansion into new consumer niches.Such new niche segments could include ""edgy millennial women,"" baby boomers and more affluent consumers overall, he noted. But still, young males ""may always be the largest energy drink consumer.""

575,MNST,"The stock market today got what it wanted — a generally weak April payrolls report. Payrolls expanded slightly more than expected for the month, to 223,000 vs. consensus estimates for 220,000. That was a positive. But private employers added fewer new jobs than expected, and the Labor Department sharply revised its March estimate downward to 85,000 new hires from an initial 123,000. Even more important, from a market standpoint, was the average hourly earnings number: up 0.1%. That compared to a 0.3% increase in March and economist projections for a 0.2% gain. The number has become a crucial metric for the Federal Reserve in deciding whether and when to raise target interest rates.

671,MNST,"No single stock screen will be the best in every uptrend. Different uptrends reward different kinds of stocks, and the screens reflect that reality. For example, during the last bear market, the aggressive and growthy complexion of the IBD 50 (then the IBD 100) faded.Stocks making the list on Oct. 27, 2008, included El Paso Electric (EE), Campbell Soup (CPB), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).The mention of those equities alone said, ""It's a bear market.""As of early November, the 85-85 screen has been the top-performing screen over the past six months. The 85-85 was up 6.1%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.1% and the IBD 50 1.5%.What can be made of this? There are two ways to use a screen — the micro approach and the macro approach.The micro approach studies the list to find stocks that might be near buy points and that have few misses by CAN SLIM standards .The macro approach looks for patterns in the list. What kind of stocks are making the list — small caps or big caps? Which sectors or industry groups are plentiful? Are the stocks making the screen aggressive or defensive?Let's contemplate two screens — the IBD 50 and the 85-85, also known as Your Weekly Review in Friday's newspaper.Generally, the IBD 50 is a collection of stocks that have higher ratings than those in the 85-85 screen. Because the IBD 50 has higher ratings, these stocks should do better in a long and strong uptrend.Quality growth stocks, though, will likely correct more sharply than defensive stocks when the market runs into trouble.What is the advantage of the 85-85 screen?The 85-85 will pick up more turnaround stocks than the IBD 50. (A turnaround stock is less likely to have strong annual ratings over the past three years.) The 85-85's looser standard means that it's also more likely to pick up stocks benefiting from sector rotation. It also will pick up more small and thinly traded stocks than the IBD 50.The sector rotation angle has been apparent recently. Small bank and S&L industry groups accounted for 40 of the stocks in the 85-85 at the end of October.Yet only two bank stocks made the IBD 50 — Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK) and Signature Bank (SBNY). Many of the 85-85 bank stocks are thinly traded. Some, though, still attract quality mutual fund holders, as the table shows.

Both stocks, though, are extended from buy points, which makes them too risky to buy. An extended stock can trigger the 8% sell rule with normal action.

"
687,MNST,"The current base began forming in August. While the pattern shows neither net distribution nor net accumulation, the up-down volume ratio is a bullish 1.8.

688,MNST,"Refiners are doing well because lower crude oil prices improve margins for the gasoline that refiners produce.

"
690,MNST,"Margins for other Valero refined products — such as petroleum coke, sulfur and propane — also ballooned. Over nine months, the boost helped these other products' margins to the tune of $1.3 billion.

780,MNST,"Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is in the third week of a pullback, but the situation is a little more complicated. The security software maker cleared a 129.52 buy point last month.

If it breaks to a new high within the next two weeks, 149.45 would act as a viable buy point. Investors should just be aware that Pal Alto's previous breakout above a three-weeks tight pattern, in September, was followed by a steep two-week dive.

"
792,MNST,"Lots of things that are tempting aren't good for you.
"
793,MNST,"One of those is the temptation to buy a stock on a late pullback, even if it has consistently rebounded after prior retreats.
"
794,MNST,"There are lots of logical reasons investors would want to make such a move.
"
795,MNST,"If the stock makes a sound advance following a proper breakout, a first or second pullback to a key support level is a valid entry point. Get in early in the run-up, the thinking goes, to capitalize on the big rally.
"
796,MNST,"But winning stocks eventually will peak when institutional investors are on the way out. Sometimes other fund managers step in at key levels to take advantage of the pullback. Sometimes not.
"
797,MNST,"When they do with real force, this is what traders call support. Stocks often find positive support at their 50-day and 200-day moving averages, as well as at other key price levels.
"
798,MNST,"But a falling stock gives no assurances. If you hold and buy only when a stock is rising from support or through a buy point in strong volume, you are buying at the most advantageous point — just as institutional investors are piling into it. That positive momentum leaves you with a cushion. That cushion keeps you from being shaken out if the stock makes a normal pullback.
"
799,MNST,"When you buy a leading stock rising through a buy point or rebounding from support, you are reducing your risk by taking advantage of research showing these are opportune places at which to buy.
"
800,MNST,"Consider Monster Beverage (MNST) in June 2012. The fast-growing energy drink maker had run up 280% following an August 2010 breakout. The stock had found support right at its 10-week moving average, with a few brief exceptions, across the entire length of that run.
"
801,MNST,"That may have made it a tempting buy to many investors as the stock retreated toward its 10-week line in June. Shares had already staged numerous pullbacks since clearing another base the prior August. That meant a new base was overdue, another reason to hold off on a decision to buy.
"
802,MNST,"The stock stabbed below its 10-week line in massive trade June 28 (1), then recovered. When it dropped through the line again, this time in light trade, in mid-July, it was on its way to a 45% decline over the next four months. Those who bought near 72 were forced to cut losses at 7% to 8%.
"
803,MNST,"Even talented investors can still get hurt if they break the rules and buy on the way down. These are generally investors who have put their time in learning the ropes, and who fit T.S. Eliot's old line about tampering with the rules of poetry and grammar, ""It's not wise to violate the rules until you know how to observe them.""
"
804,MNST,"Investors who buy on the pullback also tend already to have a big cushion in the stock, and they are well versed in how to shave their holdings quickly if no support arrives.
"
805,MNST,"Another temptation is to buy a deeply eroded stock speculating that, at some point, it will recover to its former highs. This is the realm of the deep value investor, and it requires significant research and expertise to determine whether a battered stock really has intrinsic value and what kind of stock price that value may or may not make it worth.

That cushion keeps you from being shaken out if the stock makes a normal pullback.When you buy a leading stock rising through a buy point or rebounding from support, you are reducing your risk by taking advantage of research showing these are opportune places at which to buy.Consider Monster Beverage (MNST) in June 2012. The fast-growing energy drink maker had run up 280% following an August 2010 breakout. The stock had found support right at its 10-week moving average, with a few brief exceptions, across the entire length of that run.That may have made it a tempting buy to many investors as the stock retreated toward its 10-week line in June. Shares had already staged numerous pullbacks since clearing another base the prior August. That meant a new base was overdue, another reason to hold off on a decision to buy.The stock stabbed below its 10-week line in massive trade June 28 (1), then recovered. When it dropped through the line again, this time in light trade, in mid-July, it was on its way to a 45% decline over the next four months. Those who bought near 72 were forced to cut losses at 7% to 8%.Even talented investors can still get hurt if they break the rules and buy on the way down. These are generally investors who have put their time in learning the ropes, and who fit T.S. Eliot's old line about tampering with the rules of poetry and grammar, ""It's not wise to violate the rules until you know how to observe them.""Investors who buy on the pullback also tend already to have a big cushion in the stock, and they are well versed in how to shave their holdings quickly if no support arrives.Another temptation is to buy a deeply eroded stock speculating that, at some point, it will recover to its former highs. This is the realm of the deep value investor, and it requires significant research and expertise to determine whether a battered stock really has intrinsic value and what kind of stock price that value may or may not make it worth.It doesn't pay to mix investing strategies.

It saw a nice pop in sales for all in-store carbonated soft drink categories and the beer category for the four weeks that ended Dec. 20, according to a report by analyst Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo Securities citing Nielsen data.Herzog credits lower gas prices for the ""strong"" in-store sales at U.S. convenience stores across all categories during the four weeks.Strong average price growth drove total carbonated beverage dollar sales in the U.S. convenience-store channel, excluding the energy drink category, up a solid 3.6% vs. a year earlier for the four weeks ending Dec. 20, Herzog noted.Continued strong growth for Monster and Red Bull fueled the energy drink category to dollar sales growth of 10.9% at convenience stores for the four-week period, Herzog said.IBD 50 stock Monster is in IBD's Beverages-Non-Alcoholic industry group. It has the highest Composite Rating in the group: 95 out of a possible 99. It's primed for growth this year as it benefits from a partnership with Coca-Cola (KO) that should boost its business overseas as well as in the U.S.Monster saw a hefty 12.4% rise in dollar sales at convenience stores for the four-week period.""We attribute MNST's strong results to overall industry tailwinds given lower retail gas prices and more specifically the incremental penetration of MNST's new innovation(s),"" Herzog wrote. ""We remain encouraged by the KO-MNST partnership as well as positive results from innovation, and we believe growth should continue to accelerate heading into FY2015 and beyond, particularly if retail gas prices continue to support strong in-store sales.""Unit growth of 2% and pricing growth of 2.8% drove beer dollar sales in the U.S. convenience-store channel up a solid 4.8% for the four week period, Herzog wrote.Alcoholic beverage distributor Constellation continued its strong sales growth trends of a 21.9% increase from a year earlier for the four-week period, while Boston Beer saw dollar sales rise 19.8%.Constellation and Boston Beer are a part of IBD's Beverages-Alcoholic industry group. Boston Beer has the highest IBD Composite Rating in the group at 97. Constellation ranks third with a Composite Rating of 93.Beverage industry giant Coca-Cola has also been seeing strong sales gains. A strong price increase drove its carbonated soft drink dollar sales up 4.8% for the four-week period.""We remain encouraged KO's solid dollar sales growth and share gains, which we attribute to retail gas price tailwinds (and) its best-in-class price pack architecture,"" wrote Herzog.

845,MNST,"No single stock screen will be the best in every uptrend. Different uptrends reward different kinds of stocks, and the screens reflect that reality. For example, during the last bear market, the aggressive and growthy complexion of the IBD 50 (then the IBD 100) faded.Stocks making the list on Oct. 27, 2008, included El Paso Electric (EE), Campbell Soup (CPB), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).The mention of those equities alone said, ""It's a bear market.""As of early November, the 85-85 screen has been the top-performing screen over the past six months. The 85-85 was up 6.1%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.1% and the IBD 50 1.5%.What can be made of this? There are two ways to use a screen — the micro approach and the macro approach.The micro approach studies the list to find stocks that might be near buy points and that have few misses by CAN SLIM standards .The macro approach looks for patterns in the list. What kind of stocks are making the list — small caps or big caps? Which sectors or industry groups are plentiful? Are the stocks making the screen aggressive or defensive?Let's contemplate two screens — the IBD 50 and the 85-85, also known as Your Weekly Review in Friday's newspaper.Generally, the IBD 50 is a collection of stocks that have higher ratings than those in the 85-85 screen. Because the IBD 50 has higher ratings, these stocks should do better in a long and strong uptrend.Quality growth stocks, though, will likely correct more sharply than defensive stocks when the market runs into trouble.What is the advantage of the 85-85 screen?The 85-85 will pick up more turnaround stocks than the IBD 50. (A turnaround stock is less likely to have strong annual ratings over the past three years.) The 85-85's looser standard means that it's also more likely to pick up stocks benefiting from sector rotation. It also will pick up more small and thinly traded stocks than the IBD 50.The sector rotation angle has been apparent recently. Small bank and S&L industry groups accounted for 40 of the stocks in the 85-85 at the end of October.Yet only two bank stocks made the IBD 50 — Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK) and Signature Bank (SBNY). Many of the 85-85 bank stocks are thinly traded. Some, though, still attract quality mutual fund holders, as the table shows.

862,MNST,"Pssst. I have a two-for-one deal that you absolutely can't refuse.
"
863,MNST,"I'll give you two stocks for every one you own — a 2-for-1 split.
"
864,MNST,"I have to cut the price of the shares I give you in half. So if you own a share worth $100, you get two shares worth $50 each. After all, we can't just arbitrarily double the company's market value.
"
865,MNST,"Here's the deal. The lower share price allows more investors to buy. That will boost the stock price — and the value of your shares. How about it?
"
866,MNST,"Well, you say, let's take a closer look. You in fact might decide that it's actually time to sell your shares and nail your gains.
"
867,MNST,"IBD research shows that one stock split will usually be OK during the early stages of a bull market. But two or more splits during a short period of time — say, within a year or two — may actually signal that the stock has peaked.
"
868,MNST,"Too many stock splits create a flood of supply, which can weigh on share prices if the company has overestimated demand. It's especially true of stocks that have had long, sharp advances near the tail end of a bull market.
"
869,MNST,"Firms that split their shares in a big way, such 3-for-1 or 4-for-1, are especially vulnerable.
"
870,MNST,"Hansen's Natural, now Monster Beverage (MNST), plunged from record high levels shortly after its 4-for-1 split took effect in the week that ended July 14, 2006. The split came only 11 months after an earlier 2-for-1 split in August 2005 and coincided with the market falling into a correction.
"
871,MNST,"Monster, which had hit a high of 52.72 in the week ended July 7, lost more than half its value in just four months.
"
872,MNST,"At the time, Monster boasted best-possible 99 Composite and Earnings Per Share ratings. But stocks' charts often give off sell signals well before their sales growth and profit growth fade.
"
873,MNST,"A stock split is one of many signals that the stock's run may have peaked. According to IBD research, 82% of the stock market's biggest winners didn't split their stocks in the year preceding their biggest price advances.
"
874,MNST,"So shareholders should start looking for sell signals when a company announces that it's splitting its stock. The signals could include a failed breakout from a late-stage base, as Monster had in early August 2006 (1). Monster also plunged below its 10-week moving average in huge trade, another sell signal (2).

1049,MNST,"Crucially, a stock will often give you a sell signal so clear that you can only ignore it at your peril.Consider the failure of a late-stage base as a stock's way of saying it's done.Imagine what you risk by extending the stock some leeway. Maybe you bought the stock as it formed that late-stage base.Why would you do such a thing? A late pattern is itself a flaw. Well, maybe the base was especially tight, and the price-volume action looked ideal. Or the group was hot.But failure is failure. And failing from a late-stage base suggests that there's lots of room on the downside after a long run-up.Perhaps yours was a long-held position. So you have a bigger profit cushion than recent buyers. So what? That you have ""some room"" when the stock starts misbehaving is no reason to surrender a substantial portion of your hard-fought gains.Monster Beverage's (MNST) story is classic. Maybe you bought the stock at 27.47 (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split) as it broke out from an early-stage flat base in January 2011. (See a long-term weekly chart.) It was the latest in a string of tight bases that was, collectively, a long base-on-base pattern.The next base appeared in the seven weeks through the week ended Aug. 19, 2011. (1) A five-week flat base appearing a few months later (2) was tighter — and, as a base-on-base to the August pattern, kept the base count relatively low.From this latter pattern, the stock soared 72% to 83.96, with an ugly downside reversal in the week ended May 4, 2012. (3)That reversal, along with the highest volume of the move, was itself a major sell signal.The sideways-to-higher drift seen in the ensuing seven weeks was the stock's attempt to build another base. The attempt was poor, the pattern hard to define — except that it was a late-stage structure.The final straw appeared in late June 2012, with the stock slicing its 10-week line in monster volume. (4) Why might you have given Monster some room after such a show of weakness? Perhaps because the stock ended the week in the upper half of that trading range? Well, that was, strictly speaking, an upside reversal.But you had ""Monster"" profits in this stock, which you started accumulating either at 19.15 or at 27.47. And it was failing from a late-stage base. Enough said.

1090,MNST,"Sometimes great stocks approaching their peaks flash too many sell signs to ignore. Sometimes they flash subtle ones.One such sign is a fast series of big stock splits. Many investors see splits bullishly. Companies use stock splits to lower share prices. But you should treat them with caution.Theoretically, lower prices mean more demand. A 2-for-1 split halves the price of a stock from $100 to $50 while doubling the number of shares outstanding. Investors who previously couldn't afford a share might now be tempted. (Companies can effect splits in ratios of up to 10-to-1 or more.) But a split does not change the current value of the company in any way.There are reasons that companies like Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG) and  Priceline.com (PCLN) have share prices of $439 to $820. (The grandpappy of the stock split resistance is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), with its Class A share price now topping $160,000.)These stocks attract investors willing to pay for quality. That might narrow the potential audience, but it tends to increase the smart-money sponsors that are backing the stock. Stock splits attract smaller investors. In effect, they change the neighborhood.To be sure, early stock splits are often not a problem.Stocks can and often do move higher after initial splits — particularly when they happen early in a bull market. But problems occur when companies enact multiple big splits — say, a 2-for-1 and a 3-for-1 — in a one- to two-year period.This floods the market with a company's shares. IBD research shows a stock will often reach a price peak around its second or third split. Research also shows that only 18% of history's biggest winners had even a single stock split in the year preceding the start of their run.One good example of a hot stock tripping on a stock split is  Monster Beverage (MNST), once named Hansen Natural. Monster, one of the original energy drink success stories, jetted more than 4,000% from 2003 to 2006.The company enacted its first stock split in August 2005 (1) , just a month after the stock first touched $100 per share (chart is split-adjusted). The stock's response shows why a single stock split, like most sell signals, is not a sign to cut and run.Just after the split, Monster shares dropped through their 10-week line in heavy trade, but stopped a short distance below the line. The stock formed a new base, then broke out and moved higher.The second, truly monster 4-to-1 split, occurred just after the stock punched through the 210 pre-adjusted price level in July 2006. (2) Shares responded immediately with a pullback to the 10-week line in heavy trade. Monster dived a few weeks later en route to a 53% correction.

1091,MNST,"The managers of the $782 million Thornburg Core Growth Fund are jugglers.
"
1092,MNST,"They blend and balance three types of growth stocks into their portfolio: mature industry leaders, consistent growers and emerging growers.
"
1093,MNST,"That approach helped these managers extend their successful investing streak. Their fund was up 21.82% this year through Aug. 30. That topped 96% of their large-cap growth rivals, averaging 15.56%, as tracked by Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500 was up 16.15%.
"
1094,MNST,"The fund is outperforming 98% of its peers over the past three years and 84% of its peer group over the past five years.
"
1095,MNST,"Co-manager Greg Dunn, 37 years old, spoke with IBD from his office in Santa Fe, N.M.
"
1096,MNST,"IBD: Your fund has some interesting features. You run a concentrated portfolio. You buy stocks when they're trading at a discount. You can invest in stocks of any size. Tell me what each trait contributes.
"
1097,MNST,"Dunn: Concentration lets us focus on our best ideas. We tend to hold 40 to 55 stocks. It varies depending on whether we're finding a lot of opportunities and the risk profile of each investment. We're around 50 now.
"
1098,MNST,"We consider our price target on each stock a representation of intrinsic value. And we don't own a stock unless we believe there is upside from the current price. So we always buy at a discount.
"
1099,MNST,"Size flexibility reflects our three-basket structure. Our emerging-growth leaders tend to be more aggressive stocks, smaller and faster growing. They're generally sitting in front of a large opportunity.
"
1100,MNST,"The second basket, our growth industry leaders, tends to be midcap or large caps. These have leadership positions. They're more mature companies.
"
1101,MNST,"The third basket holds our consistent growers. They add a little defensive nature to the portfolio. They tend to have a good element of visibility. They often have a subscription model or recurring revenue and good earnings visibility.
"
1102,MNST,"IBD: What sort of an edge do you get from your three-basket tack?
"
1103,MNST,"Dunn: The three baskets add diversification. They let us balance risk from more conservative to more aggressive growth stocks. Stocks perform differently in different markets. This lets us aim for good performance throughout investment cycles.
"
1104,MNST,"IBD: How do you divvy your cash among the three baskets?
"
1105,MNST,"Dunn: We want about 33% in each.
"
1106,MNST,"IBD: You make bottom-up investment decisions. But sector weights reflect where you tend to look for leaders. Why is software your largest sector currently?
"
1107,MNST,"Dunn: There's a lot of innovation and change there. Part of our weighting is exposure to SaaS — software as a service. It is disruptive to software on the premises. Lower cost. Faster upgrade cycles.
"
1108,MNST,"Another reason is that we like software companies that have expertise serving a specific vertical niche.
"
1109,MNST,"Guidewire Software (GWRE), for example, developed a software platform for property and casualty insurers. The core platform covers policy claims and billing systems. For years the software that insurers used was in-house, antiquated, inflexible and expensive to maintain. Guidewire's works much better. Its value proposition is really strong. And it is addressing a big market, which is bigger than $10 billion. Their share is less than 5%. But they're starting to win big deals that validate them within the industry.
"
1110,MNST,"IBD: So Guidewire's strength is not delivering software via the cloud. They're an exception to that preference. In this case it's their vertical integration that you like?
"
1111,MNST,"Dunn: Guidewire is primarily on-premise. Their software enables core business processes that need to be on premise. Yes, they're an exception. With Guidewire, we like how they have developed deep vertical expertise to disrupt an industry that has lacked software innovation for a long time.
"
1112,MNST,"IBD: Financials were one of your strongest sectors in the second quarter. What worked there?
"
1113,MNST,"Dunn: We don't own traditional financials like big banks. But we found what we think are interesting growth companies. One is WisdomTree (WETF), one of the largest ETF companies. They're benefiting from the flow of assets into passive investment vehicles.
"
1114,MNST,"We've got Charles Schwab (SCHW), which benefits from rising rates because of their money market funds. They've been losing money on their money market funds due to low rates. As rates rise, they can make money there. Rising rates are the biggest swing factor to earnings corporatewide.
"
1115,MNST,"Schwab brokerage clients have some portion of their assets in cash, in Schwab money market funds. Schwab normally charges a fee on assets. But with rates so low, Schwab has waived the fees. And of course on the banking side if rates go up, Schwab should benefit like any bank.
"
1116,MNST,"The stock has run up from 14 a share at the end of last year to around 21. So we trimmed around some big moves to get the weight at an appropriate level for us. We still like it.
"
1117,MNST,"IBD: Consumer staples was another successful Q2 sector. What do you like there?
"
1118,MNST,"Dunn: We've been underweight in consumer staples. We call them expensive defensives. But we do find some names in that space attractive. Monster Beverage (MNST) makes energy drinks. There's a secular trend toward energy drink consumption in the U.S. and around the world. And Monster is a leading player.
"
1119,MNST,"In consumer discretionary, we like Dollar Tree (DLTR). They're a value proposition, with a nice assortment of consumable and discount goods with good price points.
"
1120,MNST,"They have a base of about 4,800 stores, growing close to 10% a year with an opportunity to reach 7,000.
"
1121,MNST,"They also have a Canadian opportunity, with 160 stores that can go to 1,000.
"
1122,MNST,"They trade at a similar multiple to their peers, but we feel they're a better company. They have better real estate, merchandise mix, and long-term growth prospects.
"
1123,MNST,"IBD: Health care also helped. Why do you like Gilead Sciences (GILD)?
"
1124,MNST,"Dunn: They're a leader in the treatment of HIV. They've grown their share of HIV treatment from 40% in 2004 to 82% last year. And there are still a lot of infected patients who are not being treated, so there's room for patient growth.
"
1125,MNST,"Now they're moving into the hepatitis C market, which is huge. We think they have the best cure. They're trading at a single-digit P/E multiple. But at their rate of growth, they won't be growing at a single-digit pace. So there's an opportunity to get upside.
"
1126,MNST,"IBD: Energy is a small sector for you, but it was a third good one in Q2. What are some favorite plays?
"
1127,MNST,"Dunn: We own Continental Resources (CLR) and Sanchez Energy (SN). Both are shale plays.
"
1128,MNST,"IBD: CommVault Systems (CVLT) is new to the portfolio. What do you see powering the resumption of its uptrend after a wobbly Q2?
"
1129,MNST,"Dunn: We had been following it, waiting for an opportunity to get involved. We bought it in June when it had a pullback.
"
1130,MNST,"Their software provides backup, archive and recovery solutions. We think they're a best-of-breed market share gainer.
"
1131,MNST,"They've got multiple secular drivers: data growth, the move to the cloud, virtualization, mobility and the bring-your-own-device trend. They let companies reduce costs and risks associated with protecting, recovering and accessing data across an enterprise.
"
1132,MNST,"In their first-quarter conference call, they were cautious in their outlook, mirroring what a lot of tech companies were saying. We didn't see weakness in their results, but management's tone spooked people a little.
"
1133,MNST,"IBD: Priceline.com (PCLN) is up about 50% this year. You've indicated that you still find it attractive. How so?
"
1134,MNST,"Dunn: They're the best in the travel space. They were the first mover in Europe, and that market is still developing.
"
1135,MNST,"It does not have nearly the penetration of online travel booking as the U.S.
"
1136,MNST,"The hotel market is more fragmented, and Priceline is doing a better job than competitors at getting hotels onto their platform.
"
1137,MNST,"They have a first-mover, sustainable advantage there.
"
1138,MNST,"IBD: Stratasys (SSYS) is another newcomer to the portfolio. Why did you trim it shortly after opening your position?
"
1139,MNST,"Dunn: We bought it in March. Our trim was mostly to manage position size. It's an emerging-growth, early-stage stock that can be expensive and volatile. So we like to keep that sort of position at a reasonable range. But we think the 3D (prototyping) space is interesting, and they're an early pioneer.
"
1140,MNST,"IBD: LinkedIn (LNKD) has more than doubled this year. Did you trim in recent quarters for risk management or concerns over fundamentals?
"
1141,MNST,"Dunn: We bought in November when the stock was under pressure. We didn't have any concerns. We were just managing our size. The stock had grown into a bigger weight than we felt was appropriate. We've really liked them since they came public.
"
1142,MNST,"The thing that's attractive is that they've got the professional network locked down. We don't think there will be multiple professional networks. And we like the way they monetize their recruiter tools. Their talent solutions give employers access to this huge database of passive job seekers at a good price in comparison to using a recruiter.
"
1143,MNST,"IBD: CoStar Group (CSGP) is another relative newcomer. What do you like about this real estate data provider?
"
1144,MNST,"Dunn: They offer customers online access to a database of commercial real estate information, which has been researched and verified. That information is very valuable and difficult to replicate.
"
1145,MNST,"They are able to sell subscriptions to their clients, and they have very high renewal rates. The competitive barriers to entry are high. The business model is very profitable and scalable. And we may be in the early innings of a multiyear recovery in commercial real estate.
"
1146,MNST,"IBD: Portfolio Recovery (PRAA) is another name you've been trimming. Due to fundamentals or due to weight management?
"
1147,MNST,"Dunn: They've had a great performance, so the weight got bigger than what we think is appropriate. We continue to like them.
"
1148,MNST,"This stock can be controversial because it is debt collection business. They buy defaulted credit card portfolios at pennies on the dollar, then they try to collect. But they are the best operator in this business. Hedge funds and speculators used to bid on credit card receivables, then sell the portfolios to collection agencies. But many of those other buyershave left the market. So prices for defaulted portfolios are more attractive.
"
1149,MNST,"IBD: You've been trimming SVB Financial Group (SIVB). Another example of risk control, or are you concerned about fundamentals?
"
1150,MNST,"Dunn: This is the same story. It's been a strong stock, so we've been trimming to get back to an appropriate weight.
"
1151,MNST,"Silicon Valley Bank specializes in serving start-up and technology companies. They are also one of the few banks that benefits from higher interest rates. The majority of their loan book is floating rate and will benefit as rates move higher. And their net interest margin has been compressed by low interest rates.
"
1152,MNST,"Much of their deposits are in noninterest bearing checking accounts, so their cost of funding did not drop as rates declined, while their average loan rate did drop. We expect this to reverse.
"
1153,MNST,"IBD: Your 50-stock portfolio size is close to the 55-stock ceiling of your range. Have cash flows been above normal? And if they have, are you doing anything special to manage the inflow?
"
1154,MNST,"Dunn: Cash flow has been modestly positive. No portfolio management challenges. Positive cash flows allow us to proactively manage position sizes.
"
1155,MNST,"IBD: How do you and co-manager Tim Cunningham divvy up buy and sell decisions? Are you both generalists or do you each specialize in certain industries?
"
1156,MNST,"Dunn: Tim and I make all the buy and sell decisions together. Everyone on the team is working as a global generalist. We want to foster an environment of stock-picking, where analysts develop a broad set of analytical skills, and are evaluating investments in the context of the broader opportunity set, not just a narrow sector or industry.The managers of the $782 million Thornburg Core Growth Fund are jugglers.They blend and balance three types of growth stocks into their portfolio: mature industry leaders, consistent growers and emerging growers.That approach helped these managers extend their successful investing streak.

1168,MNST,"Stocks are like people. They put in their best performances while still enjoying the fresh blush of youth. (Some, of course, are late bloomers.)Research shows that stocks often put in their best gains within the first 15 years of going public. (Not long ago, IBD's guideline was restricted to eight years or less.)A raft of reasons explains this youthful exuberance.The biggest factor is the N — for New — in CAN SLIM. Big, stodgy companies can come up with new products, new ideas or new technologies. But the added revenue may hardly move the needle.Often it's the young guns that come in with a new way of doing things. In fact, that's often why the young company was formed in the first place. Maybe the new idea is an energy drink, a niche no one knew existed before Hansen Natural (now known as Monster Beverage (MNST) came out with its eponymous energy drink. The funny-looking cans hit the shelves, and a star is born. What's more, being a new concept, where's the competition? There isn't any for some time.Then, too, consider the different corporate structures of big vs. small. The young guns take out some office space and get to work on their brainchild. The new idea may well already exist, but the small firm's efforts are focused on complete execution.Now take a new idea and put it in the mid-management level of  IBM (IBM). A flash of brilliance can easily get lost in that mammoth company. Navigating the ocean of bureaucracy seems a very daunting task. Some entrenched powers may fear change. They're experts at doing things a certain way.But OK, let's say IBM recognizes the new idea. After all, this is a company that has survived for decades in an industry that thrives on new developments. We know that new ideas do get to the execution stage.Now you must deal with the economic impact of this new idea on the company.So IBM develops a new technology that puts a new twist on Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technology to help keep computer networks safe and efficient.That new unit would be very profitable. But against the backdrop of IBM's mammoth billings, the stock would likely benefit only mildly.Take that same new technology — and the genius who created it — and start a new company. Let's just call it Mellanox Technologies (MLNX). We'll base it in Israel and market to companies all over the world. That very same idea, rather than being lost in the shuffle, becomes the force behind one of the market's hottest stocks. The stock has powered 85% since moving past an early 61.50 buy point in June. 1

1233,MNST,"The previous quarter, it missed analysts estimates after topping in the first three periods last year. Its shares had nearly doubled in the last year prior to the merger report.Update: Coca-Cola (KO) said shortly before Monday's market close that ""we are not in discussions to acquire the Monster Beverage Corporation,"" denying a an earlier Wall Street Journal report that it's was in talks to buy out the energy drink maker. Monster Beverage (MNST) shares, up as much as 28% intraday, erased all its gains and closed down 0.8% to 65.***Coca-Cola (KO) is in talks to move from being a distributor to owning Monster Beverage (MNST), the fast-growing energy drink maker, reports said.Monster, with a market capitalization topping $11 billion, would be the biggest brand acquisition for Coke, the world's largest soft-drink maker, the Wall Street Journal reported.Monster shares soared as much as 28% intraday on the report. They were up nearly 17% to 76.50 in afternoon trading.For first-quarter 2012 ending in March, analysts forecast Monster's EPS climbed 30% to 38 cents, on a 25% hike in revenue, to $447.1 million.Coke shares fell 0.6% to 76.16, and archrival PepsiCo (PEP) slipped 24 cents to 65.86.Coca-Cola and Monster both initially declined to comment, and the report didn't indicate sale price or other terms.Monster has grown in part via its global distribution agreement with Coke. But the relationship has at times been an uneasy one, with Coke taking aim at Monster earlier with its own energy drinks, like Full Throttle.Private Rockstar, distributed by PepsiCo, could also come into play if the Monster acquisition succeeds.The market leader is Austria-based Red Bull, whose sales have grown rapidly in part on its distinctive ""Red Bull gives you wings"" TV marketing campaign.Monster started as a natural soft drinks maker, known as Hansen Natural. The report follows earlier rumors of a possible deal between the two beverage giants that surfaced after they inked the distribution pact.For its most recent three quarters, Monster posted earnings per share growth of 29%, 22% and 35%. Sales accelerated 26%, 24% and 29% during that period.Investors will be watching the company's earnings closely when it reports first-quarter results.The previous quarter, it missed analysts estimates after topping in the first three periods last year.

The fund's favorites were consumer discretionary names like Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and tech names such as computer storage service provider  Teradata (TDC).Exposure to emerging markets like China also hurt the fund.Now the fund is being rewarded for keeping its focus on stocks like those, which it calls exceptional growth companies.""We have an approach to developing a growth thesis,"" said lead manager James Diedrich. ""We don't change that based on what the market is doing.""Lululemon's earnings per share grew 50% and 59% the past two quarters.""They have a long runway of growth,"" Diedrich said.

That left it 4% above its 67.32 buy point set Feb. 15.Data WranglerThe fund has held Teradata since its 2007 IPO. The firm provides enterprise data warehousing.

"
1256,MNST,"Unlike beverage giants Coca-Cola (KO) and Pepsi (PEP), which drown the airwaves with commercials, Monster Beverage, which is based in Corona, Calif., nixes mainstream marketing. It doesn't even have an ad agency.
"
1257,MNST,"You might ask how Monster and its No. 1 seller, Monster Energy, generated $1.3 billion in 2011 revenue. Or how it slipped past privately owned Red Bull to become No. 1 in energy-drink convenience-store sales. Another question is why Coke and Pepsi haven't caught up.
"
1258,MNST,"The answer is that for some products, traditional advertising doesn't work. Tapping unique ways to market a brand while eschewing mainstream advertising can be an effective way to grow.
"
1259,MNST,"Part of Monster Energy's success stems from ""knowing its audience and finding a way to connect with them, in what they perceive as an authentic way, and not talking down to them,"" said Jeff Cioletti, editor of industry trade publication Beverage World.
"
1260,MNST,"The dominant audience for Monster Energy is made up of teens and people in their early 20s who want a pick-me-up drink for a quick boost. They're suspicious of traditional advertising, and Monster Energy ads on TV and radio would likely alienate them, analysts say.
"
1261,MNST,"In lieu of taking out ads, Monster Energy promotes events and competitions in extreme sports — skateboarding, motorcycle racing, surfing — and sponsors Nascar driver Robby Gordon. Similarly, rival Red Bull sponsors its own professional soccer team and targets more mainstream sporting fans.
"
1262,MNST,"Monster recognized early that its core consumer was 18 to 30 years old and seeking a drink that would boost their energy levels, so it targeted that demographic, said Scott Van Winkle, a Boston-based industry analyst at Canaccord Genuity. To boost its brand at the outset, it used guerrilla marketing to hand out free cans of Monster at events to create buzz.

1265,MNST,"To appeal to its mostly 20-something audience, Monster Beverage has nurtured a strong following on social networks. It counts 14 million enthusiasts on Facebook and has 154,000 Twitter followers.
"
1266,MNST,"Rejecting traditional advertising hasn't slowed Monster Energy's popularity. Monster had 31.5% market share in convenience-store sales in 2010, followed by Red Bull's 30.7%, Rockstar's 14% and Amp's 6%, according to Beverage Marketing. Cioletti says Monster passed Red Bull based on its effective branding campaign and making the right distribution deals to expand its network.
"
1267,MNST,"In the last several years, the energy-drink audience has increased about 7% annually, Cioletti said. He expects it to keep growing. But he's concerned about campaigns started by nutrition groups about the excessive amount of caffeine in the 16-ounce and larger Monster Energy cans. If the resistance gains traction and stirs a backlash, it could damage growth. But Van Winkle says the chance of government regulation of sales is slim.
"
1268,MNST,"In fact, Van Winkle noted that only 16% of adults over the age of 18 consume energy drinks, so there's room for growth in that demographic. It also has older fans.

The Rehab line appeals to young people who drink in the morning to recover from a night out partying (hence the name Rehab). It also introduced Java Monster, a coffee-flavored energy drink, and Hansen's sparkling-water line.
"
1271,MNST,"In addition, Van Winkle says Monster grows share by sticking with its core brand, avoiding acquisitions and not taking big gambles in new product categories.

Exxon Mobil (XOM) dipped 2%.At the smaller end of the spectrum, Prince George, Utah-based Skywest (SKYW) spired 18% before the open after clearing Q2 earnings expectations by a wide margin.

1413,MNST,"Nearly all Sector Leaders ended higher Friday, but volume was weak in almost all of them. One day after staging a downside reversal, Watson Pharmaceuticals (WPI) put in an upside reversal. It climbed 1.78, or 3%, to 70.88. The stock regained its 50-day moving average, which acted as resistance in recent sessions. But volume tumbled 43% below average, showing that…

1414,MNST,"Sector-leading stocks gave back all or most of their early gains Wednesday. Volume was mostly lower, which dulled the negative edge.

And many sector-leaders closed low in the day's range, which is another negative sign. The biggest percentage…

1415,MNST,"New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposed ban on the sale of sodas over 16 ounces in restaurants and movie theaters drew a terse response from Coca-Cola (KO) Thursday, but did little to affect the company's stock or that of Pepsico (PEP). Meanwhile, Bloomberg's role in the upcoming National Donut Day is being questioned.Coke and Pepsi shares closed down 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively. Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPS) shares were up 0.4%.Bloomberg's proposal would remove super-sized and even large sized sugary soft drinks from menus across the city in an effort to help curb rising obesity rates. The ban won't affect the sale of large drinks in grocery stores or the sale of diet beverages and drinks with less than 25 calories per 8 ounces. Milkshakes and any drink made with half milk or a milk substitute would also be exempt.Coca-Cola said in a statement on its website that it hopes New Yorkers loudly voice their disapproval about what it called an arbitrary mandate.""The people of New York City are much smarter than the New York City Health Department believes. We are transparent with our consumers,"" the statement said. ""They can see exactly how many calories are in every beverage we serve. We have prominently placed calorie counts on the front of our bottles and cans and in New York City, restaurants already post the calorie content of all their offerings and portion sizes - including soft drinks.""Coca-Cola's statement said New Yorkers expect and deserve better, and can make their own choices about what drinks to buy.""The city is not going to address the obesity issue by attacking soda because soda is not driving the obesity rates,"" said Stefan Friedman, spokesman for the New York City Beverage Association in an AP article.American's have long been losing their taste for the sweet carbonated beverages as soft drink consumption has declined steadily since 2005. In 2011 the total sales volume of carbonated beverages dropped nearly 1% to 9.27 billion cases, according to Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter.Sluggish soda sales have prompted McDonald's (MCD) to offer fancy coffee drinks like mocha lattes to compete with Starbucks (SBUX). But the switch to coffee might not help lagging beverage sales as sugary coffee drinks would fall under the ban. However lattes and cappuccinos of any size that contain at least 51% milk would be allowed.Starbucks opened an Evolution Fresh juice shop in Washington state earlier this year to branch out from its coffee roots. The juice will also be available in Starbucks coffee shops across the U.S. Beverages that contain at least 70% juice will not be affected by the NYC drink ban.Energy drink makers like Monster Beverage (MNST) sell their beverages in large 16 ounce cans and won't be affected with the ruling. But sales could be impacted if the ban lowered the size of the drinks banned to 15 ounces or less. McDonald's and Starbucks shares fell fractionally Thursday. Monster lost 1.4%.Bloomberg's proposal only needs approval of the Board of Health — which seems likely to approve the measure — but public hearings will also be held.Separately Thursday, Entenmann's Bakery issued a press release for the 75th National Donut Day, which is Friday. It planned a ""sweet celebration"" at New York's Madison Square Park and said it would ""share a Proclamation letter from Mayor Bloomberg."" Also at the event: free donuts, and the unveiling of ""the largest box of Entenmann's Donuts ever created along with custom-made donuts 1-foot in diameter.""

1497,MNST,"Top-rated industries offer more fertile hunting grounds for great stocks. But some winners hide in the rough in languishing sectors.Here's a look at the top five firms by Composite Rating in sectors residing among the bottom quarter of IBD's 197 industry groups. All are part of the elite IBD 50 for superior fundamental and technical factors.1. Liquidity Services (LQDT)Through sites such as Liquidation.com, Govliquidation.com and Govdeals.com, this online marketplace helps governments, businesses and private individuals buy and sell surplus and salvage goods. The company, with a high-flying Composite Rating of 97, resides in the Retail-Internet group, ranked 192 this week. Just six months ago it was flying near the top, at No. 4.Shares of Liquidity Services, which is No. 6 on the IBD 50 list, touched an all-time high Tuesday, before easing back to close at 46.30.Meanwhile, MercadoLibre (MELI), often referred to as the eBay (EBAY) of Latin America, is part of the same lagging industry group, and ranks only a bit lower with a Composite Rating of 91. Its shares also closed near an all-time high at 97.29. It's No. 40 on the IBD 50.2. Spirit Airlines (SAVE)This discount airline is another high-flyer in an industry — Transportation-Airline — that's nearly skidded off the runway at No. 171 among IBD industry groups. Spirit, No. 14 on the IBD 50 list, has a solid 96 Composite Rating. The Florida-based airline provides no-frills travel to Latin America and the Caribbean, with fares as low as $9.It came public last may at 12, and closed Tuesday at 19.32.3. Monster Beverage (MNST)Energy drinks and other beverages have been surging, while soft drink sales continued to fizzle in 2011, new data out Tuesday show. Monster, which started out as Hansen Natural, and still makes Hansen's Natural Soda and other beverages under that brand. But its No. 1 seller is Monster Energy, that high-caffeine jolt of energy in a can.The company, No. 19 on the IBD 50 list, owns a high-flying 96 Composite Rating, despite residing in a Beverages-Non-Alcoholic group that ranks a lowly 155. But its energy drinks are growing fast while U.S. sales of carbonated beverages from Coca-Cola (KO), PepsiCo (PEP) and others have fallen to their lowest levels since 1996.Monster shares sit near an all-time high at 60.44.4. NetEase.com (NTES)The Chinese online game company has been the exclusive Chinese operator of the wildly popular ""World of Warcraft"" game franchise since 2009. It launched the third installment of that game, ""Cataclysm,"" last July. Revenue from that blockbuster, made by U.S.-based Activision Blizzard (ATVI) slowed in the fourth quarter. But the company said its internally developed games are building a loyal following. NetEase and Activision agreed to a three-year contract extension late Tuesday.NetEase, No. 48 on the IBD 50 list, has a Composite Rating of 95. But the Computer Software-Gaming group ranks No. 154 out of 197. Shares closed near an all-time high of 56.30.5. Steven Madden (SHOO)The trendy shoe and accessory designer sells its Steve Madden and other brand shoes at top department stores and retailers. It also operates its 83 stores as well as its Web site.

It's much less expensive than maintaining software on each desktop.
"
1522,MNST,"We sold Citrix last year because we felt the cycle for desktop virtualization was advancing at a slower pace than anticipated. The growth thesis was not coming true. But even when we sell a company, we keep monitoring it. It may get to a point where we want to buy it back. And since then we've seen more evidence that desktop virtualization is advancing, so we added it back.
"
1523,MNST,"IBD: What's another example?
"
1524,MNST,"Goldstein: Amazon (AMZN). We added to our holding this year. The reason is that while it has not been controversial that revenue growth has been strong, we believe Amazon is gaining share within online sales while at the same time online is gaining share from bricks-and-mortars.
"
1525,MNST,"Many investors were concerned that Amazon's profitability was permanently impaired as it made significant infrastructure investments and as its shipping costs as a percent of sales have gone up quite a bit.
"
1526,MNST,"We believe in Q1 there were signs that margins were at least stabilizing and perhaps showing early signs of improving.
"
1527,MNST,"IBD: Where is the bargain bin aspect?
"
1528,MNST,"Goldstein: It's hard to argue that Amazon is super cheap. But we felt it was attractively valued as growth continued and margins stabilized or improved. For example, shipping costs as a percent of sales declined for the first time in three years.
"
1529,MNST,"But, yes, we did add more stable companies because of the challenging economic environment.
"
1530,MNST,"IBD: Some examples, please.
"
1531,MNST,"Goldstein: In the consumer space, PetSmart (PETM). They have merchandizing initiatives that will allow for accelerating growth within each store. Same-store comps should improve. It's already happening to some degree. So there's an earnings upside surprise opportunity as well. If sales are better than expectations, that can lead profits above expectations.
"
1532,MNST,"In health care, Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) provides veterinary lab testing products. They benefit from the rising trend of pet adoptions.
"
1533,MNST,"We think rising pet adoptions is a sign of the economy being a little better. Employment trends are a little better. Housing is bottoming or improving. Residential rental activity is up. More people are moving out of their parents' homes and starting households.
"
1534,MNST,"IBD: In general, what's your approach?
"
1535,MNST,"Goldstein: First, we buy a subset of a highly selective universe of what we call exceptional growth companies. The subset is those companies for which our expectations most exceed consensus expectations.
"
1536,MNST,"Second, we develop a proprietary growth thesis for each holding.
"
1537,MNST,"We hold each investment for the vast majority of its opportunity. When that opportunity no longer exists, we sell. It's critically important to sell when it is appropriate.
"
1538,MNST,"One last thing we do is construct a balanced portfolio. Our objective is to dampen volatility.
"
1539,MNST,"IBD: You do that through diversification, right?
"
1540,MNST,"Goldstein: Yes. We diversify by sectors, by market capitalizations and by style.
"
1541,MNST,"IBD: What is style diversification?
"
1542,MNST,"Goldstein: We have cyclical growth names, more stable growth names and high growth companies.
"
1543,MNST,"We don't own many companies domiciled outside the U.S. But we have a meaningful number of holdings that have revenue exposure outside the U.S.
"
1544,MNST,"One way we don't diversify is by relative weighting. We don't allow ourselves to have more than 10 percentage points more or less than a sector's weighting in the Russell 1000 Growth Index. We're typically closer to the benchmark weighting than that.
"
1545,MNST,"And we allow ourselves as much as a 300 basis points overweight on any individual security. Again, in practice our largest overweights tend to average about 200 basis points.
"
1546,MNST,"IBD: Does your diversification within sectors reflect your style diversification?
"
1547,MNST,"Goldstein: Right. Our health care holdings, for example, are not all of the same type.
"
1548,MNST,"We own Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), a fast-growing, high-multiple pharmaceutical company. The company is involved with ultrarare disease pharmaceuticals. We also own Gilead Sciences (GILD), which is involved with hepatitis C vaccines. And we own Vertex (VRTX), which is also involved with hepatitis C, but whose next opportunity is (the drug Kalydeco for) treatment of cystic fibrosis. Those biotech companies are developing tomorrow's cures.
"
1549,MNST,"Also, we own Perrigo (PRGO), which is a more stable company that is the leading maker of store-brand over-the-counter medicines.
"
1550,MNST,"IBD: Describe your diversification within another sector, such as consumer discretionary, please.
"
1551,MNST,"Goldstein: On the one hand we own Dollar Tree (DLTR) and TJX Cos. (TJX). Of course they benefit from the reality that more people are economically challenged and are trading down to dollar stores and discount stores.
"
1552,MNST,"On the other hand, we own Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and Coach (COH). Both of those are focused on a much higher-end demographic, more of a luxury end.
"
1553,MNST,"IBD: How does this approach show up in your largest sector, technology, with 33% of your assets?
"
1554,MNST,"Goldstein: On the one hand we have Apple (AAPL). Like Lululemon it is gaining meaningful, profitable market share and tends to sell higher priced products to a more affluent demographic.
"
1555,MNST,"On the other hand we own Accenture (ACN), which is a consulting and outsourcing company, which serves global Fortune 100 companies. Apple is consumer focused. Accenture is enterprise focused, helping clients cut costs.
"
1556,MNST,"We also have Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA), which fall into the tech sector but aren't tech per se. But they do use a lot of technology in what they do. They're really about increasing the use of plastic globally as a method of payment. There's terrific profitability that accrues to Visa and MasterCard. The more that people swipe cards, the incremental costs to Visa and MasterCard are way below their incremental revenues. It's a terrific margin opportunity.
"
1557,MNST,"IBD: Apple's recent quarterly earnings report disappointed. Do you see a long-term problem?
"
1558,MNST,"Goldstein: We don't believe it's a sign of any long-term crack. Our thesis is that they will gain profitable global market share in consumer electronics. When we first bought Apple, all it meant was Mac computers. Now they have mobile phones, and a new category they invented, tablets. All of that is still intact.
"
1559,MNST,"One reason there was a pause (in Apple stock performance) is that many consumers are waiting for the next iteration of the iPhone before updating. I'm one of them. Pent-up demand for the iPhone 5 is large, not only among existing iPhone users but also among consumers who don't own an iPhone. So it's a temporary pause (in sales) before a bigger ramp-up later this year and next year.
"
1560,MNST,"IBD: Teradata (TDC) has four quarters of 25% or higher earnings per share growth. What's your thesis?
"
1561,MNST,"Goldstein: They benefit from the proliferation of data. They sell hard and software combinations that let very large enterprises collect and analyze large amounts of data, which in turn they use to make strategic decisions.
"
1562,MNST,"Demand for data analytics and their other services is very strong. So we love their top-line growth. We look for companies with top-line growth, not just margin improvement.
"
1563,MNST,"IBD: Netsuite's (N) EPS growth jumped to 100% and 200% the past two quarters. What's your take?
"
1564,MNST,"Goldstein: This is one of our emerging high growth, high valuation companies.
"
1565,MNST,"They're in software-as-a-service, so it's a cloud play. Like Salesforce.com (CRM) they benefit from enterprises that want to get business-critical software through cloud delivery. It's software on a buy-as-you-need-it basis, rather than owning an old-fashioned in-house suite of software.
"
1566,MNST,"IBD: Is Cerner's (CERN) story basically the shift to electronic health care records?
"
1567,MNST,"Goldstein: Cerner is one of the leading public companies in health care information technology. They have a strong backlog, whether it's due to government regulatory changes or merely a reflection of economics encouraging hospitals to automate and digitize. This is a really well run, leading health care IT company.
"
1568,MNST,"IBD: Monster Beverage (MNST) has two quarters of accelerating EPS growth. What's your view?
"
1569,MNST,"Goldstein: Monster has done well and is still attractive. They are gaining share within the energy drink market. Their international opportunities are sizable. As they mature internationally, there's a nice margin improvement opportunity as well. We own it for reasons other than it might get purchased by, for example, Coke (KO). But we're not betting on that.
"
1570,MNST,"IBD: Whole Foods (WFM) has exploded off its recession trough. How much more can this specialty market grow?
"
1571,MNST,"Goldstein: We believe there is still a lot of room to run. Their same-store sales in a tough economy suggest they deliver what American consumers want. Comps were up 8% (in fiscal Q3). The rise in store-level operating margins shows great discipline. We expect they will continue to grow their store base. Combined with same-store growth, you get meaningful profit growth.
"
1572,MNST,"IBD: GNC's (GNC) EPS growth has slowed for two quarters. Do they need a shot of Geritol?
"
1573,MNST,"Goldstein: In the most recent quarter, same-store sales were up almost 13%, which is higher than most retailers.
"
1574,MNST,"Secondly, their opportunity to grow internationally attracts us.
"
1575,MNST,"We think earnings estimates will rise the rest of this year and most of next year. Collectively, all of those factors point to an attractive opportunity.The $570 million Nuveen Large Cap Growth Opportunities is a top echelon portfolio, seeking to resume its winning ways after having hit a rough patch in 2011.The fund's average annual gain of 14.60% in the three years going into Thursday ranked in the top 16% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. But in calendar 2011 its 2.69% loss meant it trailed 56% of its peers.This year the fund is up 9.81% vs. 9.15% for its category and 10.69% for the S&P 500.Hal Goldstein, 53 years old, is co-lead manager with Scott Mullinix. James Diedrich is co-manager. Goldstein discussed his approach from his office in Minneapolis.IBD: What are you doing differently this year?Goldstein: We were challenged particularly in the fourth quarter. There was a rapid turn toward stocks that benefit from an economic recovery — lower-quality, more cyclical names. And that's the environment in which we do least well.Our year was sort of respectable. We were in the middle of the pack.IBD: And this year?Goldstein: We won't do anything differently. We stay true to our process. There are occasions when our approach, like in Q4, is completely out of favor. But even when we underperform in a tough quarter, our long-term performance remained strong.IBD: Have you fished for bargains?Goldstein: Yes. Some of our favorite growth companies' earnings prospects have stayed strong while their valuations have been compressed. So we've added to or repurchased names after not having owned them for a bit.IBD: Such as?Goldstein: Citrix Systems (CTXS). They're involved in desktop virtualization. Much like the way that VMware (VMW), a provider of software behind virtualization servers, helps client enterprises with efficiency and cost reductions, Citrix lets enterprises purchase less powerful desktop computers for employees and manage the software more centrally.

1601,MNST,"Last night's subpoena news follows Wednesday night's disappointing earnings miss. The combined price action has shares off about 21% for the two-day period, hitting five-plus month lows and now in bear territory below the 200-day simple moving average for the first time in a couple years. One idea for bearish traders wanting to greatly reduce volatility risk and keep any potential losses limited is the bear vertical.
"
1602,MNST,"With Monster's options fairly liquid, traders have more than a few both bear call and bear put verticals to consider ranging from spreads constructed as tight as 2.5 points, 5 points and even as wide as 7.5 points while still greatly reducing vega risk. Shown above is a -5x September 60 / 62.5 bear call spread. For a $0.50 credit, the spread can collect the full credit if at expiration shares remain below 60. Currently that buffer means the trader can have shares move about 10% higher and still take in the maximum profit.

1603,MNST,"Risk of $2.00 is the difference between strikes minus the credit. That amount would be realized if shares of MNST are above 62.5 at expiration or earlier, if by chance, past bubbly buzz of Monster being an acquisition target, was to reintroduce itself. And while losses are never fun, being able to keep them small and manageable in the face of what would amount to being a monster move, makes the vertical a sensible strategy.

1604,MNST,"What do you think? Feel free to share your opinion in the comments section below.With less than an hour to go, Monster Beverage Corp (MNST) is under stiff pressure of around 12%. The company disclosed last night a subpoena by the attorney general in connection with an investigation into its advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and sale of its popular branded Monster Energy drink. The action hasn't gone unnoticed by option traders as volume has swelled nearly nine-fold to 44,000 contracts.

1654,MNST,"The U.S. beverage market grew in 2017 on robust sales of bottled water and carbonated soft drinks. According to a recent report by Beverage Digest, retail beverage sales surged $135.7 billion last year. However, an increasing number of consumers are refraining from sugary sodas and other carbonated beverages in favor of the healthier water, tea and other drinks.Keeping in mind the changing tastes and preferences of health-conscious consumers, beverage companies are redesigning their product portfolio and reorienting their business strategy.Beverage Sales Grow on Bottled Water, Carbonated Drinks U.S. beverage sales grew by $2.1 billion in 2017. Retail beverage sales grew around 3% last year, while volume jumped 2%, according to data and consulting firm Beverage Market Corporation. The growth was prompted primarily by strong sales of carbonated drinks and bottled water. Additionally, an increase in soda prices gave a boost to revenues in that category. Revenues from carbonated beverages came in at $81.6 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the year’s total revenues.However, an increasing number of Americans are opting for healthier variants, which saw a rise in sales of bottled water. Bottled water overtook carbonated soft drinks as the most-preferred beverage by volume in 2016, and continued its growth in 2017. Last year, bottled water accounted for $24.1 billion in sales.Industry Swings Toward Bottled WaterShifting preference for healthier drinks has seen the carbonated soft drink market shrinking for 13 consecutive years now. Carbonated soft drinks volume fell 1.6% in 2017 and is projected to decline between 0.8% and 1.3% this year.Almost all beverage companies like The Coca Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report), Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. , Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V (FMX  -  Free Report) and Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) are redesigning their portfolio along these lines.Coca Cola, PepsiCo, Dr Pepper Snapple and Fomento Economico Mexicano, each carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Coke, Pepsi Trying to Look Healthier A number of prominent names are getting into acquisitions and partnerships as well as reorienting their strategies with the aim of building a healthier portfolio, which now holds the key to their survival.After an eight-year run of flat sales, Coca Cola’s Diet Coke finally bounced back. The company has introduced a range of flavors in smaller packages to its diet coke brand to attract new-generation drinkers. It has also introduced Coke Zero Sugar, revamping its Coke Zero, which now tastes more like the original Coke. The company also acquired the U.S. rights of Topo Chico, a premium sparkling mineral water brand in October 2017. This definitely seems to have worked wonders for Coca Cola, with the company reporting first-quarter revenues of $7.6 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.43 billion (read more: Coca-Cola Tops Q1 Earnings & Revenue Estimates).PepsiCo’s focus too has been on bottled water and the healthier variants of its carbonated drinks. In February, the company launched its new sparkling water line Bubly. Also, the company’s existing bottoled water brand Acquafina’s sales increased 2.6% in 2017. PepsiCo too seems to be benefiting from redesigning its portfolio. The company reported net revenues of $12.56 billion, increasing 4.3% from the year-ago level. Dr Pepper Snapple, Monster Beverages Follow SuitOther companies like Dr Pepper Snapple and Fomento Economico Mexicano too have been increasingly focusing on creating a portfolio that will cater to health-conscious consumers. In fact, Fomento Economico Mexicano has long been focusing on naturally healthy beverages and was the leading player in 2016 with a 42% retail value share.  Monster Beverages too has been riding high on the success of a healthy portfolio. The company’s net sales in the Monster Energy Drink segment, which includes Monster Energy, Monster Hydro Energy and Mutant Super Soda drinks, increased 16.7% to $780.5 million in the first quarter.Summing UpWhile health-consciousness has led to a decline in sales growth of carbonated drinks, sales volume of bottled water and other healthier beverages has expanded. Investors’ thirst for gains should be quenched in the fast-growing U.S. beverage industry that is meandering toward healthier options.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1655,MNST,"Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated’s  shares plunged 21.2% on May 9 after the company reported loss in first-quarter 2018 on May 8, after the closing bell. Higher commodity and transportation costs have been playing spoilsport for this largest Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) bottler in the United States.Earnings & Sales DiscussionAdjusted loss per share was 82 cents in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This compares unfavorably with the year-ago income per share of 67 cents.Coca-Cola Bottling reported net sales of $1.07 billion, up 23.8% year over year. The upside can be attributed to acquisitions and higher volumes.

1657,MNST,"Coca-Cola European Partners plc (CCE  -  Free Report) or CCEP is set to report first-quarter 2018 results, before the opening bell on Apr 26.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.45%. The company surpassed/met the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 6.88%.Factors at PlayIn 2017, CCEP modestly exceeded its initial guidance for revenue, operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow. The company’s continuous focus on brand and packaging innovation, solid revenue per unit case growth (up 200% year over year) in sugar-free portfolio, stronger execution and customer service, and improving operating efficiency helped drive growth.This has encouraged CCEP to step up investments in brand portfolio, field sales teams, route to market and most importantly, digital capabilities.In the last reported quarter, the company’s net sales increased 12.7% year over year in dollar terms. Comparable revenues in the quarter grew 3.5%. From a brand and volume perspective, CCEP’s sparkling portfolio increased 1%, with a 0.5% drop in Coca-Cola trademark brands. Notably, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar continued to perform well, growing more than 15%. Again, energy drinks performed well and were up 15% as the company continued to execute its multi-brand strategy.Apart from solid revenues, the company’s cost-saving plans are helping boost the bottom line. In the fourth quarter, operating expenses contracted 11.5% on a comparable and currency neutral basis. This reflects synergy benefits, volume-related costs, expense timing and continued focus on managing operating expenses. These factors contributed to operating profit growth of 50% on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Comparable earnings jumped 26.1% year over year in the quarter.We expect the growth momentum to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well. Importantly, CCEP is on track to achieve pre-tax synergy savings of €315-€340 million by mid-2019.Overall, for the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 39 cents, reflecting a 18.2% year-over-year increase. The consensus estimate for revenues is $3 billion, implying a 19.1% increase.Here’s What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:CCEP does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which increases the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for CCEP is 0.00%.

1659,MNST,"Revenues of The Coca-Cola Company’s (KO  -  Free Report) North America segment, comprising about 30% of its topline, are expected to decline in the fourth quarter of 2017, when it reports on Friday, Feb 16.A Look at Coca-Cola’s North America Performance in Q3The North America segmental revenues totaled $2.75 billion last quarter, increasing 3% year over year on 2% growth in price/mix. Organically, revenues rose 2% in the period while volumes remained unchanged during the same. Price/mix increased on the company’s disciplined approach to occasion, brand, price and package strategy as well as positive business and category mix.Notably, sparkling beverage volumes have shown no growth during the quarter that includes mid-single digit growth in Sprite, offset by a mid-single digit decline in Diet Coke. The company registered low single-digit rise in tea and coffee, offset by a low single-digit fall in water, enhanced water and sports drinks.Precisely, the company’s sparkling beverage unit case volume was flat in the third and second quarters with a 1% decline witnessed in the first quarter of 2017. Notably, the sparkling beverage accounted for 72% of the company’s 2016 worldwide unit case volume. Hence, such vast exposure puts Coca-Cola in a weak spot.Coca-Cola’s North American sparkling beverage business has been delivering sluggish results due to carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category headwinds. Cross-category competition and growing health and wellness consciousness are hurting demand for CSDs. Consumer tastes are swiftly shifting from CSDs to healthier beverages like energy drinks, tea juices and flavored waters.The challenges in the CSD category have been affecting all major soft drink makers namely Coca-Cola, PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Monster Beverage (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group , leading to lower volumes and soft sales.Q4 ProjectionThough Coca-Cola has increased marketing investments and is driving package and product innovation to boost its carbonated beverage business, these efforts are yet to show meaningful results with the trend unlikely to change in the fourth quarter as well.Overall, Coca-Cola’s North American segmental revenues are expected to witness a 1.7% decline year over year and an 11.6%, sequentially, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Apart from the North American segment, Coca-Cola’s Latin America revenues are likely to witness 9.9% growth. While the consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa segment’s revenues of $1.7 billion indicates an increase from $1.6 billion a year ago. Bottling Investments revenues are anticipated to decrease to $1.3 billion from $4.1 billion a year ago. Again, Asia Pacific revenues are expected to increase 3.2% on a year-over-year basis.Overall Earnings & Revenue ExpectationsOverall, the beverage behemoth’s fourth-quarter revenues are likely to decline on structural changes. However, the company had earlier stated that its fourth quarter might benefit from an extra day compared with the prior-year period, which equates with roughly one additional point of top-line growth for the soon-to-be-quarter.Meanwhile, Coca-Cola expects the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items to be a 27-point headwind on net revenues and an 11-12 point headwind on profit before tax in the fourth quarter.The company had earlier stated that the hurricane strikes in North America during the third quarter caused disruption to its supply chain, registering an estimated $50 million rise in costs, majority of which is forecast to affect the fourth quarter.Nonetheless, we feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support the bottom line of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to some extent. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents for fourth-quarter earnings reflects 2.7% growth from the prior-year period’s profit of 37 cents per share. Also, the consensus mark for revenues of $7.4 billion represents a 21.7% decrease on a year-over-year basis.(Read More: Will Cost Saving Plans Support Coca-Cola's Q4 Earnings?)Coca-Cola Company (The) Revenue (TTM)  Coca-Cola Company (The) Revenue (TTM) | Coca-Cola Company (The) QuoteThe Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1660,MNST,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 16, before the opening bell.A Look at Coca-Cola’s Revenue PerformanceCoca-Cola has been struggling to boost sales amid weak demand in certain emerging and developing markets, and shift in consumer preference. The company has been witnessing a decline in revenues for the last 10 quarters, primarily due to weak volumes especially in the sparkling beverage category, and structural changes.Coca-Cola’s third-quarter revenues declined 15% year over year due to the negative impact of structural items. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had a 18% impact on revenues. The company’s soon-to-be reported quarter is also expected to be adversely impacted by 27% in net revenues from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items. However, the company expects currency to have a positive impact on quarterly net revenues by 0-1%.Overall, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Coca-Cola’s total revenues stands at $7.36 billion, implying a 21.7% year-over-year decrease.Efforts to Boost MarginsThe cola giant has been focusing on increasing their efficiency and improving their margins amid tough business conditions. For that, Coca-Cola’s strategy to refranchise its bottling operations facilitated improved margins by reducing its exposure to the capital-intensive bottling business. The refranchising efforts, though hurting sales/profits in the near term, will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending and improved return on invested capital over the long term.Coca-Cola’s adjusted EPS increased 2% from the year-ago level (after falling for nine consecutive quarters) in the prior quarter despite weak revenues. The company’s earnings have topped the consensus mark in 12 of the past 13 quarters.The improvement was attributable to its ongoing productivity initiatives. Its adjusted gross margin expanded 170 basis points or bps in Q3. Comparable operating margin also grew 404 bps. The company’s plan to refranchise its low-margin bottling operations and transform into a capital-light business are helping to improve its margins. The trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Again, the company is on track to deliver annualized savings of about $3 billion by 2019 through its productivity programs. These include restructuring of its global supply chain, zero-based budgeting and streamlining its operating model.Segment DiscussionNorth America, comprising about 30% of the total revenues, is expected to see tepid growth in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues of $2.4 billion reflect growth of 1.7% from the year-ago quarter.Latin America revenues are likely to witness 9.9% growth. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa segment revenues of $1.7 billion indicates a decrease from $1.6 billion a year ago. Bottling Investments revenues are likely to decrease to $1.3 billion from $4.1 billion a year ago. Again, Asia Pacific revenues are expected to increase 3.2% on a year-over-year basis.Overall, the beverage behemoth’s fourth-quarter revenues are likely to decline owing to structural changes and currency headwind. We feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support bottom line to some extent.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Coca-Cola’s earnings is pegged at 38 cents, reflecting a 2.7% year-over-year increase.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Coca-Cola does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Coca-Cola is -1.16%.Zacks Rank: Coca-Cola carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

1661,MNST,"Coca-Cola European Partners Plc or CCEP (CCE  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Feb 15.Last quarter, it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.19%. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 5.52%.A Few Other Factors That Might Affect Q4 Results:CCEP is gaining significant synergies from the merger and is expected to continue driving growth in the foreseeable future. The company’s continuous focus on brand and packaging innovation, strengthening execution and customer service, and further improving operating effectiveness will help in driving growth.Last quarter, although the company registered weak revenues, its cost saving plans are helping to boost its bottom line. In the third quarter, operating expenses decreased 3% on a comparable and currency neutral basis. This reflects the synergy benefits, volume-related costs, expense timing and a continued focus on managing operating expenses. These factors contributed to operating profit growth of 3.5%, on a comparable and currency neutral basis.In the first nine months of 2017, revenues were up 3% and operating profit was up 11.5%, both on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Excluding synergies, operating profit grew about 3%, broadly in line with revenues growth in the said period. We expect the growth momentum to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Importantly, CCEP remains on track to achieve pre-tax synergy savings of €315-€340 million by mid-2019.Overall, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 55 cents, reflecting a 19.6% year-over-year increase. The consensus estimate for revenues is $3.1 billion, implying a 10.1% increase.Here Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:CCEP has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for CCEP is 2.19%.

1662,MNST,"PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 (ending Dec 30) results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, this is the seventh consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise. Improvement in the snack business helped offset continued weakness at the company’s beverage business amid “rapidly shifting consumer landscape”.EarningsPepsiCo’s fourth-quarter core earnings per share (EPS) of $1.31 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30 and increased 9% year over year, mainly driven by better operating efficiency. In constant currency terms, adjusted earnings grew 8%.Core earnings exclude restructuring and impairment charges and commodity mark-to-market net impact. The company reported a loss of 50 cents per share due to a $2.5 billion one-time charge related to new U.S. tax laws. The reported loss reflects a decrease of 152% year over year. Foreign exchange translation had a positive impact of 1% on reported EPS.RevenuesNet revenues of $19.53 billion remain unchanged with the year-ago level. Foreign exchange (Fx) had a positive impact on revenues growth of 1% and pricing had a positive impact of 2%. Reported revenues also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.44 billion.Excluding the impact of Fx, revenues increased 2.3% on an organic basis, primarily driven by higher demand for food/snacks in the Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA), Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA), Latin America and Frito-Lay North America (FLNA) segments. Notably, overall organic sales growth was better than the 1.7% rise recorded in the previous quarter.Total volumes remained unchanged during the quarter against 1% growth in the previous quarter. While organic snacks/food increased 2% (better than 1% growth witnessed in the third quarter), beverage volumes dropped 2% (versus down 1%).Quarterly Segment DetailsRevenues decreased 1% at the Frito-Lay segment, 5% at Quaker Foods (QFNA) and 6% at North America Beverages (NAB). However, revenues improved 6% in Latin America and 11% in ESSA segments. Meanwhile, revenues at AMENA remained unchanged.Notably, the company’s NAB segment was negatively impacted by higher input costs, operating cost inflation and restructuring charges that substantially offset productivity gains. Moreover, the 53rd reporting week in the prior year and hurricane-related costs also added to the woes. Organic sales and beverage volumes were down 3% and 2%, respectively, in the quarter.Operating profits (on a reported basis) increased 20% in Latin America and 173% in AMENA. However, operating profits plunged 29% in the NAB, 6% in the QFNA and 1% in the Frito-Lay   segments.Pepsico, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Pepsico, Inc.

1663,MNST,"Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 14, after the market closes.The company pulled of positive average earnings surprise of 1.53% for the last four quarters. Notably, in third-quarter 2017 Pilgrim's Pride’s adjusted earnings of 98 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents by 27.27%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to Play We fear that lingering headwinds might prove fatal for Pilgrim's Pride's performance in fourth-quarter 2017.The company’s profitability in the upcoming quarter remains sensitive to market price as well as availability of certain products such as soybean meal, corn and sorghum. These items are used by the company as intermediate inputs in some of its offerings. Any sudden supply-demand imbalance or fluctuations in price of these materials might significantly raise the company's operational expenses, in turn, weighing on the company's bottom line in the quarters ahead.The company also offers services in a highly competitive industry. Intense competition might lower aggregate market share and hence weigh over the company’s revenues and profitability going forward.Also, sudden outbreak of a livestock disease or unfavorable government trading policies might hurt results going forward. Moreover, the United States Department of Agriculture’s forecast regarding rise in global corn stocks indicates a probable decline in Pilgrim's Pride's aggregate corn exports in fourth-quarter 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model provides some idea on the stocks that are about to release their earnings results.

1664,MNST,"Sluggish sales of carbonated soft drinks or CSD has prompted innovations and re-branding in the beverage industry to regain sales momentum. Keeping that in mind, Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) recently announced that it will re-launch Diet Coke in North America with a ""full brand restage"" featuring new slim bottles and flavors. The four new flavors, which will hit the stores in mid-January, are Ginger Lime, Feisty Cherry, Twisted Mango, and Zesty Blood Orange.The company is “re-energizing and modernizing Diet Coke for a new generation of drinkers – and offering its millions of current fans a new look and more flavors.”Coca-Cola’s Endeavor to Diversify PortfolioCoca-Cola’s North American sparkling beverage business has been delivering sluggish results due to CSD category headwinds. Cross-category competition and growing health and wellness consciousness — consumers are particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners, high sugar content and related obesity concern — are hurting demand for CSDs. Consumer tastes are swiftly shifting from CSDs to healthier beverages like energy drinks, tea juices and flavored waters.The company’s sparkling beverage unit case volume was flat in the third quarter and second quarter, and declined 1% in the first quarter of 2017. Sparkling beverage accounted for 72% of the company’s 2016 worldwide unit case volume. Hence, such vast exposure puts Coca-Cola in a weak spot.The challenges in the CSD category have been felt by all major soft drink makers — Coca-Cola, PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Monster Beverage (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group  — leading to lower volumes and weak sales.Accordingly, Coca-Cola is trying to reinvigorate the category with significant innovations and re-branding. The cola giant is investing in newer revenue-generating platforms to boost long-term sales and profits.The latest move in this regard by Coca-Cola is the launch of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, replacing Coke Zero, in the United States in August 2017. Based on its success in Europe and Latin America, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar offering will address two key issues: help in giving a boost to the zero calorie portion of its portfolio, addressing potential sugar taxes; and the “diet downturn” that continues to weigh on traditional Diet CSDs. Coca-Cola also has plans of using Zero Sugar as an alternative to diet sodas.The company remains on track with its plans of broadening its portfolio to meet evolving consumer preferences by introducing more than 500 new products and also ""lifting and shifting"" existing brands into new markets.Shares of the company have gained 12.6% in the past one year, compared with the industry’s growth of 16.4%. Nonetheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's efforts toward offering more products with less sodium, sugar and saturated fat along with productivity and cost-cutting initiatives to help fight revenue woes. The earnings estimates for 2018 have moved 2% north over the last 30 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes """"All In"""" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

1665,MNST,"PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) has been trying out product variations to drive carbonated soft drink sales as the product has been seeing declining demand owing to high calorie content. Recently, Mountain Dew, a product of PepsiCo, introduced MTN DEW ICE — a carbonated soft drink or CSD with a splash of real juice.The latest lemon-lime flavored carbonated soda with caffeine, with 100 calories per 12 ounces, is a marquee addition to the PepsiCo portfolio.PepsiCo’s Endeavor to Diversify PortfolioSales of PepsiCo’s carbonated beverages continue to be weak due to increasing health consciousness among consumers. Among CSDs, the cola segment has been particularly facing challenges, as consumers are opting for alternatives. The challenges in the CSD category have been felt by all major soft drink makers — Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo, Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.  — leading to lower volumes and weak sales.PepsiCo’s carbonated beverage drink volumes declined 4% in the first nine months of 2017 in North America. Nonetheless, the company is leaving no stone unturned to reinvigorate investors’ confidence and regain its footing through innovation and diversification.The company regularly creates new flavors of existing products alongside maintaining a robust pipeline of products. The company has generated $5 billion in annual sales from new products since 2013. PepsiCo is gradually reshuffling its portfolio toward healthier products which contain nutrients such as grains, fruits, vegetables, or protein.  The company now generates a significant portion of its revenues from such products and also from beverages with less sugar and sodium content.In 2016, PepsiCo acquired a sparkling probiotic U.S. drinks company KeVita, diversify its soft drinks portfolio amid slowing soda sales. The addition of KeVita will expand PepsiCo’s health and wellness offerings in the premium chilled beverage space. The latest juice-based soft drink is expected to boost PepsiCo’s portfolio, enabling it to increase the number of nutritious and delicious products it offers.Stock Price MovementPepsiCo’s shares have gained 5.9% in the last three months, as compared with a 3.1% gain of its industry. Also, earnings estimates for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company rose 0.5% for 2018 over the last 30 days. This signifies analyst optimism on the stock’s near-term performance. We expect the company's efforts toward offering more products with less sodium, sugar and saturated fat along with productivity and cost-cutting initiatives to help fight revenue woes. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

Net sales at the segment rose 6.2% to $76.6 million in the quarter. Favorable foreign currency movements drove sales by around $1.1 million in the quarter.Other: Net sales at the segment, which includes some products of American Fruits & Flavors sold to independent third parties, were down 8.8% year over year to $5.2 million.Inside the Headline NumbersThird-quarter 2017 gross margin fell 120 basis points (bps) to 62.6% due to geographic sales mix since the company’s international operations have a lower profit margin.Operating expenses, including $15.9 million in distributor termination expenses, increased 18.7% year over year to $252.3 million.

1667,MNST,"Monster Beverage Corporation’s (MNST  -  Free Report) strong product portfolio, deal with The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) and innovation raise hopes. However, higher costs pertaining to product innovation are hurting margins.Recently, this marketer and distributor of energy drinks and alternative beverages announced third-quarter fiscal 2017 results.The company reported adjusted earnings of 40 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Net sales of $909.5 million beat the consensus mark of $901.1 million by 0.9%.Meanwhile, shares of Monster Beverage have gained 42.9% year to date, outpacing the industry’s gain of 14.8%. Estimates for the current quarter and year have also inched up 2.8% and 0.7%, respectively, over the past two months, reflecting analysts’ optimism over the stock’s prospects. Key Growth DriversMonster Beverage has a wide range of brands such as Monster Energy, Java Monster, X- Presso Monster, Worx Energy and Vidration. Further, the addition of Coca-Cola’s energy drink brands has strengthened Monster Beverage’s position.The Coca-Cola deal, also denoted as TCCC deal, provides Monster Beverage full access to Coca-Cola’s world-class global distribution network. Under the agreement, Coca-Cola and its bottling partners act as Monster Beverage’s preferred distribution partner globally, thereby ensuring greater exposure for the company’s products. TCCC subsidiaries accounted for approximately 21% of the company’s net sales in the first nine months of 2017. Notably, Monster Beverage’s cash position received a major boost from the deal, which has encouraged it to consider a return of capital to its shareholders through share repurchases. Moreover, the brands acquired from TCCC, which produce concentrates or beverage bases, are high-margin products that make significant contribution to sales and gross margins.In addition to the deal, product innovation acts as a major growth driver. The company regularly introduces new flavors to existing products.Moreover, due to growing health awareness, consumers are now particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners and high sugar content and are moving toward alternatives such as energy drinks. This has been denting sales for most beverage companies like PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. . Monster Beverage in addition to carbonated soft drinks has a portfolio based on energy drinks, which should drive the company’s top line in the near term. In fact, net sales at the segment, comprising Monster Energy drinks as well as Mutant Super Soda drinks, increased 11.4% in the first nine months of 2017.ConcernsDespite the company introducing the new Mutant along with increased distribution, total Mutant sales have not been promising so far. Again, delays in Hydro, production capacity shortages related to Java Monster and Muscle Monster raise concerns. Moreover, although the company is trying to recover from operational limitations, Java Monster production issues have negatively impacted sales so far in 2017.Meanwhile, Monster Beverage’s increased marketing spend to boost top-line growth and attract customers is likely to build pressure on margins. Operating expenses increased 15.1% year over year in the first nine months of 2017. Monster Beverage’s operating margin fell 10 basis points (bps) in the same time frame owing to higher general and administrative as well as marketing expenses on international expansion.Nevertheless, various innovative sales-boosting efforts are expected to drive the top line for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

1669,MNST,"Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Nov 8, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 2.50%. However, the company managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 1.42%.The chart below depicts the surprise history.Monster Beverage Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Monster Beverage Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Monster Beverage Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayMonster Beverage has been doing well on the back of product innovation that plays a major role in the company’s success. The company’s net sales grew 9.4% year over year in the first half of 2017, banking on wide-ranging portfolio of energy drink brands that has been experiencing solid demand in both the domestic and international markets.The company’s sales in the Monster Energy Drinks segment, accounting for almost 90% of total net sales, increased 8.7%. Due to growing health awareness, consumers are now particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners, high sugar content and obesity-related concerns. As a result, the broader carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category has been suffering for the last few years. However, energy drinks constitute one of the few sub-categories that continue to gain momentum. Therefore, a portfolio based on energy drinks should drive the company’s top line in the near term.Again, the Strategic Brands segment, which includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), grew more than 13% in the period. The company's strategic deal expanded its portfolio with notable brands, with increased presence in the international energy drinks market. This addition has been boosting the company’s sales and the trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, the company is experiencing solid growth in margins. The company’s first as well as second quarters’ gross margin benefitted from the raw material cost savings related to the American Fruits & Flavors acquisition. The trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Monster Beverage’s sales and profits have been dented significantly by unfavorable currency translations. Although the U.S. dollar has softened against other currencies, the impact is still significant.Distributor termination expenses too might affect the company’s bottom line. The company has been transitioning from third-party distributors to Coca-Cola’s distribution network following the strategic deal with Coca-Cola.Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 40 cents a share, reflecting an increase of 20.8% year over year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $901.1 million, implying 14.4% year-over-year growth.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Monster Beverage does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: Monster Beverage has an Earnings ESP of -1.32%.Zacks Rank: Monster Beverage carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

Lower SG&A expense (down 20%), higher gross margin (up 170 basis points or bps), and higher operating margin (up 404 bps) helped it come up with better numbers. However, Coca-Cola's total sales decreased 15%, marking the 10th consecutive quarterly decline in revenues.PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) reported mixed third-quarter 2017 (ending Sep 9) results, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. Nonetheless, this is the sixth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise.Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.’s  third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.10 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.3%. Earnings decreased 6% on a year-over-year basis owing to the recent hurricanes in United States, earthquakes in Mexico and a previously disclosed write-off of prepaid resin inventory.

1670,MNST,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results. Despite reporting flat soda volumes, the coal giant gained from higher demand for Sprite, tea and coffee. Again, cost-cutting initiatives led by the refranchising of its low-margin bottling operations helped it to come up with better numbers.Earnings BeatThird-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of the company were 50 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents by 2%.Earnings also improved from the year-ago profit level of 49 cents helped by ongoing productivity efforts.Sales DiscussionNet revenues, however, declined 15% year over year to $9.1 billion due to the negative impact of structural items, marking the 10th consecutive quarterly decline in revenues. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had a 18% impact on revenues, partly offset by 3% positive contribution of price/mix. The structural changes primarily include the impact of bottler refranchising efforts.Revenues, however, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.8 billion.Coca-Cola Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Coca-Cola Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Coca-Cola Company (The) QuoteVolume and PricingCoca-Cola’s total unit case volume remained unchanged with no growth in the quarter (similar to the preceding quarter). Unit case volume continued to be impacted by macroeconomic headwinds in some Latin American markets. That said, emerging and developing markets saw some improvements with minor positive unit case volume growth.

The performance of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar was solid in the quarter, growing unit case volume by high single digits. By the first quarter of 2018, Coca-Cola intends to introduce the new recipe in Coca-Cola Zero Sugar in all key markets across the world.Coca-Cola has been focusing more on creating a consumer-centric brand portfolio. The beverage giant made an important addition to its portfolio beyond sparkling soft drinks with the recent acquisition of the Topo Chico premium sparkling mineral water brand in the United States.Coca-Cola also completed a key ownership transition of bottling assets in Africa in early October. However, the company will temporarily hold these businesses until it finds a suitable refranchising partner.2017 Guidance ReaffirmedOrganic revenues are expected to rise 3%.

1671,MNST,"The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the opening bell.Changes in consumer preference and consumer dynamics, demographic shifts, and also a spending shift toward lower-priced products have been a dampener for Hershey’s sales since 2014.Nevertheless, Hershey regularly innovates its core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio. The company’s initiatives have been bearing fruit of late, with net sales increasing 2.2% year over year in the first half. The company experienced sales growth for the fifth straight quarter after a few quarters of no growth. However, the company had earlier stated that owing to the timing of some second-quarter shipments, Hershey’s second half net sales are likely to be same as the year ago.To add to the woes, Hershey has been delivering weak performance in international markets since 2015, primarily due to soft results in China. Lower net price realization in international markets and challenges in China are expected to remain a drag on the soon-to-be reported quarter.According to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company’s North America (U.S. and Canada) segment revenues, comprising 89% of the total revenues, of $1.76 billion are likely to remain unchanged in the third quarter from the year-ago quarter. International and Other segment is likely to witness a decline of 0.01%.Meanwhile, Hershey’s adjusted gross margin and operating margin expanded 160 basis points (bps) and 270 bps, respectively, in the second quarter driven by favorable trade, supply chain productivity and costs-saving initiatives and lower input costs. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well. However, softness in sales and unfavorable mix are expected to hurt Hershey’s margins. Again, higher advertising as well as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses are expected to restrict the margins.Overall, Hershey’s bottom line is likely to benefit depending on its ability to increase prices, along with productivity and cost-cutting initiatives to offset lower volumes, flat sales, unfavorable mix and more advertising expenses and SG&A costs.For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.28, reflecting a decrease of 0.9% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is at $2 billion, implying 0.02% year-over-year growth.Here is what our quantitative model predicts.Hershey has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Hershey is +0.13%.Zacks Rank: Hershey carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.Hershey Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Hershey Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Hershey Company (The) QuoteStocks Worth a LookHere are a few consumer staples stocks you may consider, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Mondelez International, Inc.

1672,MNST,"Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the market opens.The company expects the default by a resin supplier to its operations in Mexico to affect its 2017 operating income by approximately $7-$9 million or 3 cents per share, the impact of which will be felt more in the third quarter of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.15, reflecting a decline of 1.8% year over year.Apart from the default, the hurricanes in the United States and the earthquake in Mexico impacted Dr Pepper’s operations. However, the company did not specify the extent to which such calamities have affected its operating results. Also, it expects about a $5-million increase in health, welfare and risk insurance in the third quarter.Apart from these headwinds, let us analyze a few other factors that might affect Q3 results:Weak Volumes: Sluggish carbonated beverages (comprise around 82% of its business) volume trends are hurting carbonated beverages (CSD) category growth for quite some time now. Cross-category competition and growing health and wellness consciousness are impeding CSD category growth. The diet drinks are also under pressure due to increasing consumer concern regarding the use of artificial sweeteners.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CSD volume growth is projected at a meager 0.02% for the third quarter, less than 3% growth reported last quarter and 2% in the prior-year quarter. Additionally, bottler case sales (BCS) volume is expected to grow 0.02% in the third quarter, lower than 3% growth reported last quarter and 2% in the prior-year quarter. Non-carbonated beverages (NCBs) volumes are expected to grow 0.04%, less than 5% growth seen in the last quarter and flat volume in the prior-year quarter.Overall, sales volume is expected to increase only 0.02% as per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, compared with 4% growth reported last quarter and 1% in the year-ago quarter.Bai Brands: Dr Pepper will be making heavy marketing investments for Bai brands in the third quarter. The company has already spent $20 million for promoting the brand in the second quarter of 2017.Bai Brands is one of the fastest growing beverage brands that offer a family of premium better-for-you beverages. Now, with the shift of consumer preference toward healthier drinks, Dr Pepper’s inclusion of Bai Brands will boost its profit margin amid declining soda sales.RCI Program: We are encouraged by the company’s Rapid Continuous Improvement (RCI) program through which it has been able to reduce inventory and storage costs and improve cash flows, which can be returned to shareholders via dividends and re-invested in the business to boost the top line.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.77 billion, reflecting an increase of 5.1% year over year.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Dr Pepper does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Dr Pepper is -0.10%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Dr Pepper carries a Zacks Rank #4. We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Quote Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the Consumer Staples sector that you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:B&G Foods, Inc.

1673,MNST,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the opening bell.Coca-Cola has been struggling to boost sales amid weak demand in certain emerging and developing markets and shift in consumer preference. The company has been witnessing a decline in revenues for the last nine quarters, primarily due to weak volumes especially in the sparkling beverage category, and structural changes.Coca-Cola’s second-quarter revenues declined 16% year over year due to currency headwinds and negative impact of structural items. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had a 17% impact on revenues, while currency headwinds hurt sales by 2%. The company’s soon-to-be reported quarter is also expected to be adversely impacted by 19-20% in net revenues from acquisitions, divestitures, and other structural items. The company also expects currency headwinds to hurt quarterly net revenues by 1-2%.Segment Discussion: North America, comprising about 30% of the total revenues, is expected to see tepid growth in third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues of $2.6 billion reflect growth of 1% from the year-ago quarter.Latin America revenues are likely to witness 4.8% growth. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa segment revenues of $1.9 billion indicates a decrease of 7.1% from the prior quarter and Bottling Investments revenues are likely to decrease 54% year over year. Again, Asia Pacific revenues are expected to decrease 0.4% on a year-over-year basis.Coming to the company’s bottom line, i.e. EPS, the cola giant has surpassed analysts’ expectations for earnings in 12 of the past 13 quarters. However, the company’s adjusted EPS, excluding one-time items, have fallen for the past nine consecutive quarters.As mentioned earlier, Coca-Cola expects net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and other structural items to have a headwind of 9-10% on profits before taxes in the to-be-reported quarter. Currency fluctuations are anticipated to have an adverse impact of 2-3% on quarterly profits before taxes.That said, Coca-Cola is taking aggressive cost-cutting and strategic measures to mitigate the impact of lower sales and weak volumes. Adjusted consolidated gross margins expanded 210 basis points (bps) year over year to 62.6% in the second quarter of 2017, as currency headwinds were offset by positive pricing and productivity gains. We expect to witness similar trends in the to-be reported quarter as well.Overall, the beverage behemoth’s third-quarter revenues/profits are likely to decline owing to structural changes and currency headwind. We feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support bottom line to some extent. The refranchising efforts, though hurting sales/profits in the near term, will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending, and improved return on invested capital in the long run by reducing exposure to the low-margin bottling operations.For the third quarter, Coca-Cola’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 49 cents, reflecting a 0.7% year-over-year decrease. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $8.84 billion, implying 16.9% decline.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Coca-Cola has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.  Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Coca-Cola is +0.17%.Zacks Rank: Coca-Cola carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Coca-Cola Company (The) QuoteStocks Worth a LookHere are a few consumer staples stocks you may consider, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.13% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1674,MNST,"PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2018 results, wherein earnings topped estimates while sales lagged. Notably, this marked the ninth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise. The improvement was mainly attributable to strong performances in its international divisions, propelled by higher revenue growth in developing and emerging markets.PepsiCo’s shares have risen nearly 4% in the pre-trading session, following the earnings release. Overall, the company’s shares have lost 10.1% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s 5% decline.EarningsPepsiCo’s second-quarter core earnings per share (EPS) of $1.61 beat the consensus mark of $1.51 per share by 6.6% and increased 8% year over year. In constant-currency terms, adjusted earnings improved 7% from the year-ago period.Pepsico, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Pepsico, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Pepsico, Inc. QuoteCore earnings exclude restructuring and impairment charges, and commodity mark-to-market net impact. The company reported earnings of $1.28 per share, reflecting a decline of 13% year over year. The foreign exchange translation had a positive impact of 1 percentage point on reported EPS.SalesNet revenues of $16,090 million increased 2.4% from the year-ago level. Foreign exchange (Fx) had 1 percentage point positive impact on revenue growth. However, reported revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16,125 million.Excluding the impact of Fx, revenues increased 2.6% on an organic basis, primarily driven by strength in the majority of the company’s businesses, particularly international divisions that gained from persistent growth in emerging and developing markets. Among these, Latin America; Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA); Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA); and Frito-Lay North America (FLNA) segments reported organic revenue growth in the second quarter.Total volume grew 1% in the reported quarter, unchanged from the previous quarter.

1675,MNST,"PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 10, before market open. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.4%. It also surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average of 4.3%.Let’s See How Things are Shaping Up for Q2PepsiCo has been head on heels trying to improve its performance through product launches, fortifying developing/emerging market presence, aggressive marketing, productivity improvement and cost-saving initiatives. The success of the company’s initiatives was well reflected in first-quarter 2018 earnings, which were driven by strong international performance on revenue growth in the developing and emerging markets.Moreover, the company’s fundamental strength is evident from its solid brand portfolio, product innovation and strong snacks business. Notably, PepsiCo has delivered positive earnings surprise for eight consecutive quarters.Pepsico, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Pepsico, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pepsico, Inc. QuoteAs a result, PepsiCo stock has been gaining over the past month, reflecting a positive sentiment ahead of earnings. The company’s shares have increased 7.9%, outperforming the industry’s 4.4% rise.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is $1.51 per share, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 0.7%. However, we note that the consensus mark for the to-be-reported quarter has moved south in the last seven days. The downward estimate movement can be attributed to the fact that the beverage industry is witnessing sluggish CSD (carbonated soft drinks) volumes, which is a pressing concern. CSD volumes for PepsiCo’s North America Beverages (NAB) business decreased 4% in the first quarter of 2018. Looking back, PepsiCo’s CSD volumes declined 2% each in 2014 and 2015, 1% in 2016 and 5% in 2017 in the NAB business.Furthermore, consumer taste is rapidly shifting from CSDs to non-carbonated beverages. To this end, PepsiCo is gradually reshuffling its portfolio toward healthier alternatives. Currently, a major portion of PepsiCo’s total net revenues comes from “Guilt-Free” products, more than half of which comes from the “Everyday Nutrition” category. This percentage is likely to increase, given the company’s stepped-up innovation and focus on adapting to changing consumer preferences.PepsiCo has also broadened its beverage portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages to decrease the dependence on colas, keeping in mind the slowdown in CSD volumes. The company’s non-carbonated beverage volume mix increased 7 percentage points since 2010.Nonetheless, results of the NAB segment — comprising beverage businesses in the United States and Canada — remained soft in the first quarter. This is because it was negatively impacted by higher input costs and operating cost inflation that substantially offset productivity gains. The results were also affected by a bonus, extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act.Segment DiscussionPepsiCo’s North America Beverages or NAB business accounts for about 33% of the company’s total revenues. Revenues at the segment declined 1% in first-quarter 2018, preceded by declines of 6% and 3% in the fourth quarter and third quarter of 2017. However, the metric remained unchanged in the first two quarters of 2017. The trend is unlikely to reverse in the to-be-reported quarter as well. For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NAB segment revenues is pegged at $5.18 billion. This reflects an increase from $4.4 billion reported in the first quarter and a decline from $5.24 billion in the year-ago quarter.For the Frito-Lay North America or FLNA business (accounting for 25% of revenues), PepsiCo had a good balance of volume growth and net price realization. The segment’s revenues improved 3% last quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $3.8 billion, mirroring an increase from $3.6 billion in the prior quarter and $3.7 billion in the year-ago period.The Quaker Foods North America segment revenues improved marginally in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $551 million compared with $601 million in the first quarter and $553 million in the second quarter of 2017.The Europe Sub-Saharan Africa segment revenues grew 15% in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $3.04 billion, implying an increase from $2.8 billion in the prior-year quarter and $1.7 billion last quarter.The Latin America segment revenues were up 14% in the last reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $1.9 billion compared with $1.8 billion in the second quarter of 2017 and $1.2 billion in first-quarter 2018.Revenues at the Asia, Middle East and North Africa segment improved 7% year over year in the first quarter. The metric is likely to increase to $1.7 billion in the second quarter of 2018 from $1.6 billion registered in the year-ago period and $1.04 billion in the prior quarter, per the consensus estimate.Overall, for the second quarter, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues to come in at $16.1 billion, reflecting 2.6% growth from the prior-year quarter.Quantitative Model PredictionHere is what our quantitative model predicts:PepsiCo does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: PepsiCo has an Earnings ESP of +0.18%.

1676,MNST,"Craft beer, which till some time back was a favorite with Americans, seems to be losing its appeal. According to market research firm IRI Worldwide, craft beer growth slowed in the first half of 2018 and the rest of the year doesn’t look good either. Moreover beer shipments from U.S. breweries too are down so far this year. An increasing number of Americans is opting for non-alcoholic beverages that have resulted in demand for energy drinks to shoot over the last few years.Understandably, this has made soft beverage manufacturing companies focus more on healthier drinks, especially non carbonated, low sugary and energy drinks. So much so, that even alcoholic drink manufacturers are focusing on non-alcoholic beverages.Craft Beer Losing AppealTill a few years back, craft beer was a favorite with Americans. However, with changing tastes and preferences of the new generation, the appeal for craft beer is fading. And the change seems to be more evident this year. According to the Beer Institute, beer shipments from U.S. breweries are already down 3.5% this year.Per IRI, worldwide sales of craft beer across large-scale retail stores grew only 1.7% in the first half of 2018. Interestingly, in 2002, beer comprised 54% of overall alcohol sales but in 2017 beer contributed only 46% of total alcohol sales. This is certainly taking a toll on prominent beer manufacturers like Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) and Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report), which are struggling to cope with declining demand for beer.The reason for this sudden beer-apathy is the growing preference for healthier drinks. An increasing number of Americans is becoming health conscious, which has seen a decline in demand for carbonated beverages. The carbonated soft drink market has shrunk for 13 consecutive years now. Carbonated soft drinks volume fell 1.6% in 2017 and is projected to decline between 0.8% and 1.3% this year.Industry Swings Toward Non-Alcoholic and Energy DrinksThe global non-alcoholic beverage market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 5.5% between 2018 and 2023, according to Market Research Future. Analysts believe that growing consumer awareness and increasing interest in a healthier lifestyle is making people shun alcoholic and carbonated drinks.This has resulted in the energy drink market to grow at a rapid pace over the last few years. Energy drinks continue to outperform the overall soft drink market in terms of value. The global value of energy drinks reached more than $51 billion in 2017.Understandably, millennials are opting for healthier and non-alcoholic drinks, which has made not only soft beverages companies shift focus toward healthier drinks, but also beer manufacturers reorient their product line with low-alcohol content.Beer manufacturers like Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report), The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) and Craft Brew Alliance, Inc. (BREW  -  Free Report) are trying to come up with innovative products and adding new flavors that have less alcohol content. The Boston Beer Company recently launched Fuzzy Traveler Peach Shandy that is low on alcohol content. Craft Brew Alliance has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.On the other hand, almost all beverage companies like The Coca Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report), Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. , Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V (FMX  -  Free Report) and Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) are redesigning their portfolio along these lines.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1677,MNST,"An increasing number of Americans are becoming health conscious. This has resulted in steady growth in sales volume of bottled water, making it the number one preferred beverage in the United States in 2017, according to a recent release from International Bottled Water Association (""IBWA"") and Beverage Market Corporation (""BMC"").Understandably, Americans are refraining from carbonated and sugary drinks. According to analysts, the bottled water market is expected to grow further in the days to come. This has made carbonated soft drink (CSD) manufacturers shift focus toward bottled water and other healthier options.Bottled Water Becomes the Number One BeverageBottled water has become the highest selling beverage in the United States for two years in a row. According to IBWA and BMC, bottled water volumes escalated to 13.7 billion in 2017, reflecting a 7% year-over-year increase. Bottled water sales came in at $18.5 billion, increasing 8.8% year over year.Per capita consumption of bottled water exceeded 42 gallons, increasing 6.2% over the same time period. It goes without saying that the gap between carbonated drinks and bottled water is fast widening.Bottled Water Market to GrowThe sparkling water category grew 70% between 2011 and 2016 and is expected to touch $3.1 billion by 2022, according to Euromonitor. Per BMC, per capita consumption of bottled water will cross 50 gallons in the next few years. Interestingly, all segments under the bottled water category witnessed robust growth in 2017. Domestic sparkling water surged 27.5%, while domestic non-sparkling and imported water jumped 5.5% and 9.2%, respectively.Moreover, according to IBWA, three out of five Americans prefer bottled water to any other beverage. Also, according to a recent Nielsen data, sales of bottled water, flavored water and energy drinks have jumped in the four weeks to May 19. During this period, PepsiCo’s share of sparkling water category grew 4.7%, up from 0.6% growth in January. Also, Dr Pepper Snapple’s shelf-stable juices and drinks witnessed sales growth of 13.1%.Industry Shifts Focus Toward Bottled Water, Healthier OptionsAccording to Nielsen’s latest data, sales growth of energy drinks, still flavored water, sparkling flavored water and bottled water grew 7%, 10.9% and 17.7% and 7.1%, respectively, in the four weeks to May 19, on a year-over-year basis.Given that more Americans prefer bottled water to other soft carbonated beverages, CSD manufacturers like the Coca Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report), Nestle S.A. (NSRGY  -  Free Report), Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. , Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V (FMX  -  Free Report) and Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) too are redesigning their portfolio along these lines. Coca Cola, PepsiCo, Nestle and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, each carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Coca-Cola recently introduced a range of flavors in smaller packages to its diet coke brand to attract new-generation drinkers. Moreover, the company has promised to reduce the sugar-level in most of its products. It has also introduced Coke Zero Sugar, revamping its Coke Zero. The company also acquired the U.S. rights of Topo Chico, a premium sparkling mineral water brand in October 2017. In February, Pepsico launched its new sparkling water line Bubly. A few months ago, Nestle announced that it will be rebranding its Nestle Waters’ Regional Spring Water Sparkling portfolio. The new portfolio will comprise 10 new flavors, design changes in bottles and a new can format.Bottom LineUndoubtedly, Americans’ growing health-consciousness has led to a surge in sales volume of bottled water and other healthier beverages. Moreover, the bottled water market is poised to grow further in over the next few years. This has made beverage companies reorient their business strategy and redesign their portfolio with increased focus on bottled water.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1678,MNST,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3.2% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MNST due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.First-Quarter 2018 ResultsMonster Beverage’s adjusted earnings came in at 39 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the company reported earnings of 38 cents, which include distributor termination expenses that lowered the reported earnings by approximately 1 cent, after tax. Then again, reported earnings increased 22.6% year over year.Net sales of $850.9 million missed the consensus mark of $859.8 million. The figure improved 14.7% from the prior-year quarter’s tally. Foreign currency translation positively impacted net sales by $17.7 million, partially offset by $9.9-million impact due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606.Net sales to customers outside the United States increased 26.8% year over year to $242.1 million.Quarterly Segment DetailsMonster Energy Drinks: Net sales in the segment, which includes Monster Energy, Monster Hydro energy and Mutant Super Soda drinks, were up 16.7% from the year-ago quarter’s tally to $780.5 million.Strategic Brands: This segment includes various energy-drink brands acquired from Coca-Cola. Net sales in the segment declined 3.3% to $65.8 million in the quarter. The downside was mainly due to the adoption of ASC 606.Other: Net sales in the segment, which includes some products of American Fruits & Flavors sold to independent third parties, were down 15.9% year over year at $4.7 million.Inside the Headline NumbersFirst-quarter 2018 gross margin fell 420 bps to 60.6% due to higher promotional allowances, the adoption of ASC 606, geographical and domestic product sales mix.Operating expenses, including $7 million in distributor termination expenses, increased 8.6% from the prior-year quarter’s level to $235.3 million. Operating income in the quarter was $279.9 million, up 5.9% year over year.Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 11.5%, down 20 bps from first-quarter 2017.Effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.3% compared with 32.8% in the prior-year quarter.FinancialsMonster Beverage ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $511.4 million compared with $528.6 million as of Dec 31, 2017.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been seven revisions lower for the current quarter.Monster Beverage Corporation Price and Consensus Monster Beverage Corporation Price and Consensus | Monster Beverage Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, MNST has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a D.

If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.The company's stock is suitable solely for growth based on our styles scores.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

1679,MNST,"Monster Beverage Corporation’s (MNST  -  Free Report) shares have lost 18.6% in the past year, faring miserably against the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry’s rally of 10.5%. Also, the company has underperformed the industry in the 4-week and 12-week time frames, which indicates the current Momentum Score of F.Moreover, Monster Beverage’s earnings estimates revisions are pretty discouraging. Estimates for 2018 and 2019 have declined 3.4% and 3.9%, respectively, over the last 30 days, which reflect analysts’ bearish outlook over the stock.Let’s delve into the factors that are taking this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company downhill.Gross Margin Woes LingerHigher raw material costs (mainly aluminum and sweeteners) and unfavorable product have been primarily hurting margins. Gross margin declined 20 basis points (bps) in 2017. Meanwhile, Monster Beverage’s ramped up marketing spend, to boost the top line and attract customers, is likely to exert pressure on margins.Increase in promotional allowances, $9.9-million commissions as a reduction of net sales due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, lower margin foreign operations, change in domestic product sales mix, rise in certain import costs principally freight-in aluminum cans as well as sucralose and Hydro production issues in the United States and EMEA region hurt gross margins by 420 bps in the first quarter.The company apprehends gross margin headwinds to persist at least through the first half of 2018. Along with this, higher distribution costs from increased freight expenses are expected to put pressure on 2018 operating margin.Softness in Beverage IndustryHealth-conscious consumers are opting for better beverage alternatives like ready-to-drink tea and bottled water. This shift in consumer preferences is impacting the volumes of soda beverages and energy drinks. U.S. sales have struggled for months as Monster Beverage faces tough competition from other energy drink companies and shifting consumer preferences. This change in consumer preference is also impacting sales of food and beverage giants like PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc .Overvalued to PeersMonster Beverage has a Value Style Score of F, signifying that there is no upside potential left for the stock at the moment.The company currently has a trailing 12-months Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.7, while the industry’s average is at 20.6. Looking at sales, the company currently trades at a Price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 8.5, significantly higher than the industry average of 4.6. Some prefer this metric more than other value-focused ones because sales are harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.These ratios show that the company is overvalued compared with its industry peers and investors should steer clear from this stock now.Industry Outlook NegativeThe Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry has underperformed the broader market in the past year. Currently, the industry ranks among the bottom 5% (242 out of 255 industries). Along with the weak past performance of the industry, a sluggish rank signals that companies in this space are likely to get affected due to unfavorable broader factors in the immediate future.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.See the pot trades we're targeting>>

1680,MNST,"In a bid to enhance shareholders' value, Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) announced a new $500-million share buyback plan. Also, the new program does not have any expiry date and is expected to be made in the open market or via privately negotiated transactions. Following the news, the company’s shares moved up 5.4% on Wednesday’s trading session.Share repurchase is an important tool, which enables a company to boost the value of shares. Since the repurchase reduces the number of shares outstanding, it thereby increases earnings per share and boosts the market value of the remaining shares.Monster Beverage has been very active on the share repurchase front. In February 2017, the company’s board authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $500 million of the company’s outstanding common stock.During the three months ended Mar 31, 2018, Monster Beverage purchased 4.3 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $57.74 per share, for a total amount of $249.9 million (excluding broker commissions), which exhausted the availability under the February 2017 Repurchase Plan.Again in February 2018, the company’s board authorized a new share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $250.0 million of the company’s outstanding common stock. Notably, there is no availability remaining under this program.Will Share Repurchase Revive the Stock?This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s shares have declined 17.9% so far this year, which indicates investors’ low confidence in the company. Earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019 also fell 3.4% and 3.9%, respectively, over the past 30 days, reflecting analysts’ concern.Of late, Monster Beverage has been grappling with multiple headwinds. Health-conscious consumers are opting for healthier alternatives. This shift in consumer preference is impacting sales of companies like Monster Beverage and other food as well as beverage giants like PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc .Again, a decline in gross margin raises concern. Higher raw material costs (mainly aluminum and sweeteners) and unfavorable product mix hurt margin. First-quarter 2018 gross margin contracted 420 basis points (bps) to 60.6% due to higher promotional allowances, geographical and domestic product sales mix. Operating expenses increased 8.6% from the prior-year quarter to $235.3 million.The new share repurchase is expected to boost Monster Beverage’s earnings and raise shareholders’ value.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1681,MNST,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) has plans to boost its investment in Argentina. The beverage giant intends to invest $1.2 billion in the country within the time period of 2019-2021, as stated by the company in a statement on May 29. Earlier, Coca-Cola had plans to invest $1 billion in the 2016-2018 time frame.Coca-Cola was one of the companies to initiate a major investment in Argentina after Macri took charge in late 2015, promising business-friendly reforms.Notably, the company’s performance in Latin America clearly improved in the last reported quarter, particularly in Brazil and Argentina, where modest volume growth was witnessed. In fact, improvement in the key markets like India, Argentina and Brazil was noticed in the second half of 2017 and in first-quarter 2018.The Latin America segment registered revenues of $998 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 8% from the prior-year quarter. Price/mix growth was 6% in the quarter, primarily driven by strong price/mix in Mexico and the South Latin business unit. Organic revenues grew 6%.Unit case volume increased 1%, as low to mid-single-digit growth in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico was offset by a decline in both Peru and Chile.Coca-Cola has a commanding presence in the developing and emerging markets of Latin America, India, Russia and China, courtesy of the growth opportunities that these countries provide. More than half of the company’s revenues are generated outside the United States.First-Quarter 2018 At a GlanceCoca-Cola started 2018 on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts in the first quarter. In addition to a notable increase in soda volumes, it also gained from its growing beverage portfolio and restructuring efforts. Organic sales grew 5%, led by price/mix improvement of 1% and concentrate sales growth of 4%. Currency also had a 2% positive impact on revenues. Again, lower SG&A expenses (down 24.2%), along with higher gross margin (up 270 basis points or bps) and operating margin (up 600 bps) helped it come up with better earnings (up 8%).However, total sales decreased 16% year over year, marking the 12th consecutive quarterly decline in revenues. Although the top line is yet to show sustained improvement, we are encouraged by its strategic efforts to transform its portfolio into a total beverage company, with improved marketing and innovation, focus on driving revenues by improved price/mix, digital focus, and productivity initiatives toward driving margins.Share Price PerformanceCoca-Cola’s shares have lost 7% year to date, comparing favorably with the industry’s 11.3% decline. Earnings estimates for 2018 have moved 0.5% north in the past 60 days, while the same remained stable for 2019. This reflects analysts’ optimism on the stock’s earnings potential.Making the most of the growth opportunities in the emerging countries, along with improved marketing and innovation will drive its revenues.Changing demographics and purchasing behavior make it essential for Coca-Cola, and other food as well as beverage giants like PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  to understand and capitalize on the primary consumer insights that identify growing trends.The company currently has Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1682,MNST,"In line with its strategy to shift toward healthier options, PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) will acquire Bare Foods, a U.S.-based maker of baked fruit and vegetable snacks.  No terms of the deal were disclosed.Buyout BenefitsThe addition of Bare Foods’ fruit and vegetable chips will expand Frito-Lay’s better-for-you snack offerings. Also, Bare Foods’ baked crunchy fruit and vegetable assortments resonate well with current consumer preference. Bare Foods products are Non-GMO Project verified and come with clean labels.Performance with PurposeThe decision to add this organic food maker is well in line with PepsiCo’s Performance with Purpose initiative, which aims to increase healthier food options in PepsiCo’s portfolio.""For nearly a dozen years, PepsiCo has been committed to Performance with Purpose, our vision of making more nutritious products, while also reducing added sugars, salt and saturated fat. Bare Snacks fits perfectly within that vision,"" states Indra Nooyi, chairman and chief executive officer of PepsiCo.Notably, PepsiCo’s recent efforts toward innovation in snacks focus on higher-margin healthy and premium offerings, since there is a definitive market for such products now. Nutritional products have increased the percentage of the company’s total portfolio from 38% in 2006 to 50% in 2017. This percentage is likely to increase considering the company’s rapid innovation and focus on adapting to changing consumer preferences.Moreover, PepsiCo has augmented its beverage portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages to reduce dependence on colas. As of Mar 24, 2018, PepsiCo increased the volume mix of non-carbonated beverages by 7 percentage points since 2010. The company has been growing its value share in a number of its fastest-growing categories including tea, enhanced water and sparkling water. Meanwhile, tea portfolio under Lipton and Pure Leaf has driven retail sales in the range of mid-single digits to as high as 21% over the past 17 quarters.Changing demographics and purchasing behaviors make it essential for PepsiCo and other food as well as beverage giants like Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  to understand and capitalize on main consumer insights that identify growing trends. Health awareness has been a prime concern for consumers in recent times. Capitalizing on this trend can prove to be beneficial for any food and beverage company.Price PerformancePepsiCo’s shares have lost around 16% year to date, compared with the Zacks Soft Beverages industry's decline of 11.2%. Also, earnings estimates have moved downward by 1 cent for 2018 and 2 cents for 2019 in the last 30 days.Nevertheless, we believe that the company’s new product lineup consisting of healthier options, productivity improvement and cost-saving initiatives should boost profits and the stock’s performance in the upcoming quarters. Zacks RankPepsiCo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1683,MNST,"PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) has been trying to gain traction through product launches, fortifying developing/emerging market presence, aggressive marketing, productivity improvement and cost-saving initiatives. However, higher input costs and dismal performance by its North America Beverages (""NAB"") division have been pressing problems.Efforts to Boost Sales Bode WellSales for beverage giant PepsiCo have remained subdued in the recent quarters, due to growing health and wellness consciousness. Consumer tastes are rapidly shifting from carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) to non-carbonated beverages. Sluggish CSD volumes are pressing concerns for this beverage giant as well as for other nonalcoholic beverage companies such as The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. . Shares of PepsiCo have decreased 17% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Soft Beverages industry that has declined 12.3% over the same period.Nonetheless, PepsiCo is gradually reshuffling its portfolio toward healthier options. Currently, a major portion of PepsiCo’s total net revenues comes from “Guilt-Free” products, more than half of which comes from the “Everyday Nutrition” category. This percentage is likely to increase, given the company’s stepped-up innovation and focus on adapting to changing consumer preferences. The better-for-you and good-for-you products have increased the percentage of the company’s total portfolio from 38% in 2006 to 50% in 2017. Retail sales of KeVita, PepsiCo’s line of premium organic probiotic beverages, grew 50% in the first quarter.PepsiCo is one of the top global positions in the non-alcoholic beverage and snack food industries, anchored by cherished brands like Pepsi, Gatorade, Tropicana, Lays, Doritos, and Quaker, among others. PepsiCo has broadened its beverage portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages to decrease the dependence on colas; keeping in mind the slowdown in CSD volumes. PepsiCo’s non-carbonated beverage volume mix increased 7 percentage points since 2010.The company has been growing its value share in a number of its fastest-growing categories including tea, enhanced water and sparkling water.Emerging/Developing Market Presence Drives GrowthLast month, the beverage giant reported first quarter of 2018 results, wherein core earnings increased 3% year over year on 4.3% revenue growth. The improvement was mainly attributable to the strong performances by its international divisions, propelled by higher revenue growth in the developing and emerging markets.In the first quarter of 2018, the company registered 8% organic revenue growth in its developing and emerging markets as a group, reflecting acceleration from 6.5% improvement recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. Within Latin America, organic revenues grew 10% in Mexico, high teens in Brazil and 20% in Argentina in the quarter. Notably, in Asia, Middle East and North Africa or AMENA division, PepsiCo witnessed strong double-digit organic revenue growth in China, India, Egypt and Pakistan.The company has almost tripled its global footprint from 28 markets at the beginning of 2015 to 77 markets at present.Weak NAB Results are Cause of ConcernIn first-quarter 2018, the NAB division reported dismal results with revenues and operating profit decreasing 1% and 22%, respectively. Volumes declined 2.5%, owing to 4% decline in CSDs and 1% decrease in Non CSDs.The non-carbonated beverage volume decreased mainly due to low-single-digit declines in Gatorade sports drinks, and juice and juice drinks portfolio, partially offset by a low-single-digit increase in the overall water portfolio. Acquisitions had a nominal positive contribution to the volume performance.Operating profit was affected by operating cost inflation as well as higher raw material costs, and a bonus extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act.Higher Input Costs a WoeThe company has stepped up productivity and cost-saving initiatives to boost profitability by reducing overall costs. PepsiCo’s productivity program aims to deliver $1 billion in annual productivity savings.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s adjusted gross margin fell 75 basis points (bps) year over year in the last reported quarter. The downside was mainly due to higher input costs. PepsiCo’s arch rival, Coca-Cola also faced a significant rise in freight costs in its North America segment in the first quarter of 2018. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Meanwhile, PepsiCo expects its gross margin to remain under pressure in fiscal 2018 due to the higher input costs. The company has been undertaking various productivity initiatives to improve its margins. However, the favorable impact of productivity measures is expected to be offset by investments in PepsiCo’s growth initiatives.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1684,MNST,"Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 numbers on May 8, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings missed analysts’ expectation. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only one of the last four quarters, the average being a negative 1.2%.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to drive the company’s first-quarter 2018 results.Product InnovationProduct innovation plays a major role in boosting revenues. The company’s net sales grew 10.5% in 2017 on the back of a wide portfolio of energy drink brands that has been experiencing solid demand in domestic and international markets. The company also introduced a number of products in the quarter under review, which is expected to contribute to the upcoming quarterly results.In the quarter to be reported, Monster Beverage launched Caffé Monster in three flavors, Monster Energy Ultraviolet, Monster Hydro in three flavors and relaunched Muscle Monster in two flavors.It launched Monster Hydro in Sweden and Germany, Monster Energy Ultraviolet in the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom along with Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink in Australia and New Zealand in the first quarter of 2018.Strong Energy Drinks MomentumSales in the Monster Energy Drinks segment, accounting for 90% of total sales, improved 10.4% in 2017. Due to growing health awareness, consumers are particularly cautious about the use of artificial sweeteners and high sugar content products. As a result, the broader carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category has been suffering for the last few years. However, energy drinks constitute one of the few sub-categories that continue to gain momentum. Therefore, a portfolio based on energy drinks will drive the company’s top line.Notably, strategic deals with notable brands bolstered the company’s portfolio and strengthened presence in the international energy drinks market. The Strategic Brands segment, which includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company, improved more than 10% in 2017. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Increased Costs to Hurt MarginHigher raw material costs (mainly aluminum and sweeteners), unfavorable product mix that included more Java products coming online (lower-margin product) as well as inventory destocking in China dented gross margin by 390 basis points (bps) in the preceding quarter. The company expects gross margin to be similar to the fourth-quarter level going forward, as the headwinds are expected to persist at least through the first half of 2018, barring inventory reserves in China. Along with this, higher distribution costs from higher freight expenses are expected to create pressure on operating margin in 2018.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 revenues is pegged at $859.8 million, reflecting an increase of 15.9% year over year. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for earnings is 39 cents, implying 18.2% year-over-year growth.Quantitative Model PredictionMonster Beverage does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which increases the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Monster Beverage has an Earnings ESP of +0.64%.

With the company’s expanded footprint, net sales increased 33.8% in the last reported quarter. The upside can be attributed to acquisitions and higher comparable net sales.Comparable net sales improved 6.7%, driven by 1.5% rise in comparable equivalent unit case volumes. Sparkling product comparable volumes were down 0.7%, while that of still products increased 8.3%.In 2017, Coca-Cola Bottling reported net sales growth of 37% year over year, primarily on acquisitions and a 3.1% hike in comparable net sales owing to 1.6% rise in comparable equivalent unit case volumes.

1686,MNST,"Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for MNST broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 7.1% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for MNST stock.If that wasn’t enough, Monster Beverage isn’t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 2 estimates have been reduced, while none has moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead.

1688,MNST,"The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) will report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, after market close.Top-line weakness in the past several quarters has been marring Kraft Heinz’s prospects. In 2017, net sales declined 1.1% year over year primarily due to soft consumer demand in the United States and Canada. The dismal scenario is not expected to see a turnaround in the to-be-reported quarter. Kraft Heinz’s sales are expected to witness negligible growth (0.1%) in the first quarter of 2018, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Increased retail competition in developed markets, distribution losses for Planters in the club channel leading to lower volumes in United States, Ore-Ida supply deficits as well as the impact of some pricing actions and trade spend timing will inhibit top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Its flagship United States segment, accounting for more than 70% of its total net sales, requires sustained improvement in sales for the company to regain its position. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues of $4.4 billion reflects 2.9% decline on a year-over-year basis.Again, lower retail inventory and lower promotion activity in Canada will hold back organic growth potential in the quarter to be reported. Segment’s revenues of $462 million reflect 4.3% fall for the first quarter, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Meanwhile, Rest of World (Asia Pacific, Latin America and India, the Middle East and Africa) segment revenues of $837 million are likely to witness 1.3% growth. Meanwhile, consensus estimate for Europe segment revenues of $650 million indicates an increase from $543 million a year ago.Increased Investments to Hurt MarginsIn order to boost demand, the company is consistently investing in building go-to-market capabilities, e-commerce and digital investments in selected markets, leveraging distribution and whitespace gains in developing markets, launching a strong pipeline of “Big Bet” products innovation. These initiatives are likely to pressurize margins in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings to DeclineDismal revenue growth and increased costs owing to various investments undertaken will likely translate into lower earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 82 cents, reflecting a 2.4% year-over-year fall. The expected decline in earnings indicates the fact that cost-savings and productivity-improvement initiatives will not be able to provide impetus to earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, our quantitative model predicts earnings miss for Kraft Heinz in the first quarter.Kraft Heinz does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Kraft Heinz is -0.20%.Zacks Rank: Kraft Heinz carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

1690,MNST,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) kicked off 2018 on a strong note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts in the first quarter. Apart from a significant rise in soda volumes, the cola giant gained from its growing beverage portfolio and restructuring efforts. Cost-cutting initiatives led by refranchising of its low-margin bottling operations, helped it to come up with better numbers.Coca-Cola’s shares have rallied 1.6% in the pre-trading session following the earnings release.Earnings BeatFirst-quarter 2018 comparable earnings of the company were 47 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents.Earnings also improved 8% from the year-ago profit level of 43 cents, helped by ongoing productivity efforts.Sales BeatRevenues of $7.63 billion in the quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.43 billion. However, net revenues declined 16% year over year due to the negative impact of structural items, marking the 12th consecutive quarterly fall. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had 26% negative impact on revenues. The structural changes primarily include the impact of bottler refranchising efforts.Organic revenues grew 5% in the quarter, aided by concentrate sales improvement of 4% and price/mix growth of 1%. Currency also impacted revenues positively by 2%.Volume and PricingCoca-Cola’s total unit case volume grew 3% in the quarter versus flat growth in the preceding quarter.Category Cluster Performance: Sparkling beverage unit case volume increased 4% (versus no growth in the prior quarter). Juice, dairy and plant-based beverages witnessed 3% decline (versus 2% growth in the preceding quarter). Water, enhanced water and sports drinks were up 1% (versus 2% in Q4), and Tea and Coffee were up 5% (compared with 2% growth in Q4).Notably, Diet Coke’s North America volume grew in the quarter following a full brand revamp. The introduction of four bold, new flavors, along with contemporary, sleek packaging and innovative marketing, helped in the upside.Quarterly Segment DetailsRevenues grew 11% at North America, 13% at Europe, the Middle East & Africa, and 8% at Latin America segment. However, revenues at Asia Pacific segment increased modestly by 1%.Organic revenues grew across the board, increasing 1% in North America, 8% in Europe, Middle East & Africa, 6% in Latin America, 3% in Asia Pacific and 13% in Bottling Investments.MarginsComparable gross margin expanded 270 basis points (bps) year over year to 64%. The company’s comparable operating margin grew 600 bps to 30.7% in the quarter, given the divestitures of lower-margin bottling businesses and ongoing productivity efforts. The upside was partly offset by the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard.2018 Guidance ReaffirmedOrganic revenues are expected to rise 4%. Acquisitions/divestitures (mainly the bottler re-franchising efforts) are expected to hurt revenues by 17%, while Fx is likely to have a positive impact of 1% on revenues. Again, revenues will be positively impacted by 1-2% from Accounting Standards Update 2014-09.Comparable currency income before income taxes (structurally adjusted) is expected to increase 8-9%. Foreign exchange is expected to hurt comparable income before taxes by 0-1%.

1691,MNST,"The Coca-Cola Company’s (KO  -  Free Report) North America segment’s revenues, comprising about 30% of its top line, are expected to witness growth in the first quarter of 2018, when it reports on Tuesday, Apr 24.A Look at Coca-Cola’s North America Performance in Q4The North America segmental revenues totaled $2.62 billion last quarter, up 6% year over year on 2% growth in price/mix. Organically, revenues rose 3% in the quarter while unit case volume grew 1%. Price/mix increased on the company’s disciplined approach to occasion, brand, price and package strategy, as well as positive business and category mix.Notably, sparkling beverage volumes have shown no growth during the quarter with 1% decline in juice, dairy and plant-based beverages, as mid-single digit growth in Minute Maid and Simply was offset by a decline in Hi-C. The company registered an 8% rise in tea and coffee, while water, enhanced water and sports drinks accelerated to 3% growth.Precisely, the company’s sparkling beverage unit case volume remained flat in the respective fourth, third and second quarters with a 1% decline witnessed in the first quarter of 2017. Notably, the sparkling beverage accounted for 69% of the company’s 2017 worldwide unit case volume. Hence, such vast exposure puts Coca-Cola in a weak spot.Coca-Cola’s North American sparkling beverage business has been delivering sluggish results due to headwinds in the carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category. Cross-category competition, and growing health and wellness consciousness are hurting demand for CSDs. Consumer tastes are swiftly shifting from CSDs to healthier beverages like energy drinks, tea juices and flavored waters.The challenges in the CSD category have been affecting all major soft drink makers namely Coca-Cola, PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Monster Beverage (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group , leading to lower volumes and soft sales.Q1 ExpectationThough Coca-Cola has increased marketing investments, and is driving package and product innovation to boost its carbonated beverage business, these efforts are yet to show meaningful results with the trend unlikely to change in the first quarter as well.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate called for Coca-Cola’s North American segmental revenues of $2.49 billion, reflecting an increase from $2.39 billion a year ago but a decline from $2.62 billion in the prior quarter.Apart from the North American segment, Coca-Cola’s Latin American segment is likely to register revenues of $1.01 billion versus $1.12 billion in the prior quarter and $926 million in the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa segment’s revenues of $1.73 billion indicates a marginal decrease from $1.75 billion sequentially but an increase from $1.63 billion in the prior-year quarter. Bottling Investments revenues are anticipated to decrease to $1.1 billion from $1.27 billion in the third quarter and $3.87 billion a year ago. Again, Asia Pacific revenues are expected to increase to $1.2 billion from $1 billion in the prior quarter. However, on a year-over-year basis, revenues are likely to remain almost flat.Overall Earnings & Revenue ExpectationsOverall, the beverage behemoth’s first-quarter revenues are likely to decline on structural changes. Meanwhile, the company had earlier stated that the first quarter will have one less day than the same period last year. Coca-Cola expects the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items to impart a 26-point headwind and 6-point headwind on net revenues and profit before tax, respectively, in the first quarter.That said, we feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support the bottom line of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company to some extent. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Again, currencies are likely to have a one point tailwind on its first-quarter operating income.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents for first-quarter earnings reflects 7% growth from the prior-year period’s profit of 43 cents per share. Also, the consensus mark for revenues of $7.43 billion represents a 18.6% decrease on a year-over-year basis.(Read More: Will Cost Cut, Innovations Drive Coca-Cola Q1 Earnings?)Coca-Cola Company (The) Revenue (TTM)  Coca-Cola Company (The) Revenue (TTM) | Coca-Cola Company (The) QuoteToday's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1692,MNST,"Cost-saving initiatives and productivity improvement have been favoring PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) amid subdued sales in the recent quarters, courtesy of growing health consciousness. PepsiCo’s shares have sunk approximately 3.8% in the past year, against the industry’s rise of 2%. Nonetheless, the company is striving to retain investors’ optimism and regain its footing.The company stepped up productivity and cost-saving initiatives to boost profitability by reducing overall costs. In February 2014, the company announced a new five-year restructuring plan to generate annual productivity savings of $1 billion each from 2015 to 2019, through productivity measures. The savings come from improved efficiency through increased manufacturing automation, closure of manufacturing facilities and increasing capacity utilization, re-structuring go-to-market systems in developed markets, expanding shared services as well as simplifying organization structures.In the past two years, the company has been using automated high-speed packaging lines across the globe, which increased packaging line speed by up to 50%. Savings from these investments and technology and operational changes are being re-invested in the business to drive the top line.Apart from cost savings, PepsiCo’s product innovation and aggressive marketing techniques are boosting growth.The company regularly introduces new flavors of existing products and maintains a robust pipeline of new products. Most of the company’s latest line-up of products offer health benefits like reduced calorie beverages, non-carbonated beverages and healthier snacks. It is working to offer products with less sodium, sugar and saturated fat to reap benefits from shifting consumers’ preference toward healthier products.Moreover, the company has significantly stepped up its advertising & marketing (A&M) and R&D investments to strengthen its brands and accelerate product innovation. It has significantly increased investments in social and digital marketing campaigns. Advertising and other marketing activities, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $4.1 billion in 2017, up from $3.9 billion in 2015.HurdlesConsumers’ tastes are rapidly shifting from carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) to non-carbonated beverages. Hence, sluggish CSD volumes are a concern for this beverage giant as well as for other nonalcoholic beverage companies such as The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. .Though PepsiCo has increased marketing investments and is driving package and product innovation to boost the carbonated beverage business, no significant improvement has yet been witnessed.

1694,MNST,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) has been aggressively diversifying its business to shift from traditional added-sugar fizzy drinks. It is well known that cola giants like Coca-Cola and rival PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) are seeing declining volumes in established markets such as the United States amid growing health consciousness. This is denting demand for carbonated soft drinks (CSDs), hurting other soft drink makers like Monster Beverage (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group  as well.Among CSDs, the cola segment has been facing the brunt of consumer shift toward alternative beverage offerings. The diet drinks are also under pressure, thanks to increasing consumer awareness regarding the use of artificial sweeteners.Though Coca-Cola has bumped up marketing investments and is driving package and product innovation to boost its carbonated beverage business, these efforts have not brought about any meaningful improvement yet. Sparkling beverage unit case volume was down 1% in 2017, which compares with flat volume in 2016. Sparkling beverage accounted for 69% of the company’s 2017 worldwide unit case volumes.Resultantly, the company’s total sales fell 20% in the last reported quarter, marking the 11th consecutive quarterly decline. Coca-Cola’s shares have also lost 4.3% in the past six months, comparing unfavorably with its industry’s decline of 2.3%. Efforts to Focus Solely on BeverageThe company has been firing on all cylinders to rejuvenate its portfolio. It has ramped up its effort to transform into a total beverage company with a broad, consumer-centric brand portfolio and an asset-light business model.Coca-Cola is pursuing investments in newer revenue platforms to boost long-term sales and profits.  In 2017, the beverage giant made an important addition to its portfolio beyond sparkling soft drinks with the acquisition of Topo Chico premium sparkling mineral water brand in the United States. Also, it entered the fast-growing U.S. ready-to-drink coffee category last year and closed the proposed acquisition of AdeS soy-based beverage business.Importantly, the beverage giant has launched Coca-Cola Zero Sugar in 20 markets, with a reformulated product, evolved marketing, new packaging and upgraded execution. This product has been contributing to revenues in the United States since its launch in the third quarter of 2017.Recently, Coca-Cola ventured into the liquor space with the plan to introduce an alcoholic drink in Japan. The company launched its first-ever alcoholic drink — Chu-Hi — made with a distilled Japanese beverage (shocho), sparkling water and flavoring.Massive Refranchising for Higher ReturnsCoca-Cola is in transition, moving away from being a capital-intensive organization. In 2017, the company achieved major milestones by fully refranchising bottling system in the United States. Its refranchising plans will help it focus on building its core brands and reduce its exposure to the low-margin, capital-intensive bottling operations.Though this effort has been impacting sales/profits adversely, it will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending, and improved return on invested capital over the long term.Cost Saving to Boost Bottom LineThe company has initiated a productivity and reinvestment program to boost profits. These initiatives include restructuring the global supply chain including optimization of the manufacturing footprint in North America, investing in technology to streamline operations, implementing a zero-based budgeting program, headcount reduction and driving increased efficiency in direct marketing investments. Currently, the company plans to save $3.8 billion by 2019.These initiatives are helping the company to come up with better numbers. In the fourth quarter of 2017, despite reporting flat soda volumes, the cola giant gained from its growing beverage portfolio and re-structuring efforts. Organic revenues grew 6% on growth across the board, driven by price/mix growth of 4% and concentrate sales growth of 1%. Again, lower SG&A expenses (down 21%), higher gross margin (up 480 basis points or bps) and higher operating margin (up 540 bps) helped it come up with better numbers.Constant endeavors to foray into the other alternative beverage space, restructuring and productivity efforts are expected to lift revenues as well as profits for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. Earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019 have moved up 3.5% and 4.1%, respectively, over the last 30 days, indicating analysts’ optimism on the stock.

1696,MNST,"Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 numbers on Feb 28, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company’s earnings met analysts’ expectation. The company managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 4.33%.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to drive Monster Beverage’s fourth-quarter 2017 results.Factors at PlayProduct innovation plays a major role in driving revenues. The company’s net sales grew 11.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2017. The upside can be attributed to a wide portfolio of energy drink brands that has been experiencing solid demand in domestic and international markets. The trend is expected to continue in the upcoming quarter.Sales in the Monster Energy Drinks segment improved 11.6% in the first nine months of 2017. The segment accounts for 90% of total sales. Due to growing health awareness, consumers are particularly cautious about the use of artificial sweeteners and high sugar content products. As a result, the broader carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category has been suffering for the last few years. However, energy drinks constitute one of the few sub-categories that continue to gain momentum. Therefore, a portfolio based on energy drinks will drive the company’s top line.Notably, the company's strategic deal with notable brands bolstered its portfolio and strengthened presence in the international energy drinks market. The Strategic Brands segment, which includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), improved more than 10% in the first nine months 2017. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Monster Beverage’s sales and profits have been dented significantly by unfavorable currency translations. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected net sales in the Monster Energy Drinks segment by approximately $13.4 million in the first nine months of 2017.Distributor termination expenses are likely to dampen the company’s profits to some extent. It has been transitioning from third-party distributors to Coca-Cola’s distribution network following a strategic deal.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $841.5 million, reflecting an increase of 11.6% year over year. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for earnings is 37 cents, implying 5.7% year-over-year growth.Quantitative Model PredictionMonster Beverage has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which increases the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Monster Beverage has an Earnings ESP of +3.40%.

1699,MNST,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2017 results, ending the year on an impressive note.

1702,MNST,"The world’s largest and the ultra-popular large cap ETF, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, has been enjoying its strong asset accumulation on the completion of its 25th anniversary. This is because it has become the first ETF with $300 billion in AUM. Though SPY’s inception date is Jan 22, 1993, it officially debuted on the American Stock Exchange on Jan 29, 1993 (read: Amazing ETF Strategies for Skyrocketing Markets).Inside The ETFSPY tracks the S&P 500 index and holds 505 stocks in its basket, with each security holding no more than 3.62%. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration.About one-fourth of the portfolio is tilted toward the information technology sector, which has fully emerged from the burst of the dot-com bubble and is flying higher in the current bullish market. Moreover, financials, health care, consumer discretionary and industrials, each of which accounts for a double-digit exposure, are also performing remarkably well.The ETF charges 9 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in heavy volume of 71.6 million shares a day on average. This ensures higher liquidity with a tight bid/ask spread, leading to lower trading costs for investors (see: all the Large Cap ETFs here).Factors Driving SPYThe U.S. stock market is in the midst of the second-longest bull run in history. Encouraging domestic and international fundamentals as well as better-than-expected corporate earnings are the major catalysts. This, coupled with Trump’s pro-growth agenda aimed at accelerating economic growth, reducing regulation, increasing spending, slashing taxes, and boosting jobs and corporate profits, are bolstering optimism in the economy.Since Trump’s win, the stock market rally has been the fourth largest since 1936, according to Goldman Sachs. Per Sam Stovall of CFRA Research, the S&P 500 rally during Trump’s first year is the third best since World War II, behind only President George H. W. Bush and President John F. Kennedy (read: Trump's First Year in Office: 5 Must-See ETF Charts).Further, a combination of other factors like rise in oil prices, a weak dollar and rounds of upbeat global economic data have bolstered the appetite for riskier assets in recent months. Good news flowing despite the global trade fears, political instability in Washington and geopolitical tension.As a result, SPY generated more than 545% returns over the past 25 years and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.

Reported revenues came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.42 billion by 1.1%.Excluding the impact of Fx, revenues increased 1.7% on an organic basis, primarily driven by higher demand for beverages/food/snacks in the Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA), Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA) and Latin America segments. Notably, organic sales growth was softer than the 3.1% rise recorded in the previous quarter.Total volumes declined 1% during the quarter against flat growth in the previous quarter.

1704,MNST,"Sales for beverage giant PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) have remained subdued in recent quarters due to growing health and wellness consciousness as well as currency headwinds. PepsiCo’s shares have evidently sunk approximately 4% in the last three months. Nonetheless, the company is leaving no stone unturned to reinvigorate investors’ confidence and regain its footing by innovations and diversifications.Key Growth DriversPepsiCo’s distinctiveness in the soft drinks space lies in the fact that it holds a balanced portfolio of both snacks and beverages, which are complementary food categories. Salty snacks and liquid refreshment beverages have extremely high co-purchase incidence more than any other commonly purchased items. The complementary portfolio results in cost leverage, capability sharing, cross-category promotions and other commercial benefits.Changing demographics and purchasing behaviors make it important for any beverage giant to understand and capitalize on main consumer insights that identify growing trends. Health awareness has been prime concern for consumers in recent times and capitalizing on this trend can prove to be beneficial for any beverage company in 2017.For this, PepsiCo is gradually reshuffling its portfolio toward healthier “Everyday Nutrition Products.” These products contain nutrients such as grains, fruits, vegetables, or protein, and the portfolio falls under a broader category of “Guilt Free Products."" The company now generates 45% of its revenues from this category, which also comprises beverages with less sugar and sodium content.Now, good-for-you products and bottled water are gradually gaining traction amid the shift in consumers’ preferences. Coconut water has become a prime alternative to coolers across North America and Europe. Consequently, in North America, the company launched LIFEWTR in Jan 2017, a premium bottled water, PH balanced, with electrolytes for added taste. Again, in 2016, PepsiCo acquired a sparkling probiotic U.S. drinks company, KeVita, thereby diversifying its soft drinks portfolio amid slowing soda sales. The addition of KeVita will expand PepsiCo’s health and wellness offerings in the premium chilled beverage space.Furthermore, the company has stepped up productivity and cost-saving initiatives to boost profitability by reducing overall costs.Importantly, to preserve investors’ confidence in the stock, PepsiCo has increased dividend for 45 consecutive years that includes a dividend hike of 7% in 2017.ChallengesIt goes without saying that consumer tastes are rapidly shifting from carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) to non-carbonated beverages. Hence, sluggish CSD volumes are pressing concerns for this beverage giant as well as for other nonalcoholic beverage companies such as The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. .Though PepsiCo has increased marketing investments and is driving package and product innovation to boost the carbonated beverage business, no meaningful improvement has been seen yet. The company’s CSD volumes were down 2.5% in the second quarter of 2017.Meanwhile, foreign exchange (Fx) is a major headwind for PepsiCo with around 39% of its revenues coming from outside the United States. Though the company now anticipates Fx to have less negative impact on core earnings than previously expected, it is expected to hurt 2017 revenues and earnings per share by 2%.Bottom LineGoing forward, we expect the company's efforts toward offering more products with less sodium, sugar and saturated fat, along with productivity and cost-cutting initiatives will help fight revenue woes.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1705,MNST,"Monster Beverage Corporation’s (MNST  -  Free Report) strong product portfolio, strategic deal with The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) and focus on innovation are encouraging.Monster Beverage offers a wide range of products under the energy drinks category. Energy drinks constitute one of the few sub-categories that continue to gain momentum. Net sales at the segment, comprising Monster Energy drinks as well as Mutant Super Soda drinks, increased 9.6% in 2016 and 8.7% in the first half of 2017. Thus, a portfolio based on energy drinks should continue to drive the company’s top line.Product innovation plays a huge role in the company’s success. There is consistent demand for new products that are appetizing as well as healthy. The company regularly introduces new flavors of existing products, while removing non-performing ones.Monster Beverage launched a number of products in the first half of 2017 and has several new products lined up for launch in the remaining of 2017. In April, the company launched a Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink in Great Britain, followed by launches in 21 European markets in the second quarter of 2017 and South Africa in July 2017. Notably, these new products will benefit from the broader distribution network from the deal.Also, Monster Beverage’s products enjoy greater exposure, courtesy of the strategic deal with Coca-Cola. Under the strategic deal, Coca-Cola and its bottling partners will act as Monster Beverage's preferred distribution partner globally. The company’s cash balance also received a major boost from the deal. The deal provides Monster Beverage full access to Coca-Cola’s world-class global distribution network. Monster Beverage generated 26% of its net sales outside the United States in the first half of 2017.ChallengesSoftness in the beverage industry and unfavorable currency translations raise concerns. The soft drink industry has been facing the brunt of shift in consumer preference toward healthier options. This changing preference is impacting the volumes of beverage companies like Monster Beverage, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc .Moreover, though the U.S. dollar has recently softened against other currencies, the impact is still significant. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected net sales at the Monster Energy Drinks segment by $12.9 million in the first half of 2017.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1706,MNST,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) has a possibility to take over the renowned energy drink maker Monster Beverage Corp. (MNST  -  Free Report), according to founder of The Street, Jim Cramer. Meanwhile, Monster Beverage’s shares scaled a new 52-week high of $56.44 on Aug 31, finally ending the day’s trading a tad lower at $55.82.Coca-Cola had already acquired a 16.7% stake in Monster Beverage on Jun 12, 2015. Hence, according to Cramer, Monster Beverage is a possible buyout choice for Coca-Cola as the company has also been focusing on portfolio expansion in order to gain a competitive edge in the U.S. beverage space.Furthermore, Coca-Cola’s new CEO, James Quincey is known for his motivation in expanding the company’s brand through acquisitions.In the U.S. beverage space, Coca-Cola along with other major soft drink makers like Pepsico, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  have been facing carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category headwinds for some time now.Cross-category competition and growing health and wellness consciousness have resulted in a drastic shift in consumer demand toward healthier beverages like energy drinks, tea juices and flavored waters. Consumer’s watchfulness over the use of artificial sweeteners and high sugar content has dented sales for companies belonging to the beverage industry.In fact, Coca-Cola’s second-quarter 2017 revenues declined 16% year over year to $9.7 billion, marking the ninth consecutive quarterly decline in revenues.Year to date, shares of Coca-Cola have underperformed the industry. The company’s shares have rallied 9.8% as compared with the industry’s 14.1% gain.Notably, new taxes levied on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressure are affecting CSD sales for Coca-Cola. In order to navigate such challenges, it is necessary for the company to diversify its portfolio by tacking on other healthier energy drink makers like Monster Beverage.Monster Beverage drinks are healthier options and keeps up with changing consumer preferences. New innovative mutant soft drink, known as “super soda,” has considerably drove revenues and profits in the last quarter from the year-ago quarter for Monster Beverage.However, Coca-Cola’s strategic efforts in enhancing its portfolio as a total beverage company are encouraging. Takeover of Monster Beverage can therefore prove beneficial in terms of revenue growth for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

1708,MNST,"Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Aug 8, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.13%. However, the company managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 0.82%.The chart below depicts the surprise history.Monster Beverage Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Monster Beverage Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Monster Beverage Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayA look at estimate revisions gives us an idea of analyst expectations right before a company’s earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share remained stable over the past 30 days at 40 cents. This reflects a year-over-year increase of 20.2%.This double-digit expected earnings growth is likely to be driven by higher sales banking on innovations, solid demand for the company’s energy drink brands and expansion into new markets.Product innovation plays a major role in the company’s success. The company regularly introduces new flavors of existing products, while removing non-performing products. Again, the company's strategic deal with The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) expanded its portfolio with notable brands with increased presence in the international energy drinks market. This addition has been boosting the company’s sales and such a trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.However, Monster Beverage’s sales and profits have been dented significantly by unfavorable currency translations. Although the U.S. dollar has recently softened against other currencies, the impact is still significant. Expenses associated with expansion, such as higher payroll expenses, are also likely to impact the company’s profitability.Distributor termination expenses too might affect the company’s bottom line. The company has been transitioning from third-party distributors to Coca-Cola’s distribution network following the strategic deal with Coca-Cola.Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $906.6 million for the said quarter, reflecting an increase of 9.6% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Monster Beverage is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Monster Beverage’s Earnings ESP is 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 40 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Monster Beverage’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP.

1709,MNST,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected second-quarter 2017 results. Innocent juice and smoothie business in Europe, organic revenue growth in sparkling soft drinks, led by innovation in and marketing support for its low and no-sugar options like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar have helped it in coming up with better numbers.Earnings BeatSecond-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of the company were 59 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents by 3.5%.Earnings, however, decreased 1.7% year over year due to currency headwinds as well as higher costs associated with refranchising efforts.Sales DiscussionNet revenue declined 16% year over year to $9.7 billion due to currency headwinds and negative impact of structural items, marking the ninth consecutive quarterly decline in revenues. Currency headwinds hurt sales by 2%.Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had a 17% impact on revenues, partly offset by 3% positive contribution of price/mix.Revenues marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.71 billion.MarginsAdjusted consolidated gross margins expanded 210 basis points (bps) year over year to 62.6%, as currency headwinds were offset by positive pricing and productivity gains.The company’s comparable operating margin grew 370 bps to 30.2% in the quarter.Comparable income before income tax was down 1.3% to $3.35 billion.The structural changes primarily include the impact of bottler refranchising efforts.Volume and PricingCoca-Cola’s total unit case volume remained unchanged with no growth in the quarter (similar to the preceding quarter), which included positive performance in four of the five category clusters. Unit case volume continued to be impacted by macroeconomic headwinds in some Latin American markets. Brazil and Venezuela accounted for more than 1% drag on consolidated unit case volume growth.From a market segmentation viewpoint, the company’s developed markets delivered 1% unit case volume growth, led by Mexico and Spain.Sparkling beverage unit case volume remained unchanged; Juice, dairy, and plant-based beverages saw 3% growth; Water, enhanced water, and sports drinks were up 1%; and Tea and Coffee was up 2%.Price/mix increased 3%, similar to the previous quarter.2017 GuidanceOrganic revenues are expected to rise 3%.

1710,MNST,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the cola giant delivered a negative earnings surprise of 2.27%.However, Coca-Cola surpassed earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters, with an average surprise of 1.51%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayCoca-Cola’s first-quarter revenues declined 11% year over year due to currency headwinds and negative impact of structural items. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had a 10% impact on revenues, while currency headwinds hurt sales by 1%. The company’s soon-to-be reported quarter is also expected to be adversely impacted by 17–18% in net revenue from acquisitions, divestitures, and other structural items. The company also expects currency headwinds to hurt the quarterly net revenues by 1–2%.The company’s revenues declined for the last eight consecutive quarters primarily due to weak volumes especially in the sparkling beverage category. Coca-Cola has been struggling to boost sales amid weak demand in certain emerging and developing markets and shift in consumer preference.That said, Coca-Cola is taking aggressive cost-cutting and strategic measures to mitigate the impact of lower sales and weak volumes. Adjusted consolidated gross margins expanded 120 basis points (bps) year over year to 61.3% in the first quarter of 2017, as currency headwinds were offset by positive pricing and productivity gains. We expect to witness similar trends in the to-be reported quarter as well.Coming to the company’s bottom line, i.e. EPS, Coca-Cola’s earnings decreased 4.4% in the first quarter 2017. The downside was primarily due to higher interest expenses, resulting from additional long-term debt issued in the quarter as well as in the second and third quarters of 2016. Coca-Cola’s first quarter of 2017 interest expenses were also higher due to interest rate swaps on the company’s fixed-rate debt.As revealed earlier, Coca-Cola expects net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and other structural items to have a headwind of 3–4% on profits before taxes in the to-be-reported quarter. Currency fluctuations are anticipated to have an adverse impact of 3% on quarterly profits before taxes. However, we feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support bottom line to some extent.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 58 cents, reflecting a 4.1% year-over-year decrease. Meanwhile, the projected sales growth for the current year is pegged at $9.75 billion, implying a 15.5% decrease.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Coca-Cola is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -1.72%.

1711,MNST,"In last week's edition of Trading Tools, payroll provider  Paychex  (PAYX  -  Free Report) was featured as it showed up on the  Zacks Most Active Options filter.  Using the same screener this week, another company caught my eye: beverage maker  Hansen's Natural  (HANS). First, let's take a minute to delve into the background behind our contrarian stance. We are looking for situations where there is heavy skepticism toward an outperforming stock. On the other hand, we typically like to see optimism toward an underperformer. In our eyes, too much optimism is a sign that nearly everyone who wants to invest in a particular stock already has. Just because a stock sees substantial optimism doesn't mean that we will blindly short that particular security; we need to see some negative price action or a major catalyst for a downside move in order to pull the trigger in most cases. Indicators we use to measure overall sentiment include option open interest, short interest, magazine cover stories, media comments, and analyst ratings.  This Company's Got Energy

1712,MNST,"As stated earlier, Hansen's is a producer of natural beverages, including sodas, smoothies, and a plethora of energy drinks, including Monster Energy ®. The Corona, California-based beverage maker was ranked number-1 on Forbes' Top 200 Best Small-Cap Companies in 2005.  Bears Bubble Over 
"
1713,MNST,"Turning back to our handy-dandy custom screener, HANS stuck out like sore thumb on the Most Active Puts list, as most of the tickers belonged to various exchange-traded funds (ETF) and financial firms. However, the stock's March 55 put (QHO OK) made the cut, trading nearly 10,500 contracts across all six exchanges on Thursday. However, it looks like positions were liquidated, as open interest at this strike dropped overnight from 11,300 to 6,242 contracts. This isn't too surprising considering that March options expire after the close on Thursday, March 20. 
"
1714,MNST,"Regardless, near-term put open interest outweighs its call counterparts, as the equity's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) docks at 1.42. Peak put open interest in the front-month series resides at the in-the-money March 40 strike, home to approximately 7,000 contracts, with the aforementioned March 55 strike coming in a close second.  Testing Support 
"
1715,MNST,"Technically speaking, the stock enjoyed a steep uptrend for several years before reaching an all-time high of $68.40 in October 2007. The stock has since pulled back and currently finds itself locked in a sideways channel between resistance at the 50 level and support in the 38 region. Furthermore, the equity is facing overhead resistance at its declining 10-week moving average.  Word on the Street 
"
1716,MNST,"Analysts seem to be hoping for another bounce in the shares; according to Zacks, HANS holds four ""buy"" or better ratings, compared to two ""holds"".  
"
1717,MNST,"On the flip side, short sellers aren't nearly as hopeful as the ranking analysts. Short interest has risen more than 4% since the last recording period, and 16.4% of the stock's float is now sold short. This increase in bearish bets is indicative that those in the short-selling arena expect the stock to fall through its current support line.   The Bottom Line 
"
1718,MNST,"Investors should definitely keep their eyes on the 38-to-40 range, as it's played the part of both support and resistance for nearly three years. The stock's recent consolidation could be dangerous, however, as constant retesting of support can ultimately weaken it. Should the shares of HANS fall through the 38-to-40 range as they did in August 2006, we could see the former area of support act as a layer of resistance. 
"
1719,MNST,"Another thing to be aware of is the sentiment on the Street. Analysts are leaning toward the proverbial bull pen, leaving the stock vulnerable to downgrades. Should HANS fail to stay atop or rebound from its current spot atop support, the optimistic analysts could issue downgrades. Not only that, but short-sellers could be inclined to add to their winning positions, placing additional selling pressure on the shares.

1720,MNST,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report)) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 20, before the market opens. This consumer goods company has exceeded analysts’ expectations for nine consecutive quarters despite lower sales.The company has been struggling to boost sales for the last few years. Weak volumes and slowing market growth along with foreign exchange headwind have been hurting its sales. Soft consumer-spending environment in developed markets, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom, also adds to the worries.The trend is unlikely to change for the to-be-reported quarter. Softness in the United States, United Kingdom and volatility in developing markets is likely to adversely impact Procter & Gamble’s results. In fact, categories in the company’s largest and most profitable market, the United States (accounting for 42% of total net sales in fiscal 2017), grew barely above flat in fiscal fourth-quarter 2017. The U.S. market growth slowed to just above 1% in fiscal 2017 from over 2% in fiscal 2016. Overall, the company expects fiscal 2018 organic sales growth of 2-3%.Importantly, Procter & Gamble expects first quarter to witness the lowest organic sales and core earnings per share (EPS) growth of the year, as the period compares against the highest organic growth base period. Top-line headwinds from portfolio choices and the recent Gillette price reduction in the United States will primarily impact the first half of fiscal-2018 results.Segment Discussion: Fabric & Home Care, comprising about 32% of the total revenues, is expected to get a boost in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fabric & Home Care revenues of $5.4 billion reflect growth of 3.5% sequentially and 1.3% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for Baby, Feminine & Family Care revenues of $4.6 billion indicates an increase of 0.5% from the prior-year quarter.Again, revenues from Beauty segment are expected to increase 2.1% on a year-over-year basis. Health Care revenues will most likely witness 0.9% growth. However, Grooming revenues is likely to register 2.1% year-over-year revenue decline.Here are the other factors that might influence Procter & Gamble’s Q1 results:To counter the tepid sales growth, Procter & Gamble has been benefiting from its ongoing restructuring program aimed at reducing costs and driving efficiency. The company has been taking various restructuring initiatives aimed at generating higher profit and lowering costs. These initiatives have helped the company to accelerate margins growth amid the slowdown in sales.The company’s focus on reducing its SG&A (selling, general, and administrative) costs and lowering its marketing and advertising spending could boost its operating margins in the coming quarters.However, lower pricing owing to increased competition in the shave care category, higher commodity costs, a tough retail environment, an unfavorable mix, and year-over-year comparables are anticipated to continue being a drag in its bottom-line growth rate.For the fiscal first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.07, reflecting an increase of 4.3% year over year. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $16.6 billion, implying a 0.8% growth.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Procter & Gamble has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Procter & Gamble is +0.33%.Zacks Rank: Procter & Gamble carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Procter & Gamble Company (The) QuoteStocks Worth a LookHere are a few consumer staples stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.13% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
