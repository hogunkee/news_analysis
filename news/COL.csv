2,COL,"United Technologies (UTX) pushed back after an activist investor said a split of the underperforming industrial conglomerate would release billions in shareholder value.In a quarterly investor letter Friday, Third Point CEO Dan Loeb argued for breaking United Tech into three business units — elevators, climate control and aerospace. The hedge fund sees such a move reversing years of underperformance; realizing the full potential of the company's franchise assets; and fixing problems for the advanced Geared Turbofan jet engine from United Technologies' Pratt & Whitney unit.The letter spoke of a new ""significant stake"" in the $100 billion industrial giant, which had already been reported in March.United Technologies countered in a statement that it ""disagrees with several of the assertions"" in the Third Point letter, without specifying which. It added a full portfolio review should be completed this year, after the pending acquisition of Rockwell Collins (COL) closes. CEO Greg Hayes has said he is mulling a breakup of core businesses.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

A history of poor management led most recently to the ""botched ramp-up"" of the next-generation geared turbofan (GTF) engine, it said.Some Wall Street analysts expected the GTF to be a profit driver. But problems with the jet engine led to grounded flights and tensions with aircraft maker Airbus (EADSY).Meanwhile, rival jet engine maker General Electric (GE) reports deliveries of its next-gen Leap are behind schedule. A GE unit made the Boeing (BA) jet engine that blew apart midair in April.Some analysts have argued that struggling General Electric should break up.

3,COL,"Is United Technologies (UTX) a more valuable property together or is UTC better off in three separate businesses? That's the question for one of the largest U.S. industrial conglomerates — and an answer should be coming soon, its chief executive said Wednesday.X United Tech's $23 billion megadeal for Rockwell Collins (COL) last year was seen as prelude to a potential breakup of the industrial giant years down the road. As investors digested that hefty price, some hoped that CEO Greg Hayes would separate the aerospace-focused units from the parts of the company that make Carrier air conditioners and Otis elevators.On Wednesday morning, Hayes signaled he's open to all possibilities for United Tech's disparate businesses as a result of a ""great benefit"" from the recently enacted tax reform.""By end of year, we will come back and have some answers in terms of what we really think we should do with the portfolio long term,"" he told the audience at the Barclays Industrials Select Conference in Miami, Florida.""The real question is do you get significant multiple expansion by having separate companies vs. the conglomerate (structure),"" he added, describing aerospace as a $45 billion-$50 billion business that enjoys significant scale, elevators as a $12 billion-$13 billion business and climate-control systems as a $17 billion-$18 billion business.Hayes expects the Rockwell Collins acquisition to close by June or July and add to earnings next year.Under the Trump corporate-tax cuts, United Tech will be able to pay down the Rockwell debt much more quickly than it had anticipated even six months ago, giving it options around the portfolio, he explained. The company has $8 billion in cash overseas and expects to repatriate about $3.5 billion this year, about $2.5 billion more than it had expected.Shares of Connecticut-based United Technologies punched up rallied 2.2% to 129.26 on the stock market today. The Dow Jones component sits 7% below the late January high of 139.24, but found resistance at the 50-day line Wednesday. It has gained 13% over the past year vs. a 20% gain for the Dow Jones industrial average as a whole.Dow peer General Electric (GE), which is mulling a breakup of its own, retreated 1.7% Wednesday. GE shares have lost more than half their value over the past year, with the company mulling a sale of its industrial gas engines business and selling an overseas part of its iconic lighting unit as it tries to remedy a sharp decline in profits. 3M (MMM) fell 1.1% to 232.18.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersThe breakup question for many U.S. multi-industry companies comes as some investors have grown disenchanted with the conglomerate structure.In part, the disenchantment stems from concerns that hoped-for synergies among component businesses have failed to materialize.In September, Hayes had described talk of a corporate breakup as premature, telling The New York Times that United Technologies will need the revenue from all of the combined operations' businesses to pay down debt tied to the Rockwell Collins deal.Hayes pointed out Wednesday that the various businesses within conglomerates benefit from shared back-office services such as payroll and centralized tax systems.""There are, as you can imagine, significant dissynergies with splitting up the portfolio as well as one-time costs,"" he added.Hayes also affirmed at the Miami event that United Tech has resumed production on the geared turbofan engine and expects to ""have wrung out most of the teething issues"" by end of year.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?2018 Stock Market Forecasts: Read The Predictions For Top Stocks And IndustriesHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

4,COL,"THE PENTAGON — The Air Force is canceling a recapitalization of its airborne command and surveillance aircraft, budget documents showed Monday, and plans to retire newer bombers but keep the Cold War-era Boeing (BA) B-52s flying.X The Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System is not funded in the 2019 presidential budget, two days after Defense News reported that the Air Force is canceling the JSTARS program in favor of linking systems together to perform the same tasks.""It's got to be survivable, that is the key. If we recap current JSTARS we have an aircraft that does what it does now,"" Air Force Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget, Maj. Gen. John Pletcher, told reporters. ""It's probably  able to do less because we'll be in a more competitive, contested environment.""Boeing, Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) were leading teams with bids for the $7 billion new aircraft program to replace the current fleet of Northrop  E-8s.The service is unsure what the new family of platforms might look like. Pletcher said it could include putting current sensors on drones like the MQ-9 Reaper or other assets in space or on the ground.The cancellation of the JSTARS recap wasn't a surprise as the Air Force has been critical of the platform since last fall.In November, Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson said the current system of one large plane with a radar system on its belly meets less than 5% of a combatant commander's requirements. But the JSTARS replacement, also envisioned as a large plane, would meet less than 1% of requirements under current threats.This came after Defense Secretary James Mattis said in September that he has talked to the Air Force chief of staff about ""new ways"" to perform a key airborne command and control ""mission.""""Boeing understands the U.S. Air Force has many competing priorities to address within the budget,"" Boeing said in a statement. ""We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force as it defines its path forward.""Boeing, a Dow Jones component, rose 3.3% on the stock market today. Lockheed advanced 1.3%, and Northrop Grumman gained 1.4%.

""We will also continue necessary B-1 and B-2 modifications to keep them relevant until the B-21s come on line.""The decision to keep the older B-52 and not the newer B-1s and B-2s was due to maintenance, total cost and mission capability, according to the Air Force's statement.Overall, the 2019 presidential budget's $686 billion defense spending plan would also give troops a 2.6% pay raise and add 16,400 service members to the ranks.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsThese 5 Defense Contractors Stand Out In Stock Market Correction

5,COL,"Industrial giant General Electric (GE) missed quarterly forecasts early Wednesday, but backed strong earnings guidance, while fellow Dow component United Technologies (UTX) beat views and guided earnings above consensus.X Investors initially cheered the GE news but then its chief financial officer told analysts on a conference call that U.S. regulators are investigating a recently announced insurance charge and its chief executive said the company intends to make further changes to its portfolio, but will continue to exist.""There will be a GE in the future, but it will look different than it does today,"" CEO John Flannery said on the call. His comments followed reports in mid January that GE is open to a big breakup.Estimates: Fourth-quarter earnings to tumble 39% to 28 cents a share, as revenue dips 1% to $32.69 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Last week, GE said it would take a $6.2 billion Q4 charge on its legacy reinsurance business.Results: EPS of 27 cents, excluding the insurance loss, tax cuts and other ""industrial portfolio actions,"" on revenue of $31.4 billion. Total organic equipment orders fell 5%, and organic services orders also dropped 5%.

8,COL,"The American public's first sign that space warfare is being waged won't be giant explosions lighting up the sky or X-Wing fighters crashing to the ground. Instead, everyday conveniences that we take for granted would be disrupted, such as ATMs and streaming videos.X But the world's most powerful military could be crippled if an enemy destroyed or disabled critical space infrastructure as part of a space war. Navigation, guided missiles and missile-warning alerts rely on GPS satellites. Critical intelligence comes from spy satellites. Drones, Navy ships and infantry grunts use communications satellites. And the disruption of your mundane comforts, which increasingly rely on satellite communications, eventually could grind daily life to a halt.""Our entire global economy and our way of life (are) enabled by space capabilities,"" said Col. Shawn Fairhurst, deputy director at Air Force Space Command.Despite the success of American companies like SpaceX in the new space race, the U.S. is more vulnerable than ever to war in space. Russia and China are ramping up their offensive potential. And while the effects of space warfare on worldwide commerce would hurt the U.S. and its adversaries alike, the U.S. military's unmatched global footprint and forward-deployed posture mean it is especially dependent on space-based assets.IBD'S TAKE: A new Space Age is dawning as billionaires like Elon Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos look to explore deeper into the final frontier and make space exploration and commercial development more affordable.  So what was once a key enabler of U.S. dominance – famously on display during the first Gulf War when precision weapons and space-based imaging left the world awe-struck – is becoming a channel that adversaries can exploit to gain the upper hand.Russia and China ""are building those capabilities to challenge the United States of America, to challenge our allies and to change the balance of power in the world,"" Gen. John Hyten, the head of U.S. Strategic Command, said at the Reagan National Defense Forum in December. ""We cannot allow that to happen.""On Feb. 21, Susan Gordon, the principal deputy director of national intelligence, warned that China and Russia have laser weapons designed to damage space-based sensors. Two days later, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein predicted that it will only be ""a matter of years"" before space warfare is waged.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportAmid the growing alarm about a war in space, the Pentagon plans to pour more money into space capabilities. Companies like Boeing (BA), Northrop Grumman (NOC), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) — which make rockets, satellites and other space assets — are poised to receive those dollars.Space was once seen as a sanctuary from military activity, even as it served as a stage for Cold War bragging rights. The Outer Space Treaty, enacted in 1967, outlaws the use of nuclear weapons in space and prohibits testing weapons or building military bases on the moon or other celestial bodies. Since then, satellites have enveloped the planet, while the International Space Station has been maintained as a sign of global scientific cooperation.But China and Russia have made no secret of their space warfare ambitions and could have anti-satellite weapons ready for combat in the next few years, according to the latest threat assessment report from the U.S. intelligence community, released Feb. 13.The threat has been growing for years. In 2007, China shocked the world when it fired a ground-based missile to destroy an old weather satellite in what was widely seen as a test of an anti-satellite system.Last month's U.S. intelligence report said China has been training with such ground-based anti-satellite missiles, and Russia is developing similar technology.Blowing up a satellite carries risks for the attacker, as it would create a massive debris field of perhaps 10,000 pieces and could put its own satellites in jeopardy too.But the intelligence report noted less blunt methods, such as Russia's ""experiment satellites"" now in orbit. These satellites have official missions like inspection, refueling and repair, but could be turned into weapons that stop short of destroying their targets.China has a satellite with an extendable robotic arm that it says can be used to collect space junk but likely can also be used to cripple working satellites. And Russia reportedly has highly maneuverable satellites secretly launched into orbit in 2015 that can be used to bump into other satellites.The U.S. isn't helpless. It has potentially dual-use technology that could be given offensive missions too. Satellites that can dock with existing satellites to refuel them could be turned into weapons by ordering them to bump enemy satellites out of orbit or equipping them with jammers or lasers, says Theresa Hitchens, senior research associate at the University of Maryland's Center for International and Security Studies. China has been working on similar technology.Northrop also provides anti-jamming capabilities but warns that ""only a very small amount of defense satellite communications are secure and protected against intercept and jamming threats."" The company declined to provide additional information about its anti-jamming and other defense capabilities for military or commercial satellites.Besides active defenses, the U.S. can make individual satellites less appealing as targets during a war in space.One way would be building large satellites used by many nations, so any attack would be seen as aggression against a potential coalition. Another way would be to develop more maneuverable satellites that could avoid collisions from other satellites, missiles or space debris.The military is also looking at deploying greater quantities of smaller satellites that spread out capabilities, instead of the current model of building large satellites that make ""juicy targets,"" according to Hyten.The U.S. can employ ground-based jammers, but they are only effective when the targeted satellite is in range. Lasers could also be used to temporarily blind or permanently disable a satellite, but the technology isn't mature enough yet to be effective against a large satellite.The bottom line is that the U.S. has much more to lose in space combat than its adversaries do.""We don't have good options for fighting back because this is an asymmetrical situation,"" as potential adversaries aren't as reliant on space systems, Hitchens said. ""It's not a tit-for-tat thing like it is for nuclear weapons.""Policymakers are aware of the threat and are working to address it. The National Defense Strategy released in January emphasized the need to ""prioritize investments in resilience, reconstitution, and operations to assure our space capabilities"" as ""attacks against our critical defense, government, and economic infrastructure must be anticipated.""In its fiscal 2019 budget request, the Air Force is seeking an 8% increase in space funding, the second straight year of significant increases to the space portfolio. The budget focuses on building more jam-resistant GPS satellites, while improving systems for missile warnings and situational awareness in space.Perhaps just as important as more funding and hardware is figuring out what kind of response an attack would merit. With no established norms of space warfare, it may be difficult to prevent an attack from spiraling out of control.For example, China could use an anti-satellite missile as a warning shot to tell the U.S. to back down and de-escalate a situation, Hitchens says. But the result could be the exact opposite. The U.S. could see the move as a sign of aggression and attack the missile's launch site, escalating the situation into an attack on the Chinese homeland.Another wrinkle is the fast-growing commercial space industry, with SpaceX showing it can deliver large military and spy satellites via its new Falcon Heavy rocket. SpaceX, Boeing and OneWeb are among the numerous companies with plans to launch thousands of satellites into low Earth orbit in the coming years.The new constellations about to enter space would provide space-based internet services as well as surveillance and tracking. Such capabilities are useful to companies that want to keep tabs on shipping fleets, but in theory they could help the military too.""If a commercial system is being deliberately used to provide the military with capabilities, in the time of war it's a legitimate target,"" Hitchens said.So what happens if China and Russia use their space assets on a commercial satellite? Is that an act of war?""That is a policy issue that is being actively discussed,"" said Stephen Flanagan, a senior political analyst at Rand Corp.While outer space is itself a vacuum, any fight there won't happen in a vacuum.Fairhurst says a war won't likely start in space. Instead, wars that start on the ground or at sea would extend into space.So options range from economic sanctions to a proportional response in a different domain, like an air- or ground-based attack.""We aren't locked into an answer,"" Fairhurst said. ""But the bottom line is that as a nation we have a right to defend ourselves if attacked. And just because we are attacked in space doesn't mean we have to respond in space.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Boeing And Apple Could Build A Parallel Internet In SpaceSpace Industry News And Top Aerospace StocksDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsIn This Space Race, Here's Where SpaceX May Not Come In First

9,COL,"General Electric (GE) is leaning toward a breakup, with a decision expected as soon as this spring, sources told CNBC Tuesday.X The report followed an announcement from the industrial giant earlier in the day that it would take a $6.2 billion Q4 charge on its legacy reinsurance business as well as comments from CEO John Flannery that the charge and results from the past several years ""only further my belief that we need to continue to move with purpose to reshape GE.""""We are looking aggressively at the best structure or structures for our portfolio to maximize the potential of our businesses,"" he said on a conference call, according to Bloomberg. A review ""could result in many, many different permutations, including separately traded assets really in any one of our units, if that's what made sense.""GE has already announced plans to shed $20 billion in assets and narrow its scope to just three businesses: aviation, power systems and health care, which together account for majority of GE's industrial revenue and profits.But that plan was widely panned after its was unveiled in November and failed to halt the stock's free fall, which was worsened by GE's halving of its dividend to conserve capital.GE shares were down 3.3% at 18.14 on the stock market today, falling back below their 50-day moving average after a two-week rally. Siemens (SIEGY) and Honeywell (HON), which have also taken steps to slim down recently, were up 0.7% and down 0.7%, respectively. United Technologies (UTX), which is acquiring Rockwell Collins (COL), lost 1.9%.IBD'S TAKE: This Dow giant just hit a buy zone on its 2018 outlook. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.GE also announced Tuesday that its GE Capital unit expects to make statutory reserve contributions, to fill a shortfall in the insurance portfolio, of about $15 billion over seven years. It will contribute about $3 billion in the first quarter of 2018 and roughly $2 billion each following year through 2024. To fund that, GE Capital will suspend dividends to GE for the foreseeable future.GE said the review and reserve testing, conducted with the help of outside experts, were tied to long-term-care policies reinsured by GE Capital's runoff insurance business, North American Life & Health. The moves will help restore GE Capital ratios to appropriate levels, he added, noting that the unit plays a key role in helping finance GE's portfolio of industrial products.""At a time when we are moving forward as a company, a charge of this magnitude from a legacy insurance portfolio in runoff for more than a decade is deeply disappointing,"" Flannery, who assumed the role of chief executive in August, said.Deutsche Bank research analyst John Inch flagged GE insurance risks in a Jan. 5 note. He noted that GE spun off Genworth, a big player in traditional long-term-care insurance, in May 2004, but the company has struggled with negative claims tied to its long-term-care portfolio since at least 2014.""Perhaps surprising to many, GE retained substantial long-term-care insurance policies that are now expected to cost the company billions of dollars,"" he wrote. In light of GE's cash crunch, he wondered if GE's insurance woes offer a clue as to why the company is pursuing the divestitures of its rail and prospectively Baker Hughes (BHGE) units ""at a potentially less than optimal time"" from a cyclical perspective.MORE YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:These 5 Top Tech Stocks Are Near Buys With Strong RS LinesStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksHow To Find The Best Stocks Before They Break Out

10,COL,"General Electric (GE) may have been nudged by a major shareholder to consider a breakup, which the industrial giant signaled Tuesday is an option while announcing a multibillion-dollar hit from a legacy long-term-care insurance business.X Activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management is pushing the 125-year old industrial giant to explore possible sales or spin-outs of its sprawling businesses — including those in the core health and power segments, The New York Post said late Tuesday citing unnamed sources.Trian's founding partner Ed Garden, who also serves on the GE board, reportedly has been meeting with GE chief John Flannery recently. Trian declined to comment to the Post.""We are looking aggressively at the best structure or structures for our portfolio to maximize the potential of our businesses,"" Flannery said Tuesday in a call with analysts. He added ""separately traded assets really in any one of our units"" was an option. As recently as November, GE had said it would keep its key power, aviation and health care businesses even as it looks to exit several others.Trian has seen its stake in the Dow stock drastically dwindle in value since first making a hefty $2.5 billion investment in 2015, which the Post suggested came at the behest of former CEO Jeff Immelt. Trian bought GE at $26 per share. GE shares dived 4.7% to 17.35 on the stock market today, surrendering the last of their 2018 gains. GE hit 17.26 intraday,  just above a six-year low of 17.25 from Dec. 28.Among GE's industrial conglomerate peers, Siemens (SIEGY) and Honeywell (HON), which are also slimming down portfolios, were up 3 cents and 0.3%, respectively. Fellow Dow member United Technologies (UTX), which is acquiring Rockwell Collins (COL), edged up 0.3%.IBD'S TAKE: This Dow giant hit a buy zone on its 2018 outlook. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Trian delivered a 4% return in 2017, lower than most of its hedge-fund peers, the Post said, attributing that performance to GE.The firm was seen to back the exit of Immelt and pushed for deeper restructuring, but Garden voiced support for Flannery while gaining a board seat late last year.Trian both demands change at companies and collaborates behind the scenes with management to turn troubled businesses around.GE did not respond to an IBD request for comment on the Post story.MORE YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Chip-Gear Stocks Rock On These 2 Upbeat Earnings ReportsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksHow To Find The Best Stocks Before They Break Out

11,COL,"The stock market uptrend continued on its merry way Thursday, one day after the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 marked a distribution day.X The Dow Jones industrial average outperformed in afternoon trading with a 0.9% gain. The blue-chip index offered up plenty of strong price performers, including United Technologies (UTX). The industrial conglomerate jumped back above its 50-day moving average, rising 3% in heavy volume. Last year, the company announced plans to acquire avionics firm Rockwell Collins (COL) for $23 billion. Many view the deal as a prelude to a breakup of United Technologies due to disparate businesses, including Carrier air conditioners and Otis elevators.General Electric (GE), Caterpillar (CAT) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) were other top performers in the Dow, rising more than 2%.Oil and gas stocks outperformed as April U.S. crude oil futures jumped 2.2% to $63.03 a barrel. Strength was fueled by a U.S. government report that showed an unexpected drop in supplies. IBD's Drilling, Machinery/Equipment and Exploration/Production groups outperformed, with gains ranging from 2.5% to 4.5%.The S&P 500 added 0.5% and the Nasdaq composite picked up 0.2%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking slightly higher than Wednesday's levels in the stock market today. A 0.2% decline for the Nasdaq really didn't have the feel of distribution, or institutional selling, but the index gave back a lot of ground after rising about 1% early.Heavy-volume gainers Thursday included Green Dot (GDOT). Shares jumped nearly 10% to 66.07. The stock gapped out of a consolidation with a conventional entry at 65.98 after reporting another strong quarter late Wednesday. Green Dot's business is reloadable prepaid debit cards.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersSmall-cap enterprise software name Five9 (FIVN) also broke out from a shallow, cup-shaped base with a 27.91 entry. Shares popped 12.5% to 30.36 on news adjusted profit soared 600% from the year-ago quarter. Sales rose 25% to $55.4 million.Inside the IBD 50, retailers Floor & Decor (FND) and Five Below (FIVE) showed gains of 2% and 1%, respectively. Floor & Decor is battling to reclaim its 50-day line ahead of its March 1 earnings report. Five Below is back above the 50-day line as it works on a potential base.On the downside, Roku (ROKU) crashed 18% to 41.60. Earnings and sales topped expectations, but sales guidance for the current quarter disappointed. Roku went public in late September at 14.Snap (SNAP), meanwhile, swooned 7% to 17.27 as it retests a prior buy point of 16.98. Shares gapped up powerfully Feb. 7, helped by an earnings beat and strong sales growth, but a large number of users are unhappy with a recent redesign of the app. A couple of recent analyst downgrades to sell hasn't helped matters.RELATED:Zebra Technologies Stock Soars On Fourth-Quarter Earnings Report Grubhub Price Target Raised On Optimism Over Yum Brands Deal Best Stocks To Buy And WatchHow To Invest In The Stock Market Using A Simple Routine

12,COL,"Friday proved to be an unusual session as growth-style stocks and income-type utilities rallied nearly in lockstep amid a broad late-afternoon advance in the stock market today.XMeanwhile, members of the aerospace and defense industry group continue to have a hot start in 2018. IBD's Aerospace/Defense industry group has vaulted 6.7% year to date, vs. a less than 2% gain for the S&P 500, amid news reported by IBD that the Air Force is rushing to build a next-generation fighter jet.Lockheed Martin (LMT), which found nice support at the rising 50-day moving average during the fast slide in stocks in early February, gained 0.5% to 357.34. That extends the military jet and warfare systems giant's advance from a breakout past an eight-week flat base at 322.29 to nearly 11%.Lockheed pays a quarterly cash dividend of $2 per share, giving the stock an annualized yield of 2.3%. That's better than the 1.7% yield for the S&P 500.Meanwhile, at least 10 additional companies in the same industry group hold a Composite Rating of 90 or higher on a scale of 1 to 99, including Teledyne Tech (TDY), Heico (HEI), Curtiss-Wright (CW), Rockwell Collins (COL), Spirit Aerosystems (SPR), Huntington Ingalls (HII), General Dynamics (GD) and KLX (KLXI).You can compare all of the IBD Ratings of each of these stocks with peers in the same industry group by using Stock Checkup to speed your fundamental analysis. Focus on those with rising relative strength lines, which are painted in blue in all IBD charts. A fast-rising RS line means a stock is sharply outperforming the S&P 500.At 3 p.m. ET, the Dow utility average shot more than 2.2% higher, beating gains of 1.3% to 1.5% for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite. The Dow Jones industrial average gained nearly 0.6% as 12 of the 30 components rallied 1 point or more.The Dow utilities group is a big laggard so far in 2018, falling as much as 17% below its December peak of 778. Yet these dividend-rich defensive plays are getting relief from reports that members of the Federal Reserve's FOMC policy board are hinting at a continued ""go slow"" approach toward raising the cost of money.While a quarter-point hike in the short-term fed funds rate is likely in the bag during next month's meeting on interest rates, futures traders still see less than a 40% chance that, by year's end, the Fed would raise the fed funds rate by more than three times. The current target range is 1.25%-1.5%, and the majority of futures traders tracked by CME Group see the range rising to 2%-2.25%.That rate would still be much lower than the expected 12-month forward earnings yield of the S&P 500, which is around 5% to 5.5%, depending on which Wall Street investment strategist you trust.Meanwhile, investors bought back long-term bonds. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond edged down to 2.88%. Earlier in the week, the yield hit as high as 2.95%, creeping closer to the January 2014 peak of 3.04%, a key psychological level for institutional investors.Going back to the military supplier group, Huntington Ingalls recently broke out of a three-month flat base with a 253.54 buy point. The 5% buy zone goes up to 266.22.Notice on the submarine and Navy class destroyer builder's daily chart that Huntington's relative strength line has ascended into new high ground, a bullish sign.KLX is finding buying support at the 50-day moving average for the second time since its breakout from a cup-shaped base at 54.50 on Oct. 3.The first and second pullbacks to the 50-day or 10-week line can offer a timely entry to establish a new position in a leading stock or to add a small amount of shares to a winning core position.Among the FAANG stocks, Google search engine operator Alphabet (GOOGL) looked poised to finish a second straight week up. The internet content titan is up just 0.5% to 1,115.40, but Friday's advance is the eighth in 10 sessions. The stock is also up more than 2.5% for the week.Like the Nasdaq itself, Alphabet has turned in an impressive rebound after tickling its 200-day moving average Feb. 9.See on a daily chart how the megacap tech ($775 billion in market value, which is share price times shares outstanding) bounced sharply off its intraday low on Feb. 9, then finished up big in whale-like volume. That's bullish.For now, Alphabet is in a new base, less than 7% below its all-time peak of 1,197. The recent correction of 17% from head to toe is too deep to be a potential flat base. The correction is also too narrow in time to serve as a cup or a cup with handle. So keep watching.Also keep an eye on Alphabet's proprietary ratings.The Relative Price Strength Rating is not great, but at 78 on IBD Stock Checkup it's decent for a mature large cap. The very best growth companies tend to show an RS Rating in the high 80s or more. However, Alphabet, for now, should be viewed as a potential new big cap leader.Alphabet's Composite Rating is grand at 98.Elsewhere, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rallied more than 6% to 17.82 following positive reports that South Korea in fact may allow certain types of transactions in digital currencies. However, as noted frequently in IBD's Stock Market Today columns, the closed end fund has a very long way to go before forming a legitimate new base and staging a potential new breakout point.Universal Display (OLED) got hammered again, falling 15% to 131 in massive volume. The expert in organic light-emitting diodes for TVs and smartphone displays reported stout earnings growth, up 69%, as revenue jumped 55% to $115.9 million.However, the former stock market leader had already triggered two key sell signals: 1) Universal slammed beneath its 50-day moving average in huge trade on Jan. 24-25; and 2) the stock triggered the golden rule of investing as it slid 8% below the most recent late-stage base buy point of 192.85.In other markets, the persistent rise in crude oil seems to confirm the recent weakness in the U.S. dollar as well as optimism over the global economy, not just OPEC's continued willingness to limit its production.WTI near-term futures rose 1.3% to $63.58 a barrel, marking a three-week high. The year-to-date high for WTI is $66.14, last seen in late January. WTI prices have not touched the $70 level since late November of 2014.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on financial markets and top stocks.)RELATED:Can GE Stay In The Dow Jones Industrials?Finding Excellent Growth Stocks: Who Are New Hot IPOs?How The Time The Stock Market: Does Every Follow-Through Work Out?What Is The Current Stock Market Direction?How To Build A Good Watch List: Check These Stocks And The Annotated Charts

""The relative size of the charge vs. expectations and limited disclosure related to potential off-balance-sheet liabilities once again raise a question about the credibility of the current guidance and capital structure framework.""Here is what to watch when GE and its industrial peers report.Analysts see Q4 earnings tumbling 39% to 28 cents as revenue slips 1% to $32.69 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Shares fell 0.55% to 16.17 on the stock market today, hitting their lowest level since December 2011.GE booked a 13% weekly loss Friday, after announcing it would take a $6.2 billion after-tax charge against fourth-quarter earnings. The charge relates to a legacy insurance portfolio in its finance arm, raising worries that GE's industrial businesses may eventually have to shore up GE Capital with cash.As investors watch for signs of more potential liabilities in the finance unit, they also will tune into commentary around GE's troubled power business. GE Power saw profit plunge 51% in the last quarterly report, amid a severe downturn in the overall market for gas-power generation.GE's 2018 rally has proved to be short-lived, with the stock back at the very bottom of the 30 blue-chip stocks on the Dow Jones industrial average, booking a 7% loss this year so far. GE's status in the Dow industrials may be in doubt.GE CEO John Flannery said Jan. 16 he is open to a more radical breakup than he originally envisaged in November, and a major activist investor has reportedly pushed for such action. Many GE watchers think not even a big breakup will halt the slump in GE stock, while others believe it could prove transformative.While GE also said Jan. 16 that it expects full-year 2017 earnings to be at the low end of the $1.05-$1.10 range, analysts such as Morningstar's Barbara Noverini are watching whether ""industrial cash from operations may exceed the latest $7 billion forecast"" and whether its cash squeeze will worsen under the Trump tax cuts.The Boston-based company slashed its dividend and 2018 outlook in half in November. Yet its latest woes have analysts like BoAML's Obin worried about further cuts to earnings targets.As GE stock continues to fall, its dividend yield now stands at 3%.IBD'S TAKE: Investing for income alone can be risky if you chase stocks just because of their high dividend yields. Learn how to buy the best dividend stocks that combine yields with earnings growth and a solid share price trend.United Technologies should see flat Q4 EPS of $1.56 despite a 5% increase in revenue to $15.40 billion.Shares slid 0.5% to 135.21 Monday afternoon The stock has advanced 9% from a 123.38 cup-with-handle entry in seven weeks, and is up 5% year to date.Analysts will closely watch for updates on Geared Turbo Fan (GTF) production and deliveries, from its Pratt & Whitney division, and on United Tech's recently announced acquisition of Rockwell Collins (COL).Pratt's shift from legacy engines toward the GTF has pressured earnings, but the GTF could transform into a significant profit driver over the next decade. It also may give United Tech an edge in the next-generation midsize aircraft, or NMA, market.United Technologies competes against fellow Dow stock GE in jet engines.Besides jet engine makers, United Technologies units include the makers of Otis elevators and Carrier air conditioners. A spinoff of those units could unlock major value, analysts say.Carrier axed more than 200 workers in Indianapolis earlier this month, with those jobs are going to Mexico, where workers make about $3 an hour, Reuters reported.Honeywell should see Q4 EPS rise 6% to $1.84 as revenue grows 7% to $10.69 billion.Shares dipped 0.1% to 158.54, still within buying range from their recent breakout past a 156.80 flat-base entry.Honeywell in December guided Q4 and full-year 2017 EPS to the high end of its previous range, while offering a conservative 2018 outlook. Analysts said that the latter fit the company's pattern of underpromising and overdelivering on financial results.The outlook call showed progress in one of new CEO Darius Adamczyk's top priorities — organic revenue growth, according to Noverini. The company is targeting 2% to 4% organic revenue growth vs. five- and 10-year CAGRs of less than 2%.That will be an area of scrutiny when Honeywell reports, especially for its aero business.Honeywell plans to spin off its home and global distribution business, as well as its transportation system business, by the end of 2018. Investors will be watching whether those spins are tracking to plan.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?This Top-Performing Dow Titan Is Reaping The Benefits of RestructuringHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

29,COL,"Fed up with the delays that plague production of luxurious jetliner cabins, Boeing (BA) is forming its own company with the leading seat supplier to the auto industry.X The joint venture with Adient (ADNT) will be based near Frankfurt, Germany, along with a technology center and an initial production plant, the companies said in a statement Tuesday. It will market seats to airlines and leasing companies that are ordering new planes and retrofitting older ones.The strategy furthers the Chicago-based planemaker's foray into so-called vertical integration as Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg seeks to bring more work back in-house. That's a reversal of the outsourcing that dominated its strategy a decade ago, when Boeing was building the first 787 Dreamliner.Boeing said the Adient Aerospace venture was prompted by slow seat production and a capacity crunch that has delayed jet deliveries and frustrated airlines. United Continental's (UAL) premium Polaris seats were slow to make their debut on the Boeing 777-300ER last year when Zodiac Aerospace fell behind schedule.Adient, the leader in the $70 billion automotive seating sector, has been hinting at a closer relationship with Boeing since the companies announced a collaboration last March. Retired Boeing Vice Chairman Ray Conner, a former chief of its commercial airplane division, is a director of Adient. The Plymouth, Michigan-based company was spun off from Johnson Controls International in 2016.Adient, with 230 plants worldwide, sees itself as a potential ""disruptor"" in the aircraft seating realm, Mark Oswald, vice president of investor relations said at a conference in September. ""The customers aren't excited about the current supply base,"" he said. When Adient was approached, a board member ""was very influential"" in spurring the company to look at the opportunity, he said.The two companies, in particular, are eyeing complex, lie-flat seats that can cost as much as a Ferrari. ""The front-of-a-plane business, full-flat business class is kind of our initial entree,"" Adient Chief Executive Officer Bruce McDonald said at a conference in August.By sourcing its own parts and components, Boeing gains greater control over quality, intellectual property and high-margin aftermarket sales -- the main source of profit for aerospace suppliers. The company has expanded its reach into avionics, additive manufacturing, actuators and engine covers known as nacelles.Yet the move risks adding tension to sometimes fraught relationships between Boeing and some of its largest suppliers. Safran, which makes engines for Boeing's 737 Max through a joint venture with General Electric (GE), is taking over Zodiac.Rockwell Collins (COL), a long-time supplier of radio and flight displays to Boeing, last year bought B/E Aerospace Inc., the largest cabin-equipment supplier. United Technologies Corp. later struck a deal to acquire Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based Rockwell, a deal aimed at gaining bargaining clout with Boeing and rival Airbus (EADSY).
"
30,COL,"The Geared Turbofan jet engine from United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit may transform from a drag on earnings to a significant profit driver over the next decade, according to one analyst.X United Tech invested roughly $15 billion in its next-gen Geared Turbofan (GTF), which allows different engine components to operate at different speeds, improving fuel efficiency while producing less noise and exhaust. Hopes were high as Pratt & Whitney sought to dethrone General Electric's (GE) Leap engine.But manufacturing issues and delays dogged the GTF, testing the patience of shareholders as well as customers like Qatar Airways and Airbus (EADSY). Delta Air Lines (DAL) also has ordered the engines for its 100 A321neo aircraft, set for delivery in early 2020. In October, United Tech backed its target of 350-400 GTF deliveries for 2017 as it resolves production problems.In a note to clients Wednesday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Matthew McConnell wrote that initial ""engine teething issues"" seem to have been fixed, paving the path for a successful ramp-up in GTF production and deliveries.""We believe the long-term growth opportunity at Pratt & Whitney is underappreciated, not just as the GTF ramps up and engine kinks are fully derisked, but also given the rich aftermarket opportunity from its large installed base of V2500s, competitive take-aways on key upcoming business jet platforms, and Pratt's sole-source position on all three Air Force mega programs,"" McConnell said.The Connecticut-based United Tech, a Dow Jones industrial average components, competes with fellow Dow stock GE and Rolls-Royce in the aerospace and defense markets, supplying engines to massive Pentagon programs like Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35.McConnell expects 2018 to mark the final year of margin headwinds in Pratt that have weighed on United Tech shares. The business could generate double-digit operating profit growth over the next 10 years, driving free cash flow of $10 per share by 2020, he estimated.However, he cautioned it is ""too early to declare victory"" on the GTF ramp-up, from 138 in 2016 to 700-plus in 2018. United Tech fell short of its target for 200 GTF deliveries in 2016, he added, and more challenges could result in ""further penalties and potentially order cancellations,"" weighing on investor sentiment.Shares of United Tech closed up 0.3% at 130.45 on the stock market today, after rallying 1.5% Wednesday on the RBC note, which also upgraded the stock to outperform. The stock is out of proper buy range after breaking out from a 123.38 cup-with-handle entry. GE rose 2.1%, Airbus jumped 2.5%, while Delta ended flat.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard  is a curated list of potential stock market winners.In his Wednesday note, McConnell also described United Tech's Rockwell Collins (COL) acquisition as a key free cash flow driver.""Rockwell Collins has among the stronger underlying outlooks of its commercial aerospace peers, driven by significant new content wins on next-generation platforms that position it well for the next five years,"" he said, while noting that the ""pricey"" $30 billion buy will likely deliver a return on investment in roughly five years.But the deal reportedly raised concerns from Airbus that it would keep United Tech from fixing the problems that delayed aircraft deliveries.MORE YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Dow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisCES 2018 News: The World's Largest Consumer Tech ShowQ4 Earnings Preview: Who Joins Facebook On List Of Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus Growth?

32,COL,"United Technologies (UTX) lifted full-year forecasts Tuesday after topping Q3 estimates, led by growth at its jet engine unit, which is making progress on resolving problems in its Geared Turbofan engine.Estimates: EPS to slip 4.5% to $1.68 while revenue grows 3.7% to $14.89 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: EPS dipped 2% to $1.73 as revenue grew 5% $15.06 billion. Organic sales rose 6%. Sales at the Otis elevator unit rose 4.6% to $3.16 billion. Climate, controls and security sales climbed 6.2% to $4.69 billion. Pratt & Whitney jet engine sales increased 10.6% to $3.87 billion. Aerospace systems sales were flat at $3.64 billion. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 11% at both Pratt & Whitney and aerospace systems.Orders for new equipment at Otis were down 4% on a constant-currency basis, while climate, controls and security saw a 2% increase in organic orders.Outlook: United Tech raised its full-year earnings estimate to $6.58-$6.63 from $6.45-$6.60. It sees sales of $59 billion-$59.5 billion, up from $58.5 billion-$59.5 billion. The Dow industrials component still sees 3%-4% organic growth.Stock: Shares fell 0.9% to 119.76 on the stock market today, falling back below a 120.05 buy point on a cup-with-handle base after hitting 123.28 intraday. Fellow Dow component General Electric (GE), which slashed its guidance last week, slipped 1.9% after diving 6% on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.United Tech has been grappling with problems in its new Geared Turbofan engines, which have delayed Airbus (EADSY) A320neo deliveries.In July, Airbus said Pratt & Whitney has to ""work harder"" to fix delays and reliability problems. United Tech said Tuesday that it has shipped 245 Geared Turbofan engines so far this year and backed its target of 350-400 deliveries for 2017.Management also said the company is speeding up production for the engines used in the A320neo and Bombardier's C Series aircraft.Meanwhile, United Tech reached a deal last month to buy aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins (COL) for $30 billion, including debt.The combination of United Tech, whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes jet engines, and Rockwell, which makes cockpit and communications systems, is seen as one of the biggest aerospace deals ever, and may draw a challenge from Boeing (BA), which is looking to keep it market share in the lucrative maintenance and repair business.The United Tech-Rockwell deal comes as Boeing ramps up its parts sales and services business, which provides maintenance and technical support and was launched on July 1.""We believe this deal is partly in response to the increased pricing pressure from the leading aerospace OEMs (Airbus and Boeing) and the increased push by the leading OEMs, notably Boeing, into the commercial aftermarket, traditionally the source of most industry profits and cash flow,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Ken Herbert said in a note last month.But as United Tech gets bigger, other industrial heavyweights like GE and Siemens (SIEGY) are getting smaller. General Electric said last week it will streamline its business by $20 billion, with thousands of layoffs expected. Siemens may cut thousands of workers at its power-and-gas and process industries, Bloomberg reported last week.United Tech needs to break up some of its assets to ""unlock the conglomerate discount and bring this deal to its ultimate logic,"" according to Vertical Research Partners analyst Jeff Sprague.In a Setember note, Sprague wrote that a spin-off of United Tech's buildings units, which includes Carrier air conditioning and Otis elevators, ""could unlock upwards of $20/share in value"" and would be ""the logical conclusion"" to the Rockwell transaction.RELATED:GE Under Pressure To Cut Dividend After Slashing Cash Flow OutlookBoeing May Challenge United Tech's Buyout Of Rockwell CollinsHoneywell's Expected Spinoffs Fall Short Of Investor's PlanHoneywell To Spin Off 2 Units; Pfizer Mulls Consumer Sale; P&G-Peltz Proxy Fight Today

33,COL,"Honeywell (HON) will reportedly spin off noncore assets into at least two public companies, but that might not be enough to appease an activist investor.XThe industrial conglomerate's turbocharger unit, which builds components that make cars and trucks more efficient, is among the units that may be spun off, sources told Reuters. While it falls under the aerospace business, Honeywell isn't planning to spin off that entire unit.That stops short of what Third Point LLC, a hedge fund run by activist investor Daniel Loeb, has urged. Loeb wants Honeywell to spin off its aerospace assets, its largest business.Honeywell shares rallied as much as 1.2% in Monday's stock market trading, but closed down down 0.1% at 143.54.

United Tech rose 0.3% to 118.62. United Tech is forming a flat base with a 124.89 entry point. The stock has an alternative entry point of 120.29.Honeywell pays a quarterly dividend of 74.5 cents a share, which translates to an annualized dividend yield of more than 2%.RELATED:

49,COL,"Boeing (BA) indicated Tuesday it may try to block United Technologies' (UTX) acquisition of Rockwell Collins (COL), as the jet maker looks to keep it market share in the lucrative maintenance and repair business.XBoeing has reportedly been critical of mergers in the past and — along European rival Airbus (EADSY) — privately lobbied against United Tech's efforts early last year to buy another aerospace supplier, Honeywell, according to the Wall Street Journal.""We intend to take a hard look at the proposed combination of United Technologies and Rockwell Collins,"" Boeing said according to Aviation Week. ""Until we receive more details, we are skeptical that it would be in the best interest of—or add value to—our customers and industry.""If Boeing determines the deal is ""inconsistent"" with its interests, ""we would intend to exercise our contractual rights and pursue the appropriate regulatory options to protect our interests,"" the company warned.The deal comes as Boeing looks to ramp up its parts sales and services business, which provides maintenance and technical support and was launched on July 1.""We believe this deal is partly in response to the increased pricing pressure from the leading aerospace OEMs (Airbus and Boeing) and the increased push by the leading OEMs, notably Boeing, into the commercial aftermarket, traditionally the source of most industry profits and cash flow,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Ken Herbert said in a note Tuesday.On Monday, United Tech announced it would buy aircraft supplier Rockwell for $140 a share, with $93.33 a share in cash and the rest in stock for a total deal of $23 billion.

52,COL,"Textron's (TXT) AT-6 Wolverine and Sierra Nevada-Embraer's (ERJ) A-29 Super Tucano could get a chance to show off their abilities against the Islamic State or al-Qaida in a combat test next year, as the Air Force looks at possibly buying up to 300 relatively cheap, light-attack aircraft by 2022.XThe Air Force hasn't decided if light-attack planes will be an official acquisition program, but it experimented with the planes over the summer at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico.The idea is save operating costs by flying the aircraft in uncontested environments and use sophisticated fighters like Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 and Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet for more dangerous missions.A final decision on the test, dubbed Combat Dragon III, hasn't been made yet, but Air Force Reserve Col. Mike Pietrucha, light attack adviser to Air Combat Command, told Aviation Week that he is preparing to send two AT-6s and two A-29s.The test would take place in areas under U.S. Central Command's area of responsibility, but the precise location decision would be determined by Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Harrigian, commander of U.S. Air Force Central Command.At the Air Force Association Conference last week, Harrigian said ""air superiority is job one,"" but once air superiority is assured, then a light-attack aircraft can be used.""I think the light attack would be able to provide me a lot of options, particularly if you're able to move closer to the forward line of the troops, provide the persistence that this type of platform will provide.""Textron shares rose 1.5% to 53.93, edging above buy range, and U.S.-listed shares of Brazil-based Embraer rallied 1.1% on the stock market today.  Boeing gained 0.6% and Lockheed added 0.2%, with both still in buy range.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The price tag for the Super Tucano would be more than $10 million, or about a tenth the current unit cost of Lockheed's F-35. Operating a propeller plane like the Super Tucano would only cost a few thousand dollars per hour vs. $19,000 per hour for Lockheed's F-16 and $44,000 for the F-35A variant, according to Air Force data cited by the Washington Post.The F-35 and Super Hornet would still form the backbone of the U.S. fighter fleet and would be needed in so-called contested environments against high-end rival planes from China and Russia.But will a light attack aircraft be enough force against terror groups in the Middle East?The AT-6 can carry conventional and laser-guided bombs and be used for precision attack as well as surveillance missions.The Super Tucano can carry rockets, air-to-air missiles and laser-guided bombs and is already in use by the fledgling Afghan Air Force.

59,COL,"There's plenty to like about the fundamentals of the aerospace and defense sector.XThe U.S. plans to increase combat operations in Afghanistan, while the battle against ISIS in Iraq and Syria continues. North Korea's nuclear program has placed greater urgency on missile defense technology. Passenger jet manufacturers and their suppliers enjoy a long backlog of orders for new-generation planes.Against that backdrop, it's little surprise that iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense (ITA) ETF is trading near record highs.

President Trump is seeking to boost military spending, although Congress made a much smaller proposal and both plans are well beyond current spending caps.Commercial aviation has been a growth industry of its own, largely because many airlines have been busy ordering new jets with higher fuel efficiency and other operating advantages.Although risks in that segment appear to be minimal, a Canaccord Genuity analyst saw greater potential in defense stocks.""We believe there is more upside in the defense sector in the next two years than in the commercial aerospace sector ..., which we believe will be a tailwind for defense stocks into 2018,"" analyst Ken Herbert wrote in a report last month. ""Note that defense investment outlays, as of June, were up (about) 4% on a rolling-12-month basis.

62,COL,"General Electric (GE) may have to sell more assets to maintain its current dividend as it battles weak cash flow, and GE investors should brace for more pain after a tough year so far, according to a JPMorgan Chase analyst.XThe industrial conglomerate's fundamentals are ""worse than we think,"" JPMorgan's Stephen Tusa wrote in a note to clients Thursday. Against that backdrop, he believes GE's prized dividends are safe ""for now"" — but likely not without some tough decisions.""GE is already below break-even when it comes to funding the dividend with ongoing free cash flow, with compounding risk if fundamentals come in worse than expectations,"" Tusa wrote. ""Our sense is that GE will sell assets to plug the near-term hole.""But a Morningstar analyst noted in July that Industrial free cash flow turned positive in GE's second quarter at over $700 million, rebounding from the first quarter's negative $2.2 billion.GE could raise $13 billion to $14 billion by selling assets in transportation as well as energy/lighting and renewables, and ""some smaller businesses within larger segments that most people have never heard of"" also could be dumped, Tusa said.He made note of difficult transportation trends into 2018, including weak locomotive demand in the freight markets, and of low cash margins in energy and renewables.But if GE's businesses suffer further in a tougher macro climate, the dividend would be highly vulnerable, ""meaning GE is not a safety stock,"" Tusa — described by Bloomberg as a consistent GE bear — wrote.GE didn't respond to a request for comment.GE's high dividend payouts — the stock currently has a 3.96% yield — have made it attractive to income investors. Many believe the dividend is safe, with the 125-year-old company merely suffering a short-term setback rather than more permanent distress.But others have recently questioned the safety and sustainability of GE's dividends. A Deutsche Bank analyst warned in May that GE's weak cash flow could mean a cut in dividends, prompting a forceful GE rebuttal.IBD'S TAKE: General Electric shares hit a post-financial crisis high in July 2016, but GE has been underperforming the S&P 500 index for the past five years, or even as far back as 2000. Here is how the Relative Strength Line can help you pick the best stocks to invest in.In his note, Tusa maintained an underweight rating on GE stock and a year-end price target of 22.GE shares crumbled 3.6% Thursday after the JPMorgan Chase report and extended losses Friday and Monday morning. GE pegged a fresh two-year intraday low of 23.58 Friday.GE stock is down about 25% year to date, by far the worst performer on the Dow Jones industrial average. The Dow itself is up more than 10% so far in 2017.GE's tumbling share price has flattered its dividend yield, but that's small comfort to investors who have held the stock on the way down.New CEO John Flannery is expected to present his vision for the future in November as well as a potential reset of GE's earnings-per-share targets. One analyst recently suggested that Flannery may shed the health care unit as he puts the company's vast-but-streamlined portfolio under review.Under former CEO Jeff Immelt, GE cut loose its financial and certain consumer units and returned to its industrial core, which include the power, aviation, energy and transportation segments. But those measures failed to revive investor confidence in the company's overall strategy, leading to Immelt's exit this year.Meanwhile, industrial peer 3M (MMM) rose 0.6%, finding resistance at its 50-day moving average within a flat-base consolidation. Honeywell (HON) added 0.4%, Siemens (SIEGY) slipped 0.9% and United Technologies (UTX) shed 0.4%.3M and United Technologies, which this week agreed to buy Rockwell Collins (COL) for $30 billion including debt, are Dow components like GE.RELATED:This 'Outlier' GE Unit May Ironically Be Ripe For Sale Under New CEODow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisBest Stocks To Buy And Watch

78,COL,"ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. — The Army's General Dynamics (GD)-made Stryker troop carrier could get a high-powered laser in the future to shoot down bomb-laden drones, as ISIS employs these so-called flying IEDs.To combat the growing unmanned air system (UAS) threat, the Army tested Boeing's (BA) Mobile High Energy Laser, a 5-kilowatt laser cannon, mounted on a Stryker, at Fort Sill, Okla., back in April.""I'm very optimistic about lasers for counter-UAS missions,"" Maj. Gen. David Bassett, the Army's acquisition executive for ground combat systems, told a group of reporters at a media day Tuesday.But before the Army can use lasers to zap enemy tanks and other vehicles, ""there are hard physics problems "" that need to be solved first, he added.For example, a laser beam spreads out as it travels, making it less powerful the farther away the target is from the laser's source.So for a laser to be effective against a large target, like a tank, it either needs to be more powerful than 5 kilowatts or remain on the target for perhaps hours, rendering the laser impractical in combat.IBD'S TAKE: Defense stocks have been on the rise as tensions heat up across the globe, and General Dynamics stock is in buy range. You can find other top stocks near buy range and deeper chart analysis in IBD's review screens. Right now, the Army is just starting to demonstrate laser capabilities, and Col. Glenn Dean, the Stryker's project manager, said he isn't sure if lasers would be included in an official Stryker program anytime soon.General Dynamics shares edged up 0.4% on the stock market today.

79,COL,"ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. — The Army showed off its latest iteration of General Dynamics' (GD) Stryker vehicle Tuesday, now packed with more firepower than ever as tensions heat up with Russia.XThere are only 30,000 U.S. troops in Europe, down from the 300,000 at the height of the Cold War, and the U.S. doesn't have a lot of armor in Europe anymore, Lt. Col. Troy Meissel, deputy commanding officer of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, based in Germany, told IBD.The Strykers that his unit operates are armored troop carriers that aren't designed to slug it out with tanks. Meanwhile, Russia's invasions into Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014 have raised fears in Europe of more Russian aggression.So the more heavily armed Strykers now feature a 30-mm cannon, an upgrade from the 0.50-caliber machine gun. The cannon, which is remotely operated with an unmanned turret, can provide more stand-off range and shoots armor-piercing as well as high-explosive/incendiary rounds. A machine gun can also be mounted on the turret along with a Javelin anti-tank missile launcher.Meissel said the new weapons can hold off and slow down a surprise attack from Russian tanks, troop carriers and other lightly armored vehicles until U.S. tanks and other reinforcements can arrive.""We don't fight tanks or armored vehicles,"" he said. ""The goal is to survive those chance contacts.""General Dynamics shares rose 0.6% at 200.61 on the stock market today, retaking their 50-day average. They remain in buy range after breaking out in April, but the stock hasn't moved much over those months.IBD'S TAKE: Defense stocks have been on the rise as tensions heat up across the globe, and General Dynamics stock is in buy range. You can find other top stocks near buy range and deeper chart analysis in IBD's review screens. Delivery of the vehicle — nicknamed Dragoon after the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which requested the vehicles — starts in January, with all 81 vehicles expected to be delivered by July 2018.As deployment nears, there are still issues that need to be worked out. For example, soldiers are concerned about reduced visibility due to the removal of hatches for the 30-mm cannon's turret.But Major Gen. David G. Bassett, the Army's program executive officer for ground combat systems, said the service is working through possible solutions.RELATED: Here's What The Army Can And Can't Destroy With This LaserWatch The Aircraft In The Air Force's Light-Attack ExperimentDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

""Doug pursued opportunities to educate himself in all areas of military need and was first to volunteer for hazardous duty situations,"" Harper said.In June 1941, President Roosevelt ordered the Coast Guard to man four large naval transports and its men to serve with Navy crewman aboard 18 ships.Evans said that when word came that signalmen were needed on the transport ship USS Hunter Liggett, he and Munro spent several days making their case to the Spencer's executive office to be reassigned — and were.In April 1942, four months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and the United States' entry into World War II, the Hunter Liggett set sail to New Zealand in preparation for combat in the South Pacific.After military successes at the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway, the Navy moved to counter the Japanese advances in the Solomon Islands. As U.S. forces advanced, the island of Guadalcanal, some 600 miles east of New Guinea, became a strategic target due to a vital airfield that the Japanese were building.On August 7, 11,000 Marines came ashore in Coast Guard-manned transports at Lunga Point, located on Guadalcanal's northern coast. They encountered little enemy resistance.Munro was now ""the best small-boat operator on the island,"" wrote Gary Williams in his book about him, ""Guardian of Guadalcanal."" Munro helped transport troops to Tulagi Island, which was 20 miles across a channel from Guadalcanal. This was a much more contested landing and it took several days to secure that island.Munro was then assigned to what was now Lunga Point Base. It was a staging area for troop transports and landing craft up and down the Guadalcanal coast.In a bloody and critical battle, the U.S. quickly seized the airfield on Guadalcanal, but the Japanese kept fighting to regain control. A month after the landings, the Marines planned to advance west across the Matanikau River in order prevent the Japanese from attacking American positions.After several attempts that encountered strong Japanese resistance, on Sept. 27 three Marine companies under the command of legendary Marine Lt. Col. ""Chesty"" Puller planned to land west of the river to attack the Japanese and establish a patrol base.Two weeks shy of his 23rd birthday, Munro, along with Evans, was in charge of 10 landing craft: LCVPs, which carried vehicles and personnel, and LCTs, which carried tanks. The boats were slow, and the LCVPs were each equipped with only two .30-caliber machine guns.Some 600 Marines were landed and made their way inland 500 yards, but then their artillery cover from the destroyer U.S.S. Monssen was compromised by Japanese bombers. The ship was forced out of range and couldn't help protect the landed Marines, who were now at the mercy of a sizable Japanese force.Back at the Lunga Point base, where Munro and Evans had returned, Williams describes Coast Guard Cmdr. Dwight H. Dexter as running toward them to ask: "" 'Are you ready to go back and get those jarheads off that beach?' 'They are getting hit pretty hard.' Munro looked at Evans and said, 'Hell, yeah!'""Both men turned and ran back down the pier, yelling to the other boat crews to get ready to depart,"" Williams wrote. ""With Munro and Evans in the lead, the squadron headed back out to sea.""As they approached the landing point, the Japanese unleashed a barrage of mortar and automatic-weapons fire on the boats that Munro was leading back to the beach, resulting in casualties. One of the boats pulled up alongside Munro's and its crew yelled to him that the attempt to rescue the Marines was too dangerous.""Munro responded by jabbing his finger toward the beach and yelled, 'We're not leavin' them there! We're goin' in!' "" Williams wrote.Waves of haggard Marines emerged from the dense jungle dragging wounded and dead comrades. Two to three landing craft at a time picked them up as Munro and Evans provided machine-gun cover. Then Munro maneuvered their boat to act as a shield between Japanese fire from a ridge and the withdrawing men.One blood-covered Marine said to Evans, ""You came back, thank God."" Evans pointed to Munro.Having directed the evacuation of some 500 Marines, Munro and Evans were headed for Lunga Point when they saw that an LCT loaded with Marines was grounded on a nearby beach.According to Evans, Munro then directed an LCT to go in, use a tow line, and free the ship and men from the beach. The procedure took about 20 minutes and there was no gunfire from the Japanese or sight of them there.As the landing craft headed out to sea, Evans ""saw a line of waterspouts coming across the water from where the LCT had been grounded and realized it was machine-gun fire"" from a Japanese emplacement. He yelled, ""Doug, get down!""""I don't think Munro saw the line of bullets since he was facing forward and did not at first react to my yelling over the engine noise,"" Evans said.Munro received a mortal wound at the base of his skull. Munro's final words summed up his short life of service; he wanted to know about the last detachment of Marines on the beach, asking, ""Did we get them off?""""And they said `Yes Doug, we did,' "" Edith Munro recalled in her 1982 TV appearance. ""They said he just beamed. And then he died.""""Munro was recommended for the Medal of Honor by the United States Marine Corps, and his portrait is (of) the only non-Marine displayed in the National Museum of the Marine Corps Hall of Heroes,"" Williams said.The medal was presented to his parents in the Oval Office by President Franklin Roosevelt. His citation reads, in part, ""For extraordinary heroism and conspicuous gallantry in action above and beyond the call of duty as Officer-in-Charge … in the evacuation of a Battalion of Marines trapped by enemy Japanese forces at Point Cruz, Guadalcanal."" In addition to his Medal of Honor, Munro also received the Purple Heart.But the story didn't end with Douglas Munro's death. Williams told IBD that when Edith Munro learned that the Coast Guard had created a women's auxiliary known as the SPARS, which stands for ""semper paratus: always ready,"" she attempted to enlist to fulfill her son's commitment.""The Coast Guard was reticent to allow the enlistment of a Medal of Honor Gold Star mother and offered her an advanced-rank commission, lieutenant junior grade,"" Williams said. ""She accepted the commission on condition she be permitted to complete basic training with all other recruits. At the age of 48, twice the age of her fellow recruits, she completed basic training and became the first female officer assigned to a district commander's staff.""The high-endurance cutter USCGC Munro, commissioned in 1971, was named in Douglas Munro's honor. Edith Munro, in her mid-70s, was on hand for the ceremony, just as she had been in 1944 when a Navy destroyer escort was named for her son.And in November 2013 the U.S. Coast Guard headquarters in Washington, D.C., was named the Douglas A. Munro Coast Guard Building by an act of Congress.Only member of the United States Coast Guard to receive the Medal of Honor. Recipient of the Purple Heart. USCGC Munro, commissioned in 1971, named in his honor.Overcame: Intense enemy fire to rescue Marines stranded during the Battle of Guadalcanal.Lesson: Take your training seriously, and your duty.""Doug Munro did not become a hero at his moment of valor. He prepared for that moment his entire life. And when that moment came, he unhesitatingly did what needed to be done, at the cost of his own life."" — Kris Cotariu HarperMORE ABOUT LEADERS & SUCCESS:Peter Tomich's Sacrifice Saved Hundreds Of Lives At Pearl HarborJimmy Doolittle Wrecked Japan's Invincible ImageEddie Rickenbacker's Daring, Determination Took Him To Aviation's Heights

86,COL,"China successfully completed the first test flight of its home-built modern passenger jet, bolstering President  Xi Jinping's ambition of turning China into an advanced economy.Amid cheers from onlookers, the C919 airliner took off Friday from Pudong International Airport in Shanghai, the home base of its builder Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac. The jet landed back about an hour and 19 minutes later after cruising at 3,000 meters (9,840 feet). The single-aisle plane, which is designed to seat as many as 174 people, is slated to enter commercial service with China Eastern Airlines Corp. in 2019.""It shows China made a historic breakthrough in its years-old dream of building a big aircraft,"" Comac said in a statement, calling the test a ""complete success."" The nation's State Council, the top administrative authority, sent a congratulatory note to the designers.The test flight, after repeated delays, marks another step in Xi's ambitious 'Made in China 2025' program, which identified aerospace among sectors that could accelerate China's advancement. The government has said the ability to build and fly a large commercial aircraft is the ""flower'' and ""pearl'' of modern manufacturing.The C919 would be the first major competitor for Airbus SE and Boeing Co. in the most popular sector of the airliner market and gives Comac a home advantage in what is set to become the world's biggest aircraft market. Boeing estimates China will need 6,810 aircraft worth more than $1 trillion in the two decades through 2035.""There's a lot riding on the C919,'' said Xu Yongling, a military test pilot and a member of the Beijing-based Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics. ""The expectation for the C919 is not to become the best-selling single-aisle aircraft in the market, but rather become a stepping stone for COMAC to build something better, with indigenous technology.''COMAC plans to make six planes for tests, and the second one is getting ready at the final assembly workshop in Shanghai, the builder said. Guests who witnessed Friday's test flight included Vice Premier Ma Kai and Han Zheng, Communist Party secretary from Shanghai.The five people on board the test plane were the captain, co-pilot, an observer and two engineers.Getting into the major league with Airbus (EADSY) and Boeing (BA) may be a few decades away as customers typically prefer aircraft with proven track record, reliability and safety, analysts said. COMAC is seeking certification for the C919 from European agencies.""Comac could well be an option for us,"" said William Walsh, chief executive officer of IAG SA, the owner of British Airways Plc, adding he'd only seriously consider the plane when IAG reviews its existing fleet of short-haul Airbus A320-family jets in the long-term. More immediately, he's expecting lower prices from the added competition.Walsh, a former pilot who's flown in the plane's simulator, said he's due to meet with Comac next month to further advise on features that IAG looks for in a new model.""A new entrant will have an impact on pricing,"" Walsh told analysts on a call Friday. ""We've seen that to some degree with the launch of the CSeries. It's something that both airlines and the manufacturers are aware of.""The C919 designation was chosen partly to reflect the idea of long life in Chinese numerology.With a maximum range of 3,450 miles, the plane is powered by two LEAP-1C engines from CFM International Inc., a joint venture between Safran SA and General Electric (GE). Other key system suppliers include Honeywell International (HON), Rockwell Collins (COL), Liebherr-International Deutschland GmbH, Thales SA and Panasonic Corp.The test flight of the plane follows China's launch last month of its first domestically built aircraft carrier. The milestones, coming within weeks, burnish Xi's credentials as a modernizer before he presides over the ruling Communist Party's twice-a-decade congress later this year.Almost a billion people will fly to, from or within China by 2025, the International Air Transport Association estimates. Over the next two decades, about 75 percent of the jets ferrying those passengers will be single-aisle -- a category dominated by Boeing's 737 and Airbus's A320 family.In an email, Boeing congratulated Comac for the ""successful development"" of the C919, while Airbus said it welcomes competition, ""which is good for the development of the industry.""Comac, which had postponed the test flight at least twice, says it has commitments from 23 customers for about 570 planes, with Shanghai-based China Eastern lined up to take the first delivery.Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group, said China may have to wait till its next aircraft to really break the duopoly for jets that can carry more than 100 passengers.""At the moment, they are in a real replication mode, which is not where you want to be,"" he said. ""First off, they need to privatize and open their supply chain up to a global network, rather than just people who will transfer yesterday's technology.""Comac has set its sights on building a wide-body aircraft. It is forming a joint venture with Russia's United Aircraft Corp. to develop a twin-aisle jet.""The C919 is a testament to China's civil aviation research and manufacturing capability,"" said Yu Zhanfu, executive director at Roland Berger Management Consultants Shanghai Co. ""China's had a lot of success in making rockets, making spaceships. It shows the country is capable of mega tech-intensive manufacturing projects.""

87,COL,"Third Point, the activist hedge fund run by Dan Loeb, reportedly has issued a letter calling for Honeywell (HON) to spin off its aerospace unit, which is the industrial conglomerate's largest segment by revenue.Loeb says Honeywell's stock trades at a ""substantial discount"" to its peers and that an aerospace spinoff would produce a ""sustained increase in shareholder value"" of more than $20 billion, according to the New York Times.Shares of Honeywell jumped 3.2% to 134.00 in after-hours trading on the stock market today. The stock remains near record highs after topping first-quarter earnings forecasts last week.Shares of General Electric (GE), which has been under pressure from Trian Fund Management to improve results, edge up 0.1% late to 29.10. United Technologies (UTX) wasn't active late but closed up 0.5% at 118.78. Rockwell Collins (COL) was also quiet after falling 0.6% to 104.48.In February, Third Point disclosed a new stake in Honeywell. In its letter Thursday, it said several Wall Street analysts are in favor of a spinoff, the Times reported.Honeywell's wide array of aerospace products include gas turbine auxiliary power units and cockpit systems and displays. In Q1, the segment's revenue slipped 4% to $3.55 billion, though on an organic basis it was flat.

88,COL,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 flew alongside older fighters from the U.S. and allied forces during its recent European deployment, providing the Air Force with new lessons on how the stealth jet can be supported and integrated with other forces.Pentagon officials envision ""fifth-generation"" F-35s and F-22s entering a battle space first to suppress any airborne or air-defense threats, allowing older, but more heavily armed ""fourth-generation"" fighters to follow.X Eight Air Force F-35A variants from the 34th Fighter Squadron deployed to RAF Lakenheath in the U.K. in April and were later sent to Estonia and Bulgaria as a show of force in the region and to test the procedures and logistics of moving the F-35 around the area.While the F-35 didn't fly with any Bulgarian or Estonian aircraft, they did train with U.S. Boeing (BA) F-15s stationed at Lakenheath and flew with British, Dutch and Norwegian Lockheed F-16s.The last of the F-35s returned to the U.S. on May 9, and officials from Hill Air Force Base offered more details Wednesday about the plane's first deployment to Europe.""We continue to learn again and again that the 5th gen is making our 4th gen more survivable, and the 4th gen makes us more lethal or deadly with their fire power,"" Lt. Col. George Watkins, the 34th Fighter Squadron commander, told reporters during a briefing.Here are some other takeaways:Lockheed shares were down 0.8% at 269.51 in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today, dipping below their 270 buy point amid a broad sell-off. United Technologies, whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes the plane's engines, dropped 1.6%, re-entering the high end of its buy zone. Northrop, a major F-35 subcontractor, dipped 0.1% to 247.18 but still near a 249.53 entry.As tensions heat up in the region, Germany could be the next NATO ally to buy the F-35 outside current NATO partner countries like the U.K., the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey and Italy.According to a Reuters report Wednesday, the German air force requested classified data on the F-35 as it looks to start replacing its older fourth-generation jets between 2025 and 2035. There are no plans yet for a procurement program from Berlin.The F-35 will attend the Paris Air Show next month, but Lockheed, not the Air Force, will get the plane over to the show.RELATED:The Brains For Lockheed's F-35 Just Got SmarterLockheed's F-35, F-22 May Soon Face Their Moment Of Truth

89,COL,"XDow Jones industrial average component General Electric (GE) on Friday turned out first-quarter earnings that topped analyst estimates. But shares fell, potentially due the state of the company's industrial operating cash flow, which turned negative and was a billion worse than the company expected.Meanwhile, fellow diversified industrial giant Honeywell (HON) also topped first-quarter earnings forecasts, soaring to a record high and briefly hitting a new entry area.General Electric's industrial cash flow from operating activities was negative $1.6 billion, partly due to the timing of things like cash collection for service contracts. But the company held to its forecast for the metric of between $12 billion to $14 billion this year.""That single point, which is very important for quality of earnings, simply gave investors a reason not to feel good about the quarter,"" RBC analyst Deane Dray said.Analysts have focused more on General Electric's cash flow since its separation from its finance arm, GE Capital, he said. That move, done to help GE return to its industrial roots, enabled Wall Street to more closely scrutinize GE's core finances.The company, he said, spent a good deal talking about the cash-flow situation — perhaps too much.""You end up sounding more defensive the more you talk about it,"" Dray said.Questions were also raised about whether General Electric can reach a $1 billion cost-cutting goal this year.In a research note after GE reported results, Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna said several factors — including negative industrial cash flow, and GE's cost-cutting plans — ""may mitigate the stock's reaction today.""General Electric also only tallied $76 million worth of savings toward the $1 billion target, part of an agreement worked out with activist investor Trian Fund Management. However, management on the company's earnings call said the pace of cost cutting would accelerate through the year.In March, following what Trian characterized as ""intensified"" discussions, the fund and General Electric worked out an agreement in which GE would try to slash $2 billion from its industrial segment this year and next. Executive bonuses would be tied to whether it meets those goals.GE also stuck with its full-year earnings-per-share forecast of $1.60-$1.70 and organic growth of 3%-5%.Shares fell 2.4% to 29.55 in the stock market today, undercutting their 50-day line a day after finding upside resistance at the 200-day line.GE has been mired in what has been called an ""industrial recession"" in which slow growth and an oil glut have affected demand for its equipment.While the company in January said that oil markets were stabilizing, management said Friday that ""a large degree of uncertainty remains,"" with stockpiles still flush with crude and OPEC's deliberations over keeping a lid on production hanging over oil prices.U.S. crude oil futures sank 2.2% to $49.62 a barrel, part of a 7.4% weekly tumble.""GE had a good quarter in a slow growth and volatile environment,"" Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt said on the company's earnings call. ""While the resource sector is challenging, we had the strongest oil & gas orders in 10 quarters."" Oil and gas revenue dropped 9% to $3 billion.Immelt said that the company sees ""global growth accelerating while the US continues to improve,"" and that China, Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia were ""all stronger than last year.""General Electric's EPS was flat at 21 cents on revenue of $27.66 billion, down less than 1% vs. a year earlier, topping views for 17 cents and $26.405 billion, respectively. Organic revenue climbed 7% and organic orders climbed 10%.Revenue for GE's aviation segment, which makes jet engines and other equipment, grew 9% to $6.08 billion. Revenue in power systems, which include gas turbines, rose 17% to $6.09 billion.Renewable energy revenue jumped 22% to $2.04 billion. Health care edged up 3% to $4.29 billion, helped by China, whose middle class has expanded.Within the health care division, which offers surgical imaging, ultrasound technology and an array of other products, GE remained upbeat on the global health care market, even as Republicans in Congress try to revive efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.""GE is continuing its portfolio transformation and investing in innovations in GE Digital and GE Additive,"" said Immelt in a statement. ""Our planned combination of GE Oil & Gas and Baker Hughes remains on track, and we expect the deal to close in mid-2017.""The deal with oilfield services firm Baker Hughes, which does much of its work on land, could broaden General Electric's exposure to the oil recovery as rig activity picks up in the Permian Basin and elsewhere. Much of GE's business in oil and gas is in deep-sea drilling.Investors have grown more cautious about the probability of President Trump and Congress delivering on tax reform and other policy goals quickly, though Trump told AP on Friday that a ""massive tax cut"" package will be released next week. Upcoming elections in Europe have also stirred anxiety.Honeywell's EPS rose 11% to $1.66 excluding divestitures on revenue of $9.492 billion, just below a year earlier. Organic revenue climbed 2%. The maker of avionics gear and climate control products also raised the low end of its full-year EPS target range by 5 cents and now sees $6.90-$7.10, up 7%-10%.Shares rose as high as 128.30, a record high and above a 127.62 flat base buy point. Honeywell closed up 2.7% at 127.07.Rockwell Collins (COL), a maker of aircraft parts, offered a full-year EPS forecast of $4.50-$4.70, one that was affected by its recent acquisition of B/E Aerospace, according to Reuters. However, Rockwell raised its sales outlook to $6.7 billion-$6.8 billion. B/E Aerospace provides products and services for aircraft interiors.Rockwell shares shot up 5.1% to 104.70, hitting a record high.RELATED:Honeywell Cuts 2017 Sales Outlook, Citing Drop In Jet Sales

90,COL,"Following recent minimum-wage setbacks in Baltimore, Flagstaff, Ariz., and Miami Beach, the Fight for $15 is attempting today to regain its momentum for raising the minimum wage — with another round of coordinated protests in major cities nationwide.This marks at least the twelfth coordinated Fight for $15 protest paid for by the Service Employees International Union since 2012. To keep the protest fresh for the media and ensure its quota of sympathetic news stories, the Fight for $15 has partnered with the activist group Black Lives Matter.""What we both realize is we're stronger when we operate together,"" says Fight for $15 organizing director Kendell Fells.It's a strange association for many reasons. For unions, which have spent upward of $100 million on the Fight for $15 in recent years, they risk alienating some of their more centrist supporters by partnering with a group built on the misconception that there is an epidemic of racially motivated police shootings.But the association is even weirder for Black Lives Matter, given the role of minimum-wage increases in creating additional barriers to black employment.A recent review of minimum-wage research by economists at the San Francisco Federal Reserve concludes, ""A higher minimum wage results in some job loss for the least-skilled workers — with possibly larger adverse effects than earlier research suggested."" Because they often face failing public schools and divided families, black job-seekers are often less skilled than their counterparts and are disproportionately impacted by such entry-level wage increases.According to a report last year by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, roughly one in three black men aged 18 to 34 is either jobless or incarcerated. Among those without a high school education, that figure approaches two in three. The CBO cites the numerous recent minimum-wage increases at the state and local level as a cause of this employment carnage.Ironically, unemployment among black youth is worst in the cities where Fight for $15 and Black Lives Matter are protesting today. In Philadelphia, the current rate of black teen unemployment is 27%. In Baltimore, it's 35%. In New York City and Los Angeles County, it's 33%. In metro Atlanta, where I grew up, it's 38%. And in Washington, D.C., it's 39%. In black neighborhoods in these cities the unemployment rate regularly exceeds 50%.Now is not the time to increase barriers to employment for black youth by dramatically increasing the minimum wage. Black youngsters need a job more than a raise.Why aren't these staggering black unemployment statistics common knowledge? Because for minimum-wage or black activists to acknowledge them would mean admitting that the minimum wage has nothing to do with the problems facing the black community. In fact, to the extent that the minimum wage keeps black people out of the workforce, it exacerbates their problems.Such an admission would mean having to tackle issues facing black communities today that are not politically correct. These include divided families, broken public schools, gang violence and a lack of entrepreneurial opportunity.Rather than supporting counterproductive increases to the wage floor, activists should fight to raise the wage ceiling for average job-seekers. In other words, fight for $50,000-a-year careers, not $15-an-hour mandates. Fight for victors, not victims.This is not a far-fetched goal. Roughly half of the current 5.6 million unfilled jobs nationally pay this amount or more. These include hundreds of thousands of jobs in fields like sales, maintenance and trades.But before job-seekers can get these good jobs, they first need jobs in which they can gain a toehold on the bottom rung of the career ladder and learn soft skills like customer-service, communication, and camaraderie to quickly move up it. For black youths, who often don't get this training at home or in the classroom, this is especially important.As Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen highlighted in her speech to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition last week, the research connection between entry-level jobs and career prospects is robust. To win the fight for $50,000, these jobs must be protected.The black community has many issues to protest about today. The minimum wage is not one of them.RELATED: Minimum Wage Is Racist, Kills Jobs And Doesn't Help The Poor — Apart From That, It's A Great Idea 'Fight For $15': The Most Devastating Minority Job-Killer Ever?

92,COL,"ARLINGTON, Va. — The Air Force looks to be ""completely transparent"" about its secretive new stealth bomber, at least on Capitol Hill, while the Pentagon stays tight lipped in public about Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 Raider.Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy in Air Force acquisition, said he met with members of Congress on Wednesday to discuss a preliminary design review on the B-21 as well as provide a schedule of key milestones and other events expected with the bomber, which will replace Cold War-era Boeing (BA) B-52s.But it was unclear from Bunch's comments at an Air Force Association breakfast Thursday if his Capitol Hill discussions included cost figures, the lack of which has drawn stern warnings in the past from Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz.He has taken issue with the B-21's cost-plus contract, which puts taxpayers on the hook for any overruns, and with the Air Force's refusal to provide a full cost estimate. So far, the service has only put development costs at $23.5 billion and the per-plane cost at $564 million in 2016 dollars. Analysts, however, estimate the total acquisition price tag could hit $80 billion.""Why would you not want to tell the American people how you are going to spend their dollars?"" McCain asked during a hearing last year.

93,COL,"Last week on CNN I debated a liberal commentator who complained that the problem with President Donald Trump's budget blueprint is that it lacks ""compassion"" for the poor, for children and for the disabled.This woman went on to ask me how I could defend a budget that would cut Meals on Wheels, after-school programs and special-education funding, because without the federal dollars, these vital services would go away.This ideology — that government action is a sign of compassion — is upside-down and contrary to the Christian notion of charity.We all, as individuals, can and should act compassionately and charitably. We can volunteer our time, energy and dollars to help the underprivileged. We can feed the hungry, house the homeless. Most of us feel a moral and ethical responsibility to do so — to ""do unto others.""And we do fulfill that obligation more than the citizens of almost any other nation. International statistics show that Americans are the most charitable people in the world and the most likely to engage in volunteerism.Whenever there is an international crisis — an earthquake, a flood, a war — Americans provide more assistance than the people of any other nation.But government, by its nature, is not compassionate. It can't be. It is nothing other than a force. Government can only spend a dollar to help someone when it forcibly takes a dollar from someone else.At its core, government welfare is predicated on a false compassion. This isn't to say that government should never take collective action to help people. But these actions are based on compulsion, not compassion.If every so-called ""patriotic millionaire"" would simply donate half of their wealth to serving others we could solve so many of the social problems in this country without a penny of new debt or taxes.My friend Arthur Brooks, the president of American Enterprise Institute, has noted in his fabulous book ""Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compassionate Conservatism"" that conservatives donate more than the self-proclaimed compassionate liberals.The liberal creed seems to be: ""We care so much about poor people, climate change, income inequality and protecting the environment (or whatever the cause of the day) that there is no limit to how much money should be taken out of other people's wallets to solve these problems.""Let's take Meals on Wheels. Is this a valuable program to get a nutritious lunch or dinner to infirmed senior citizens? Of course, yes.Do we need the government to fund it? Of course not. I have participated in Meals on Wheels and other such programs, making sandwiches or delivering hot lunches. And many tens of thousands of others donate their time and money every day for this worthy cause.Why is there any need for government here? The program works fine on its own. Turning this sort of charitable task over to government only makes people act less charitably on their own. It leads to an ""I gave at the office"" mentality, which leads to less generosity.It also subjects these programs to federal rules and regulations that could cripple them. Why must the federal government be funding after-school programs, or any school programs, for that matter?One of my favorite stories of American history dates back to the 19th century when Col. Davy Crockett, who fought at the Alamo, served in Congress. In a famous incident, Congress wanted to appropriate $100,000 to the widow of a distinguished naval officer.Crockett took to the House floor and delivered his famous speech, relevant as ever: ""We have the right, as individuals, to give away as much of our own money as we please in charity; but as members of Congress we have no right to so appropriate a dollar of the public money. ... I am the poorest man on this floor. I cannot vote for this bill, but I will give one week's pay to the object, and if every member of Congress will do the same, it will amount to more than the bill asks.""Crockett was the only member of Congress who donated personally to the widow, while the members of Congress who pretended to be so caring and compassionate closed their wallets.It all goes to show that liberal do-gooders were as hypocritical then as they are today.

96,COL,"Eddie Rickenbacker overcame a lot to become a fighter pilot in World War I. At 8, he had developed a fear of heights after trying to fly off the roof of his home with an umbrella attached to his bike. After becoming a famed race car driver at 27, he accepted an invitation to go up in an early plane, which scared him to death, but also thrilled him.He joined the Army hoping to join its Air Service on arrival in France in June 1917, but his skills as an engine mechanic were too valuable to allow him to allow him into the air. He sneaked in flying time, and after qualifying was allowed to go up, despite being two years over the age limit and lacking a college degree.In April 1918, Rickenbacker shot down his first enemy plane and a month later joined the 1% of combat pilots earning the title ""flying ace"" with his fifth confirmed kill, going on to become America's top gun of the war, with 26.""He was absolutely fearless — not that he wasn't afraid, but he knew how to persist and overcome his fears,"" Winston Groom, author of ""The Aviators: Eddie Rickenbacker, Jimmy Doolittle, Charles Lindbergh, and the Epic Age of Flight,"" told IBD. ""He had a winning mindset and could envision the future, which was the key to his success in all his main endeavors, including auto racing and starting Eastern Air Lines.""Rickenbacker (1890-1973) grew up in Columbus, Ohio, where his Swiss immigrant parents and their eight kids barely had enough to eat. At 5, Eddie got up at 4:30 a.m. to sell newspapers. When he was 13, his father died, so he dropped out of school and worked 12-hour shifts six days a week at a factory making glass tumblers.After getting a ride in an early roadster, Eddie's fascination led to a job at a repair shop for ""horseless carriages."" He taught himself to drive and soon was able to take apart engines and put them back together blindfolded. After taking a correspondence course in mechanics, in 1910 he was hired as the chief engineer at the Columbus Buggy Co., which made electric and gas-powered cars. He also earned the firm publicity by racing their cars on dirt tracks and earning the moniker ""Fast Eddie.""In 1911, taking a train to visit a rich customer, he stuck his head out the window and a cinder from a passing locomotive entered his right eye. After a painful operation without anesthesia, he was left with a permanent blind spot. But that didn't slow him down: At 24, he was a full-time race car driving earning $24,000 (equivalent to $600,000 today). He sometimes drew crowds of 50,000 and competed four times in the already world-famous Indianapolis 500.""You didn't win races because you had more guts,"" his obituary in the New York Times quoted him as saying. ""You won because you knew how to take the turns and baby your engine. It wasn't all just shut your eyes and grit your teeth.""In 1914, the Great War had started in Europe, with the U.S. neutral at first.""Rickenbacker had paid close attention to the news about the heroic British young men who had taken to the air to play deadly three-dimensional chess against the Red Baron and other German aces,"" said John F. Ross, author of ""Enduring Courage: Ace Pilot Eddie Rickenbacker and the Dawn of the Age of Speed.""But Army leaders weren't yet sold on the importance of aircraft, except for photo reconnaissance and turned down Rickenbacker's initial application to fly. Then in June 1917, a friend who was now an Army major invited him to become a staff sergeant and join a secret mission sailing out of New York. It turned out to be Army commander Gen. John J. Pershing and his staff, including headquarters chief Capt. George S. Patton Jr., and they needed drivers.One of those he chauffeured was Col. Billy Mitchell, whose advocacy for air combat was resisted by Army brass. Mitchell arranged to get Rickenbacker into a French flight school, despite his bad eye. In September, he was tapped to be chief engineer at the Army Air Service's combat training facility in Issoudun, France.""Pilots were largely on their own, picking up insights from fellow fliers,"" said Ross. ""Flying a plane like the Nieuport with a joystick was said to be akin to 'trying to fly a gyroscope.' This was where Rickenbacker's superior racetrack-honed instincts took over.""His superiors tried to keep him repairing engines, but by Spring 1918, Rickenbacker had qualified to join the 94th Aero Squadron. Its most famous member, Raoul Lufbery, was a French expatriate who took him under his wing and taught him how to dogfight.On Sept. 25, now captain of the squadron, Rickenbacker was flying solo over Verdun on what was to become his most famous mission. In his French Spad XIII, he went after two German reconnaissance planes, dodging their gunners before shooting down one plane. Then he came under attack by five fighters and he downed one and escaped. He belatedly received the Medal of Honor for this in 1931, as well as a record eight Distinguished Service Crosses, holding the Ace of Aces title until World War II.After returning home, he founded Rickenbacker Motor in Detroit in 1920, and it soon had 600 dealerships.""Rickenbacker Motors announced with great fanfare that its 1924 automobiles would include a reliable, state-of-the-art, four-wheel braking system,"" said Groom. ""This caught the other auto companies by surprise, because they had large inventories of cars and it was too late for them to change. They ran an ad campaigning that charged, falsely, that the four-wheel braking system was unsafe, causing cars to skid out of control in rain, perhaps hurl passengers into the windshield.""Rickenbacker's invention was decades ahead of its time, but the company went into a tailspin during the 1925 recession and was out of business two years later. He personally owed creditors $250,000, but instead of declaring bankruptcy, Rickenbacker eventually repaid them.Rickenbacker put together a syndicate to buy the Indiana Motor Speedway at the end of 1927. It was very profitable, but shut down during World War II to conserve fuel and he sold it in 1945.General Motors (GM) recruited Rickenbacker to help it enter aviation, including the acquisition of Fokker Aircraft and North American Aviation, an umbrella that included Eastern Air Transportation. In 1935, he merged Eastern with Florida Airways to form Eastern Air Lines, and three years later bought it from GM for $3.5 million ($59 million in today's money).Rickenbacker ""ran his company in much the same manner he had commanded the 94th Squadron in World War I,"" his New York Times obituary said. ""He set impossible goals, and then went out and achieved them himself before complaints got out of hand."" And it credited him with being ""the first man to prove that airlines could be made profitable, and then the first to prove that they could be run without a Government subsidy and kept profitable.""""Eastern was the blue chip of the airline industry then,"" venture capitalist and Rickenbacker friend Laurance Rockefeller is quoted as saying in ""Eastern Airlines: A History, 1926-1991. ""His forte was his ability to analyze costs — that was the key to his early success.""It was while traveling for business that Rickenbacker was a passenger on an Eastern flight in February 1941 that crashed in Atlanta. His injuries were so extensive that the emergency rescue team initially left him for dead and it took months for him to recover.In October 1942, Secretary of War Harold Stimson asked Rickenbacker to undertake a sensitive mission to assess the situation in the conflict's Pacific theater. Over the central Pacific, Rickenbacker and the nine crewmen went down and all but one survived for 24 days in life rafts. In 1943, he traveled to the Soviet Union and China to report on their wartime needs.Eastern Air Lines would become the most profitable commercial airline in the postwar era, but he was ousted in 1959 and it went into a tailspin after deregulation and was liquidated in 1991. Rickenbacker died two decades later at 82.""It was Rickenbacker's courage in extremity that served as a model for successive generations of explorers, adventurers, and warriors and an ever vaster host of risk takers, entrepreneurs, and executives,"" wrote Ross. ""He was many things — daredevil, tinkerer, cool risk manager, improviser, showman, tactician, and leader — but always it was his enduring courage that shone like a beacon for the better part of a century, showing America what it could be and challenging it to get here.""Most successful American fighter pilot during World War I and founder of Eastern Air Lines.Overcame: Barriers to becoming a fighter pilot, business failure, physical challenges.Lesson: Intense practice and calculated risk can achieve the seemingly impossible.""I can give you a six-word formula for success: Think things through, then follow through.""MORE ABOUT LEADERS & SUCCESS:Igor Sikorsky's Dream Took Flight With The HelicopterJimmy Doolittle Wrecked Japan's Invincible ImageGail Halvorsen Bombed Berlin With Candy During The 1940s Airlift

98,COL,"Peter Tomich always answered the Navy's call. For most of his adult life, it was his only family. And when it came time to risk his life to save his shipmates, he did so unhesitatingly.Tomich (1893-1941) was one of 15 men who received the Medal of Honor — the nation's highest military decoration — for his actions during the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on Dec. 7, 1941.On that day 75 years ago, the attack took 2,400 American lives including Tomich's. Nineteen ships of the Pacific Fleet were sunk or damaged, and it brought the U.S. into World War II.Doug Sterner, a military historian and founder of the ""Home of Heroes"" website, said ""at age 48, Tomich had almost 23 years of naval experience. During that time the Navy became his life, wife and family. His next of kin, the sailors he worked with.""Tomich's Medal of Honor citation reads: ""For distinguished conduct in the line of his profession, and extraordinary courage and disregard of his own safety, during the attack on the Fleet in Pearl Harbor …""Although realizing that the ship was capsizing, as a result of enemy bombing and torpedoing, Chief Watertender Tomich remained at his post in the engineering plant of the USS Utah until he saw that all boilers were secured and all fire room personnel had left their stations, and by so doing lost his own life.""Kris Harper, an educational consultant who works with Patriots Point Naval & Maritime Museum, told IBD, ""Peter understood the ramifications of the ocean water hitting the hot boilers. He had to have known the size of the explosion would have been devastating, not only to the Utah, but the surrounding area, as well. Hundreds of lives would have been lost.""He put his duty ahead of everything else. … He displayed uncommon courage in the choice he made to protect his shipmates and his ship at the expense of his own life.""Among the other honors Tomich has received, the destroyer escort USS Tomich was named for him and operated from 1943-1946. The Peter Tomich Power Plant was dedicated in 1987 at the Naval Training Center in Great Lakes, Ill. The Navy's Senior Enlisted Academy in Newport, R.I., is housed in Tomich Hall, so named in 1989.Shipmate Leonard Purifoy, who was in the engine room with Tomich at the time of the attack, said in 2001 to Thomas O'Brien in an article for the U.S. Naval Institute that the chief was ""a real good man … (Tomich) always took care of his crew first. He was real good at his job and at showing the rest of us the right way to do things.""Shipmate Lee Soucy added that Tomich was a ""conscientious guy who went down to check on his boys and the equipment"" instead of escaping.Born Petar Herceg Tonic in Prolog, in what is now Bosnia-Herzegovina, Tomich immigrated to the United States in 1912. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in June 1917 during World War I, but never saw combat. When his 18 months were up, 10 days later he enlisted in the U.S. Navy, in January 1919. He'd become a U.S. citizen in 1918.Tomich worked his way up the ranks. By 1941 he was a chief watertender, equivalent to a chief petty officer, and responsible for a ship's powerful boilers. The position required a detailed knowledge of the piping in the engine room and an understanding of the pressure gauges, ""the nuances of the machinery that kept the ship in operation,"" Sterner said. ""Tomich was one of the most experienced and best in the entire Pacific Fleet.""Tomich was assigned to the USS Utah, a former destroyer converted into a training and target ship.That Dec. 7 morning at Pearl Harbor started as picturesque and tranquil. U.S. intelligence didn't believe a Japanese attack from 4,000 miles away was feasible, Sterner said. It was thought to be a day of rest and relaxation for the fleet. Key battle stations were not manned, weapons and ammunition were locked up. Many military personnel were sleeping in, and several top commanders were ashore.Then at 7:55 a.m. that tranquillity was shattered. The first wave of about 350 Japanese aircraft, taking off from aircraft carriers that had crept undetected to within a few hundred miles of Hawaii, made their appearance in the sky.The attack had been meticulously practiced and prepared for by the Japanese. The Utah, moored off Ford Island, wasn't a planned target, as the Japanese knew the ship was an old noncombat vessel and didn't want to waste torpedoes and bombs on it.Despite that, the Utah was one of the first ships hit. The Japanese are believed to have mistaken it for the aircraft carrier Enterprise, which was supposed to be moored there.Two torpedoes hit the Utah and it began flooding quickly. The ship's senior officer, Lt. Commander S.S. Isquith, ordered all hands on deck. As crewmen raced up from below deck, Tomich raced down to the boiler room.""Tomich, ever mindful of his (engineering) crew, ran to warn them of the impending doom and to issue an order to evacuate,"" Sterner wrote. "" 'Get out,' he yelled above the horrible noises around him. (Tomich) could feel the ship slowly turning on its side and knew that in moments any hope of escape would vanish. He had to get his men ... out of danger. 'Get topside! Go ... the ship is turning over! You have to escape now!' He ignored his own evacuation order and set himself to the job that had to be done.""Unless the boilers were secured, they'd rupture and explode, killing hundreds of escaping sailors.""Peter understood his job and the risks involved when he purposefully and voluntarily stayed behind, while sending his men to safety,"" Harper said. ""Closing those valves would surely have been easier, and quicker, had he had help. He protected these men from the very real possibility of a slow and painful death while assuming that risk himself.""Sterner said that Tomich ""calmly moved from valve to valve setting the gauges, releasing steam here and there, and stabilizing and securing the huge boilers that otherwise would have turned the entire ship into a massive inferno no man could survive, on the ship or near it.""By the time he'd completed his duties, Tomich was trapped inside the capsized ship.The Utah's rusting hull still lies in Pearl Harbor, a portion of it above water. Fifty-eight men including Tomich were entombed, where it is an official military water grave.But Tomich's story didn't end there, as there was no family member to be found to present his Medal of Honor to, despite Navy attempts to find one.In January 1944, Tomich's Medal of Honor was presented to the commander of the USS Tomich, where it was displayed onboard pending the location of a relative.After the ship was decommissioned in 1946, the medal was displayed in the Utah State Capitol Building with its USS Utah memorial. Tomich was also made an honorary citizen there. The medal was loaned back to the Navy in 1963 and then donated in 1978. It's been displayed at the Navy Museum in Washington, D.C., ever since.For 64 years, there was no blood relative to receive Tomich's medal. The Medal of Honor Society says it was the only Medal of Honor to go unclaimed since the 1880s.In 1997 the CMHS teamed up with J. Robert Lunney, a retired read admiral in the New York Naval Militia who had been researching Tomich's case and genealogy, to find Tomich's heirs. Lunney traveled to Tomich's European homeland to conduct research at his expense. He enlisted the Croatian Genealogical Society for help.Lunney turned his completed findings over to the secretary of the Navy for verification, which turned out to be a lengthy process. Finally on May 18, 2006, a replica of Tomich's Medal of Honor was presented to a living verified relative, Croatian Army Lt. Col. (ret) Srecko Herceg Tonic, in a ceremony off the coast of Split, Croatia, and on the USS Enterprise.U.S. Navy Admiral Harry Ulrich made the presentation, and stated in the ceremony:""It is all too rare that we see the act of one man become the passion and spirit of many. But, so it has become of Peter Tomich … whose character and devotion to his shipmates compelled him to make the ultimate sacrifice. …""His valor inspires us to this day and his spirit has become the patron of those who follow in his wake as sailors. … The Tomich legacy touches all of us who wear the cloth of our nations. Will we be ready? Will we answer Peter Tomich's charge when called upon?""One of 15 men to receive the Medal of Honor for his actions at Pearl Harbor, Dec. 7, 1941. Named for him were a destroyer escort ship in 1943, the USS Tomich, and Tomich Hall in 1989, where the Navy's Senior Enlisted Academy in Newport, R.I., is housed.Overcame: The fear that rained down from the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor.Lesson: Decide what you are committed to, and the choices you have to make become clearer.""Honor, courage, commitment — Navy core values — (Tomich) had all those in life. He gave them to us in death."" — U.S. Navy Admiral Harry Ulrich.MORE HEROES OF PEARL HARBOR:Donald Kirby Ross Was Prepared At Pearl HarborCassin Young's Courage Made A Difference At Pearl HarborMervyn Bennion Stood Tall To The End At Pearl HarborSamuel Fuqua's Fiery Courage At Pearl Harbor

104,COL,"Last week, The Wall Street Journal wrote an editorial about YouTube restricting access to 16 videos -- down from 21 -- that were created and posted online by my nonprofit educational organization, Prager University. The subheading read, ""YouTube thinks Dennis Prager's videos may be dangerous."" The Journal said:""Tech giants like Google and Facebook always deny that their platforms favor some viewpoints over others, but then they don't do much to avoid looking censorious. ... Dennis Prager's 'PragerU' puts out free short videos on subjects 'important to understanding American values' -- ranging from the high cost of higher education to the motivations of Islamic State.""The channel has more than 130 million views. ... As you might guess, the mini-seminars do not include violence or sexual content. But more than 15 videos are 'restricted' on YouTube ... This means the clips don't show up for those who have turned on filtering -- say, a parent shielding their children from explicit videos. A YouTube spokesperson told us that the setting is optional and 'based on algorithms that look at a number of factors, including community flagging on videos.'""PragerU started a petition calling for YouTube to remove the restriction, and more than 66,000 people have signed. YouTube is free to set its own standards, but the company is undercutting its claim to be a platform for 'free expression.'""It is a good sign that YouTube's censorship of respectful and utterly nonviolent and nonsexual videos made it to The Wall Street Journal editorial page. It is a very bad sign that it had to. And it is a very bad sign that it made the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal but not that of The New York Times, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times or any other mainstream newspaper that still purports to support the classic liberal value of free speech.To understand what YouTube, which is owned by Google, has done, it is necessary to briefly describe what it has restricted access to.Every week, PragerU (the generally used name for Prager University) posts at least one 5-minute video presentation online. These presentations are on just about every subject and are given by important thinkers -- some very well-known, some not.The list includes dozens of professors at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Notre Dame, Princeton, Dayton, Boston College, Stanford, UCLA, Harvard, and West Point, among other universities; a black member of South African Parliament; comedians Adam Carolla and Yakov Smirnoff; two former prime ministers (one of Spain, and one of Denmark); Pulitzer Prize winners George Will, Bret Stephens and Judith Miller; Mike Rowe of ""Dirty Jobs""; Ayaan Hirsi Ali; Arthur Brooks; Jonah Goldberg; Alan Dershowitz; Nicholas Eberstadt; Larry Elder; Steve Forbes; Walter Williams; Christina Hoff Sommers; George Gilder; Victor Davis Hanson; Bjorn Lomborg; Heather Mac Donald; Eric Metaxas; Amity Shlaes; Col. Richard Kemp, former commander of British troops in Afghanistan; and many others. I also present some videos.Any responsible person, left-wing or right-wing, would have to acknowledge that this is a profoundly respectable list of non-bomb-throwing presenters. It's hardly conducive to censorship.YouTube placed restrictions on the following videos.Think of these topics, and consider the list of presenters. Do you see any violent content or sexual content? Do you see anything you wouldn't want your minor child to view? The only possible ""yes"" might be to the video titled ""He Wants You."" Though void of any explicit content, it deals with the subject of men looking at other women yet most still wanting their own wives. It has almost 4 million views and has helped a lot of couples.Obviously, then, the explanation is not that ""algorithms"" catch violence and sex. Rather, YouTube doesn't want effective conservative videos to be posted (each video has at least 1 million views). Does that mean that it has left-wing censors looking for every widely viewed conservative video? If so, it doesn't have to. Left-wing viewers simply flag our videos and others' as inappropriate, and YouTube does the rest.I have never devoted a column to PragerU. But I have done so today because if YouTube gets away with censoring as big a website as PragerU -- after a major editorial is published in The Wall Street Journal, after coverage in the New York Post, The Boston Globe, Fortune, National Review and many other places, and after a petition signed by over 70,000 people (which is on the PragerU website) -- what will happen to other conservative institutions?For the probable answer, see your local university.The question, then, is this: Will Google and YouTube do to the Internet what the left has done to the university?

107,COL,"It is not a theory that delegating the protection of our embassy and military personnel to other countries risks lives. It is a reality bathed in American blood.The latest reports on Benghazi released this week underscore the persistent dangers of outsourcing security.By all accounts, the security conditions at the State Department's consular facility in Libya were ""deplorable,"" as the House Benghazi committee's final summary report described it. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had been warned a month before the attack that violence was ""on an upward trend"" and ""unpredictable;"" ""lawlessness was increasing,"" and local militia groups that were providing security in many areas were at the same time ""undercutting it in others.""One of those local militia groups just happened to be in charge of providing interior armed security at the Benghazi Mission compound: the February 17 Martyrs Brigade militia.Yes, we entrusted armed Islamic strongmen -- linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, supportive of al-Qaida, and financed by the Libyan defense ministry -- to guard our diplomats. No, this is not an Onion parody.Instead of serving as a ""quick reaction force"" as they were contracted to do, the Muslim militiamen fled. (What's Arabic for ""cut and run force""?) Two days before Ambassador Chris Stevens was scheduled to arrive in Benghazi, the ""martyrs"" informed State's Diplomatic Security Agents that they would no longer provide off-compound security during transport or meetings off-site.""The meeting underscored that the militias in Benghazi controlled what little security environment existed there,"" the House Benghazi final report noted.The other entity providing internal security support was the British-operated Blue Mountain Guard Force, which employed unarmed personnel at three entrance gates and inside the compound. As documents previously obtained by Judicial Watch revealed, BMG guards had been abandoning their posts for three months before the attacks out of fear for their safety. Officials warned the State Department that they were ""undermanned.""Reuters interviewed the Libyan commander in charge of the local guards at the mission, who had applied with BMG after hearing about the company from a neighbor. ""I don't have a background in security; I've never held a gun in my life,"" he told the news service.As Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton concluded, the internal communications showed that the ""U.S. Special Mission at Benghazi was a sitting duck. ... All security indicators were flashing red and, perhaps, with a show of strength to secure the Benghazi mission, U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods might be alive today.""The same is true of two U.S. Marines, Lt. Col. Christopher Raible and Sgt. Bradley Atwell, who lost their lives three days after Benghazi. Remember Camp Bastion? On Sept. 14, 2012, three days after the deadly siege on our consulate in Libya, the Taliban waged an intricately coordinated, brutal attack on the base in Afghanistan. Fifteen Taliban infiltrators decimated eight U.S. aircraft, refueling stations and a half-dozen hangars, in addition to killing the heroic Marines and wounding a dozen others.As I've reported over the past four years, the Bastion families discovered to their horror that watchtower security at the besieged and vulnerable facilities had been outsourced to soldiers from Tonga who had been widely known on base to fall asleep on the job. Compounding the insecurity on base, President Obama's politically correct military leaders insisted on disarming Marines out of respect for their Afghan allies.Two years after Benghazi and Bastion, the Obama administration still had learned nothing. A November 2014 federal inspector general's audit exposed how the State Department's outsourced contractor in Kabul, Aegis Defense Services, failed to properly vet guards hired from Nepal and failed to obtain proper training documentation from explosive detection dog handlers. A separate contractor, Armor Group North America, shelled out $7.5 million to settle claims it had misrepresented the work experience of 38 third-country national guards it contracted to do work at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul.From Benghazi to Bastion and beyond, cutting corners has cost too many of our best and brightest. American forces and American diplomats deserve the best in American-led protection and security abroad. If we can't look after our own people, we have no business sending them to look after the rest of the world's.

108,COL,"Walt Whitman is often celebrated as America’s finest poet. But it was a different story when he was alive.Whitman (1819-92) was ridiculed and ostracized during his lifetime. His seminal work -- ""Leaves of Grass,"" a collection of free-verse poems -- was called by many obscene for its overt sexuality.Even Whitman’s family was unimpressed with his work. When he brought the first copy home, his brother George dismissed it: “I saw the book -- didn’t read it at all -- didn’t think it worth reading -- fingered it a little.""But Walt didn’t care. He was writing for those who believed, as he did, that “whatever satisfies the soul is truth.”Whitman had abandoned several occupations -- printer, teacher, editor, shopkeeper and house builder -- because he felt called to writing, in particular to writing poetry that explored nature and the self.Whitman published the first edition of ""Leaves of Grass"" with his own money in 1855, then printed, distributed and promoted it himself. He knew the poetry was shocking, but he also knew that its bluntness was the source of its power. As he once said, “All faults may be forgiven of him who has perfect candor.”Whitman was born in Huntington on Long Island. His parents had nine children, in whom they instilled many of the principles of Quakerism. Later in life, Walt would say that he accepted all faiths but believed in none.The Whitmans soon left for Brooklyn. Although Walt loved New York (and would rarely leave it until later in life), he did not see his childhood as a particularly happy one, in large part because his family struggled financially due to bad investments by his father.Walt’s formal schooling ended at age 11, when he became an office boy at a law firm. The partners there helped the youngster with his handwriting and composition and introduced him to novels and poetry. He then worked at a printing office, learning the craft of writing.At 17, he became a teacher. But though Whitman was a gifted educator, he didn’t enjoy it much; he once wrote a short story titled “Death in the School-Room (a Fact).”For the next two decades, Whitman worked at a series of teaching, editing and writing jobs in New York. He even founded his own newspaper, the Long Islander, where he performed all the jobs -- writer, editor, publisher; he even delivered the paper himself. By 1845, he had worked for at least 10 newspapers. All the while, he wrote poetry and submitted some of it to periodicals.Whitman always claimed he wasn’t really cut out to be a journalist. “My opinions are all, always, so hazy -- so slow to come,” he once said. “I am no use in any situation which calls for instant decision.”In his early 30s, Whitman decided to focus on his poetry and began writing what would become ""Leaves of Grass,"" a collection of poems using free verse with a cadence based on the Bible. He quickly printed 795 copies.Karen Karbiener, who teaches liberal studies at New York University and is a scholar of 19th century American literature with a special interest in Whitman, told IBD: “When 'Leaves of Grass' was first published in 1855, his readers didn't know what to make of Whitman's unheard-of informality with the reader (‘Listener up there!’-- he gestures toward the end of ‘Song of Myself’) and his shockingly raw, revolutionary subject matter. ... He was criticized with breaking every rule of good form and good taste -- of course, this was all intentional on his part.”It wasn’t long before the work was being criticized for celebrating love and sex in explicit and personal ways. Critics tried to get ""Leaves of Grass"" banned from libraries, and in some cases they succeeded.Whitman’s poetry also won him acclaim, especially from intellectuals, other writers and Europeans. Ralph Waldo Emerson called ""Leaves of Grass"" “the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed.”Despite creating a stir, ""Leaves of Grass"" didn’t put much money in Whitman’s pocket. So he returned to writing articles for newspapers.What was Whitman like? He had a striking physical appearance, standing 6 feet tall with graying hair and a long beard. He often wore shirts that exposed his hairy chest. He has been described as a radical egalitarian. He was well-mannered, friendly and open to learning new things. Although his poetry was enjoyed most by intellectuals, his closest friends were laborers.During the Civil War, Whitman moved to Washington, D.C., to volunteer as a Union nurse. In 1862, he traveled to the front lines to take care of his brother, Lt. Col. George Whitman, who had been wounded at Fredericksburg, Va.Whitman's work in a field hospital became some of the most important of his life, profoundly shaping his view of humanity. He nursed and ministered, he later figured, to nearly 100,000 sick and wounded soldiers in 600 hospital visits and tours.He became attached to the soldiers he nursed, mourning the loss of the many who died and staying in touch with those who survived. Whitman was fiercely against war, which he called “999 parts diarrhea to one part glory. The people who like the wars should be compelled to fight the wars.”Whitman was an abolitionist who supported the Union -- some of his poems presented equality among races -- but he didn’t think emancipation was worth the loss of so many men.""Leaves of Grass"" would be republished eight times throughout Whitman’s lifetime, each with additional poems and increased fanfare.“O Captain! My Captain!” -- perhaps Whitman’s most popular and well-known poem -- commemorated the death of Abraham Lincoln in 1865 and appeared in ""Leaves of Grass"" beginning with its fourth edition in 1867.Although the poem brought him more fame, he sometimes regretted having written it. “It’s My Captain again; always My Captain,” he said when a publishing house inquired about reprinting it in a schoolbook. “My God! When will they listen to me for whole and good?”Whitman suffered a stroke in 1873 and was forced to move in with his brother in Camden, N.J.Despite being partially paralyzed and suffering other ailments, he continued to work and published several new versions of ""Leaves of Grass.""Whitman died of bronchial pneumonia at age 72. His funeral was a public spectacle, with 1,000 attending.Whitman is considered the father of free-verse poetry. But he was much more than that. He introduced readers to previously forbidden topics -- sexuality, the human body and its functions -- and incorporated unusual themes, such as debris, straw and leaves, into his work.Matt Cohen, a professor of English at the University of Texas, notes that part of what made Whitman special was that he broke the rules of poetry, which at the time meant “writing in rhyme and meter, in stanzas with traditional shapes.” Instead, Whitman wrote in “long, unrhymed lines, with a sort of conversational cadence rather than iambic pentameter or some other meter, and played fast and loose with stanzas and other sorts of organization.”More broadly, NYU's Karbiener believes, Whitman “woke us up regarding what American poetry could look like, say and do. … His aim was to set free the American imagination, to awaken and encourage the development of uniquely American art. And he actually spoke directly to his potential heirs about their role in making this happen.”Whitman’s innovations went even deeper. He broke the boundaries of poetry that he believed restricted freedom. In a sense, Cohen believes, by choosing free forms, “Whitman built democracy into his very style.”Free-verse poet who authored ""Leaves of Grass.""Overcame: Criticism of his poetry.Lesson: “All faults may be forgiven of him who has perfect candor.”“Re-examine all that you have been told. … Dismiss that which insults your soul.”

109,COL,"As the Air Force readies 60-year-old B-52 bombers to prosecute the war against the Islamic State, a separate air war is looming over Congress amid opposition to the Pentagon's acquisition strategy for the B-21 bomber, which is supposed to replace the aging aircraft.Six years after an earlier attempt to update the bomber fleet was canceled due to high costs, the Defense Department awarded Northrop Grumman (NOC) the B-21 contract in October. Work was held up by a protest from the losing Boeing (BA)-Lockheed Martin (LMT) team, but the Government Accountability Office rejected it last month.Now the B-21, which could cost $50 billion-$80 billion, is taking flak from lawmakers over the Pentagon's use of a contract that leaves taxpayers on the hook for any cost overruns for the initial phase.“I remain seriously concerned about the acquisition strategy for the B-21 Long Range Strike Bomber, especially the use of a cost-plus contract for the development of this aircraft,” said Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, at a hearing earlier this month.When asked if he would use the defense authorization bill to block the contract, a McCain spokeswoman said the senator would ""consider his legislative options.""Cost-plus contracts have been used for programs -- like Lockheed's F-22 and F-35 as well as Northrop's B-2 -- that are now known for sky-high price tags. Production on the F-22 and B-2 ended early, due in part to ballooning costs.Despite McCain's concerns, the Air Force is moving ahead with its latest stealth weapon. Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy in Air Force acquisition, said last week that the service decided to use a cost-plus contract for development because of risks associated with building a completely new airframe.The options for the first five production lots, which include 21 aircraft, are fixed price, meaning the contractor absorbs additional costs.But Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said there are also risks with using fixed-price contracts.General Dynamics’ (GD) F-111 attack aircraft, Boeing's C-17 transport aircraft, and Lockheed's C-5 transport plane were all fixed-price contracts that went well over budget, he said. The government then has no choice but to help out the industrial base or risk a ripple of bankruptcies from various suppliers, he added, drawing a comparison to the auto bailout.""Almost without an expectation, the government has had to pay extra,"" Hunter said of planes bought at fixed prices. ""The government has the decision to cancel the program and get nothing, or pay more to actually get the airplane.""Critics of the cost-plus contract point to Boeing's KC-46 refueling tanker, which is under a fixed-price contract. The aerospace giant has assumed over $800 million in after-tax charges on the plane due to higher-than-estimated engineering and manufacturing costs.But the Air Force's Bunch cautioned against comparing the B-21 with the tanker, pointing out that the KC-46 is a derivative of a commercial plane, Boeing's 767, and has potential for foreign sales. The B-21 has no commercial version and no prospects at this time for international sales to allies, he said.And while the B-21 will use mature technology, there are still risks from integrating the technology into a new plane, Bunch added.McCain also has issues with the Air Force not disclosing the full price of the bomber, though it puts the development cost at $23.5 billion and the per-plane cost at $564 million in 2016 dollars.""Why would you not want to tell the American people how you are going to spend their dollars?"" he asked March 8.The Air Force countered by saying it doesn't want enemies inferring the plane's capabilities based on price.But the B-21 isn't so secret that the Air Force can't disclose the identities of top subcontractors, who can help build more political support among lawmakers seeking Pentagon spending for their states and districts.They include United Technologies’ (UTX) Pratt & Whitney, BAE Systems and Rockwell Collins (COL).Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a member of the Senate’s Appropriations Committee, said last week that he was pleased that the engines would be built at a factory in his home state, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, echoed his sentiments.McCain's House counterpart, Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, told reporters earlier this month that he would like to see more mature technology on big-ticket programs, lowering the risk and need for cost-plus contracts. But he didn't voice a stance on the B-21 contract.Air Force Secretary Deborah James said the service will continue to “communicate” with Congress about the contract, as the B-21 “is a capability we need for the country.” The Air Force estimates an initial operational capability in the mid-2020s.While the B-2 is a stealth plane, it still lights up radars on Capitol Hill and in the Pentagon, as it looms over the latest bomber contract. Considered a poster child for Pentagon overspending, only 21 B-2s were built at a cost of more than $2 billion each.But James said she's learned from the B-2's failures, and the Air Force is taking a different approach with the B-21 this time.“The B-2 remained in the shadows for too long,"" she said. ""Too many details remained classified too long.""
"
110,COL,"ARLINGTON, VA. -- The Pentagon must mitigate key software issues in Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 by late spring, or else the Air Force might have to delay declaring its variant combat-ready.The plane needs to be rebooted once every four flight hours, Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan, the F-35 program's executive officer, said at a briefing late Wednesday. ""Not a good metric.""The team is working to bring it to once every eight or nine hours, as on legacy planes. He added that the F-35 is ""a lot better"" than where Lockheed's earlier stealth fighter -- the F-22 -- was in its early days.Of particular concern is how the software in the F-35's sensors work with the main computer. If it isn't improved by the end of May, the Air Force might have to push back the Aug. 1 target date for the F-35A's initial operating capability (IOC).""If you don’t get that right, the system just clogs,"" Bogdan said.The service has a window of August to December to declare the F-35 combat-ready, but Bogdan said that Aug. 1 was the only date in his mind.Another critical issue is the F-35's Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), which helps manage diagnostics, maintenance and supply-chain issues and has been described as the fighter's ""brains.""""We are adding significant capability to ALIS, at the same time trying to fix many of the things we didn't fix when were trying to first deploy it,"" Bogdan said. ""Hard to do together.""A report from the Pentagon's chief weapons tester had mentioned the software and ALIS issues, and also noted the risk of smaller pilots getting seriously injured if they try ejecting from the plane.But Bogdan said that the report's calculation -- that pilots lighter than 136 pounds have a 25% chance of dying when ejecting -- was misleading and that the probability of any one pilot flying the F-35, ejecting and getting hurt is actually 1 in 50,000. Still, pilots below 136 pounds are restricted from flying the F-35.Lockheed is working on a delay to the ejection system of a few milliseconds to slow down the seat for lightweight pilots. Rockwell Collins (COL) is also working on building a helmet that weighs 4.6 pounds, down from 5.1 pounds.But the helmet's development is lagging behind seat development by eight or nine months and won't be fixed until next year, so the restrictions on lightweight pilots won't be lifted until then. For now, only one pilot is affected and has been moved to train on the F-22.Lockheed shares were down 3.2% in the stock market today. Rockwell Collins fell 1.6%.

111,COL,"Global Jihad: The British press has obtained from an ISIS defector the names of about 22,000 terrorists who have joined ISIS, including dozens of Americans and other Westerners. The data could prove a turning point in the war against ISIS.Intelligence sources in Germany and the U.K. have already confirmed the authenticity of the thumb-drive files, which include the addresses and phone numbers of Islamic State recruits from 51 countries, including the U.S.Recruits were also asked to give their blood types, mothers’ maiden names and “level of Shariah understanding,” among other information, according to Sky News, which broke the story.The treasure trove of intel could, for the first time, give the West the jump on the most virulent terrorist enemy ever faced. Based in war-torn Syria and Iraq, ISIS has operated largely in the shadows. Thanks to President Obama’s hasty withdrawal, the U.S. no longer has boots on the ground in Iraq to cultivate informants and collect human intelligence to infiltrate the upper echelons of the terror group.If U.S. intelligence analysts verify that the contents in the files check against data they have on suspects, the benefits could be tremendous, including: 1. Giving the U.S. and its allies a better handle on the size of ISIS forces and the scope of the caliphate’s global reach2. Helping Homeland Security and FBI better ID so-called homegrown ISIS terrorists who have returned to America and disrupt terror plots in the pipeline3. Buttressing evidence in the trials of several citizens already facing charges related to terrorist activities4. Aiding in the investigation of family members, friends and associates of ISIS recruits, as well as clerics at local mosques, and the mapping of the entire ISIS network in America5. Shedding light on the methods ISIS uses to recruit jihadists6. Helping the CIA sort out previously unidentified figures in the ISIS command structure and work its way up the terror group’s inner circle, where it can narrow drone targeting and decapitate the ISIS leadershipIf confirmed, the files are a goldmine. Of course, their value ultimately depends on how -- or if -- President Obama exploits it.We aren’t holding our breath.The news comes as the administrations says it has no plans to hold captured ISIS operatives for more than a month before turning them over to the Iraqi government. The Pentagon confirmed the short-term detainment order.“Fourteen to 30 days is a ballpark figure,” said Col. Steve Warren, a U.S. military spokesman based in Baghdad. “We are confident [the Iraqis] can hold them. If some escape, then we’ll just go catch them again.”For example, Sulayman Dawud al-Bakkar, an ISIS commander in charge of chemical weapons, was turned over to the Iraqis after being captured by U.S. special operations forces last month.Republicans on Capitol Hill blasted the catch-and-release program. They argue the detention policy hinders the U.S. military’s ability to gather intelligence through long-term interrogations, particularly in the wake of Obama's plans to close Gitmo.Some are fighting the Gitmo closure plan, seeing the prison as the solution for handling captured ISIS soldiers and exploiting the defector’s data.On Thursday, more than a dozen Republican senators, including presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, introduced a resolution to send the captured ISIS fighters to Gitmo.At the CNN Republican debate in Miami on Thursday, Rubio said ISIS detainees need to be locked up there indefinitely.“They’re not going to go to a courtroom in Manhattan. They’re going to go to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we will find out everything they know, and we’ll do so legally,” he said.This issue deserves more attention in the campaign.

112,COL,"ARLINGTON, Va. -- United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney was selected as the engine maker for Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 bomber, the Air Force announced Monday, and the service is OK with Pratt also building the engine for the F-35 fighter.At a Pentagon briefing Monday, Air Force Secretary Deborah James said Pratt is the new bomber's engine maker, beating out General Electric's (GE) aviation division.James said that there wouldn't be any issue with the company handling engines for both the B-21 and F-35 and that she was ""comfortable with our choices and our strategy.""Northrop won the B-21 contract, which could be worth $50 billion-$80 billion, for the B-21 back in October, beating out a Boeing (BA)-Lockheed Martin (LMT) team. But until Monday, the Air Force hadn't disclosed details about the other contractors.BAE Systems, Orbital ATK (OA), Rockwell Collins (COL), Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) and GKN Aerospace were selected as subcontractors for the airframe and mission systems.United Tech shares closed flat in the stock market today. GE lost 0.6%. Northrop shares fell 2.3%. Rockwell dipped 0.7%, Spirit closed down 2.7% and Orbital ATK fell 2.6%.Boeing shares closed up 1.5% to 122.90. Lockheed shares fell 1.3% to 215.84.James said there was a ""balancing act"" in sharing information with the public but also protecting information against cyber and other threats. The information about the subcontractors was released only after the companies had protection plans in place.""With the B-21 we are leaning forward and trying to be more transparent,"" she said.Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy in Air Force acquisition, said the service would continue to be transparent with Congress about the program after Sen. John McCain threatened to block the bomber as long as it was was procured using a cost-plus contract.Bunch wouldn't give contract value or incentive amounts but said he would disclose more information about the bomber as it becomes available.

Mucci’s aim was to rescue those POWs in January 1945.“If any of you think you can’t hold up under all that,” he said of the preparation, “I’ll send you to the hospital, and you can spend the rest of the war washing nurses’ panties.”As it turned out, Mucci’s men -- 100-plus from the 6th Ranger Battalion, 100 Philippine guerrillas and 13 soldiers of the Alamo Scout Army commando unit -- rescued all 511 POWs at the Cabanatuan camp 60 miles north of Manila.“This guy was a true leader,” author Patrick O’Donnell, who interviewed Mucci over the phone in 1996, told IBD. “He was cut from the same cloth as Earl Rudder (a key leader of the Boys of Pointe du Hoc during the invasion of Normandy, France, in 1944). Mucci survives Pearl Harbor and suddenly has to take a bunch of mule skinners -- soldiers who hiked mountains with Howitzer-packing mules until mechanization ended that -- and turn them into Rangers. This was totally unique.“It was a daunting task, a true test of leadership. It was amazing how he turned these men into a cohesive unit able to pull off one of the great raids in World War II -- or ever, in terms of people lost and saved.“It was an incredible rescue mission: marching 30 miles behind enemy lines, hostile Japanese units, setting up roadblocks, assaulting the compound. It took great planning and adjusting.”Mucci (1909-97) so indoctrinated his commandos, they were all in at crunchtime. One was Capt. Robert Prince, who would spearhead the assault.As Prince told O’Donnell for the 2002 book “Into the Rising Sun,” the GIs were gung-ho, even knowing the odds were against them living through the ordeal.“I’m going to turn around,” Prince said at formation, “and every man that wants to volunteer take one step forward.”The captain recalled: “I turned around, and they were all in the same row. I thought none of them stepped forward, when actually they all stepped forward.”To rescue the POWs -- mostly American soldiers -- Mucci’s men had to stealthily cover Philippine land swarming with 9,000 Japanese combat troops, then knock out the guards, charge into the compound, corral the prisoners and lead them all the way back to friendly lines.The Mucci operation started on Jan. 28 and climaxed spectacularly on Jan. 30.Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who greeted Mucci and his team a couple of days later, said: “No incident of the campaign in the Pacific has given me such satisfaction as the release of the POWs at Cabanatuan. The mission was brilliantly successful.”Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the Gulf War hero who was an aide-de-camp to a Bataan Death March survivor, called the raid “a model for special operations, as well (as)… one of the most remarkable and tactically studied achievements in our Army’s history.”The raid germinated in the summer of 1943. MacArthur had escaped the Japanese jump on the Philippines the year before, and now as Allied boss in the Southwest Pacific he listened at his headquarters in Australia to three of his officers. They had also fled the enemy and woke him up to this shock: The POWs at Cabanatuan were suffering atrocities and were doomed to death.By April 1944, 33-year-old Mucci was in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, telling his men of the 98th Field Artillery Battalion: “I’m going to turn you men into Rangers. From this point on, we will be known as the 6th Ranger Battalion.”Wrote Hampton Sides in ""Ghost Soldiers"": Henry A. Mucci ""was such a lavish and convincing persuader that the Rangers supplied him with (a) nickname -- Ham, an acronym formed naturally enough from his initials, but also a sobriquet that captured his incorrigible knack for laying on the bulls**t with a very large shovel. His men didn't care -- they adored him, in large part because anything he asked them to do and anywhere he asked them to go, he was right there alongside them.""Sides told IBD: ""What was remarkable about him was that he delegated -- to Prince, to others who were also just kids, to Philippine guerrillas whom he had reasons to doubt. In the end, he trusted them.""MacArthur returned to the Philippines with a massive force in October 1944, and by year’s end Mucci had his target -- the POW camp at Cabanatuan, thick with survivors of 1942’s Corregidor siege and Bataan Death March.“There was no time for a rehearsal,” Prince told O’Donnell. “That’s why they sent us in, because there was no time, and they were afraid they’d murder those men like it happened on (the Philippine island of) Palawan. The Japanese poured gasoline on the men and burned them alive; it was horrible.”On Jan. 27, the eve of the pursuit, Mucci told his troops, “I don’t want any of our boys from Bataan and Corregidor killed. Bring out every prisoner. Bring 'em out even if every Ranger has to carry a man or two on his back. … Men, I want all of you to go to church. Get down on your knees and pray. Swear to God that you’ll die if need be rather than to let harm come to our POWs.”None wavered. “Every Ranger in the battalion wanted to go,” said Prince, “and only 121 could go.”They knew that once they neared the camp, “total surprise, stealth and speed would be crucial,” wrote William Breuer in “The Great Raid.” “When night fell, the Rangers would assault the compound -- with fury and deadly skill. There would be no second chance should they fail.”They were hardly going in naked. “The Rangers were walking arsenals: Browning automatic rifles, Tommy guns, pistols, bazookas and rockets, hand grenades, trench knives,” noted Breuer.With Mucci staying on the perimeter, Prince pushed his men to the gates of enemy hell in the dark of Jan. 30. “Suddenly,” wrote Breuer, “the silent night was split by a murderous crescendo of gunfire that echoed for miles across the flatland, as John Murphy and his platoon poured heavy fusillades of bullets into the barracks where the transient Japanese troops were relaxing in their underwear.”The shock and awe worked. The Rangers, who suffered two killed, rallied and carried the prisoners to safety in less than an hour, with Prince going “into each hut or building with my .45 cocked. It was dark. I called out, ‘Is there anybody in here?’ There were no replies. Only one man was left behind. He was deaf and fell asleep and didn’t know we were there. Fortunately, he was later rescued by the guerrillas.”Breuer wrote that when Mucci’s bunch reached the American command post Jan. 31 at Guimba, northwest of Cabanatuan, six barefoot POWs handed “the regimental flag of the U.S. 26th Cavalry, which had fought to the bitter end on Bataan,” to Lt. Gen. Oscar Griswold, commander of XIV Corps, who responded, “This is the most touching incident of the war.”The next day, MacArthur rode to the Army hospital, clasped hands of feeble former POWs and said, “I’m a little late, but we finally made it.”The general then told a chaplain, “In your next sermon, take your text from Lazarus arisen from the dead.”Outside the hospital, Mucci told the press that Prince, the Rangers, the Alamo Scouts and Filipino guerrillas deserved the credit. Among reporters covering the story was Life magazine’s Carl Mydans, who wrote: “Every American child of coming generations will know of the 6th Rangers, for a prouder story has never been written.”America thanked Mucci with the Distinguished Service Cross, the second-highest honor for valor.The Connecticut man who vaulted from West Point to national hero to retired colonel to husband of Marion and father of three died at age 88 in Florida.Said Prince: ""He made a Ranger battalion out of a bunch of mule skinners, and he inspired us and trained us -- and any success we had belongs to Colonel Mucci.""Led Army Rangers in a raid for the ages in the Philippines in World War II.Overcame: Heavy Japanese force at the POW camp.Lesson: Plan to the hilt.“We’ll succeed in this mission because of our grueling training and soldierly qualities. And by luck and grace of God.”

118,COL,"Profiles In Courage: Since 2009, a couple of Pentagon patriots have quietly been throwing up one bureaucratic obstacle after another to frustrate the president's goal to empty and close Gitmo. They are unsung heroes.With each terrorist released from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, President Obama gets one step closer to realizing his goal of shuttering the prison before he leaves office.But the prisoner transfer process has been deliberately slowed by career military officials concerned that their subversive commander-in-chief is sacrificing national security for politics.They worry that release of al-Qaida and Taliban detainees will endanger U.S. troops in Afghanistan and elsewhere — a valid concern, seeing how Obama's own intelligence czar recently confirmed that 1 in 3 Gitmo transfers have returned to the battlefield.In a new special report, ""Pentagon Thwarts Obama's Efforts to Close Guantanamo,"" Reuters news service is singling out two Pentagon officials, both Marines, for rebuke for blocking White House moves to release Osama bin Laden's bodyguards and other high-value al-Qaida detainees from Gitmo, and repeatedly blocking his plan to close the terrorist prison camp.Quoting White House sources, it cites Gen. John F. Kelly, head of the U.S. Southern Command, which includes Gitmo, and Ret. Col. William K. Lietzau, former deputy assistant secretary for detainee policy, as the chief opponents of Obama's traitorous prison break.The White House whines that the Pentagon officials and their staffs have sat on videotaped testimony, photos, medical files and other documents needed to secure the transfer of some of Gitmo's dangerous prisoners to Muslim countries where too often they are simply freed to rejoin the jihad against the U.S. and West.Even after the White House intervened to order the Pentagon to hand over videos to the State Department, military officials classified them ""Secret/NOFORN,"" which means it's illegal to share the material with a foreign country. After administration officials complained and got a more lenient classification, the videos came back virtually useless. They were filmed through ""dimpled glass."" This is fantastic.What's more, Pentagon brass have barred foreign delegations from spending the night at Gitmo, as the delegations visit with prisoners seeking repatriation. In another example of ""Pentagon intransigence,"" Reuters complained, officials have cut the time that the delegations can interview the terrorists whom they want to adopt.Such delays have resulted in the poor little al-Qaida terrorists spending additional ""months or years"" at Club Gitmo ""after being approved for transfer.""Yes, how terrible. They'll have to stay there longer and be ""tortured"" by satellite TV, state-of-the-art treadmills, elliptical trainers, soccer fields, porn-on-demand, private kitchens, prayer mats, prayer beads, prayer oils, full-menu halal (Islamicly correct) meals, imams and Islamic librarians.Instead of repudiating these military leaders for going against the president's plan, we should be honoring these patriotic obstructionists as national treasures.When Obama took office, Gitmo held 242 detainees. Only 107 remain, but they're the worst of the worst. They need to stay put, and the patriots in the Pentagon should continue to use any bureaucratic trick they can come up with to block their transfer.""You're detaining them to prevent a future threat,"" as Lietzau says. ""They are the enemy. If you were captured in war, of course you wouldn't release that person — they're still the enemy, they still want to fight you, they still want to kill you. I know of American lives that have been lost because of detainees that we have released. You detain them until the end of hostilities.""Or at least until this terrorist-sympathizer leaves the Oval Office.

119,COL,"Edmund Hillary produced two impressive feats in his 88 years. One was becoming the first person to climb Earth's highest peak — 29,000-foot Mount Everest in the Mahalangur section of the Himalayan mountain range in Nepal and Tibet — vaulting him into the pantheon of great explorers.The second was his resolve to lead a life of charity after becoming an international celebrity at age 33. Hillary devoted much of the rest of his life to improving the lives of the Sherpa people of Nepal.Hillary, melancholic and shy, was not always comfortable under the hot glare of the media spotlight.He eventually came to embrace his celebrity, but on his terms.As Paul Little wrote in his book ""After Everest: Inside the Private World of Edmund Hillary,"" ""He shaped his celebrity to suit his values, rather than compromising his values to deal with celebrity.""Edmund Percival Hillary (1919-2008) was born in Auckland, New Zealand.His mother, Gertrude, was a school teacher.His father, Percy, was a beekeeper who also ran the District News, a newspaper in nearby Tuakau, where the family moved a few years after Ed's birth.Ed had an older sister, June, and a younger brother, Rex.Peaceful DadPercy was a pacifist who instilled in his children a deep social consciousness that would inform Ed's later philanthropic work.Ed was a gifted student and skipped two school grades as a youngster. He was also, as he later described himself, a ""small and rather lonely child.""Ed spent much of his younger years reading adventure stories and trying to avoid the children and teachers who teased him for his gangly physique.Then it was on the college, at the University of Auckland, where he studied science and math.But his mind wandered to more rugged pursuits, and he dropped out two years later.Ed's college days were invaluable in one respect: He joined a tramping club and discovered his love of mountain climbing.After a stint flying search and rescue operations in Fiji as a navigator in the Royal New Zealand Air Force during World War II, Hillary returned home to help run his father's beekeeping business.Hillary spent the next decade developing his mountaineering skills.He climbed as often as he could, reaching the summit of peaks across New Zealand and even in Europe, which he once visited to attend his sister's wedding.His 1946 peak came at New Zealand's highest, Mount Cook.Hillary was a natural on the big rocks. He was strong, extremely fit and had extraordinary stamina and endurance. Plus, he loved the solitude that hiking and climbing afforded, and he never lost the joy of mountaineering.He once told an interviewer: ""I've always regarded myself in a sense as a competent amateur. Because of that, I think a freshness has been brought to it, that every new adventure has been a new experience and great fun. I really like to enjoy my adventures.""In 1953, Hillary was selected to be part of a Royal Geographical Society-Alpine Club expedition whose goal was to do what no one had: climb to the top of Mount Everest.Eight previous British expeditions had failed, but this one, led by British army Col. John Hunt, would succeed spectacularly.On that expedition, Hillary's 6-foot-5 frame proved beneficial.At 4 a.m. on May 29, Hillary and Nepalese Sherpa mountaineer Tenzing Norgay set out from camp to climb the treacherous south summit, facing toward Nepal.As Maurice Isserman, a professor at Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., who has written extensively on the history of mountaineering in the Himalayas, told IBD, ""On the slopes of Everest, as the British expedition moved up the mountain establishing new and ever-higher camps in the spring of 1953, (Hillary) would often push to the fore, his tall, angular form seemingly eating up the mountain slope with ease, despite the great altitude.""At midday, Hillary and Norgay made history by reaching Everest's peak.The two spent 15 minutes on top of the world, with Hillary burying a crucifix and Norgay filling a hole with sweets.To put Hillary's achievement in perspective, only about 1,200 of the 10,000 climbers who have tried to reach the Everest summit have succeeded, while 200 have died.Hillary approached his post-Everest life with humility.""I did not consider myself knightly material,"" he said of being knighted by the new queen of England, Elizabeth II, soon after his triumph. ""For one thing, I was far too impoverished to play the role.""He was also indignant that Norgay had not also received a knighthood, instead landing the George Medal, a lesser honor.EnergizedPeter Hansen, who has written a book on the history of mountaineering, said Hillary succeeded because he was ""ambitious and driven, but also modest and humble. Partly that means he was a New Zealander — willing to push himself in extreme places like the Hillary Step on Everest (now named after him), but also eager to share credit for the ascent with the whole team, especially his climbing partner Tenzing Norgay.""Hillary hadn't anticipated how much his feat would change his life. ""I was a bit naive, really,"" he told the Detroit Free Press a few years before his death. ""I was just a country boy. I thought the mountaineering world would be interested, but I never dreamed that it would have that effect on people who didn't climb.""Hillary married Louise Rose shortly after his Everest triumph.They had three children, Peter, Sarah and Belinda. Tragedy struck in 1975 when Louise and Belinda, then a teenager, were killed in an airplane crash.Hillary was crushed by the news, and he blamed himself because he had convinced Louise to fly against her own wishes.He was distraught for months, turning to alcohol and sleeping pills.But he recovered and found love again, marrying June Mulgrew in 1989, with whom he remained until his death 19 years later at age 88.After EverestHillary embarked on many other adventures, including reaching the South Pole by tractor in 1958 and ascending the treacherous Mount Herschel during an expedition of the Antarctic.In 1985, he and another titanic figure, first man on the moon Neil Armstrong, flew a small plane to the North Pole.The same year, Hillary became New Zealand's ambassador to India, an assignment that lasted several years.Meanwhile, he wrote or co-wrote 13 books, most of them accounts of his adventures.He also lectured widely on conservation and other issues.Hillary spent much of his post-Everest life working to improve the lives of the people of Nepal, whom he grew to admire deeply.In 1960, Hillary founded the Himalayan Trust, a nonprofit dedicated to the Sherpa people, one of the ethnic groups native to Nepal, who served as guides for Western expeditions in the Himalayas. By 2006, the trust had built 27 schools, 13 village health clinics and two hospitals, as well as numerous bridges and drinking water systems.""Hillary once told me,"" Hansen said, ""he hoped he would be remembered as much for his charitable work in the Himalayas as for his feats on Everest or Antarctica.""Hillary remarked: ""When I kick the bucket, I don't want memorials. I don't want statues. I just want the work to continue.""He did so much to improve the lives of Nepalese that in 2003, the Asian country conferred honorary citizenship on him.Peter Hillary told Little that his dad's upbringing shaped the Everest hero's values and direction:""They were a deep, philosophical family, searching for things, for a good way of living, and I think the Himalayan Trust was his way of fulfilling that childhood experience: 'What is the right way to live? Well, I am going to build schools and hospitals in Nepal.'""

120,COL,"Deception: Congress has found that President Obama's cash and prisoner swap for U.S. army deserter Bowe Bergdahl was not ""the best deal we could get."" In fact, it was a disaster that aided our enemies and endangered U.S. lives.According to a still-unreleased investigative report by the House Armed Services Committee, the 2014 prisoner swap of Bergdahl and five Taliban kingpins held at Guantanamo was primarily a political act for the White House's own purposes, not ""the best deal we could get,"" as the Pentagon claimed at the time. Nor was it a prisoner exchange to signal the end of hostilities, as White House sources told the press.It was all about President Obama's desire to empty out Guantanamo, a sorry bid to fulfill a campaign promise to the far left, and never mind the consequences to American security, according to the Daily Beast, which got its hands on the still-unpublished report.It also may have been a White House effort to ingratiate itself to the Taliban and forge a new alliance with the hand- and foot-chopping barbarians, by calling the war over, which at the time was a political imperative.But as an exchange, it was wildly unbalanced. Not only was it actually illegal, bypassing Congress, but the five Taliban kingpins were the worst of the worst, dangerous and malevolent terrorists.And according to one source, there was a gigantic ransom sweetener that went home with the Taliban killers as part of the deal. According to terrorism blogger Walid Shoebat, Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer (Ret.) reported the U.S. paid $5 billion ransom as part of the deal.Meanwhile, White House National Security Advisor Susan Rice assured the public that Bergdahl had served the U.S. with distinction. The White House even held a showy ceremony feting Bergdahl's strange hippie parents from Idaho, who went on to express odd ideas about solidarity with their son.Ten months after this bizarre production, the Pentagon slapped desertion charges on Bergdahl, openly defying the White House and leaving the White House ""narrative"" about the noble Bergdahl and his supposedly ordinary Taliban swap-mates in tatters.Who cooked up such an appalling swap scenario? None other than the usual suspects, the National Security Council's finest. Susan Rice got the first lies out, just as she did during Benghazi scandal, calling an al-Qaida-linked terror attack the work of a mad mob.The leader of the swap plan itself was then-White House deputy national security advisor Denis McDonough, who's now Obama's chief of staff, the Beast said.As for battling the Pentagon to hold ""the narrative,"" the point man was Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes, a creative writing major, who also authored the infamous fictitious Benghazi ""talking points"" that Rice expounded.All this shows what a disgrace the Bergdahl affair has become, a beyond-bad deal that was all about politics, not rescuing captive soldiers, and certainly not about winning a war or keeping Americans safe.It's a microcosm of atrocious White House policy that has failed the country time and time again.

121,COL,"Turkey shot down a Russian warplane near the border with northwestern Syria, drawing an angry rebuke from President Vladimir Putin and marking the first direct clash between foreign powers embroiled in the civil war.
"
122,COL,"Turkey said its planes fired after the pilots ignored repeated warnings about violating its airspace. Putin called the attack ""a stab in the back from the accomplices of terrorism,"" saying the plane was operating over Syria and targeting terrorist groups. He said Russia ""won't tolerate such crimes"" but stopped short of threatening any military response against Turkey, which is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, warning only of ""serious consequences"" for bilateral ties.NATO ambassadors were to gather in Brussels later Tuesday for a report from Turkey on the incident, the first time in decades that a member country has downed a Russian military aircraft.Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov canceled a trip to Turkey planned for Wednesday and recommended citizens avoid traveling there, citing the threat of terrorism in a country that millions of Russian tourists visit every year.'Common Evil'While global financial markets slumped on fears the shoot-down could be a sign the Syrian civil war is spiraling to a new level, political analysts in Russia and Europe said major escalation seems unlikely, given the risk of any conflict between Russia and a NATO member.Putin highlighted the need for cooperation in fighting terrorism in Syria. ""We expect the international community will find the strength to join forces in the fight against a common evil,"" he said before talks in Sochi with Jordan's King Abdullah.The incident shows how the four-year civil war is seeping beyond Syria's borders in unpredictable ways. It also highlights the rising risks of inadvertent conflict since Russia started its military campaign on Sept. 30. While Russia and the other powers involved — including the U.S. and France — all say they're targeting Islamic State, their actions often are out of sync.Hollande TalksThe U.S., France and Turkey all seek the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while Russia's strikes have served to shore up his embattled regime. In the wake of the deadly terror attacks in Paris earlier this month, Putin's calls for a broad coalition against Islamic State appeared to get a boost despite skepticism in the U.S. and Europe about his real aims. Tuesday's incident may set back those hopes.French President Francois Hollande meets in Washington on Tuesday with his U.S. counterpart, Barack Obama, to discuss new joint steps to counter ISIS. Hollande comes to Moscow for talks with Putin on the same issue on Thursday.U.S. military spokesman Col. Steve Warren said the Russian plane didn't respond to Turkish warnings, while saying that the incident was a matter between Russia and Turkey.The Su-24 jet was flying one kilometer (0.6 mile) inside Syria's border when it was hit and crashed four kilometers from the line, Putin said. His Defense Ministry said it was flying back to base. Turkey released what it said were radar data that showed the plane crossing into its territory before it was shot down.The downing wasn't aimed at any specific country and was in line with its rules of engagement for violations of its airspace, a Turkish government official said by text message before Putin's comments. Turkey said it warned the plane 10 times in five minutes before its F-16 jets opened fire.Pilots KilledTurkish media reported both pilots had been killed as they parachuted by Turkmen rebels. There was no immediate Russian comment on that.Neither side is interested in an escalation, said Daniel Fiott, a researcher at the Institute for European Studies at VUB in Brussels. ""They'll want to defuse the situation pretty quickly,"" he said, ""because this is not something you want to have on top of all the problems in Syria at the moment.""Analysts said Russia is likely to limit any response to non-military pressure on Turkey, so as not to risk a broader conflict with its NATO allies.""The last thing that Turkey wants is to get into a sharp conflict with Russia,"" said Fyodor Lukyanov, head of the Moscow-based Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, a research group that advises the Kremlin. ""For Russia, given its military operation in neighboring Syria, a conflict with Turkey is also not in its interests.""Frants Klintsevich, deputy head of the Defense Committee in the upper house of Russia's parliament, said any direct confrontation with Turkey over the incident ""would be absurd and unacceptable.""Economic RetaliationIn Russia, some members of parliament called for economic retaliation. One major tour company suspended sales of packages for Turkey, citing the unstable political environment, Interfax reported. Moscow is also a major buyer of Turkish farm products and other goods, while Turkey is one of the largest buyers of Russian gas.Relations between Turkey and Russia have soured since Putin started his air strikes. Turkey has at least twice warned Russia about incursions into Turkish airspace, threatening to shoot down violators. The government has also told Russia not to target ethnic Turkmen rebels in the border region.Putin on Tuesday accused Turkey of helping ISIS by buying oil from the group and providing military protection, apparently a reference to the downing of the Russian jet.'Aggressive Leaders'""You've got two of the most aggressive leaders facing off in proximate air space trying to prove something to the folks back home,"" said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax Virginia. ""This is very dangerous.""The last time a NATO country downed a Russian warplane was in 1953, said Joerg Forbrig, senior program director at the German Marshall Fund of the U.S. in Berlin.""It was just a matter of time before something like this happened,"" he said, adding that the incident should lead to more cooperation on reducing the risk of inadvertent conflicts in the air over Syria.

123,COL,"Frederick ""Fritz"" Payne, a retired Marine brigadier general, died this past August at age 104. He was the oldest surviving World War II ace. Aces are fighter pilots who shoot down at least five enemy aircraft. Just 1,462 have earned the title out of over 60,000 who have flown since World War I.Payne had five solo kills and helped down one other Japanese aircraft over Guadalcanal in his F4F Wildcat.""The speed of our planes and the Japanese bombers we called Bettys was about the same, and you'd try to get to a high altitude and then roll down and strafe the entire plane as you came from above,"" Payne said in a videotaped interview in 2010 at the Palm Springs Air Museum in California. ""The Zeros were faster, and if one got behind you, the best evasive action was to cut the throttle and they'd overshoot you.""The almost daily aerial combat, three major land battles and seven large naval clashes from August 1942 to February 1943 cost over 7,000 American lives and 31,000 Japanese, ending the empire's expansion.High Stakes""It could have gone either way, though,"" Michael Myers, author of ""The Pacific War and Contingent Victory: Why Japanese Defeat Was Not Inevitable,"" told IBD. ""The Japanese came very close to taking the vital airfield. They were more successful than the U.S. in surface naval actions at night and an even match in the carrier battles of the Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz. But the Americans had the edge in the air war.""Payne was born in 1911 in Elmira, N.Y. His father was a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and participated in the Spanish-American War's Battle of Manila Bay.Payne entered Annapolis in 1930 but left two years later as the Depression affected his family and he moved with them near San Diego.He became interested in flying while watching planes at Coronado's naval station. He was told that if he earned a degree while serving in the Reserve Officer Training Corps, he could qualify as a pilot, so he completed his studies in 1935 at the University of Arizona in Tucson.From there he entered the Marines' aviation program as a second lieutenant at a base in Pensacola, Fla., flying Boeing F4B biplanes.After training in maneuvers at Quantico, Va., he returned to Coronado, then shipped off to Hawaii.By July 1941, Payne was back in Coronado flying the Brewster Buffalo with Marine Fighting Squadron 221. It was scheduled to ship out to the base on Midway in the Pacific on Dec. 8 when the Japanese hit Pearl Harbor the day before.Payne and his fellow Marines were ordered to reinforce Wake Island but had to turn back when it fell to the Japanese on Dec. 23.Soon, Payne became executive officer of the newly organized VMF-212, in charge of training with Grumman Wildcats in the New Hebrides Islands, 500 miles southeast of Guadalcanal.In September 1942, with Payne now a major, the carrier Wasp brought the squadron within 300 miles of Guadalcanal.The team flew to Henderson Field, and shortly after takeoff, a submarine sank the Wasp.With the Marines at the airfield under constant incoming fire, Payne took to the sky to thwart enemy planes. At 25,000 feet, his guns froze; he returned to base and waited days for them to be fixed.By late in the month, Henderson had 71 aircraft vs. the 117 that the Japanese could fly from their base 600 miles away. Payne's new outfit, VMF-223, took to the air and encountered 25 bombers protected by 30 Zeros.""He picked out a bomber toward the tail of the formation and closed to effective range,"" wrote Max Brand in ""Fighter Squadron at Guadalcanal."" ""He watched it fall apart. ... Suddenly, another came in from the rear, so close they nearly collided, and he barely had time to squeeze the trigger and get in one burst at the second plane.""The sky is like that in war; now empty as a desert, now full of whale-shaped bombers, now alive with fighters as quick and savage as thin-sided barracuda.""Payne prepared for another go at the formation when he realized the rest of the Marine squadron had left. He was given shared credit for the first bomber, which another pilot had also hit, when he got back to the base.Later in the week Payne knocked down his first solo bomber kill. ""They were our priority because they were killing our troops on the ground,"" he said.Soon he came down with malaria with a torrid temperature, and it almost did what the enemy couldn't.At 27,000 feet, he vomited into his oxygen mask and blacked out.When he came to, the plane was at 8,000 feet and falling fast, but he managed to pull out. That was it for a while — he was shipped off to a hospital for a couple of weeks.InvasionThe next month, October 1942, the Japanese bombarded Henderson and landed 15,000 troops, bringing their total to 20,000 vs. 23,000 Allies. ""We would dig foxholes as deep as we could and then try to find a piece of iron to put on top to protect us from shrapnel,"" Payne said. ""We were really scared at night, when their ships would start shelling us.""In the Oct. 18-23 period, Payne was back with the 212. He downed two more bombers and was victorious in dogfights with two Zeros.""Fritz described these as free-for-alls, a type of combat in which numerous planes are zooming about, and he was making evasive moves and turning in an effort to get an enemy in his sites and squeeze off a few shots before losing him,"" said Bob Andrade, an aviation historian and longtime friend. ""Another time he pulled the trigger, but his guns failed. His plane often returned full of holes.""Meanwhile, Payne took over as the 212's commander when Lt. Col. Joe Bauer was killed on Oct. 16, and he served until February 1943.But Payne had to leave Guadalcanal on Oct. 27, 1942, to be treated for malaria, with quinine scarce.The squadron followed him to California, stationed at El Toro Marine Air Base, where Payne was promoted to lieutenant colonel.In early 1943, Payne and three other airmen met Brand to discuss writing a book about their experience. Brand was the pen name of Frederick Faust, the author of popular novels and movie screenplays.He worked on the book until his death while serving as a war correspondent in Italy in May 1944, when the manuscript disappeared.Wedding And FamilyIn 1949 — four years after war's end — Payne was stationed at the Presidio in San Francisco and married Dorothy, a Navy widow, and adopted her two children. They would have one child together.During the Korean War in 1952, Payne took charge of a forward radar control group and flew Corsairs and AD-6s seeking to destroy radar sites. He then was a liaison officer with the 5th Air Force in Seoul.The war ended in 1953, and two years later Payne took command of a helicopter squadron in Tustin, Calif. He finished his career as tactical air commander during atomic testing and retired from active duty as a brigadier general in 1958.In addition to being recognized as an ace, he was awarded the Navy Cross for his actions at Guadalcanal, the second highest honor for valor. He also received the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross and a Silver Star.Payne worked for Southern California Edison for 24 years, managing its aircraft and helicopter field operations before retiring in 1976. He and Dorothy lived in Rancho Mirage until she died in 2011.Before he was killed, Brand had given a copy of his manuscript to a member of the 212, Capt. Mel Freeman, and it eventually reached Payne and Andrade. They contacted Brand's daughter, Jane Faust Easton, who discovered that she had another version, and she and her husband completed the final manuscript. ""Fighter Squadron at Guadalcanal"" was published by the Naval Institute Press in 1996.In the introduction, Payne wrote: ""This is about Americans engaged in a global struggle for survival. ... It is about a future that we enjoy now but which seemed very uncertain.""Said the Palm Springs Air Museum's director, Fred Bell: ""He was an extraordinary guy who was very humble, and we can only hope we can live up to his and others' examples and carry on in their footsteps, remembering what they did.""

125,COL,"Barney Barnum was shot at for the first time right after he arrived in South Vietnam in December 1965. As a first lieutenant, he was an artillery observer for E Battery in support of H Company, 2nd, 9th Marines, 3rd Marine Division, at the end of an uneventful operation in a strategic northern province.Then the Viet Cong ambushed the outfit at the village of Ky Phu.""We were under intense fire, and I hit the deck,"" Barnum told IBD from his home in Reston, Va. ""I didn't know where the next senior officer was, but the radio operator had been killed instantly and our captain had been mortally wounded. Our medical corpsman tried to get to him and was shot several times. I ran out to the captain and carried him back to a covered position, but he died in my arms.""Hero Amid The HeatAccording to his Medal of Honor citation, Barnum retrieved the radio and assumed command of over 100 men, ""moving at once into the midst of the heavy fire, rallying and giving encouragement to all units, reorganized them to replace the loss of key personnel and led their attack on enemy positions. ... His sound and swift decisions and his obvious calm served to stabilize the badly decimated units, and his gallant example as he stood repeatedly exposed to point out targets served as inspiration to all.""Harvey C. ""Barney"" Barnum Jr., 75, was born in Cheshire, Conn.A high school overachiever, he entered the Marine Corps' Platoon Leaders program at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire.After graduating with a bachelor's degree in economics in 1962, he was commissioned a Marine Reserve second lieutenant.He did basic training at Quantico, Va., and in 1963 he graduated from the artillery officer course. His first deployment was to Okinawa, Japan, and in 1964 he rose to first lieutenant in the regular Corps.The next year, he was serving as a guard officer at the Marine barracks at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii when he volunteered for combat.After landing in Vietnam, Barnum joined Operation Harvest Moon, slogging 20 miles through the hills and rice paddies of the Phuoc Ha Valley in a monsoon.VC guerrillas were so well hidden that patrols missed them as the Americans passed through Ky Phu, with H Company in the rear.Then the communists attacked.""They were smart in taking out the captain and radio operator,"" Barnum said. ""They figured the rest of us would flounder and they'd wipe us out.""After helping the corpsman to safety, Barnum directed a counterattack and called in Huey gunships.With his men running out of ammo, he organized the evacuation of the wounded and a 200-yard run for the rest to break out of the trap.Miraculously, Barnum wasn't wounded, though his pack was shot up.The enemy retreated, leaving 104 VC dead, while 2nd Battalion lost 11 and suffered 71 wounded.Barnum would return to the scene with a military historical tour group in 1996.Home And HonoredIn 1966, he was back in Hawaii and promoted to captain.The next year, he went to Washington, D.C., to receive the Medal of Honor, only the fourth Marine to be awarded it during the war (53 would follow). According to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, 78 recipients from all branches and all wars are alive.Also in 1967, Barnum went to New Orleans to receive the Veterans of Foreign Wars Man of the Year Award from Lt. Gen. Lewis Walt, the assistant chief of staff for manpower. Walt convinced him to be his traveling aide, headquartered in D.C., with the understanding that Barnum could go wherever he wanted after a year.When the time came, Barnum insisted on returning to Vietnam. Medal of Honor recipients weren't supposed to, because they'd already risked their lives far beyond the call of duty, so Walt had to pull some strings.Barnum landed back in the war zone in October 1968. He was promptly appointed commanding officer of the same artillery battery he had served with on his first tour, part of 2nd Battalion, 12th Marines, 3rd Marine Division.Over the next year, he earned a Bronze Star with Combat V and a Gold Star and a Purple Heart.He was wounded during Operation Dewey Canyon, a sweep of northern valleys from January to March 1969, the Marines' last major offensive of the war.Flying High, Then Hit""We built firebases on mountaintops with six guns and engineers so that when the infantry went down into the valley, they would never be out of range,"" said Barnum. ""I had a flag on top of one that Sen. Strom Thurmond had sent me, and my mom had sewn a flag that flew under it with our nickname, Thundering Guns of Death. You're only supposed to fly the U.S. flag in a foreign country at the embassy, but pilots loved seeing it after flying for 10 hours. I was standing in the doorway right under it when (the)enemy mortared and rocketed our position and collapsed the bunker. I took shrapnel, but had it taken out by a corpsman and stayed on.""To those who ask how he feels about America winning South Vietnam's freedom with the January 1973 Paris peace treaty, only to see the north's communists overrun Saigon two years later, Barnum has a firm response: ""The war was lost by gutless politicians who wouldn't stick with a winning strategy. We never lost a battle, and the failure of the Vietnam insurgency is what ultimately killed the Russian bear. If you were part of ending communism as we know it, you can be proud.""On his return to America, he served in a variety of positions, including with U.S. Central Command, helping execute exercises with 26,000 personnel spread over four southwest Asian nations.He was promoted to his final rank of colonel in 1984 and three years later became military secretary to the Marines' commandant.He left the military in 1989 and quickly became principal director of drug enforcement policy for Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.Also that year, a friend set up a blind date for the bachelor with Martha Hill, a widow with two children. They hit it off and married three years later. She works with him on his commitments as a board member of outfits that include Segs4Vets and the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation.In July 2001, Barnum was appointed deputy assistant secretary of the Navy for Reserve affairs.Two months later, the 9/11 terrorists struck, and he grappled with the challenges of preparing Reserve forces for the front lines.For the winter/spring of 2009, he was acting assistant secretary for manpower and Reserve affairs.""Our naval and Marine reservists are the citizen soldiers who have a can-do attitude and a wide range of vital skills, from law enforcement to medical, that are essential complements to the full-time military,"" said Barnum. ""They used to be thought of as weekend warriors but are now considered as part of one team. We shouldn't be making manpower budget cuts today so that the military can be an expensive social experiment. We could also save money by having defense companies make what we tell them we need, rather than having them come up with gee-whiz stuff and then try to sell it to us.""Terry McKnight, a retired rear admiral, who worked with Barnum at the Pentagon and later wrote the book ""Pirate Alley,"" said: ""Over my 30-plus years in the Navy, I had the opportunity to listen and learn from some of the titans of the defense establishment. However, for a student of leadership, the pinnacle of my career was working with Col. Barnum. Day in and day out, his No. 1 concern was the people who worked for him and the thousands of men and women serving in the military.""Before I went out to command an amphibious assault ship, he told me, 'Terry, command is very simple: Always take care of your people, and they will take care of you.'""Lots of people in the Pentagon said that, but he lived it every day. After 9/11, he knew our country would change forever and drove his staff to make sure that not only were the Navy and Marine Corps Reserve forces ready to answer the call, but that their families would be taken care of in time of conflict.""He is a true hero who has always gone beyond the call of duty.""

128,COL,"James Stavridis had no plans to stay in the U.S. Navy, let alone become an admiral. Originally, his goal was to become a Marine officer, like his father, learn leadership skills and switch to a corporate law career.In 1981, as his post-Naval Academy five-year commitment was ending, he applied to top law schools.Then Lt. Cmdr. Mike Mullen, the future chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a mentor, called.He recommended that instead of getting stuck with a huge law school bill, Stavridis should accept a scholarship Mullen could arrange to the Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy at Tufts University in Medford, Mass.This would require only a three-year service commitment.Stavridis agreed — and the military remained his life, all the way to becoming the first admiral in charge of NATO forces.Now he's dean of Fletcher.""Everyone should keep an open mind about career goals and seek advice from those who might know your potential better than you do,"" Stavridis, the author of ""The Accidental Admiral,"" told IBD. ""I never dreamed I would spend 37 years in uniform and become a four-star admiral.""Florida RiseStavridis, 60, was born in West Palm Beach, Fla., and graduated from the academy at Annapolis, Md., in 1976. By then, he had changed course and become a surface ship warfare officer.One of his first managerial jobs was heading an engineering department, where the sailors worked long hours in hot and dirty conditions far below the top deck.""The successful officer will be able to make his people feel privileged,"" he wrote in his chapter of ""Naval Leadership,"" edited by Thomas Cutler. ""He makes them believe in themselves, and the simplest way to do that is to believe in them himself.""In 1983, Stavridis earned a master's degree in law and diplomacy from Fletcher and the next year a Ph.D. in international relations.""This helped me learn that the world was a diverse place and there were no single silver bullet solutions for its problems, so you have to work with allies and partners, communicating strategically to create answers that would endure,"" he said.During his postgraduate days he married Laura Hall, who also came from a Navy family and had a degree in international relations. She would go on to do her own advanced studies at Boston University. They have two daughters, Julia and Christina, with the family usually based at Norfolk, Va., while he was often away for months.After rising in the ranks, he landed a big break in 1993, when he took command of the Barry, a new, billion-dollar destroyer.Halfway through his tour, it became the first destroyer to include women, who made up 15% of the 340 sailors. Stavridis recounted his experience in 2007's ""Destroyer Captain,"" amid his sideline of articles that reached 150 and command handbook contributions.Meanwhile, the Barry took Stavridis and his crew 130,000 miles to enforce an arms embargo on Haiti and Serbia, search for Iraqi mines in the Persian Gulf, practice anti-submarine warfare and conduct military exercises — while avoiding frequent hurricanes.Also with Stavridis at the helm, the Barry won the Battenberg Cup as the best-run ship among the 150 vessels in the Atlantic Fleet in 1995.Stavridis has always been a big reader and most mornings devours news, blogs and opinions in English, French and Spanish.A believer in continuous learning and getting different viewpoints, he includes in his ""Accidental Admiral"" a reading list that runs 20 pages and emphasizes ""the importance of the lessons of history.""Among his favorites: Edward Luttwak's ""The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire."" ""The Struggle for Mastery in Europe: 1848-1918"" by A.J.P. Taylor. ""No Simple Victory: World War II in Europe"" by Norman Davies. ""Winning the Peace: The Marshall Plan and America's Coming of Age as a Superpower"" by Nicolaus Mills.Stavridis writes of the pivotal Battle of Salamis near Athens in 480 B.C. between the small Greek fleet under Themistocles and the vast array of vessels under Persian King Xerxes.""Themistocles told his captains the night before to remember to tell the men of the galleys that they rowed first for their parents, then for their children, their city and finally for their freedom,"" said Stavridis. ""Attitude and training were more important than numbers, and they were victorious, enabling the first democracies to thrive and inspire our Founding Fathers.""In 1998, Stavridis took command of Destroyer Squadron 21 in the Persian Gulf and received the John Paul Jones Award for inspirational leadership.After running the Navy's first think tank about the 9/11 attacks, he returned to the Persian Gulf in 2002-04 to direct combat operations of the aircraft carrier Enterprise's strike group during the Afghan and Iraq wars.He's reticent about the details, only saying, ""There's a thrill to launching a Tomahawk missile.""GlobalIn 2006 he became the first admiral of U.S. Southern Command out of Miami, vaulting him on trips to 45 countries with 500 million people. ""I worked with Admiral Stavridis as he transformed Southern Command into a model of smart power that uses interagency and private-public relationships in innovative ways that address the multifaceted challenges of the 21st century strategic environment,"" said retired Army Col. Jorge Silveira, who served as his Commander's Action Group chief. ""He put on a full-court press to create a joint command by inviting 15 U.S. government agencies to send representatives to integrate with our headquarters. Among the results was a hospital ship that sailed to countries in the region and saved lives as it supported theater security objectives. His proudest moment was when we helped the Colombia military rescue three American hostages who had been held for over five years by narcoterrorists.""Next up for Stavridis, in 2009, was head of U.S. European Command in Stuttgart, Germany, overseeing 100,000 military members.Simultaneously, he commanded 120,000 NATO forces from 51 countries, with headquarters in Mons, Belgium.He was the first admiral in the post after 15 Army and Air Force generals, starting with Dwight Eisenhower in 1950.Stavridis made Silveira his military assistant, and they soon faced crises from piracy off the Horn of Africa to the civil war in Syria.Facing The Enemy""We worked hard to raise the 10,000 allied troops to add to the 30,000 Americans for the Afghanistan surge in 2010, doing everything from trading off desires of certain nations for specific missions to giving speeches, and the effort succeeded,"" Stavridis said.The next year, he oversaw U.S. and NATO attacks against Libya's dictator, Moammar Gadhafi, ending 222 days later after 24,000 air and missile strikes and 3,000 intercepts at sea.His third big preoccupation was the former Yugoslavia, where NATO had bombed Serb aggressors in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1995, then in Kosovo in 1999.At the campaign's peak, 60,000 peacekeeping troops were in Kosovo. By the time Stavridis stepped down, 5,000 remained.""My biggest disappointment in my four-year tour was our inability to build a better working relationship with the Russians,"" Stavridis said. ""By far my saddest responsibility was having to write 2,400 letters of condolence"" for the loved ones of those serving NATO in Afghanistan and elsewhere.In ""The Accidental Admiral,"" Stavridis recommends ways for leaders to be more effective: Prepare for key events. Be your own spokesman. Spend a quarter of your time on personnel matters, from mentoring to meeting new people. Enjoy relaxing weekends. Stay physically fit.His 2012 TED Talk, ""A Navy Admiral's Thoughts on Global Security,"" viewed nearly 700,000 times, digs into the use of smart power, integrating military action with diplomacy, humanitarian aid and other resources to achieve goals.In 2013, he retired from the Navy and became dean at Fletcher.His personal awards include the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, the Defense Superior Service Medal and the Legion of Merit with four stars.

"
172,COL," Because of conflicts between the advice the Joint Chiefs are supposed to give the president and their loyalties to their services, replace them with former service chiefs or combat commanders.
"
173,COL," Eliminate the unnecessary layer of bureaucracy of the service secretaries and their staffs. Instead, have the services report to the defense secretary through the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, as regional combat commanders do.
"
174,COL," Instead of having so many troops at forward bases, rely more on coalition partners and a rapid-deployment force.

He also recognized the dedication of the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese army regulars.""I came to believe that we could have prevailed if our leaders had bothered to understand the South Vietnamese and had given them a government they were excited to fight for,"" said Zinni. ""We never emphasized winning hearts and minds, while the NVA convinced or coerced them.""He rose to captain in July 1967, and when his 10-month commitment was up, Zinni wanted to extend his tour an additional six.But he was so sick with a maze of diseases, he had to be shipped to a hospital in Guam. Recovering back in America, he spent two years as a Marine instructor at Quantico, Va.In August 1970 he returned to South Vietnam as an infantry company commander, based in Da Nang. His battalion boss was Lt. Col. Mick Trainor, whom Zinni calls ""one of the smartest officers the Corps ever produced.""In November, Zinni was conducting an operation that ran into strong resistance. Three AK-47 rounds went right through his flak jacket. An emergency operation removed a third of the muscle in his back before he was shipped to Guam for skin grafts from his legs.By December, he had recovered enough to finish his yearlong tour commanding a supply battalion on Japan's Okinawa Island.More DeathAmerica's combat role delivered the Paris peace treaty of 1973.But with U.S. troops gone, South Vietnam fell to the communists two years later.Thereafter, Zinni pushed for combat command and training positions while sharing his analytical and management skills. ""Marines have always tolerated mavericks and encouraged officers to speak out, which has been a big factor in making the Corps an innovator,"" he explained.While Maj. Zinni attended the National War College in Washington, D.C., in 1983, Muslim terrorists slaughtered 220 Marines in a barracks bombing in Beirut, Lebanon.In short order, Lt. Gen. Trainor recruited Zinni to rethink anti-terror strategy. That led to the creation of the Marine Expeditionary Unit,which would go in harrowing spots meant for special forces.As a colonel in 1987, Zinni took charge of an MEU on Okinawa and conducted security operations in the Philippines.General On The GoBy 1990, he had his first star and was deputy director of operations at European Command in Stuttgart, Germany, a front-row seat as the Soviet Union came apart.""But we didn't plan for the end of the Cold War to give stability to a world which had ignored or suppressed other problems for so long, from illegal drugs in Latin America and Islamic extremism to ethnic tensions in the Balkans and disease in Africa,"" said Zinni. ""We naively thought the main result would be a big savings on defense.""After overseeing the Patriot missile defense of Israel during the Gulf War, he headed relief for the Kurds in Iraq and Turkey.Then came a promotion to major general, plus missions in Somalia later in the 1990s. They helped him see the bigger picture of smart power, the full deployment of assets and skills to reach U.S. goals.""The military can't go it alone anymore,"" Zinni said. ""We have to have integrated solutions to problems, and we have to stay involved in a closely connected world.""His next big leap came in 1997, when he landed a fourth star and took over U.S. Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla.His responsibility covered operations in what would soon expand to 25 countries, from East Africa to Central Asia, so he read 50 books to grasp their culture.The big military operation during this tour was Desert Fox, a series of airstrikes in 1998 to batter Iraq's chemical weapons.Zinni retired in September 2000 with 22 personal awards in addition to his Purple Heart, including a Defense Distinguished Service Medal and a Bronze Star.A year later, on 9/11, Muslim terrorists struck again, this time killing 3,000 in New York City and Washington, D.C.America soon hit back in Afghanistan and Iraq.Zinni had already prepared a report for U.S. leaders in case of a fight in the Middle East, and he was shocked to learn no one read it.""Regardless of their original positions on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, there's a consensus among the retired leaders I know that we relied too much on technology, didn't provide enough troops and didn't do adequate postwar planning,"" said Zinni. ""No one thought we would be putting $2 trillion on a credit card for the first time. Dwight Eisenhower came to the presidency from the strong planning culture of the military, and his presidency is known for its careful decision making, something we haven't seen in recent administrations.""He thinks Eisenhower, who after winning World War II was president from 1953 to 1961, would endorse these ideas to revamp the Pentagon and overall defense: Because of conflicts between the advice the Joint Chiefs are supposed to give the president and their loyalties to their services, replace them with former service chiefs or combat commanders. Eliminate the unnecessary layer of bureaucracy of the service secretaries and their staffs. Instead, have the services report to the defense secretary through the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, as regional combat commanders do. Instead of having so many troops at forward bases, rely more on coalition partners and a rapid-deployment force. Fund a more robust staff in nonmilitary agencies to provide humanitarian and political aid after or in lieu of military action. Improve cooperation with countries on economics, energy and education to prevent flare-ups.""If more Americans would listen to General Zinni, we'd have a better foreign policy and a happier country,"" said Thomas Ricks, author of ""The Generals.""After retiring, Zinni served on corporate boards and in 2009 was CEO of BAE Systems' North American unit. He's now on the board of Michael Baker International, a Pittsburgh engineering and consulting firm. He also serves on the boards of many not-for-profits, including Colonial Williamsburg.Meanwhile, he teaches at the Joint Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Va., and in the executive program at Villanova University.He's also a student, working on a master's degree in negotiation from Creighton University. If he doesn't ace that, you have a scoop; he's been on many diplomatic missions, from Israel to Indonesia.""I practiced negotiation before, but now I want to understand the theory,"" he explained.This would be his third master's. The others are in international relations from Salve Regina University in Rhode Island and in management from Central Michigan University.""I've always had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge,"" he said.
"
183,COL,"Army Col. James Van Fleet led his men on D-Day, but they landed at the wrong place on Utah Beach. ""As commander of the 8th Infantry Regiment, 4th Division, he had learned to seize opportunities where he could, so he made the decision to move forward, leading from the front,"" Michael Haskew, author of ""West Point 1915: Eisenhower, Bradley and the Class the Stars Fell On,"" told IBD. ""He had overcome obstacles by sheer perseverance throughout his career that would have thwarted individuals of lesser constitution, taking the action he could wherever he was.""Belatedly recognized for his leadership, he ended World War II as a major general.The next year, 1946, President Truman sent him to Greece to help the government defeat communist insurgents.Then in 1951, as a lieutenant general, he commanded Allied troops that routed North Korean and Chinese communists and was awarded the rank of full general.""General Van Fleet is the greatest general we have ever had,"" said Truman. ""I sent him to Greece and he won the war. I sent him to Korea and he won the war.""Van Fleet (1892-1992) was born in Fort Lee, N.J., soon before his family moved to Bartow, Fla., when he was still an infant.To The PointHe entered the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1911, but was a slow reader who didn't have good study habits. He wrote to his father, saying he should probably drop out, but was encouraged to persevere. He told himself, ""I can take it,"" a lesson he never forgot.He graduated in 1915 as a second lieutenant, among 36% of his class of 164 who were destined to become generals. Included were Dwight Eisenhower and Omar Bradley, who would receive five stars, and three would get four, one of them the late-bloomer Van Fleet.During leave on Christmas Day, Van Fleet married Helen Moore in Carnegie, Pa., and they would have two daughters and a son.After moving around the country as an instructor in the run-up to WWI, he joined the 16th Machine Gun Battalion of the 6th Division as it set sail for France in July 1918.First Lt. Van Fleet was soon in the trenches, and in November — the month the war ended — was wounded by a bomb.He returned home in June 1919.Van Fleet rose to major the next year and taught military leadership at Kansas State. Then he did the same at the University of Florida while coaching the football team to winning seasons in 1923 and 1924.By 1927 he was at Fort Benning, Ga., where Lt. Col. George Marshall was innovating infantry tactics.Van Fleet rose to lieutenant colonel in 1936 while training reserves in San Diego. Three years later the Nazis invaded Poland, so he was called back to Fort Benning to command 1st Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, which would demonstrate tactics to other units.In June 1941, Van Fleet assumed the rank of colonel and took over the 8th Infantry Regiment.""Many of his classmates had been rapidly promoted, and it was alleged that the reason for his career stagnation was that Marshall, who was named Army chief of staff in 1939, had confused him with an alcoholic officer with a similar name,"" said Steve Taaffe, author of ""Marshall and His Generals."" ""Instead of becoming bitter and despondent, though, Van Fleet focused on the task at hand, even if it was beneath his talents. Generals Eisenhower, Bradley and Joe Lawton Collins were said to have eventually cleared up the matter with Marshall.""On June 6, 1944, at 4 a.m., the 8th Regiment was headed for the wrong landing point in the chaos of the invasion of Normandy, France, with Van Fleet initially behind in a command ship.""After more than three years of training and planning, it was the first to make an amphibious landing on Utah Beach,"" wrote Paul Braim in ""The Will to Win: The Life of General James A. Van Fleet."" ""The lessons learned would save lives, and then-Capt. George Mabry, remembering his moment of trial after retirement as a major general with a Medal of Honor, said Van Fleet was 'the best leader I have ever encountered, and I've encountered a lot of them.'""Van Fleet joined his men on the beach and led them deeper into Normandy. His jeep roamed the front line over the next four days, and he was slightly wounded.Bradley was astounded at what he saw and gave Van Fleet his first of three Distinguished Service Crosses, the military's second highest award, on the spot.The regiment continued to lead the division in fierce fighting over the next two weeks that ended with the capture of Cherbourg.""He worked hard to gain intimate knowledge of his unit's personnel and operation, studying and analyzing not only the manpower, firepower and terrain under his control, but the same features for the enemy,"" said Keith Huxen, senior research director at the National WW2 Museum in New Orleans. ""He knew that he would be successful if he mastered these details.""A StarIn August, Van Fleet became a brigadier general, and in October took over the 90th Division, which had lagged at Normandy.He promptly made the outfit live up to its nickname, the Tough Ombres. Recalled one of its GIs, ""He acted as if he expected success, and he got it.""In November, the same month Van Fleet was made major general, the retrained 90th had its first big test in an assault across the Moselle River toward Germany.His men took heavy casualties the first three days, then pushed the enemy back. ""Swiftness, mobility, unrelenting attack — these were Van Fleet's principles, in football as in war,"" wrote Braim. ""He would regard the Moselle campaign as his finest hour.""The 90th pursued the retreating Germans to the Siegfried Line near the Saar River, where the defensive barrier of the border of Germany was most highly developed.The Americans made a surprise attack in December and, despite strong resistance, pushed inland, capturing many prisoners.Just then, the 90th rushed north to counter the German offensive that was the Battle of the Bulge.In March 1945, Bradley urgently ordered Van Fleet to take over III Corps, which had just crossed the Rhine River at Remagen, Germany, the first major unit to do so.By mid-April, Van Fleet had directed III Corps' encirclement of the industrial heartland of the Ruhr Valley and captured over 100,000 prisoners. The Nazi high command surrendered on May 7.All Over The MapVan Fleet arrived home in June and took over the 2nd Service Command in New York City. The unit involved the Army Reserve.In February 1948, Truman promoted him to lieutenant general and put him in charge of helping the Greek government defeat the insurgency backed by the Soviet Union. Starting with a poorly armed and badly led force, Van Fleet oversaw $300 million in aid, equipment and training, and by 1950 his Greeks had triumphed.Van Fleet returned to Washington and helped the Army prepare a response to the North Korean invasion of the South in June 1950.In September, Gen. Douglas MacArthur's U.S. and U.N. troops pushed back the communists and captured the North's capital.But in November, the Chinese army poured over the border, and the Allies were forced back into South Korea. Then came a political thunderstorm, with MacArthur criticizing the American strategy in public in March 1951 and Truman replacing him with Gen. Matthew Ridgway, commander of the 8th Army, the main U.S. force.Van Fleet was rushed to take over the 8th in April, and a week later a communist force of 700,000 struck. He directed a tactical withdrawal and blunted the offensive, inflicting 70,000 casualties.The 8th then pushed the communists north of the border, inflicting an additional 200,000 casualties.In July 1951, Van Fleet received his fourth star. Peace talks started the same month, but fighting continued.The next April, his son, a B-26 bomber pilot, was shot down over North Korea and died.The general left for home in early 1953 and retired. The armistice was signed that July.Van Fleet lived to 100 and died at his ranch near Polk City, Fla.
"
184,COL,"George Washington had only a few decisive battlefield victories. But he soared as a strategist. ""Strategic military planning starts with a clear vision of desired goals, to achieve the reasons for which a nation goes to war,"" Dave Palmer, author of ""George Washington's Military Genius,"" told IBD. ""Strategists must consider key factors influencing operations, such as tactics, weapons, geography and the quality of their forces. But the foremost factor is a full consideration of the enemy — his aims, strengths, weaknesses and capabilities. Perhaps the best example of strategic military leadership in American history is Washington.""Palmer, a retired Army three-star general and former West Point superintendent, says few histories of the American Revolution recognize its four phases and how Washington reacted correctly to each: From April 1775 to mid-1776, Americans had superior forces, and he was bold. Mid-1776 through 1777, the British army was larger and better, and he was cautious. 1778-81, bolstered by French military and naval forces, he sought decisive battle. 1782-83, with war weariness sweeping the land, he generated the will to persevere.Against daunting odds, he led Americans to independence.Virginia RiseWashington (1732-99) was born to wealthy tobacco planters near present-day Colonial Beach, Va., but his father died when he was 11.Receiving the equivalent of an elementary school education, he was a big reader the rest of his life.At 17, he was appointed to a well-paid position as county surveyor that let him buy 1,500 acres over the next two years.In 1752, Washington rose to major in the Virginia militia. As relations between France and Britain heated up, the governor sent him on a dangerous mission to the Ohio Valley to tell French troops to leave, but they refused.Two years later, Washington led Colonial troops at the start of the French and Indian War.By 1755, Lt. Col. Washington was an aide to British Gen. Edward Braddock during a 1,300-man expedition to the Ohio.They were ambushed and 465 were killed, including Braddock. Washington displayed bravery leading the retreat, as two horses were shot from under him and musket balls pierced his clothing. The governor made him a colonel and chief of the Virginia Regiment.""Unique among the founders of the U.S., Washington's primary education came from living life in its rawest form, deep in the woods, often with death a nearby companion,"" wrote Alonzo McDonald in ""Character Counts,"" edited by Os Guinness. ""The endless physical hardships he endured tested him in every way, and he survived by indomitable willpower, hardened to ridicule, failure and paucity of resources.""Washington retired to Virginia's Mount Vernon in 1758 at the end of the war and married a widow, Martha Custis, in 1759. Their land made them wealthy, though they were cash poor, and Washington diversified their crops and investments to pay debts.The expense of the war caused London's Parliament to tax the Colonies, starting with the Stamp Act in 1765. Protests led to the shots heard around the world at Lexington and Concord in April 1775.The next month, Washington was a delegate to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia and accepted command of the Continental Army.He forced the British out of Boston in March 1776. But in August, 20,000 redcoats landed on Long Island, N.Y., and crushed the 9,000 Colonials.The Americans suffered more defeats until Washington crossed the Delaware River from New Jersey to Pennsylvania in early December, taking the only boats with them so the British couldn't maneuver. With the weather worsening, the Brits set up winter quarters while many of their Hessian mercenaries were in Trenton.""It was the darkest hour of the Revolution, with Washington losing 90% of the Army to battle, disease, desertion and enlistments that were up at the end of the month,"" said Gregory Aldrete, author of the Great Courses' audiovisual program ""The Decisive Battles of World History."" ""He knew he had to do something dramatic and planned an attack before dawn the day after Christmas at Trenton, knowing that the 1,500 Hessians would be hung over.""Washington's 2,400 men embarked as the darkness, sleet, snow and river ice made the crossing dire. Still, they surprised the enemy, killing or wounding 116 and capturing 950; the rest fled.On Jan. 2, 1777, after convincing some of his men to re-enlist and recruiting from the countryside, he returned with 1,400 against 1,000 British regulars at Princeton, inflicting 100 casualties and taking 200 prisoners. ""By a series of daring maneuvers, Washington's twin victories restored the confidence of the Army and saved the Revolution,"" said Aldrete.Here Came The FrenchIn October 1777 came a significant American victory, with Gen. Horatio Gates beating the redcoats at Saratoga, N.Y.The victory convinced France to become America's ally.Then came the winter at Valley Forge, Pa., where 2,500 of Washington's men died from cold, disease and malnutrition.Washington's winter camp of 1778-79 was again at Valley Forge, where an effort by some officers to replace him failed. ""Washington's influence over his officers would have been limited had his integrity been an abstract virtue,"" wrote Caroline Cox in ""The Art of Command,"" edited by Harry Laver and Jeffrey Matthews.The winter of 1779-80 was brutal, with the American soldiers ready to revolt. ""With powers bordering on the mystical at times, Washington was able to calm the mutineers, appealing to them not to discard the 'time, blood and treasure' they had invested in the war,"" wrote Harlow Unger in ""'Mr. President': George Washington and the Making of the Nation's Highest Office.""On New Year's Day, 1781, 1,500 Pennsylvania veterans near the end of their enlistments marched toward Congress in Philadelphia.""Washington desperately needed their manpower and wrote to the notoriously hot-headed Brig. Gen. Anthony Wayne to avoid a reaction that could drive them into the arms of the British,"" said Stephen Brumwell, author of ""George Washington: Gentleman Warrior."" ""He told him to find out their grievances and address them. His counsel to talk, not intimidate, defused the crisis, as most of the mutineers re-enlisted.""The End Was NighIn the spring of 1781, British Gen. Charles Cornwallis headed for Yorktown on the Virginia coast to get more men and supplies from the British navy.In September that year, Washington marched south with 9,000 Americans and 7,800 French to corner the 8,000 redcoats.With French ships driving off the royal navy, Washington oversaw an artillery bombardment of the British field fort. It led to Cornwallis surrendering and the British sailing home in mid-October.It was the last major battle, but a peace treaty was two years off. The delay meant that Washington had to keep his Army in the field.""He knew he commanded the love and respect of his troops, serving without pay and remaining with them in camp through the most severe winters,"" said Unger. ""Most officers in the world's armies routinely left their men in winter quarters and returned to the comforts of their homes or rented quarters.""Washington retired to Mount Vernon after war's end. But the Articles of Confederation, which set up a weak government, made paying the veterans impossible.After the ratification of the U.S. Constitution brought a more powerful central government, Washington served as president from 1789 to 1797, sometimes threatening military action to quash anti-tax rebellions.""Fearing anarchy, disunion and an end to American freedom if he failed to act decisively, he transformed the presidency from being a relatively impotent figurehead position to one with immense powers,"" said Unger.Two years after stepping down, Washington died at 67.""The outcome of the Revolution was the result of many factors, but at the head of the list must stand the strategic acumen of the American commander in chief,"" said Palmer. ""He won for a variety of reasons, not the least of which was he out-generaled all his opponents.""

235,COL,"Shames says he can't elaborate, but said, ""I've had an amazing life.""At 93, Ed Shames is the last living officer of Easy Company, the ""Band of Brothers"" immortalized by the 2001 HBO TV series about World War II.Serving initially in the Army's Item Company, 3rd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, he was dropped behind enemy lines on D-Day, June 6, 1944.Over the next week, they fought fierce Nazi resistance around Carentan, a rail center between the Americans coming in from Utah Beach and those who landed at Omaha Beach.Victory came on June 13, his 22nd birthday, and he was given the battalion's first battlefield promotion, to second lieutenant.""If we'd lost, the Germans would have probably pushed us back into the sea,"" Shames told IBD from Virginia Beach, Va., his home with Ida, his wife of 69 years.Ian Gardner, author of ""Airborne: The Combat Story of Ed Shames of Easy Company,"" wrote: ""Carentan was where Ed's fighting reputation was established, and from the 101st Airborne perspective it was one of the most important and decisive engagements of its entire Normandy campaign.""Aiming StraightShames was born into an Orthodox Jewish family in Virginia Beach in 1922. His father and mother owned a grocery store, but Dad died when Ed was 5. Left with a Smith & Wesson pistol, Ed became a crack shot in the woods.At 19, he was attending the Steam Engineering School in Norfolk, hoping to become a naval engineer, when the Japanese hit Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.Reading in the paper about a new volunteer force in the Army's experiment with parachuting infantry, he joined and began training at Camp Toccoa, Ga.The 506th PIR arrived in England in September 1943 for further preparation, and Shames became the operations sergeant for the 3rd Battalion's commander, Col. Lee Wolverton.On June 5, 1944, at 11:30 p.m., the air armada took off for Normandy ahead of the invasion.The cloud cover required the Allied planes to stay low and slow, resulting in many being shot down.In the chaos of landing, Shames learned from other paratroops that Wolverton and much of I Company had died in two crashes, so he was attached to H Company.""German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel had ordered Carentan defended 'to the last man,'"" wrote Stephen Ambrose in ""Band of Brothers."" ""The country around it was full of very dense hedges at least 6 feet tall on either side of narrow lanes. This was about as bad a place to launch an infantry assault as could be imagined, as bad as clearing out a town house by house, as bad as attacking a World War I trench system.""Little progress could be made toward Cherbourg, the largest port in Normandy and a major strategic objective, until the bottleneck at Carentan had been broken.""After initial fighting and heavy Allied bombing of the town, Shames' 3rd Battalion moved in from the north on June 13 through hedged fields. His H Company came under heavy fire when he realized F Company was not on the right to protect the flank, having been driven back. After close calls, he made it to regimental headquarters to alert the brass. ""Without a doubt, his quick thinking helped to change the outcome of the battle,"" wrote Gardner.Fighting for H Company occurred on a sunken road — Bloody Gully — then 502nd PIR tanks rolled to the rescue. A bullet had taken out a piece of Shames' nose, but he taped it up and fought on.Carentan was the last battle in Normandy. The 506th PIR had taken 983 casualties, 50% of the total of all regiments in the campaign, with the 3rd Battalion the hardest hit. The GIs were sent to England for recuperation and training, with Shames reassigned to the 2nd Battalion as an intelligence officer.On Sept. 17, Shames and the 506th PIR landed near Eindhoven, Holland, as part of Operation Market Garden, involving 40,000 other U.S. and British paratroopers. Allied commanders thought the enemy would collapse, opening the way into northern Germany.Instead, the Nazis regrouped and counterattacked, making it daunting for the Allies to hold the bridges and roads essential to moving men through a marshy country covered by rivers and dikes.Shames spent much of his time working with the Dutch underground on reconnaissance missions. The Allies began withdrawing eight days after the drop, having suffered 17,000 casualties.On Oct. 2, the 506th PIR trekked toward ""the Island,"" an area below sea level with 7-foot dikes near Arnhem. After artillery duels and assaults, the front line settled into a stalemate while Shames, shot in the left leg, went to the hospital.In a few days he took over the 40-man 3rd Platoon of Easy Company. ""We all had nicknames and mine was SOB — Son of the Battalion — because I was tough,"" said Shames. ""I was a perfectionist and never satisfied.""Easy Does ItHe and Easy Company now had new orders: Help rescue a stranded group of 149 British troops, Dutch fighters and Americans.On the night of Oct. 22-23, Operation Pegasus managed to evacuate all of them to the Allied side of a river without casualties.Hitler launched his last great offensive on the Western Front on Dec. 16, through the heavily forested Ardennes region of Belgium, Luxembourg and France. It caught the Allies by surprise and became known as the Battle of the Bulge.Initially, the Germans had more men and were better equipped.On Dec. 18, the 101st Airborne rumbled by truck to Bastogne, Belgium, a key crossroads.Shames and his fellow soldiers were surrounded in the bitter cold without adequate clothing, food or ammo to counter the Nazi attacks.""Our patrolling let the enemy know that despite the situation, we were still on the offensive and I made sure my men constantly honed their skills,"" said Shames.The siege was broken on Dec. 26, and by then the men of the 101st were a legend back home for their heroic defense. But the fighting continued in woods near Foy, which the 2nd and 3rd Battalions captured on Jan. 13, 1945, then cleared the enemy out of two other towns over the next few days.Shames took shrapnel in his left knee and would receive a third Purple Heart, as well as promotion to first lieutenant.The Battle of the Bulge ended on Jan. 25, turning out to be the largest fought by the U.S. in the war, with the 610,000 Americans suffering 89,000 casualties (55,000 Brits took 2,500). The 550,000 German soldiers involved lost 100,000.Coming Through""Of the 500 platoons in the 101st, 3rd Platoon brought more men home than any other, so the hard training was worth it,"" said Shames.On April 3, the 506th PIR moved to Duesseldorf on the Rhine River. Soon, 325,000 Germans gave up.The 506th then rode by train to southern Germany to stabilize the area as the 7th Army pushed back the last resistance.Slave labor camps were discovered that had been producing fighters and bombers.On April 28, Shames was with a humanitarian mission to one camp that had been run by the Nazis and found 100 prisoners suffering from typhus and malnutrition.On May 2 he visited Dachau, which had just been liberated. The Nazi death camp had slaughtered 28,000, mostly Jews, with piles of bodies unburied. ""The stench and horror will be with me as long as I live,"" said Shames.On May 5, a cease-fire was in place and the 101st Airborne was ordered to take control of Hitler's Alpine retreat at Berchtesgaden.Shames liberated a bottle of cognac with the Fuehrer's initials, but didn't drink it for 20 years.Victory in Europe Day came on May 8. Two days later, while Shames was directing roadblocks to capture Nazi leaders, a car with Field Marshal Albert Kesselring was halted. He refused to surrender his pistol to anyone less than a major until Shames put a .45 to his head.Shames arrived back in Norfolk in September. He married Ida Aframe in January 1946, settled in Virginia Beach, and their two sons would join the Army.As to what he did after the war, Gardner wrote, ""Ed was subsequently recalled to service and much of what he did is still classified, but he and sometimes Ida were allowed to travel the world and experience different cultures.""Shames says he can't elaborate, but said, ""I've had an amazing life.""

237,COL,"Omar Bradley knew who scaled history's heights on D-Day. ""No soldier in my command,"" wrote the general after overseeing the Army at the Normandy invasion of June 6, 1944, ""has ever been wished a more difficult task than that which befell the 34-year-old commander of the Provisional Ranger Force.""That commander? Earl Rudder.When Bradley sought a man of steel to lead men up the cliff of Pointe du Hoc and nail the Nazis, he turned to the tenacious Texan.Lt. Col. Rudder came through. His triumph high above the Normandy coast helped D-Day deck the Germans from the west as the Russians rushed from the east — and in 11 months World War II in Europe was over.""Pure leadership,"" Patrick O'Donnell, author of ""Dog Company,"" told IBD. ""He was a leader of men. He had mental toughness. He was determined. It was in his DNA. And to think the whole operation might not have succeeded if he had not been there.""Douglas Brinkley, author of ""The Boys of Pointe Du Hoc,"" put it this way: ""James Rudder was the best of the U.S. military tradition. As an officer, he was one with his men. He was the perfect leader.""This was a man who went on a suicide mission, and it's one of the most remarkable stories of World War II. He told his men they had a 50% chance of making it alive. And when his superiors told him not to go himself, he insisted. No way would he send them on that mission and not put his own life on the line.""GroundedThomas Hatfield, author of ""Rudder: From Leader to Legend,"" also raves: ""He was simply an authentic person who had a calling in his life. He was very purposeful, with values that were as firm as was his character. He was one of the greatest citizen soldiers. The greatest, of course, was George Washington, who left the Army after the Revolution and returned to farming. Rudder was a reservist. He didn't make the Army a career. He wanted to return to civilian life for two reasons: an attachment to his mother and an attachment to Texas, to ranching. He was a man of the soil.""When Rudder retired from the Army Reserve in 1967, while president of Texas A&M; University, he was a major general whose top decoration was the Distinguished Service Cross, a military award second only to the Medal of Honor.His men never forgot.Rudder was ""one of the greatest men that ever lived,"" said Pvt. Jack Keating, one of the 2nd Ranger Battalion GIs who hit Pointe du Hoc.Heroic 1st Lt. Dutch Vermeer said that seeing Rudder ""control the operation saved our day on Pointe du Hoc. In spite of his wounds, he was in command all the time.""Star Ranger Leonard Lomell said: ""He inspired you to do your best. You just wanted to die for him.""Rudder almost died on that day 71 years ago. He was wounded twice at the Pointe, once by a bullet in his calf, and minutes later when an explosion fired cement fragments into his chest and arm.Meanwhile, as Rudder's Rangers ran into a Nazi gantlet above the coast of France, ""he had to cope with the unknown,"" said Hatfield. ""He and his men were cut off, isolated. They had no communication with commanders at sea. They didn't know the outcome of the invasion. Yet Rudder was steadfast without knowing when relief was coming. He remained calm, a dedicated leader. Some of his men told me they were better soldiers with him than at other times. That's because he was consistent, whatever the circumstances. He was always the same, authentic leader — and with him, his men knew the mission came first.""James Earl Rudder (1910-70) developed his traits growing up poor in tiny Eden in central Texas.""The family was stoic, and he became a man who was not easily ruffled,"" said Hatfield, who witnessed that character while with the Army Reserve in the 1960s. ""He was also extraordinarily competitive.""Rudder played football well enough in high school to get a ticket out of isolated Eden to play at John Tarleton Agricultural College, a few hours north in Stephenville. And play he did. Other than football, he had little use for the junior college (now four-year Tarleton State University) and quit.Yet he returned, completed two years and vaulted to Texas A&M;, where he landed a bachelor's degree in industrial education.The Depression kept him from pursuing his career for a year, but in the fall of 1933 he hooked up as a football coach and teacher of history and math in Brady, just east of Eden. ""He was a very conscientious teacher. And he made no compromises with his football players,"" said Hatfield. ""In fact, he was more demanding of them. The main thing was preparation. He lived in the future. He did not think about the past. That all carried over to Pointe du Hoc.""Rudder had been commissioned an officer in the Army Reserve out of A&M;, and by 1937 he was married to Margaret Williamson and on the way to having five children.With America gearing up for WWII, he entered active duty in June 1941 and rose to major in July 1943 upon taking over the 2nd Ranger Battalion, then was promoted to lieutenant colonel that November. He put his men through the wringer of assault training at various U.S. bases.At the start, his men ""were a disaster,"" said O'Donnell. ""They couldn't do parade formation or much else. But Rudder the football coach turned them into a unit obsessed with winning. It all emanates from Rudder. He turned raw recruits into soldiers who could act on their own initiative and change the course of a battle.""By early 1944, Rudder was in England and received details of the mission. In May, wrote Brinkley, he ""laid out the plan for his men. . . . The Rangers' task: climb the cliffs and destroy the Nazi concrete bunkers 4 miles west of Omaha Beach on the Normandy coast. The Nazis had a battery of six 155 mm guns, with a range of 14 miles, on top of the Pointe between Utah and Omaha beaches aimed at the boats and men storming in. From their jutting crow's nest, the Germans could inflict great damage to the Allies' armada of over 5,000 ships.""Added Brinkley: ""To neutralize these enemy guns, this elite group of about 225 2nd Ranger Battalion volunteers — Rudder's Rangers — had to surprise the enemy by scaling the 100-foot-tall promontory, even while under a barrage of Nazi fire coming from a concrete observation post. It was a daunting assignment.""To say the least. One naval officer said flatly, ""It can't be done. Three old women with brooms could keep the Rangers from climbing those cliffs.""Said O'Donnell: ""It was definitely one of the most dangerous missions of World War II and American history. The Rangers had to fight through a 'Guns of Navarone'-like fortress atop the cliff filled with bunkers, tunnels and artillery, and machine gun nests.""After crossing the English Channel, Rudder wasted little time, noted Brinkley: ""Setting a fearless example for his men, (he) was on the first (assault craft) to land. . . . He raced to the cliff and established a small headquarters in a cave.""The charge was made deadlier by the Nazis' MG 42, a savage machine gun called the Bonesaw. Rudder and his men still ascended with rope hung from hooks shot up the Pointe.Stratospheric ResultsAfter reaching the top — bombed by Allied planes that ""turned it into something resembling the surface of the moon,"" said O'Donnell — the GIs followed tire tracks to the Nazi guns and used thermite grenades to disable them.""The cliff climbing was tough enough,"" said O'Donnell. ""The German counterattack the night of June 6 and the next day made it all the more difficult. First, the Americans ran out of ammo, so they had to use German guns. Then some of Rudder's men were taken prisoner.""Rudder forged on with his next order: cutting the road between Utah and Omaha beaches.""By June 8,"" wrote Brinkley, ""the Americans were victorious at the Battle of Pointe du Hoc, raising the Stars and Stripes on the promontory. They had suffered 70% casualties. Yet their mission had been a military success.""

238,COL,"Imagine a PGA tour where the world's best golfers earn a pittance for endorsement deals. Mark McCormack couldn't. In 1959 the Cleveland attorney was moonlighting as a tournament organizer when he overheard players complaining about how little money they were earning.Few were as frustrated as Arnold Palmer, golf's top player and arguably the nation's most exciting athlete, who landed a whopping $500 and all the ketchup he could eat for pushing the Heinz condiment.""Appalling,"" McCormack said.The game was about to change.After hooking up with Palmer in late '59, McCormack set out to prove that corporations would pay enormous sums for celebrity athletes to endorse their products.In his first two years with McCormack, Palmer's annual earnings skyrocketed from $60,000 to $500,000.By 1967, the golfer's businesses, under McCormack's management, were ringing up sales of $15 million, worth $100 million today.Using Palmer as his springboard, McCormack (1930-2003) went on to create the International Management Group, a billion-dollar firm that represented a stable of sporting legends from Bjorn Borg and Jean-Claude Killy to Tiger Woods and Derek Jeter.By the time McCormack died, his Cleveland-based company had 80 offices in 32 countries employing almost 3,000 people.Rich LegacyForbes magazine estimated his net worth at $1 billion.Over the course of his groundbreaking career, Golf magazine called McCormack ""the most powerful man in golf.""Tennis magazine said he was ""the most powerful man in tennis.""Sports Illustrated cited him as ""the most powerful man in sports.""And the Times of London noted he was ""one of the 1,000 people who have most influenced the 20th century.""""I don't think it's an overstatement to say that kind of like Henry Ford and Bill Gates, Mark McCormack literally created and fostered and led an entirely new worldwide industry,"" CBS (CBS) Sports Chairman Sean McManus said following McCormack's death.McCormack was born in Chicago, the only child of a farm journal publisher. Mark's self-discipline came from his German-Irish mother, who always laid out breakfast the night before and planned her family's day to the split second.Mark was just 6 when he was hit by a car and suffered a fractured skull. His doctors said that contact sports like football and basketball were out, so he turned to golf.A steady player, he won the Chicago high school title and went on to play No. 1 at William & Mary.During a match with Wake Forest, he met Palmer, the star of the Wake Forest Demon Deacons.After graduation from Yale Law School and a hitch with the Army, McCormack joined a Cleveland law firm but walked away after his handshake deal with Palmer.""He was an old-school businessman whose word was his bond,"" Jon Franklin, CEO of Glory Sports International and a former agent with IMG, told IBD. ""You could do a deal on a napkin, and he'd stick by his word.""After starting IMG in 1960, McCormack quickly snared lucrative exhibitions and endorsements for Palmer, who won the U.S. Open that year. As reigning champ into 1961, Arnie endorsed L&M; cigarettes on one of the first TV commercials to use an athlete.In short order, McCormack also signed a talented South African newcomer by the name of Gary Player and a young American professional called Jack Nicklaus.The Big Three dominated golf for the next decade. With McCormack netting them big deals, money poured in for everything from appearance fees to corporate outings.""He realized how much sports were part of the culture,"" said Kirstin Kay, archivist at the Mark H. McCormack Department of Sport Management at the University of Massachusetts. ""He realized there was a real entertainment factor.""In 1968, McCormack went international, signing Killy after the French skier won three gold medals in the Winter Olympics.A year later, McCormack added Australian tennis champion Rod Laver and Scottish race car driver Jackie Stewart.""I could have stayed with the big three golfers, as Col. Parker did with Elvis Presley, or take the idea into other sports,"" McCormack told the London Sunday Times. ""I signed up Stewart, Laver and Killy. After that, people started coming to me, because the market was crying out for someone like me, and I seemed to be the only one with a track record.""At the same time, McCormack began opening offices in Tokyo, Australia, South Africa and across Europe — establishing a foreign beachhead long before global trade was much discussed. ""He was willing to go into markets and stay the course even while losing money for years,"" Franklin said.TV VisionMcCormack was one of the first to merge the rapidly growing TV industry with the sports world, increasing the marquee value of his athletes and such historic sporting events as tennis' Wimbledon and golf's British Open.His broadcast division was the largest producer of televised sports programming, other than the networks, and the largest seller of sports TV rights. To gain more exposure for his clients, he created events such as ""The Superstars"" (1973-2003) and ""World's Strongest Man,"" which debuted in 1977.""He created new ways to capitalize on what was then new media,"" Franklin said. ""He saw very quickly that to get deals for his clients, he needed to get them exposure on television. Once you start creating these events, they have to be on television. So he created a television division.""Into the 1980s, IMG expanded again, branching out to represent authors, classical musicians, fashion models, even the pope. ""He led a very driven life,"" Kay said. ""He was incredibly tightly managed.""To keep pace with his business demands, he ran his life with military precision, rising at 4:30 a.m. and scheduling every moment of his day, including naps, exercise and playtime with his three children. He allowed only four hours a day for rest, trained himself to go to sleep as soon as he got into bed and kept his watch 10 minutes fast so as to be punctual for meetings. ""He would say, 'In six months' time, on September 2 at 10:00, I'll call you,'"" Killy said. ""Six months later at 10:00 he'd call, on the nose.""On The GoAll of his ventures made McCormack a prolific traveler, logging up to 200,000 miles a year, nearly all on commercial airlines.Though he had homes in New York, London, Cleveland and Orlando, Fla., half his time was spent in places where he had no home.In one two-month period in 1994, he was in London; Geneva; Zurich; Singapore; New York; Cleveland; Chicago; Los Angeles; St. Andrews, Scotland; Tokyo; Mexico City; Williamsburg, Va.; Orlando; Jakarta, Indonesia; and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.He kept busy during his travel by writing books, many on management, including ""What They Don't Teach You at Harvard Business School,"" a best-seller in 1984.McCormack went all over with stacks of index cards, which he used to jot down everything from notes on people and projects to his exercise and sleeping habits. ""His three-by-fives were about the best in the world,"" Palmer said. ""He could pull a three-by-five out and tell you how many pushups he did 10 years ago or how many situps.""McCormack's first marriage, in 1954 to Nancy Breckenridge, ended in divorce after three children. A second marriage came in 1986, to the tennis player Betsy Nagelsen, twice an Australian Open doubles champion, and they had a daughter.A year after McCormack died at age 72, Forstmann Little, a private equity firm, bought IMG for $750 million. In 2013 the company sold IMG to the entertainment talent agency William Morris Endeavor and private equity firm Silver Lake Partners for $2.3 billion.Despite the changes in ownership, McCormack's legacy as the godfather of sports marketing remains intact, 55 years after his landmark handshake with Palmer.""I had luck,"" McCormack told London's Sunday Times. ""I saw those two big things (television and high-profile athletes), and suddenly everybody started relating to sports. It was an easy sell. As stupid as it may seem today to say that Tiger Woods wearing Nike (NKE) can make a lot of money for Nike, people weren't doing that then.""

239,COL,"War On Terror: Just days after the White House termed its IS strategy a ""success"" that merely needed a bit of ""tweaking,"" the Islamic State continues to gobble territory like some demented version of Pac-Man.Mere days after seizing Ramadi in Iraq's strategic Anbar Province, the Islamic State this week swept into Syria's city of Palmyra, known for its rich trove of archeological sites and artifacts, but also a key town in the terrorist group's plans to seize control of all of Syria.What's our plan? ""The president is tweaking just about every day,"" said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. Sorry, but so far, IS' strategy is beating President Obama's tweaking. USA Today reports that IS now controls half of Syria's territory. In Iraq, having seized Anbar, IS forces sit just outside of Baghdad.Our own Pentagon suffers no delusions. On Tuesday, the Defense Department issued a stunning admission of, in its own words, ""failure"" in allowing Ramadi to fall.""It was a failure of a lot of things,"" Pentagon spokesman Army Col. Steve Warren said, ""leadership being one of them, tactics being one of them.""Say, maybe ""tweaking"" our strategy isn't enough.This, by the way, is why some Gulf leaders refused to attend President Obama's much-touted Camp David meeting on the Mideast. They smell the stench of failure and don't want its taint on them.A big part of the problem is that our commander in chief ended our armed engagement in Iraq in 2011 without finishing the job. He failed to intervene in Syria after it crossed the ""red line"" of chemical weapon use.Last year, after the stunning rise of the Islamic State from seemingly nothing, the Pentagon embarked on a crash program to train and prepare Iraq's troops for the challenge. It was another tweak that didn't work.""We train them and turn them back over to the Iraqi Ministry of Defense for follow-on deployments, so we don't necessarily track with great fidelity precisely where each of these trained forces go,"" Warren noted.Translation: We have no idea where the hell they are.Meanwhile, IS has put together a murderous, motivated and growing international fighting force of 17,000 Muslim extremists, many recruited from the West.They're acquiring land, killing enemies and building a potent future Iraq-Syria terror state that will straddle the Mideast and make Iran look soft by comparison. By doing nothing other than drone and air strikes, the U.S. signals that it believes IS control is a fait accompli.So what do we do? Neither Democrats nor Republicans are keen for the one thing that would work — boots on the ground. So, given the general zeitgeist, we may have to wait for the Islamic State to take both Syria and Iraq — which would make it the world's 20th largest nation — and begin committing atrocities on a mass scale.In the meantime, never fear. President Obama will just keep on tweaking.

241,COL,"War On Terror: Whatever you think about the Iraq War, it's more than sad to learn our hard-won victory in Ramadi has been handed back to terrorists. Hundreds have paid with their lives for our leaders' incompetence.'We're leaving behind a sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq."" Or so President Obama declared on Dec. 14, 2011. The removal of the last troops from that country, he said, was a ""moment of success.""Those words in retrospect were false — part of a manufactured feel-good moment that right away became engulfed by the harsh new reality in the Mideast.In fact, President Bush's surge had worked. In 2008 Anbar Province — whose provincial capital, Ramadi, fell over the weekend to ISIS — was largely quiet, and the Islamists had been defeated in battle after battle.But it all came at a very high price. As Jim Hoft of the Gateway Pundit blog site notes, 1,335 U.S. soldiers died while liberating Anbar Province during Iraqi Freedom, and another 8,205 soldiers were injured, maimed or crippled in the fighting.So, when Obama spoke in 2011, he was right in a sense: Iraq was, by and large, at peace, thanks to Bush's surge. What happened next? In a word, IS.All those terrorists vanquished by the U.S. came back to fill the vacuum left by Obama's foolish troop withdrawal. By 2014, IS controlled both Fallujah and Abu Ghraib. Now, a year later, it has taken Ramadi.Today Iraq itself is at grave risk of falling to terrorists. Yet, apart from U.S.-led bombings of IS targets, the U.S. is doing little. The resulting carnage is appalling.An Iraqi government official said Sunday that 500 Iraqi citizens and soldiers were killed in and around Ramadi, either by fighting or by executions, as the city fell. Some 8,000 refugees have fled. Those who stay behind will find no mercy from IS fighters.""Bodies, some burned, littered the streets as local officials reported the militants carried out mass killings of Iraqi forces and civilians,"" the Associated Press reports.But worst of all, the sacrifice of our troops and their families to give Iraq a chance at having a civil society has been thrown away by our president.""The greater amount of angst in the military is from seeing the manifest positive results of the surge in 2007 and 2008 go to waste by misguided policies in the aftermath,"" retired Army Col. Peter Monsoor, a top aide to Gen. David Petraeus during the surge, told AP.Knowing this, what parents would want their sons to serve in combat — especially if they knew their sacrifice would be betrayed by their country's own leaders?Finger-pointers are busy blaming Bush for this disaster. But it's Obama's conduct of the war that is the disaster. He walked away from Bush's success, believing he could fight at arms-length with drones and bombers.As we now know, that's just not the case, and ultimately it will lead to terrorists taking over Iraq and much of the Mideast. Even worse, it will mean the sacrifice of thousands of young Americans who served their nation proudly and well — and who, this Memorial Day, deserve to be thanked rather than forgotten or pitied.

Chick-fil-A had experienced nearly uninterrupted growth since its debut 15 years earlier.About 100 of Cathy's chicken sandwich restaurants dotted the country, mostly in the South.But that year, Chick-fil-A experienced its first (and only) decline in same-store sales.Fewer malls — where all of Cathy's restaurants were located then — were being built.And McDonald's and Wendy's were about to enter the quick-serve chicken market by offering chicken sandwiches and nuggets, which helped poultry prices soar.""All of that focus on chicken would be good for us in the long run,"" Cathy explained in ""Eat Mor Chikin, Inspire More People,"" his 2002 memoir, ""but the immediate effect was a double punch that caused me many sleepless nights.""Prudent InvestingCautious by nature, Cathy was also anxious about a corporate plan to double the number of Chick-fil-A's in two years and spend $10 million on a new corporate headquarters in Atlanta.Having grown up watching his mother struggle to run a boarding house in their home, Cathy hated the idea of carrying debt.So Cathy (1921-2014) invited his small executive committee on a two-day retreat.Instead of thinking up ways to cut costs, the execs reflected on why they were in the restaurant business to begin with.This discussion of first principles prompted Cathy and his team to articulate the following corporate mission statement:""To glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us. To have a positive influence on all who come in contact with Chick-fil-A.""That simple act worked. ""Wonderful things began to happen,"" Cathy told Philanthropy magazine. ""I felt confident in the future.""The company grew by 29% in the next year and would go on to become one of the nation's largest family-owned companies. From then on, Cathy also began to focus more of his resources on charity, launching several endeavors that improved thousands of lives.Samuel Truett Cathy was born in Eatonton, Ga., and was an unlikely candidate to become a restaurant mogul. Growing up, he was a slow reader and learner.""I didn't have much confidence in my ability,"" he wrote in ""How Did You Do It, Truett?"" another autobiography. He was a C student and never attended college.Cathy took on jobs — newspaper delivery boy, Coke (KO) stand operator — that instilled in him the importance of keeping the customer satisfied: ""The key to succeeding with a paper route — and the restaurant business, I would later learn — is to take care of the customer.""After high school and a stint in the Army, Cathy and his brother Ben borrowed $10,000 to open a restaurant in the Atlanta suburb of Hapeville in 1946.They called the restaurant Dwarf Grill because of its small size, later renaming it Dwarf House.Tragedy struck in 1949 when two of Cathy's brothers, including Ben, died when a plane they were flying in crashed. The year before, Truett had married Jeanette McNeil, with whom he had three children: Dan, Don (""Bubba"") and Trudy.Jeanette was instrumental in getting Cathy to recommit to his Southern Baptist faith. ""Her level of commitment showed me a new way to live,"" he wrote.Cathy built his business one satisfied customer at a time. But when he built a second restaurant, it promptly burned down.Cathy was philosophical about the loss. ""When I had two restaurants, I had one too many,"" he later reflected. ""So the Lord burned one down and gave me the chance to start Chick-fil-A.""With only one restaurant to manage, Cathy had more time to develop what would become his signature chicken sandwich.He took his time. ""I worked for years, adding this, taking away that,"" he wrote. ""I was up to more than 20 seasonings and breading ingredients — twice as many as Col. Sanders had in his secret recipe.""Southern StartCathy tested all of his variations on customers, gauging their reactions. It wasn't long before Cathy had trademarked the name Chick-fil-A and begun selling his chicken sandwiches to restaurants across the South. And in 1967, Cathy opened the first Chick-fil-A restaurant, in an Atlanta mall.Chick-fil-A was unique in two ways. It was the first fast-food restaurant to serve a skinless, boneless-breast chicken sandwich, and the first to operate in shopping malls. It was an immediate success.Over the succeeding decades, Chick-fil-A grew to more than 1,800 locations scattered across 40 states. Chick-fil-A opened its first freestanding restaurant in 1986 and its first drive-thru-only location in 1993.At the time of his death at age 93, Cathy's net worth was $1.9 billion, according to Bloomberg.The year before, the company took in more than $5 billion, making it the country's largest fast-food chicken restaurant by sales.In 2010, Chick-fil-A became the industry leader in average sales in its restaurants: $2.7 million per.Chick-fil-A's massive growth was helped by its ""Eat Mor Chikin"" ad campaign. It featured hapless dairy cows trying to persuade the public to eat chicken sandwiches instead of hamburgers by, in one example, painting ""Eat mor chikin"" on a billboard. The amusing campaign has remained a core part of Chick-fil-A's ads for two decades, winning numerous industry awards.Cathy succeeded by following four key principles: 1. The main reason companies fail is their desire to grow too fast too soon. Cathy exercised caution and patience. He spent 21 years owning just one restaurant, learning the trade and saving enough money to try new ventures. He never went into debt and never took his company public, which made him accountable only to God, himself and his customers. 2. As restaurant consultant and marketing expert Aaron Allen told IBD, Chick-fil-A ""focuses on speed, accuracy, cleanliness. They're not showy. As other companies start to drift, it has remained focused on fundamentals.""Chick-fil-A offers a basic chicken sandwich and a small menu that rarely changes. By doing so, it can focus on quality. Result: In 2014, Consumer Reports ranked Chick-fil-A's chicken sandwich No. 1. 3. The company's faith-based corporate culture is most clearly seen in its policy of closing on Sundays. Cathy said the policy is the result of his desire that employees save at least one day a week for God and family. 4. The ""loyalty effect"" is something Cathy instilled in employees and customers.Denise Lee Yohn, author of the book ""What Great Brands Do,"" says that Chick-fil-A has engendered a deep devotion from customers by serving a high-quality product and through top customer service. Chick-fil-A ""really does go the extra mile to serve its customers,"" she said. That includes everything from community-building promotions to college scholarships for staffers. Many call Chick-fil-A's employees among the industry's kindest. They often respond to customer requests with a hearty ""my pleasure.""Tasteful Loyalty""In the past 60 years, no matter the ups and downs, I have learned that the number one thing to do is to please the customer and they will come back,"" Cathy once said.As he became wealthy, Cathy donated more of his time and money to charities and started one of his own, called the WinShape Foundation, which provides scholarships and foster homes to needy children. Cathy himself was a foster parent for more than 30 years. He liked to say that some 150 children called him Grandpa.""People ask me why I invest so much in the foster homes,"" he said. ""The one thing I take more joy in than anything else in the world is seeing young people develop. They grow and make good decisions. They want to be winners despite the odds against them.""That's an aspiration that Cathy helped thousands of people, including himself, realize.

246,COL,"Every relationship requires tending. How beloved companies win shoppers' devotion: Be their champion. ""Loyalty isn't some mythical essence that some companies are lucky to have. It's built and created."" So says Noah Fleming, author of ""Evergreen: Cultivate the Enduring Customer Loyalty That Keeps Your Business Thriving.""Companies with enduring relationships hone three Cs:Character — what the company is and why it exists.Community — whom it serves.Content — the product it delivers.The ""why,"" or a company's purpose and heritage, is key.""Organizations too often focus on the 'what' when they need to focus on the 'why,'"" Fleming told IBD.Often a superhero emerges, such as Richard Branson of Virgin Group, which oversees Virgin America (VA), and Col. Sanders of Kentucky Fried Chicken. Beware gimmicks.  Shoppers can sniff out insincere marketing spins or silly offers.""You need to build a more real relationship,"" Fleming said.The use of loyalty cards — they track customers' spending and reward frequent shoppers with discounts — is widespread. But they can't guarantee a shopper's allegiance. ""I think where most companies go wrong is believing they can buy loyalty,"" Fleming said.Price is a factor, but consumers still make purchase decisions based on overall impressions. Tend them. Fleming tells corporate clients to invest in customer retention. ""This is a true profit center,"" he said.When an industrial supply firm shifted most of its marketing budget from customer acquisition to customer retention and reactivation, it upped its profit margin by 17%. Build an army.  Public speaker and author (""Zombie Loyalists: Using Great Service to Create Rabid Fans"") Peter Shankman ends nearly every keynote address with the same line:""You get the customers you want by being beyond awesome with the customers you have."" Pass it on. No one believes a business that brags about itself.""But if you can get your customers to tell their friends how awesome you are, if you can turn your current customers into zombie loyalists who infect everyone they meet, then you have something real,"" Shankman said. Lift them. Ground-level interactions impress. Smart firms empower front-line workers to wow clients. ""Superhero employees can create zombie loyalist customers every single time they interact with them,"" Shankman said. Pleasantly surprise them. A few attendees to the Chicago Symphony Orchestra receive a seat upgrade, a CD and parking coupons.The regular practice is completely random.""But the orchestra is known for it, and it brings happiness to people who might now have even more reason to come back,"" Shankman said. Recover from falls.  When something goes wrong for a customer, smart firms hustle. ""Whatever you do, you need to do it quick, do it right and make sure you get in front of the problem, solve it and keep your zombie,"" Shankman said. Make it personal.  Steiner Sports CEO Brandon Steiner eliminated his firm's customer service department because he deemed every employee, not just a single department, responsible for the job.To drive the message home, he talked to every staffer about how to treat clients at the sports memorabilia operation. How he put it to Shankman: ""Treat your customer as you would treat your mother.""

247,COL,"Transparency: The administration is said to be hiding for reasons of damage control a report on the soldier we traded five Taliban leaders for. Bowe Bergdahl's lawyers have already been given a charge sheet for desertion.
"
248,COL,"Both Fox News and now NBC News have reported that Sgt. Bergdahl will be charged with desertion. ""I have been told and confirmed by two other sources that his attorney has been given what we call a charge sheet,"" retired Army Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer, a respected military analyst, told Fox's Bill O'Reilly on Monday. NBC's Jim Miklaszewski quoted senior defense officials on Tuesday as saying charges could be referred within a week.
"
249,COL,"""A charge sheet is the results of investigation listing out the articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice that have been violated,"" Shaffer explained. ""The key violation is desertion.""
"
250,COL,"According to Shaffer, an analyst with the London Center for Policy Research, White House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, who played a key role in the cover-up of administration malfeasance in the Benghazi terrorist attack that killed four Americans, has been laboring to keep this information under wraps as long as possible, perhaps to be included later in one of those Friday data dumps the administration is famous for.
"
251,COL,"We'd be stunned if any other decision were reached, for the uncontestable fact is that Bergdahl walked away from his combat post in 2009 in a time of war, leaving behind his weapon, his gear and his fellow soldiers. At least six soldiers were reported to have been killed in operations looking for him. He was not out for a walk to relieve stress or clear his head.
"
252,COL,"Bergdahl was believed to have been held by the Haqqani terror network in the tribal area of Pakistan's northwest frontier on the Afghan border. He was picked up in eastern Afghanistan, near the Pakistani border, by a Navy SEAL team as part of a trade involving the return of five top Taliban commanders who'd been held at Guantanamo Bay.
"
253,COL,"After the trade, the Taliban released a statement attributed to their leader, Mullah Omar, declaring the release of the commanders from Gitmo a ""great victory.""
"
254,COL,"It was this trade that told the world that America was now ready to deal with terrorists, putting a price on all our heads. President Obama not only broke America's pledge that we will never negotiate with terrorists. He also broke a law that requires congressional notification of such a trade. Not coincidentally, ransom is now a prime source of income for the Islamic State.
"
255,COL,"There's another law the president himself may have broken — that of giving material aid and comfort to a terrorist enemy. As pointed out by Allen West, former congressman and Iraq War veteran, Obama recently signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act, which makes it a crime to offer or provide any material support to terrorist groups. It makes no exception as to who and under what circumstances.
"
256,COL,"""We have a federal statute which makes it a felony to provide material assistance to any terrorist organization,"" said Fox News judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano in support of West's opinion. ""It could be money, maps, professional services, any asset whatsoever, including human assets.""
"
257,COL,"Releasing official charges against Bergdahl for desertion would also indict Obama for illegal activities that benefit terrorism. Shaffer spoke of ""a titanic struggle behind the scenes,"" with the Army trying to do the right thing while the White House worried about the images of a president welcoming the parents of someone now charged with desertion and a terrorists-for-deserter narrative coming out.

327,COL,"""Edson had true courage, which is the most important trait a leader needs, and I don't just mean on the battlefield,"" said Wesley Fox, a fellow Medal of Honor Marine and the author of ""Six Essential Elements of Leadership."" ""Because without it, one may fall short in integrity, miss doing the correct thing because it is difficult, or state an untruth because it is to his advantage. Without it, one will accept the easier task and not stand for the tough or costly issues. Merritt Edson had both courage and integrity, and was a great Marine warrior.""When the Battle of Guadalcanal called in 1942, Merritt Edson answered. The colonel came through with Marines who thwarted the Japanese for an early American triumph in World War II.The island's name to this day represents the tropical hell that was the Pacific War.Edson's 840 Marines defended a key coral ridge sticking up from the jungle near the vital U.S. airfield during the nights of Sept. 13-14, 1942, repelling repeated assaults by 3,000 determined Japanese.""We took 263 casualties,"" Whitey Groft, co-author of ""Bloody Ridge and Beyond: A World War II Marine's Memoir of Edson's Raiders in the Pacific,"" told IBD. ""He was standing erect 20 yards behind me on a hill, bullets piercing his clothing, but not hitting him, like he had a charmed life, while the rest of us hugged the ground. He knew that if the ridge fell, the island could well be lost. He earned the Medal of Honor that night.""The heroic defense enabled the American victory on the island, Imperial Japan's first major defeat on land and the beginning of its end.From Vermont To ActionEdson (1897-1955) was born in Rutland, Vt. After attending the University of Vermont for two years, he joined the state's National Guard in 1916 and went to the Mexican border to curb bandit-rebel Pancho Villa but saw no action.Edson then joined the Marines, but after the first lieutenant arrived in Europe in 1918, he saw no combat in World War I and returned to America the next year.He stayed at his rank for six years because of the postwar force reduction. Still, he made a mark as assistant director of an education program to improve morale and competence at Marine headquarters in Quantico, Va.In 1920, Edson married Ethel Robbins. They would have two sons who would become Marines.""In 1921, Edson hoped to earn a coveted slot on the Marine rifle team, a high honor,"" wrote Jon Hoffman in ""Once a Legend: 'Red Mike' Edson and the Marine Raiders."" ""Soon, he shot his way through to the Marine Corps Matches. The captain and coaches did not rely solely on scores to pick the best. They wanted men who could perform under pressure.""He made the team of 10 that defeated the reigning Army champs, and he went on to coach rifle and pistol teams in the 1920s and '30s that won national trophies.Meanwhile, in 1922 he got his wish to transfer to an aviation unit in Pensacola, Fla.Early flight was extremely hazardous, which is why participants were usually unmarried. That year, nine of its 52 pilots died.Edson pressed on, even after some crash landings and the 1926 discovery that he had defective depth perception.In 1927, Edson was promoted to captain and transferred to the cruiser Denver as commanding officer of a detachment of Marines.Their new mission: amphibious assault at crisis points around the world.Edson saw action during Nicaragua's civil war, earning his first Navy Cross, then returned to America in 1929 to teach tactics and organize ordnance.In 1936, he graduated from the senior officers' course at Quantico, rose to major and went to Shanghai to observe Japan's invading force from 1937 to 1939.He returned to Quantico in 1939 to head up target practice. By June 1941, he was a lieutenant colonel commanding what would be designated the 1st Marine Raider Battalion, 5th Regiment, 2nd Division.It would be an early special operations force deployed in WWII.With America in the thick of the war by August 1942, Edson — now a full-bird colonel — landed the Raiders on Tulagi in the Solomon Islands. That's where he earned his second Navy Cross for leading from the front.""Tulagi was the first of three battles they would wage against the Japanese special naval landing forces,"" wrote retired Marine Col. Joseph Alexander in ""Edson's Raiders."" ""Each would be characterized by vicious, point-blank, bloody fighting, often at night. While killing all but three of the 350 defenders, the Raiders sustained 38 killed and 55 wounded themselves, almost 10% of the command, in the first 24 hours.""Hanging In ThereThe Raiders then went to nearby Guadalcanal. The first mass Japanese attack against their position on Lunga Ridge came on the night of Sept. 13 and was so fierce, it broke through the defense.As the attack faltered, Edson reorganized his men farther back for the following night.""We were all aware this could be our finest hour, that if we failed, all 12,500 Marines on the island might be captured or killed,"" Groft said.

350,COL,"Terrorism: An ax attack on two New York City cops by a Muslim convert with jihadi postings on his Facebook page is yet another reminder of the prophetic warning by the leader of the Islamic State.Some pundits are downplaying any connection between Zale Thompson, who attacked two New York City cops with a hatchet, and the Islamic State, which has issued a call for such actions by sympathizers in the West. This is an ""isolated case,"" they say, an act by a ""nut job"" and not by a terrorist conspirator.The Islamic State is perhaps the world's largest collection of nut jobs. How sane can someone be, taking joy in sawing off the heads of infidels like Steven Sotloff and James Foley, or delighting in kidnapping and gang-raping the Yazidi women of Iraq because they worship a different god? How sane can young women be who leave the West to journey to Syria in the hopes of being incubators for future jihadis?In the Soviet era, we might have called the likes of Zale Thompson sleepers — individuals hidden in our free society waiting for the call to fulfill their destiny.The current bevy of homegrown jihadis beheading office workers in Oklahoma and killing policemen and soldiers in Canada may not have been planted here by the Islamic State. But in the age of social media, they have heard their master's voice and responded accordingly.Like the attack by Michael Zehaf-Bibeau that killed a guard at Canada's National War Memorial, and the attack on a London street that killed British soldier Lee Rigby last December, the New York ax attack is the very type of murder urged by the Islamic State on Western authority figures such as policemen and soldiers.On the Facebook page bearing the name of Muslim convert Thompson (aka Zaim Farouq Abdul-Malik), a jihadist warrior is pictured masked in a head-and-face scarf and armed with a sword, spear and rifle, ready to do battle with Western infidels. A quote from the Quran in Arabic, speaking of judgment against those who have strayed from or resisted assimilation into the Islamic fold, serves as the page's banner.We are reminded of the prophetic warning of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi when he was released on President Obama's watch from Camp Bucca in Iraq in 2009.As Michael Daly pointed out recently in the Daily Beast, al-Baghdadi, aware that those guarding him were reservists from Long Island, had a few choice parting words.""He said, 'I'll see you guys in New York,'"" recalls Army Col. Kenneth King, then commanding officer of Camp Bucca. ""We spent how many missions and how many soldiers were put at risk when we caught this guy, and we just released him,"" Daly quotes King as saying.The threat by al-Baghdadi was not taken seriously at the time, but it should be now. The call by the Islamic State for those who can't make it to the training camps of northern Syria and Iraq to join the fight by proxy is being carried out on the streets of New York City; Moore, Okla.; and Ottawa.Kudos to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper for promptly, and accurately, calling the Parliament shooting what it was, a terrorist attack.Interestingly, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who refuses to call the ax attack terrorism, in April disbanded a special 1,000-officer counterterrorism unit built up by former Police Commissioner Ray Kelly and tasked with conducting surveillance of mosques and Muslim groups suspected of radical ties.Michael Mukasey, U.S. attorney general from 2007 to 2009, says the unit was instrumental in finding possible terrorist ties within Muslim communities.It just may be time for everybody to start crying wolf.
"
351,COL,"Scandal: Democrats claim it's been asked and answered, but the question of why four Americans had to die in a diplomatic outpost in a terrorist haven with inadequate security and no plans for rescue has not.That all questions regarding Benghazi have not been answered and new ones have in fact arisen was shown by the recent revelation by former Deputy Assistant Secretary Raymond Maxwell to reporter Sharyl Attkisson.Maxwell said he witnessed State Department personnel sifting through stacks of documents and emails to filter out those that would put the department in a bad light before turning any over to the Accountability Review Board tasked to find out the truth.Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., and the Select Committee he chairs is also tasked with uncovering the truth.Before Maxwell spoke to Attkisson, Gowdy — along with Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah — deposed Maxwell. Chaffetz said he was told that then-Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills and Deputy Chief of Staff Jake Sullivan were there to oversee the document cleansing.""For Hillary Clinton's chief of staff and deputy chief of staff to be making a concerted effort to hide documents (and to) make sure that the Accountability Review Board (ARB) and Congress did not see these documents is unbelievable and wrong,"" Chaffetz says.Chaffetz told Attkisson he is ""100% confident that the Benghazi Select Committee is going to dive deep into that issue,"" Ed Morrissey at HotAir.com reports.An interesting exchange occurred when Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., asked Greg Starr, assistant secretary for diplomatic security at the State Department, about ""tripwires"" — incidents that are supposed to trigger concrete action to enhance security at a given post.Westmoreland asked Starr if he thought an earlier attack on a convoy carrying the British ambassador, an attack that caused them to leave Libya, or a June 2012 attack where an IED blew a hole in the consulate wall, might have been considered tripwires. Starr said yes.Yet no more action was taken than after the 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, as Rep. Susan Brooks, R-Ind., pointed out in her initial questioning. Recommendations made by another Accountability Review Board were never followed, and the mistakes there are eerily similar to Benghazi.A review of those attacks showed that the CIA repeatedly told State Department officials in Washington and the Kenya embassy that there was an active terrorist cell in Kenya connected to Osama bin Laden, who masterminded the attack.As in Benghazi, requests for more security were denied, warnings were issued, prior incidents were ignored and Susan Rice, then assistant secretary of state for African affairs, went on PBS as spokesperson for the administration to explain it all away.Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, pointed out the similarity between Nairobi and Benghazi in his questioning of Todd Keil, former assistant secretary for infrastructure protection at the Homeland Security Department.Jordan pointed out that Lt. Col. Andrew Wood, the commander of a Security Support Team (SST) sent home in August 2012, has said, regarding requests for more security: ""We were fighting a losing battle. We couldn't even keep what we had."" Wood said having the SST sent home was against his wishes and those of Ambassador Chris Stevens.Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., failed to get a good answer to his question to Starr on why the pleas of Stevens were ignored. On Aug. 8, 2012, Stevens sent a two-page cable to the State Department titled ""The Guns of August: Security in Eastern Libya"" and noting a dangerous ""security vacuum"" in and around Benghazi and the presence of terrorist training camps. He was ignored.As the first Select Committee hearing underscores, there's another security vacuum. It's in our own State Department, which long before Benghazi refused to recognize there are people trying to kill us and that we should do whatever it takes to make sure they do not.

352,COL,"War On Terror: The failed mission to rescue photojournalist James Foley reportedly should have been approved a month sooner, but our special forces ""weren't permitted."" This seems to be The Dithering Presidency.Toby Harnden, Washington correspondent for the London Sunday Times, reports that President Obama originally wouldn't give the green light to the elite 160th Special Ops Aviation Regiment to rescue Foley and other American hostages being held by the Islamic State at least partially because of political considerations.According to ex-Royal Navy officer Harnden, ""preying on his mind was the failed 1980 Delta Force operation to rescue American hostages in Tehran.""The Desert One disaster, with eight U.S. troops killed ""cast a shadow over Jimmy Carter's presidency."" Defense sources told Harnden that out of concern ""about the ramifications of U.S. troops being killed or captured in Syria,"" Obama ""took too long to authorize the mission.""Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer, an ex-military intelligence officer and covert operations specialist, told Harnden, ""I'm told it was almost a 30-day delay from when they said they wanted to go to when he finally gave the green light.""Another Pentagon source complained to Harnden of a White House that ""constantly goes back and forth on these things,"" describing the president and his closest advisers as ""a bunch of academics who endlessly analyze stuff and ordering up another deep-thinking paper but can't decide what to order for lunch.""There are several very disturbing issues here.Lack of focus: President Obama's obsession with golf has become a running joke, with even liberals like New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd viciously turning on him over it.And we've known for years that he doesn't attend his daily intelligence briefings regularly. If you're not prepped on your daily duties, you can't do your job well, whether you're president or a short-order chef.Politicization: Five-and-a-half years of this presidency makes it clear that every big decision has to be vetted by the White House political shop, and that takes time. Real leadership often means doing the right thing, fast.This is especially true during war — which is what this is. Maybe Valerie Jarrett and David Axelrod don't always have to weigh in, Mr. President.Pride: The White House ""academics who endlessly analyze"" and ""deep-think"" also don't dare ruffle the feathers of ""The One."" Maybe this bunch, and their boss, ought to have more respect for the judgment of the military brass.They're sending out strong public signals of alarm that the president doesn't recognize the bloodthirsty IS has exceeded its al-Qaida forefathers as a threat.

426,COL,"Politics: Harry Reid blames Russia's annexation of Crimea on Republicans who didn't act fast enough on a sanctions package. But he ignores Obama's appeasement as president and push when a senator to disarm Ukraine.The Senate Majority Leader's latest claim is consistent with other utterances out of his parallel universe, including calling Stage IV cancer patients liars about Obamacare's collateral damage and asking why we'd want to save one child with cancer.""Since a few Republicans blocked these important sanctions, Russian lawmakers voted to annex Crimea, and Russian forces have taken over Ukrainian military bases,"" Harry Reid said Monday as the Senate began debate on a package of sanctions and aid.""It's impossible to know whether events would have unfolded differently if the United States had responded to Russian aggression with a strong, unified voice.""The man who makes Vice President Joe Biden look competent by comparison ignores the fact that since the House and Senate passed different versions, quick action on sanctions would have been impossible and that it was Reid and the Democrats who refused to bring up the House version as is.The Senate version wasn't a clean bill, having attached provisions that would increase the power of emerging countries in the International Monetary Fund and shift some $63 billion from a crisis fund to a general account that Republicans feared would leave U.S. taxpayers on the hook for more foreign bailouts.Yet Reid directed blame to Republicans who had reservations about this Christmas tree, saying their delay of congressional action ""sent a dangerous message to Russian leaders.""We doubt that former KGB Col. Vladimir Putin, who considers the demise of the Soviet Union one of history's great tragedies, cared much about Reid's idea of sanctions.Obama's record of appeasement as both senator and president is all the encouragement that Vlad, the impaler of nations, needed. An American president who betrayed Poland and the Czech Republic on missile defense and vacillated on the Russian invasion of Georgia as senator lost Moscow's respect long ago.From Obama's infinite number of red lines on Syria to his gutting of the U.S. military, Putin saw a weak, out-of-his-depth former community organizer who bowed to world leaders as he apologized for American excess. Obama would go on to cave to pressure and promise Russia's leaders that he'd have even more ""flexibility"" to bend to their will after he was re-elected.Putin no doubt remembers how in 2005 then-Sen. Obama pushed for the destruction of large amounts of conventional ammunition and weaponry for the Ukrainian military, based on vague assurances that the Cold War was over and the U.S. would provide a security guarantee.As the Daily Mail reports: In August 2005, just seven months after his swearing-in, Obama traveled to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine with then-Indiana Republican Sen. Dick Lugar and toured a conventional weapons site. Meeting in Kiev with President Victor Yushchenko, they made the case that weapon stockpiles inherited from the old Soviet Union should be destroyed.Sen. Obama pushed for eliminating 400,000 small arms, 1,000 anti-aircraft missiles and more than 15,000 tons of ammunition. ""We need to eliminate these stockpiles for the safety of the Ukrainian people and people around \ world by keeping them out of conflicts around the world,"" Obama said in an Aug. 30, 2005, statement from Donetsk.So how safe are the Ukrainian people now, Mr. President? And any further comment from you, Sen. Reid?

Notably, this could be the fourth straight quarter to record earnings growth after five quarters of back-to-back declines.With over 1000 companies scheduled to report results this week, including 130 S&P 500 members, we believe this season to be a busy one. Now, let us focus on the defense sector as it is expected to see quite a few of the major defense contractors coming up with their financial numbers.In the Aerospace and Defense space, 96.7% of the index’s market cap has reported quarterly results as of Jul 28, with 88.9% beating on earnings and 66.7% exceeding revenue expectations. Undoubtedly, such bullish releases raise hopes of a much better performance for the sector, as we move into the second half of the second-quarter reporting cycle. In fact, projections are of a 59.9% surge in earnings despite 0.8% revenue deterioration. For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through the Earnings Preview.Let’s take a look at three defense companies – Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) and Engility Holdings, Inc. (EGL  -  Free Report), which are scheduled to release second-quarter results on Aug 3.Huntington Ingalls saw a negative earnings surprise of 31.25% in the last quarter. However, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 3.04%.Our proven model shows that Huntington Ingalls is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen and the company has the right mix. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP FilterThis stock has an Earnings ESP of +4.96% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.75, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.62.

428,COL,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 1% in the past month, outperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is COL due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Rockwell Collins Beats on Q1 Earnings, Sales Up Y/YRockwell Collins reported results for first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Dec 31, 2017). The company’s adjusted earnings per share of $1.59 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.53 by 3.9%. Reported earnings grew 30.3% from $1.22 a year ago.Excluding one-time adjustments, the company’s earnings of $1.69 per share reflected a year-over-year improvement of 53.6%.The year-over-year bottom-line growth was primarily driven by a tax benefit of 37 cents on account of the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.RevenuesIn the reported quarter, Rockwell Collins’ total sales were $2,011 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,988 million by 1.2%. Revenues grew 69% year over year, driven by higher sales at Commercial Systems, Government Systems and Information Management Services segments.Excluding revenues worth $716 million from the acquisition of B/E Aerospace, the company witnessed 9% organic sales growth.Operational HighlightsTotal segment operating income during the quarter was $371 million, up 47.8% from $251 million in the year-ago quarter.Rockwell Collins’ total research and development investment (including increase in pre-production engineering costs) was $318 million, up 51.4%. The figure represented 15.8% of total sales compared with 17.6% in the year-ago quarter.Interest expense during the quarter was $64 million compared with $20 million in the year-ago quarter.Segment PerformanceCommercial Systems: In the quarter under review, sales of $608 million were up 11% year over year owing to higher original equipment and aftermarket sales.Operating earnings for the quarter were $139 million compared with $125 million in the year-ago quarter. Consequently, operating margin expanded 10 basis points (bps) to 22.9%.Government Systems: The segment reported sales of $573 million, up 21% on the back of higher communication and navigation as well as avionics revenues.Operating earnings for the quarter were $109 million, up 14% from $96 million in the year-ago quarter. However, operating margin contracted 120 bps to 19%.Information Management Services: Segment sales were $174 million, up 3% from $169 million in the year-ago quarter, backed by growth in aviation related revenues.Operating earnings for the quarter were $29 million, down from $30 million in the year-ago period. Operating margin was 16.7% compared with 17.8% a year ago. The downside was caused by asset disposition and customer bankruptcy costs.Financial ConditionAs of Dec 31, 2017, Rockwell Collins’ cash and cash equivalents were $583 million compared with $703 million as of Sep 30, 2017.Long-term debt (net) was $6,498 million as of Dec 31, 2017, up from $6.676 million as of Sep 30, 2017.Cash used for operating activities at the end of the quarter was $259 million, compared with 101 million in the prior-year quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Fresh estimate followed an upward path over the past two months.Rockwell Collins, Inc.

429,COL,"Merger and acquisition activities across the globe hit record highs in the first half of 2018 driven by growing ambition of American companies.According to the latest Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence data, global mergers and acquisitions totaled more than $2.5 trillion, up 64% from the year-ago level and marked the strongest year-to-date period since records began in 1980. With this rise, the mergers are on track to surpass $5 trillion in 2018, which would top 2015, the highest yearly total on record (read: How to Play the Surge in Global M&A With ETFs).The massive increase in M&A activity came despite growing global trade tensions. United States M&A volumes climbed 82% to $1 trillion, the country’s strongest period for deal making on record. This was followed by European deals, which nearly doubled to $767 billion in the first half.Most of the boost came from media and healthcare deals. The proposed media M&A has totaled $322.5 billion so far – up more than six times from the year-ago level. The sector is poised for more consolidation in the coming months as a federal judge ruling on AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner  set the stage for waves of M&A in the media space that would change the landscape of the industry (read: Comcast Outbids Disney for Fox Assets: Media ETFs Surge).Big deals have driven much of the activity as total number of deals valued at $10 billion or more surged to 36 in the first half of 2018. These constituted $950 billion in deals, or nearly 38% of all activity. The bidding war for Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) was the largest contributor. This was followed by health insurer Cigna’s (CI  -  Free Report) deal to purchase Express Scripts Holding (ESRX  -  Free Report) for $67 billion and Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical purchase deal of Shire for $62.4 billion (read: Cigna to Buy Express Scripts: Healthcare ETFs in Focus).The boom in M&A is likely to continue, given an accelerating economy, still-low interest rates, and tax reform, which allow companies to bring offshore cash back home. Potential cost savings through mergers are further fueling the urge to merge in the current ultra-competitive environment.How to Tap?Investors could easily take advantage of this surge in deals by employing the merger arbitrage strategy in their portfolio. This strategy looks to tap the price differential (or spread) between the stock price of the target company after the public announcement of its proposed acquisition and the price offered by the acquirer to pay for the stock of the target company. This is especially true given that investors should go long on the target or the acquired company and short on the acquiring company. When the deal is completed, shares of the target company will increase to the full deal price (in some cases slightly below the deal price), giving investors a nice profit.Below, we have highlighted three merger ETFs to ride out the surge from the increasing M&A deals. Any of these could make compelling options for investors seeking to implement this low correlation strategy to their portfolio: IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF (MNA  -  Free Report) This fund offers capital appreciation by investing in global companies for which there has been a public announcement of a takeover by an acquirer while at the same time providing short exposure to global equities as a partial equity market hedge. This is done by tracking the IQ Merger Arbitrage Index. The fund has 61 holdings in its basket with the largest allocation to Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report) and Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) on the long side with each accounting for more than 8% share. The product has amassed $629.2 million in its asset base and trades in average volume of around 131,000 shares a day. It charges 77 bps in annual fees. The ETF has lost about 0.3% year to date (see: all the Hedge Funds ETFs here). ProShares Merger ETF (MRGR  -  Free Report) This product provides exposure to a global merger arbitrage strategy, which seeks to capture the spread between the price at which the stock of a company (a target) trades after a proposed acquisition is announced and the value (cash plus stock) that the acquiring company has proposed to pay for the stock of the target (a spread). This can be easily done by the S&P Merger Arbitrage Index. The fund holds a well-diversified portfolio of 39 stocks and charges 75 bps in annual fee. Healthcare, financials, real estate and technology are the top four sectors. The ETF has been able to manage assets worth $4.5 million while it sees light volume of just 1,000 shares a day. It is down nearly 1% so far this year. Bottom Line While investors could capitalize on merger arbitrage by trading in a particular target company stock, the ETFs provide diversified exposure in the basket form with lower risk. Further, these could be excellent choices for investors in the rocky market due to their low correlation with the overall market. This is because companies in merger and acquisition deals generally move independently, ignoring all other issues that influence the movement of other stocks. As a result, investors could definitely focus on these products for relatively higher returns in any type of market.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

430,COL,"American Outdoor Brands Corporation (AOBC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and fiscal 2018 results, after market close on Jun 20.The gun maker surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 9.46%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderFor the past few quarters, the company has been facing several challenges in the consumer market for firearms due to lower shipments. Such lower shipments can be attributed to weak demand as evident from the consequent declines in firearm background checks, per the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).Nevertheless, according to the FBI's NICS, firearm background checks improved 9.1% year over year for the period February-April 2018, thus reflecting an increase in demand. This, in turn, is likely to boost sales of the publicly traded gun manufacturers like American Outdoor Brands.Meanwhile, the company has strengthened its focus on manufacturing of innovative products. During the fiscal fourth quarter, American Outdoor Brands launched a new personal protection concealed carry pistol — the M&P380 Shield EZ. We may expect to witness more such innovations made by the company in its upcoming results, which might push up its cost of production. However, revenue recognition from these products can not be expected in the fiscal fourth quarter.While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Outdoor Brands’ fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of 11 cents projects a decline of 80.7%, the same for revenues of $182.9 million hints at a decrease of 20.2% on a year-over-year basis.American Outdoor Brands Corporation Price and EPS Surprise American Outdoor Brands Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | American Outdoor Brands Corporation QuoteEarnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for American Outdoor Brands this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.Zacks ESP: American Outdoor Brands has an Earnings ESP of -29.41% as the Most Accurate estimate of 8 cents lies below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the power of surprise prediction. However, a negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Defense ReleasesSpirit AeroSystems Holdings (SPR  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 earnings of $1.10 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35 by 18.5%.Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report) reported results for second-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Mar 31, 2018). The company’s adjusted earnings per share of $1.81 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.53 by 3.4%.Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 earnings from continuing operations of $2.20 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.10 by 4.8%.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

433,COL,"On May 23, we issued an updated research report on Orbital ATK, Inc. . The company continues to gain from its wide range of high-quality products and consistent flow of orders. Orbital ATK reported first-quarter 2018 earnings of $1.76 per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.50 by 17.3%. Total revenues were $1,312 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,134 million by 15.69%. Higher sales volumes from all three segments boosted its performance.However, intense competition in the space and fluctuations in currencies are deterrents.In a year’s time, Orbital ATK stock has gained 32.9% outperforming the 29.9% rally of its industry.What’s Driving Orbital ATK?Higher backlog is expected to drive the company’s performance. The new orders have boosted the company’s year-over-year contract backlog by 14% to $9.4 billion and total backlog by 12% to $16.6 billion.The company continues to win a steady stream of contracts from its wide customer base, courtesy of a diverse product offering. Company’s total sales were divided among U.S. Government deals accounting for 75% and commercial & foreign customers accounting for 25%. Mix of domestic and foreign customers gives more stability to revenues and compensate for declines in orders in any particular area.In the quarter, the company invested nearly $100 million for research & development activities and capital equipment. During the first quarter, Flight Systems conducted its fifth IRBM target launch from a C-17 aircraft and completed OmegA next-generation large-class launch vehicle. For commercial operators, Space Systems introduced its second-generation in-space satellite servicing technology.However, defense is a highly competitive sector and Orbital ATK is required to offer high-quality products and services to retain and gain customers. In addition, foreign currency fluctuation and delay in supply in raw materials required by the company to fulfil orders could affect operations.Acquisition NewsOrbital ATK will be acquired by Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) for $9.2 billion. Of the total amount, Northrop will pay approximately $7.8 billion in cash and the assumption of $1.4 billion in net debt. The companies expect the transaction to be closed by the first half of 2018.

434,COL,"Launched on 11/17/2009, the IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF (MNA  -  Free Report) is a smart beta exchange traded fund offering broad exposure to the Hedge Fund ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment.A good option for investors who believe in market efficiency, market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns.However, some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection, and choose a different type of fund that tracks non-cap weighted strategies: smart beta.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.While this space offers a number of choices to investors, including simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies, not all these strategies have been able to deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor & IndexMNA is managed by Indexiq, and this fund has amassed over $522.41 M, which makes it the largest ETF in the Hedge Fund ETFs. This particular fund, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the IQ MERGER ARBITRAGE INDEX.The IQ Merger Arbitrage Index seeks to achieve capital appreciation by investing in global companies for which there has been a public announcement of a takeover by an acquirer. This differentiated approach is based on a passive strategy of owning certain announced takeover targets with the goal of generating returns that are representative of global merger arbitrage activity.Cost & Other ExpensesInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.77% for this ETF, which makes it the least expensive product in the space.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Looking at individual holdings, Morgan Stanley Ilf/treas/inst (CASH  -  Free Report) accounts for about 19.60% of total assets, followed by Rockwell Collins Inc (COL  -  Free Report) and Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 66.04% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe fund's year-to-date return has lost about -1.61%, and is up about 1.13% in the last one year (as of 05/04/2018). MNA has traded between $30.08 and $31.86 in the past 52-week period.MNA has a beta of 0.14 and standard deviation of 4.98% for the trailing three-year period. With about 65 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

437,COL,"According to data released by the Commerce Department on Thursday, U.S. durable goods order rose 2.6% in March. The rise can be attributed to an increase of 44.5% in orders for commercial aircraft. Moreover, orders for defense capital-goods jumped, giving a clear indication that the U.S. manufacturing industry is on steady track.Earlier this month, the Commerce Department said that factory orders rose 1.2%, primarily on orders for transportation equipment aided by robust orders for civilian airlines. Moreover, the U.S. ISM manufacturing PMI registered 59.3% growth. U.S. manufacturing industry is benefiting from strong global growth, which is leading to a sharp rise in durable goods’ orders.The rise in orders of commercial aircraft and defense capital goods bears testimony to the underlying strength in the country’s economy. Against this backdrop, it makes good sense to invest in stocks that are poised to gain from the solid durable goods orders data.Higher Durable Goods Order to Boost ConfidenceOrders for durable goods rose 2.6% in March, higher than the estimated increase of 1.6%. The rise was mainly backed by strong demand for commercial aircraft, which surged 44.5% to almost $21 billion. This follows a 39.1% rise in February after a 27.9% drop in January. Apart from commercial aircraft, the rise in durable goods orders was driven by a 0.9% increase in orders for defense capital-goods.The overall demand for transportation increased 7.6% to $91.4 billion in March, making it clear that airlines and defense capital-goods are driving durable goods’ orders. Also, orders for motor vehicles and parts increased 0.1% to $57.7 billion. Although the increase is negligible, the figures indicate that the U.S. economy is booming and riding high on strong industrial growth.Manufacturing Sector Expands, Factory Orders SurgeThe ISM Manufacturing Index came in at 59.3%. Although the index slipped 1.5%, the signs are positive, as 17 of the 18 manufacturing industries registered growth. The March PMI figure also marks overall economic growth for the 107th consecutive month.Moreover, the New Orders index came in at 61.9%, indicating strong demand. Exports orders also remained robust because of a weaker U.S. currency, while the Price Index is at its highest level since April 2011, registering 78.1%.Meanwhile, new orders for U.S. made goods increased in February. The growth can be attributed to robust demand for transportation equipment. Factory orders grew 1.2% owing to a 7% rise in transportation equipment, aided by a 26.2% jump in orders of commercial aircraft.   Our ChoicesThe latest data, which reflects strong orders for durable goods, is a clear indication that economic activity in the manufacturing sector is expanding. Moreover, the robust growth in orders for commercial aircraft and defense-capital goods is an indication of strong demand for U.S. made goods. Also, economists believe that investment growth is likely to pick up in the near term.Strong factory orders aided by steady demand for transportation equipment such as civil aircraft and defense-capital goods hint a bullish economic outlook. Naturally, investing in stocks that are likely to gain from strong durable goods’ order looks like a good option at this point.

439,COL,"TransDigm Group Incorporated (TDG  -  Free Report) has decided to divest the SCHROTH business. The company had earlier announced that the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) had been investigating its acquisition of SCHROTH seatbelt and restraints business, which the company concluded in February this year.DoJ requires Transdigm to divest two businesses — SCHROTH Safety Products GmbH and SCHROTH Safety Products — that Transdigm acquired from Takata for $90 million.The DoJ had challenged the acquisition on grounds that the company had a uniquely substantial position in the aerospace seatbelts and restraints business. The DoJ insisted on the divestitures to restore competition in the market for certain restraint systems used on commercial airplanes as the acquisition would have eliminated Transdigm’s most significant competitor in the field.In light of the size of the deal, and risks and expenses associated with carrying on the investigation, TransDigm decided that it would be more prudent to sell the business, thus avoiding any protracted dispute.TransDigm conducted an extensive search and evaluation for a buyer, and is now selling SCHROTH Safety Products in a management buyout to Perusa Partners Fund 2, L.P. Perusa is a private equity fund advised by Perusa GmbH, as majority shareholder, as well as dedicated SCHROTH managers from both Germany and the United States.The proposal has been accepted by the DoJ, subject to court approval. The deal remains subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.TransDigm’s shares have suffered over the past year, having risen just 9.1% in contrast to the industry’s gain of 28.2%.TransDigm continually adds to its product range with acquisitions of firms with proprietary products which enjoy solid positions on high use of platforms, robust aftermarket content and an excellent reputation. Products offered by the firms include highly engineered aerospace controls, quick disconnect couplings, as well as communication electronics.TransDigm’s thriving aftermarket business continues to expand as a majority of aircraft bought during the financial crisis is beginning to age, and requires more frequent and comprehensive servicing.We believe stable aftermarkets, which have historically produced higher gross margins, will continue to drive financial performance for the upcoming quarters.However, softness in business jet, helicopter and freighter revenues, have been hurting the company’s profits. The company expects that its gross margins will be affected in the upcoming quarters due to increase in interest expenses, which have been flaring up for the last few quarters.In addition to this, weakness in the global macroeconomic conditions is thwarting air travel, adding to the company’s woes. Further, the company has some persistent concerns about the commercial transport industry in the upcoming quarters as well. These factors can play spoilsport for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company in the near term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (TDY  -  Free Report), Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report) and Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report). While Teledyne Technologies and Curtiss-Wright sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Curtiss-Wright carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

440,COL,"With President Donald Trump closer to his major legislative move — the biggest tax overhaul in decades — investors have started chasing dividend growth stocks. This is because lower corporate taxes would boost companies’ profitability leading to fatty dividends and in turn benefit stocks having a history of dividend growth year over year.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model, a long track record of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields. All these makes dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term.Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe. Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Style Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 13 stocks that fit the bill:Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (JLL  -  Free Report): This Illinois-based full-service real estate firm provides management services, corporate and financial services and investment management services to corporations and other real estate owners, users and investors worldwide.

441,COL,"L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 1, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.17%. Moreover, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 6.61%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Dearth of Order: A ConcernUsually contract wins from the Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the United States drive revenues for defense contractors like L3 Technologies. Unfortunately, the company secured no notable contract during the first quarter of 2018. This in turn is likely to weigh on the company’s revenues for the to-be-reported quarter.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales indicate year-over-year decline in the two major segments of the company.Moreover, soft commercial satellite market conditions continue to hurt aviation security and electronic systems along with commercial SATCOM and communication systems. Cumulatively, these factors are expected to drag down the company’s overall top line number.Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.33 billion, implying a 12.7% year-over-year decline.Tax Reform: A Boon?The latest U.S. tax reform boosted L3 Technologies’s fourth-quarter earnings per share by 99 cents. Expecting to witness similar gains in 2018 as well, the company has increased its 2018 earnings guidance.  However, the company is expected to incur $15 million pension expenses during the year, which will dent its earnings growth.  We believe, this along with the significant dearth of orders might impact the company’s bottom line adversely.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus estimate for earnings shows 3.4% year-over-year decline for the upcoming quarterly result. L3 Technologies Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  L3 Technologies Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | L3 Technologies Inc. Quote Solid Cash FiguresL3 Technologies’ strong balance sheet provides financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividends, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions. Continuing with its trend of consistent dividend hike, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 6.7% in February 2018 to 80 cents. This hike marked the 14th consecutive dividend increase for the company. Keeping up with its trend we may expect the company’s upcoming results to reflect similar solid balance sheet figures.Vertex Divesture: What Lies Ahead?Contract price modifications at Vertex Aerospace unit raised concern about L3 Technologies’ Aerospace Systems segment’s growth.  In fact, the company has identified this segment to be its most challenging business and remains skeptical about this unit’s growth rate as well as profitability.  However, as the company remains on schedule to sell Vertex by the middle of 2018, the divesture is likely to not have any impact in L3 Technologies’ first quarter results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that L3 Technologies is likely to beat on earnings this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: L3 Technologies has an Earnings ESP of +2.51%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: L3 Technologies carries a Zacks Rank #3, which along with positive Earnings ESP increases the probability of a positive earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) while going into an earnings announcement.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other stocks in the Aerospace and Defense space worth considering on the basis of our model which shows that they have the right combination to pull off a beat:Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 27.

The reported figure also increased 33.3% from the prior-year quarter figure owing to solid top-line growth.Adjusted net income came in at $68.2 million compared with $49.6 million in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year improvement can primarily be attributed to the company’s solid top-line performance.Inside the HeadlinesFLIR Systems’ revenues grew 8.1% year over year to $439.6 million. The top line also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $397.5 million. Strong growth across the company’s two of the three segments drove the overall top line.FLIR Systems, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise FLIR Systems, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | FLIR Systems, Inc. Quote Segment-wise, revenues at the Industrial segment increased 10.3% year over year to $170.7 million. The improvement was driven by higher handheld thermal imager and camera core sales. At the Government and Defense segment revenues came in at $159.3 million, up 15.3% on a year-over-year basis. The uptick can be attributed to international deliveries. However, the Commercial segments’ revenues declined 3.7% to $109.6 million from the year-ago quarter.Adjusted operating income came in at $87.8 million compared with $69.6 million in the prior-year quarter. Healthy top-line improvement led to the rise in income.Liquidity & Cash FlowAs of Mar 31, 2018, the company's cash and cash equivalents were $452.1 million compared with $519.1 million as of Dec 31, 2017. Long-term debt was $421 million, marginally up from $420.7 million at Dec 31, 2017.Cash flow generated from operating activities in the quarter came in at $43.2 million, down from $75.1 million in the prior-year quarter.OutlookConcurrent with the first-quarter earnings release, FLIR Systems revised its guidance for 2018.

The new segments are called Government & Defense, Industrial, and Commercial. Streamlining the operations is anticipated to augment the company’s agility, drive solid improvements in backlog, operating margin, net income, earnings per share as well as enhance management focus. We believe that FLIR Systems’ strategic restructuring activities and solid backlog levels should help it sail through difficult economic times and drive growth.However, the company’s gross margins remain vulnerable to a host of factors, including product mix changes and manufacturing cost absorption.FLIR Systems carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are Rockwell Collins, Inc.

443,COL,"Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 27, before the opening bell.The aviation electronics maker posted in-line earnings in the last reported quarter. Impressively, Rockwell Collins surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 2.50%.Let’s take a detailed look at the factors influencing Rockwell Collins' quarterly results.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Rockwell Collins is likely beat earnings this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: Rockwell Collins has an Earnings ESP of +0.19%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Rockwell Collins carries a Zacks Rank #2, which along with positive Earnings ESP increases the probability of a positive earnings surprise.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Rockwell Collins, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   Rockwell Collins, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Rockwell Collins, Inc. Quote Factors at PlayRockwell Collins remains the foremost global supplier of communications and avionics equipment for both commercial and military customers. The company continues to expand its operations in overseas markets driven in part by expanding populations and emerging economies. During the fiscal first quarter, BOC Aviation selected Rockwell Collins’ advanced avionics, as a baseline configuration on up to 74 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Moreover, AIRMARK Aviation of Singapore selected Rockwell Collins’ ADS-B Out solution to upgrade four of its Boeing 737-300 aircraft, with an option to fit one more.We believe these orders will boost the company’s top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal second-quarter sales of $2.14 billion reflects a solid annual surge of 59.5%.Moreover, the company’s B/E Aerospace buyout, has been adding value to its top line and bottom-line growth ever since the deal’s completion. In fiscal 2017, its U.S. sales improved 18% as a result of improved accretions from this takeover.In line with this, we expect this acquisition to continue boosting the company’s earnings in the second quarter as well. Evidently, the Zacks consensus estimate for earnings in the second quarter stands at $1.75 per share reflecting an annual growth of 30.6%.Last September, Rockwell Collins entered into an agreement to be acquired by United Technologies Corporation for $30 billion. The deal is expected to create one of the world’s largest aircraft-equipment manufacturers.Notably, shareholders of Rockwell Collins will be given all-cash consideration of $140 per share, reflecting a premium of nearly 7.5% from the company’s closing price of $130.29 on Sep 1, 2017. Interestingly, shares of Rockwell Collins is presently trading near the acquisition price but has not yet attained it. Considering this, investors even now have a possibility of gaining from this stock. We may expect further development on this transaction once the company releases its quarterly result.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies to consider as our model shows they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26.

444,COL,"Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the opening bell.The company’s revenues are anticipated to be primarily driven by Missile Systems business unit’s performance in the quarter under review. Moreover, we expect the upcoming result to reflect solid cash flow numbers. Let’s take a detailed look at the factors influencing Raytheon’s quarterly results.Missile Systems Unit Driving GrowthSegment-wise, Missile Systems business unit that represent more than 30% of the company’s total business sales continues to be a major growth driver. Keeping this trend, Raytheon is poised to benefit from this unit in the first quarter as well. Notably, the company won a modification contract worth $523 million for production of Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile’s (AMRAAM) 31st Lot, and a foreign military sales contract worth $150 million for providing staffing and training services to support the Qatar Patriot Air Defense Missile Systems in the quarter under review.Raytheon also won a $2.3 billion hybrid contract for providing engineering services to the Phased Array Tracking Radar Intercept on Target (PATRIOT) weapon systems program. Again, around the end of the quarter, it secured a $4.8 billion deal to deliver Patriot Missile Systems to Poland, which turned out to be Poland’s biggest arms deal till date. Surely these order flows will boost Missile Systems unit’s top line in the quarter.In sync with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter sales is pegged at $1,909 million for the segment, reflecting year-over-year growth of 7.7%.Raytheon Company Price and EPS Surprise Raytheon Company Price and EPS Surprise | Raytheon Company QuoteDividend Hike: A Solid Cash StoryIn March 2018, Raytheon’s board of directors approved a hike in annual dividend of 8.8%, marking the 14th consecutive annual dividend increase by the company.A steady dividend payout policy primarily mirrors Raytheon’s robust financial position and balanced capital deployment strategy. In fact, an increase in dividend at regular intervals has been one of the characteristic features of this defense major.Raytheon ended fourth-quarter 2017 with operating cash flow from continuing operations of $1.6 billion, reflecting an increase of 45.4% year over year. We may expect the soon-to-be reported results to reflect similar solid cash flow performance by the company.Other Factors at PlayApart from winning contracts for its Missile Systems business unit, Raytheon’s other segments also secured notable contracts from Pentagon. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for other segments also reflected annual sales growth.  Buoyed by such solid sales expectations for each of its segments, the consensus estimate for first-quarter total sales is $6.17 billion, representing an annual improvement of 2.9%.On the bottom-line front, lower tax expenses and in-line interest expenses are expected to provide an impetus to the company. In line with this, the consensus mark for Raytheon’s first -quarter earnings of $2.10per share reflects a year-over-year improvement of 21.4%What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Raytheon is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Raytheon has an Earnings ESP of +1.91%.

445,COL,"Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, before the opening bell.The Defense giant’s Aerospace Systems remains the major growth driver. The company’s first-quarter results are expected to gain from the same.  Lower corporate tax also is likely to boost results.Let’s discuss the factors influencing Northrop Grumman’s quarterly results, in brief.Aerospace Systems — A Key CatalystThe Aerospace Systems segment fetches almost half of Northrop Grumman’s sales and has traditionally been a primary contributor to its top-line growth. The segment’s sales are likely to benefit from increased demand as well as aircraft deliveries. Notably, in the first quarter, the company received a number of contracts for this segment.Among them, the significant ones are the $429-million contract for developing two Extremely High Frequency Data Rate (EHF XDR) payloads and a $255-million contact for low-rate initial production (LRIP) of three MQ-4C Triton. Such contract wins are likely to boost the Aerospace Systems segment’s first-quarter revenues.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Aerospace Systems segment stands at $3,131 million, reflecting annual growth of 16.1%.Other Factors to ConsiderThe company’s total sales growth has been historically benefited from higher sales at the Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems segment. We expect the upcoming quarterly result to reflect this trend as well.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $2,870 million  reflect an annual increase of 5%,  as the company is expected to continue with its increase in production rates for Sensors and Processing programs.Cumulatively, this is likely to boost the company’s total sales growth for the first quarter. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $6,583 million, reflecting annual growth of 5.1%.While lower corporate tax on account of the recent tax reform is likely to boost the company’s top line, Northrop Grumman is expected to incur notable expenses in regard to its Orbital ATK acquisition. These two opposite forces may neutralize each other, as a result of which our consensus estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings of $3.63 per share remained in line with the year-ago quarter’s figure.Further updates on the company’s Orbital ATK acquisition can be expected once it releases first-quarter results.Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Northrop Grumman Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Northrop Grumman is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Northrop Grumman has an Earnings ESP of -0.99%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Northrop Grumman carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the probability of earnings beat.

446,COL,"FLIR Systems, Inc. (FLIR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 58 cents per share, delivering a positive surprise of 3.6%.We expect FLIR Systems to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that FLIR Systems has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: FLIR Systems has an Earnings ESP of +2.33% as the Most Accurate estimate of 44 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.FLIR Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise FLIR Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | FLIR Systems, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Reasons Driving Better-Than-Expected ResultsFLIR Systems continues to benefit from its well-diversified business portfolio in terms of geographies, products and markets. Also, the company’s restructuring efforts over the past five years have helped it to combat headwinds like currency fluctuations and difficult market conditions. Moreover, the company’s robust execution and streamlined business have enabled it to drive solid improvements in backlog, adjusted gross margin, net income and earnings per share. We believe the company’s strategic restructuring activities and solid backlog levels will continue driving profitable growth.Also, the company’s core strength in providing reliable and effective imaging & threat-detection technologies is expected to bolster its performance in the quarter. Meanwhile, increased adoption of thermal imaging in a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from military to personal hand-held cameras and Smartphones, continue to fuel growth in this market. Moreover, FLIR Systems’ government and military business has been faring well over the past few quarters driven by its CDMQ model.Further, the company’s persistent focus on introduction of innovative products has enabled it to penetrate new markets and expand its customer base. Notably, since the launch of Lepton technology, FLIR Systems has witnessed solid compound annual growth rate in total unit volumes. We believe that steady market traction of the newly launched products should continue supplementing sales performance in the upcoming quarters as well. In the meantime, its recent acquisitions are acting as major profit churners. The previously completed buyouts are anticipated to boost top-line growth in the quarter under review.Despite these tailwinds, FLIR Systems’ gross margins remain vulnerable to a host of factors, including product mix changes and manufacturing cost absorption. Also, high manufacturing cost absorption is likely to restrict the company’s growth. Moreover, poor economic conditions across its key operating regions might hamper capital investment and consumer spending, thereby weighing on its profitability.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.91% and a Zacks Rank #2.

447,COL,"The Boeing Company’s (BA  -  Free Report) Defense, Space & Security segment has been witnessing solid demand for its varied product offerings. However, a dismal delivery figure for its defense equipments marred this healthy demand scenario. We expect Boeing’s first-quarter 2018 results, scheduled for release on Apr 25, to duly reflect these factors.Key CatalystsIn the first quarter, Boeing’s defense business won a number of multi-billion-dollar contracts. Also, of late, management has been witnessing strong support for funding levels, above the President's budget request, for a number of its programs namely the F-18, CH-47 Chinook, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, AH-64 Apache, the V-22 and the space launch system.In sync with this, the company won quite a few contracts for its F/A-18 programs in the to-be-reported quarter.  Such robust demand for its programs is likely to boost Boeing’s order growth and subsequently its defense backlog, which in turn, should boost the defense, space and security segment’s revenues in the quarter under review.KC-46 Delivery- A Major PositiveThe upcoming results are Iikely to reflect further progress in the company’s KC-46 tanker program. In 2011, the U.S. Air Force awarded Boeing a deal for designing, developing, manufacturing and delivering four next generation aerial refueling tankers – KC-46A. Also, the fourth quarter of 2017 witnessed Boeing’s first delivery contract of KC-46 international tanker to Japan.With its management aimed at delivering first 18 tankers this year, we may expect the yet-to-be reported quarter’s results to reveal more updates on this program.Deliveries – A Gloomy PictureOn Apr 10, 2018, Boeing announced first-quarter 2018 delivery figures that reflected a 40.5% decline in defense shipments compared with the previous year. Notably, the company’s defense deliveries totaled 25 in first-quarter 2018, down from 42 dispatched in the year-ago period. Total deliveries consisted of six AH-64 Apache helicopters (remanufactured) and eight Chinook helicopters (new and renewed). The company also delivered four P-8’s, five F/A-18s and two F-15s.The Boeing Company Price and EPS Surprise The Boeing Company Price and EPS Surprise | The Boeing Company QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Boeing is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

448,COL,"With the rise in demand for commercial jetliners both in the domestic and the international market, The Boeing Company’s (BA  -  Free Report) Commercial Airplanes segment has been receiving contracts regularly for delivering 737, 787 and 747 jets. We believe the impact of the same to get duly reflected in the company’s first-quarter 2018 results, slated to release on Apr 25, before the market opens.Solid Deliveries Buoy OptimismOn Apr 11, Boeing announced upbeat first-quarter 2018 commercial delivery figures. The company delivered 84 airplanes, up 8.9% year over year. The rise in delivery came on the back of  higher demand for 737 jets. Delivery of the single-aisle 737 jet increased to 132 in the first quarter of 2018 from 113 a year ago.Shipments of the 777 and 787 Dreamliners totaled 12 and 34, compared with 21 and 32, respectively in the year-ago period. For the 747 and 767 jets, the company delivered two and four jets, respectively compared with 1 and 2 in the year-ago quarter.737 — A Major Growth DriverDemand for Boeing’s commercial airplanes has been on the rise due to a steady improvement in the passenger and freight traffic. Per Boeing's current market outlook, the world will need 41,030 new planes, worth $6.1 trillion between 2017 and 2036. Single-aisle jets are expected to be the major demand driver, comprising 72% of the total projection.Interestingly, the company’s 737 model remains one of the best-selling planes in the single-aisle market, courtesy of its fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Interestingly, majority of the commercial orders Boeing has won in 2018 belonged to the 737-fleet. In particular, recent ramp up in the production of 737 Max has been fueling the demand for 737-fleet.Considering the fact that management at Boeing expects its current-year revenues to reflect higher planned production of the 737 model, we expect this fleet of jet to play the role of a key catalyst for Boeing’s first-quarter results.The Boeing Company Price and EPS Surprise The Boeing Company Price and EPS Surprise | The Boeing Company QuoteWill Huge Orders Drive the Top Line?Keeping with its trend, Boeing received a number of multi-billion-dollar orders in the first quarter. However, it has been witnessed that majority of these orders came for either 737-Max or 787-Dreamliners.  In particular, lower delivery rates for its 777-model marred the order growth for 737. Indeed, a huge drop of 43% was witnessed in the first quarter deliveries of 777 model, which clearly show lack of demand for this particular jet. In fact, realizing its declining demand, Boeing implemented a planned production rate decrease from seven per month to five per month during third-quarter 2017, which has been further reduced to the rate of 3.5 per month for 2018.This significant decline in 777 deliveries may outweigh the 16.8% improvement in 737 deliveries and might get reflected in the form of lower revenues for Boeing’s commercial jets in the upcoming results. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Commercial Airplanes segment’s revenues is pegged at $13.1 billion for the first quarter, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 12.4%.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Boeing is likely to beat earnings this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

Solid cash flow is also expected to get reflected in the upcoming results.Let’s take a detailed look at the factors influencing General Dynamics’ quarterly results.Dividend Hike: A BoonGeneral Dynamics’ strong cash generating capability provides the company with financial flexibility, which in turn allows it to hike dividend significantly and repurchase shares. This, in turn, makes the stock a valuable pick for investors. Notably, its cash and cash equivalents were $2,983 million at 2017-end compared with $2,334 million at 2016-end. Moreover, its cash flow from operating activities was $3,879 million in 2017 compared with $2,198 million in 2016.Last month, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 10.7%. Impressively, the latest hike marked the 21st consecutive annual dividend hike.The raised dividend indicates General Dynamics’ optimism on solid cash inflow, which we believe will get reflected in its yet-to-be reported results.New Products & Orders to Boost SalesOrder flow form Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the United States generally boost quarterly sales of defense bellwethers, and General Dynamics is no exception. Notably, the company’s business division, Electric Boat, clinched a modification contract worth $696.2 million for supplying long lead time materials for the construction of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 Virginia-class submarines.Moreover, in February, the company unveiled its newest aircrafts — Gulfstream G500 and Gulfstream G600 — at the Singapore Airshow. Such innovations are expected to provide impetus to Gulfstream business’ revenues, which we believe will get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results. In sync with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter sales is pegged at $7.5 billion, reflecting 1.4% year-over-year growth. General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | General Dynamics Corporation Quote Other Factors at PlayIn the first quarter, General Dynamics offered to buy CSRA — an information technology provider — for $9.6 billion, including $2.8 billion of debt. However, CACI International proposed $7.2 billion in cash for the takeover. Interestingly, General Dynamics revised its acquisition deal with CSRA on Mar 20, 2018. Per the agreement, General Dynamics agreed to acquire all of CSRA’S outstanding shares for $41.25 per share in cash, reflecting an increase of 50 cents from the previous proposal.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Dynamics’ first-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.47 per share, reflecting 0.4% annual decline. This might have been caused by higher R&D expenses that management expects the company to incur across 2018.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that General Dynamics is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: General Dynamics has an Earnings ESP of +0.18%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: General Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other stocks in the Aerospace and Defense space worth considering on the basis of our model which shows that they have the right combination to pull off a beat:Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 27. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.19% and a Zacks Rank #2.Boeing (BA  -  Free Report)) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25.

450,COL,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 25.The company’s results in the to-be-reported quarter are anticipated to be primarily driven by regular contract wins along with higher commercial jet deliveries.Let's take a detailed look at the factors influencing Boeing’s quarterly results.Slew of Contract Wins — Key CatalystBeing largest aircraft manufacturer and one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the United States, Boeing enjoys a solid inflow of contracts from both the Pentagon as well as foreign allies, courtesy its varied product offerings.Markedly, the company received a number of big orders for its commercial jets in the first quarter including a $12-billion contract from American Airlines for 47 Dreamliners, a $8.8-billion order from Jet Airways for 75 737-Max jets, a $6.2-billion order from Lion Air Group for 50 737 MAX 10 jets and a $2.8-billion contract from Hawaiian Airlines for 10 787-Dreamliners.Among the defense contracts won in the first quarter, the significant ones include a $1.2-billion deal to develop a baseline configuration for the production and delivery of 22 F/A-18E and 6 F/A-18F Super Hornets and a modification deal with cumulative face value of $305 million for Royal Saudi Air Force F-15SA fighter jet. Boeing also clinched a contract worth $312-million modification contract for providing Joint Direct Attack Munition tail kits. The company won a delivery order worth $430 million to provide F/A-18 planned maintenance interval-1 high flight hour depot support.In addition, on Mar 30, 2018 Boeing announced that it has signed a Memorandum of Agreement with Saudi Arabian Military Industries to form a new Joint Venture (""JV"") worth $450 million. The JV will help to localize more than 55% of the maintenance, repair and overhaul services for fixed and rotary-wing military jets in Saudi Arabia.Boeing has also agreed to provide the technological know-how required to install weaponry on the aircraft included in the JV as well as localize the supply chain for spare parts.Thus, it goes without saying that such steady inflow of contract wins will surely boost Boeing’s quarterly sales. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter sales is pegged at $22.2 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 5.9%.Q1 Deliveries to Boost Bottom LineBoeing’s first-quarter deliveries showed an 8.9% improvement year over year in commercial shipments. However, defense shipments declined 40.5% than the year-ago figure. Higher demand for the 737 jets primarily drove the year-over-year improvement in commercial deliveries. Boeing’s total deliveries were 209 units in the first quarter of 2017, compared with 211 the year-ago period figure.Notably, during its fourth-quarter 2017 earnings call, Boeing announced that higher volume will drive its bottom line in 2018. Although, the company’s overall deliveries declined, commercial deliveries reflected solid growth and with this business constituting for almost 60% of Boeing’s total revenues, we may expect to see a notable uptick in first-quarter earnings.In line with this, the consensus estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.56 per share, reflecting a solid year-over-year increase of 27.4%. The Boeing Company Price and EPS Surprise  The Boeing Company Price and EPS Surprise | The Boeing Company Quote Cash Flow: A Strong PositiveDuring 2017, Boeing paid $3.42 billion in dividends and repurchased 46.1 million shares for $9.2 billion. This reflects strong balance sheet and cash flows that the company boasts, which in turn provide it financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions. Boeing generated $13.34 billion of operating cash flow at the end of 2017, up 27.1% year over year. The company projects to generate operating cash flow worth $15 billion for 2018, reflecting annual improvement of 12.4%. Therefore, we may expect its upcoming results to reflect such solid cash flow features, as we have witnessed in prior years, buoyed by the scrumptious orders that Boeing won in the first quarter. What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Boeing is likely to beat earnings this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Well, Boeing possesses the right combination currently, as the Zacks Rank #2 company has an Earnings ESP of +1.70%.

451,COL,"TransDigm Group Inc. (TDG  -  Free Report) has managed to impress investors with its recent earnings streak, wherein the company’s bottom line has trumped estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters. TransDigm’s impressive business model actively works toward strengthening and enhancing its position in highly-engineered proprietary aerospace components’ niche markets.We believe that the company’s strong operational execution, solid portfolio of products as well as complementary acquisitions should continue boosting growth, moving ahead.Consequently, TransDigm’s shares have had an impressive run on the bourse over the past six months. The stock has gained 16.3%, compared with the industry’s rally of 9.5%. We expect the company’s remarkable traction across markets to continue in the upcoming quarters as well. Given this backdrop, let’s delve deeper to find out key drivers for the company right now.Factors to ConsiderTransDigm’s business operation model is driven by three value driver concepts has helped the company generate sufficient organic and inorganic growth, and drive operating margin expansion over the past few quarters. Also, it designs, produces and supplies highly engineered proprietary aerospace components and certain systems with a significant aftermarket presence. In this regard, 90% of TransDigm’s net sales are generated from proprietary engineered products, for which the company enjoys the intellectual property right, thus enhancing its competitive strength meaningfully.Moreover, the company’s penchant for acquisitions of proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content has helped it to bolster footprint in core market and grab a higher market share. In fiscal 2017, TransDigm acquired three add-on aerospace product lines, for a total consideration of roughly $100 million.These acquisitions should add to its product range with the proprietary products, which already enjoy strong positions on high use of platforms and robust aftermarket content. Further, its Defense business has been experiencing stability, thus adding to the company’s strength.Also, decentralized organizational structure and a unique compensation system for senior management have created a potent workforce that acts as one of the company’s major assets. This apart, a diversified revenue base reduces TransDigm’s dependence on any particular product, platform or market channel, thus playing a crucial role in maintaining its financial performance.However, the company is suffering from escalating debt burden and consequent higher interest expenses. Its interest expenses have also been trending upward for the past few quarters. For instance, TransDigm recorded an interest expense of about $15 million, up 10% from the previous quarter, mainly on account of increase in its total debt. We believe that rising interest expenses will continue restraining its profits, going ahead.This apart, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been suffering from prolonged weakness in some of its major end market that has thwarted the company’s growth momentum. Softening discretionary retrofits, interior retrofits and weakness in jet and helicopter markets have also impacted its top-line performance in recent times.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include Curtiss-Wright Corp. (CW  -  Free Report), Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) and Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report). While Curtiss-Wright sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Raytheon and Rockwell Collins carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Curtiss-Wright surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 15.1%.Raytheon surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 6.4%.Rockwell Collins outpaced estimates thrice in the preceding four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 2.5%.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

452,COL,"Merger and acquisition activities across the globe picked up rapidly in the first quarter thanks to U.S. tax reform and faster economic growth in Europe.Per the preliminary Thomson Reuters data, global mergers and acquisitions had their strongest start ever totaling $1.2 trillion in the first quarter of 2018. This is up 67% over the past year and marks the fourth quarter that has surpassed $1 trillion over the past three years. United States M&A volumes climbed 67% while Europe volumes doubled. Meanwhile, Asia saw an 11% increase. However, the number of deals dropped 10% year over year to 10,338.According to a report by research firm Mergermarket, M&A activity across the world has hit a 17-year-high record in the first quarter with 3,774 deals globally, totaling $890.7 billion. This was the strongest start to the year since 2001 and represents an 18% year-over-year increase in value.The healthcare space has so far been at the forefront as Amazon’s move into the pharmaceutical sphere has spurred the major pharmacy retailers to consolidate. With regard to this, U.S. health insurer Cigna (CI  -  Free Report) will acquire the largest pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding (ESRX  -  Free Report) for $67 billion. The deal is expected to close by the end of this year. In another deal, the drug chain and a pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp (CVS  -  Free Report) is also in a process of acquiring the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) for $69 billion. The deal is expected to close in the second half of the year (read: Cigna to Buy Express Scripts: Healthcare ETFs in Focus).Another large agreement is German utility EON SE’s $38.5 billion deal to acquire RWE AG’s renewable energy business Innogy SE.The boom in M&A is likely to continue given an accelerating economy, still-low interest rates, and tax reform, which allows companies to bring offshore cash back home. Potential cost savings through mergers are further fueling the urge to merge in the current ultra-competitive environment.How to Tap?Investors could easily take advantage of this surge in deals by employing the merger arbitrage strategy in their portfolio. This strategy looks to tap the price differential (or spread) between the stock price of the target company after the public announcement of its proposed acquisition and the price offered by the acquirer to pay for the stock of the target company. This is especially true given that investors should go long on the target or the acquired company and short on the acquiring company. When the deal is completed, shares of the target company will increase to the full deal price (in some cases slightly below the deal price), giving investors a nice profit.Below, we have highlighted three merger ETFs to ride out the surge from the increasing M&A deals. Any of these could make compelling options for investors seeking to implement this low correlation strategy to their portfolio: IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF (MNA  -  Free Report) This fund offers capital appreciation by investing in global companies for which there has been a public announcement of a takeover by an acquirer while at the same time provides short exposure to global equities as a partial equity market hedge. This is done by tracking the IQ Merger Arbitrage Index. The fund has 44 holdings in its basket with the largest allocation to Blue Buffalo Pet Products  and Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report) on the long side. These two firms combined to make up for 17.5% share. The product has amassed $503.7 million in its asset base and trades in average volume of around 119,000 shares a day. It charges 77 bps in annual fees. The ETF has lost about 2.3% year to date (see: all the Hedge Funds ETFs here). ProShares Merger ETF (MRGR  -  Free Report) This product provides exposure to a global merger arbitrage strategy, which seeks to capture the spread between the price at which the stock of a company (a target) trades after a proposed acquisition of such target is announced and the value (cash plus stock) that the acquiring company has proposed to pay for the stock of the target (a spread). This can be easily done by the S&P Merger Arbitrage Index. The fund holds a well-diversified portfolio of 33 stocks. Technology, industrials, healthcare and financials are the top three sectors. The ETF has been able to manage assets worth $4.4 million while it sees light volume of just 1,000 shares a day. Bottom Line While investors could capitalize on merger arbitrage by trading in a particular target company stock, the ETFs provide diversified exposure in the basket form with lower risk. Further, these could be excellent choices for investors in the rocky market due to their low correlation with the overall market (read: Trade Tensions or Not, Stay Safe with These ETFs). This is because companies in merger and acquisition deals generally move independently, ignoring all other issues that influence the movement of other stocks. As a result, investors could definitely focus on these products for relatively higher returns in any type of market.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

453,COL,"FLIR Systems, Inc. (FLIR  -  Free Report) launched a thermal traffic sensor — FLIR ThermiCam V2X — for the emerging vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology market. The sensor will be a vital component in smart city and connected vehicle applications.The V2X-enabled traffic sensor is designed for urban traffic that will enable vehicles and traffic infrastructure to communicate by sharing data. The entire system will advance safety and efficiency for motorists, pedestrians and bicyclists.The V2X technology is an emerging crash avoidance system that warns drivers about potentially dangerous situations based on communication between nearby vehicles and traffic infrastructure. Both the vehicles and the infrastructure will have communication units installed to transmit information in a V2X system.Also, the ThermiCam connects with existing city traffic systems and thus, city traffic planners can future-proof traffic infrastructure without needing to make major investments in retrofitting technology.FLIR Systems is a leading maker of sensor systems globally. Its reliable and effective imaging & threat-detection technologies are expected to bolster its revenues in the future. Increased adoption of thermal imaging in a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from military to personal hand-held cameras and Smartphones, continue to fuel growth. Notably, shares of the company yielded 28.6% in the past six months, nearly double the industry’s average gain of 14.5%. The company also remains strongly committed toward the introduction of innovative products to expand customer base and enhance foothold in new markets. Going forward, we expect steady market traction of these products to help the company drive revenue growth in the respective segments.Moreover, the company’s solid execution and streamlined business have helped it drive solid improvements in backlog, operating margin and net income in the past few quarters. Further, its streamlined operations are anticipated to drive solid improvements in backlog, operating margin and net income.This apart, driven by its CDMQ model, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s government and military business has also been faring well over the past few quarters. Using the model, the company has been able to combat softness in cyclical spending associated with government markets. However,softness in the retail product line has significantly hurt its Security segment over the past couple of quarters.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) andTeledyne Technologies Incorporated (TDY  -  Free Report). While Curtiss-Wright sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Rockwell Collins and Teledyne carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Curtiss-Wright has surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average surprise of 15.1%.Rockwell Collins has surpassed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.5%.Teledyne Technologies has delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 35.4%, beating estimates in all the trailing four quarters.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

454,COL,"Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) recently secured a foreign military sales (FMS) contract for providing technical expertise and assistance to the Qatar government. Work related to this contract is scheduled to be over by Nov 30, 2022.Valued at $150.2 million, the contract has been awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL. Per the terms of the deal, Raytheon will offer training, planning, fielding, deployment, operation, maintenance management, configuration management, logistics support, installation and sustainment of the Qatar Patriot Air Defense Systems and associated equipment.Fiscal 2018 foreign military sales funds will be utilized to carry out the task at Doha, Qatar.Patriot Air Defense SystemPatriot is a long-range, high-altitude; all-weather missile defense system. It consists of radars, command-and-control technology and multiple types of interceptors. The system helps to detect, identify and defeat tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, drones, advanced aircraft and other threats.Raytheon — the manufacturer of the popular Patriot missile defense interceptors — has consistently remained focused on upgrading this defense system to keep pace with the changing dynamics of modern warfare. This must have enabled, Patriot to become the foundation of integrated air and missile defense for 13 nations.What’s Favoring Raytheon?Raytheon’s Patriot missile-defense systems have seen a number of buyers in recent times including international customers like Qatar, Korea and Poland. In September 2016, Poland signed a letter of request with the United States for an integrated air and missile defense system based on Patriot. Per earlier expectation, the country signed a FMS agreement worth $10.5 billion with the U.S. government, last month (according to Reuters). With the addition of Poland, Raytheon sees emerging opportunities in the European region. In this line, Raytheon’s management expects that the company has an opportunity to expand its market in Poland that boasts a total value of nearly $5 billion.Apart from Poland, Raytheon believes that Patriot will be in demand in other countries like Romania. The company hopes to clinch an agreement pertaining to the same worth $2 billion. These opportunities, along with demand for additional fire units and upgrades for existing customers in other regions, continue to demonstrate the strength of Raytheon’s Patriot franchise.With increasing geo-political tensions across the globe, apart from the United States and its allies, other nations across the globe are also utilizing advanced technology to strengthen their defense systems. Raytheon’s Patriot missile defense system has showed its success during the 1991 Gulf War and Iraqi War. This must have boosted the demand for this particular missile system worldwide.The company believes that growing interest in including a 360-degree active electronically scanned array radar to the Patriot Air Defense systems will lead to further sales growth for the company.Currently, the rocket and missile market is projected to grow from $55.5 billion in 2017 to $70 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 4.74% during the forecast period (as per Markets and Markets research firm). Given this huge opportunity for expansion, frequent contract wins from Pentagon for its high-end missiles like Patriot, including the latest one, will allow Raytheon to further enhance its market share in the aerospace and defense industry.Price Performance Raytheon’s stock has returned 25.3% over a year, underperforming the 29.9% rally of the industry it belongs to. This might have been caused by the earlier budget cuts implemented by the U.S. government.  Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderRaytheon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), Orbital ATK, Inc. , and Rockwell Collins, Inc.

455,COL,"Raytheon Company’s (RTN  -  Free Report) Missile Systems business segment recently won a contract for providing support equipment and support hours for Enhanced Paveway II bomb. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Feb 28, 2019.Valued at $59.7 million, the contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Eglin Air Force Base, FL. Fiscal 2016 and 2018 procurement funds will be utilized to finance the task, which will be executed at Tucson, AZ.A Brief Note on Enhanced Paveway IIThe Enhanced Paveway II belongs to Paveway family of laser guided bombs. These bombs have revolutionized tactical air-to-ground warfare by converting ""dumb"" bombs into precision guided munitions. Paveway bombs make up more than half the air-to-ground precision guided weapons used in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Paveway II version is the weapon of choice for more than 40 customers.Newer versions of the Paveway bomb include GPS/INS guidance capabilities. The latest Paveway bomb combines the accuracy and flexibility of traditional laser-guided weapons with the all-weather capability of GPS guidance, creating a product which lowers the required sortie count and weapon inventory while increasing the mission’s success rate.Our ViewWith the increase in cyber-attacks, terrorism threats and geopolitical instability, there is an immediate need of all countries to elevate their level of security and defense. Major defense contractors like Raytheon, AeroVironment, Inc. (AVAV  -  Free Report), Orbital ATK, Inc. , Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) are putting their best to make most of this opportunity and expand their business worldwide. Moreover, the frequent cross-border counter-missile testing conducted by the United States and North Korea has further boosted the prospect of missile-makers like Raytheon.In particular, Raytheon’s Missile Systems segment has been clinching significant awards from the United States as well as international customers, courtesy of its high-end, combat-proven advanced arsenals. To this end, last month, the company won a $300 million worth modification contract from the U.S. Army for supplying Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wireless-guided missiles.Notably this segment witnessed 10% sales growth in the third quarter of 2017, with Raytheon’s Paveway program being one of the primary growth drivers. We believe the recently won award reflects the strong demand that the Paveway program already boasts and with the similar ones anticipated in the near future, will enable the company to enhance its business in the ever-expanding missile market.Price PerformanceRaytheon’s stock has returned 25.4% over a year, underperforming the 31.2% rally of the industry it belongs to. This might have been caused by the earlier budget cuts inflicted by the U.S. government. Zacks RankRaytheon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

456,COL,"Thanksgiving is coming up and it’s time to stuff dividend stocks with strong growth prospects in your portfolio for market-beating returns. This is especially true as stocks with a history of dividend growth year over year form a healthy portfolio with greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields.  Inside Dividend Growth StrategyStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth as opposed to those that pays high yields form a healthy portfolio with more scope for capital appreciation. This is because these stocks act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. Simultaneously, these offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely.

457,COL,"Premium engineered aircraft components provider, TransDigm Group Incorporated (TDG  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results last week, wherein earnings once again surpassed estimates. Despite recording year-over-year growth, net sales in the quarter trailed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.We anticipate that a continuous rise in interest expenses, weakness in revenues related to business jets, helicopters and freighters, and persistent concerns about the commercial transport industrywill thwart growth for the company in the upcoming quarters.Further, the stock has put up a dismal show in recent times. Over the past three months, TransDigm has lost 4.2%, as against the industry’s gain of 5.4%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has moved south over a couple of months from $13.42 to $13.23, indicating bearish analyst sentiment.  Read on to find the major factors denting the company’s growth and why it may be prudent to avoid this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock at the moment.Factors Troubling TransDigmTransDigm’s business remains highly vulnerable to risks associated with macroeconomic conditions. Currently, the company is witnessing some weakness in revenues related to business jets, helicopters and freighters, and expects the adverse trend to persist in near future as well. In addition, weakness in the global macroeconomic conditions is affecting air travel, adding to the company’s woes. Further, the company has some persistent concerns about the commercial transport industry in the upcoming quarters as well.TransDigm has been suffering from prolonged weakness in some of its major end markets, which has thwarted the company’s growth momentum. Softening discretionary retrofits, interior retrofits and weaknesses in jet and helicopter markets have impacted the company’s top line in recent times. TransDigm’s commercial transportation business is plagued by inventory management issues from OEM customers, much of which appears due to rate reductions on wide-body platforms. Also, softness in this market can be traced to a decline in various fleet refurbishment projects.The company expects that its gross margins will be pressured in the upcoming quarters due to increase in interest expenses, which have been trending upward for the last few quarters. In fact, TransDigm expects its debt servicing costs to rise almost 24% year over year to around $600 million in fiscal 2017. Thus, we believe that rising interest expenses will continue to restrain the company’s profits, going forward.These apart, major acquisitions like SCHROTH, DDC, PneuDraulics, Franke and Breeze involve significant integration-related costs, and might also take some time to be properly integrated into the company’s existing business, which further increases costs.Other factors like environmental liabilities and failure to successfully integrate acquisitions also add to the company’s risks.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks in the industry are Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (TDY  -  Free Report), Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) and Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report). While Teledyne Technologies sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Rockwell Collins and Curtiss-Wright carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Teledyne Technologies has an average positive earnings surprise of 37.2% for the trailing four quarters, having surpassed estimates thrice.Rockwell Collins managed to beat estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, at an average earnings surprise of 2.6%.Curtiss-Wright has an average positive earnings surprise of 11.8% for the trailing four quarters.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

458,COL,"TransDigm Group Incorporated (TDG  -  Free Report) reported its seventh successive earnings beat, as is fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings came in at $3.48 per share, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.38.The figure fared even better in year-over-year comparison, rising 5.8% from the year-ago quarter’s adjusted figure of $3.29.The bottom-line growth came on the back of robust top-line performance and improvements in the operating margin. Also, continued efforts to boost productivity, favorable product mix and lower acquisition-related costs proved conducive to the earnings growth. This was partially offset by higher interest outlay.For fiscal 2017, adjusted net income rose 6.5% year over year to $12.38 per share.Inside the HeadlinesNet sales for the quarter amounted to $923.9 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 5.6%. However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $967 million. Organic net sales growth was 2.7%.For fiscal 2017, net sales rose 10.5% over fiscal 2016 to $3,504.3 million, with organic net sales growth of 2.4%.Decent growth in Defense (up 3% year over year) and Commercial Aftermarket (up 4%) revenues supplemented the top-line performance. Furthermore, contributions from the previously-completed acquisitions boosted the overall sales performance during the quarter. TransDigm’s commercial aftermarket transport business witnessed solid year-over-year revenue growth.Majority of the company’s commercial aftermarket businesses witnessed year-over-year revenue growth, which was supplemented by stronger defense revenues. In fiscal 2017, the commercial transport aftermarket revenues were up in the mid-single-digit percentage range, which was partially offset by softness in the interior businesses, and sustained weakness in the business jet and helicopter aftermarket revenues.TransDigm’s EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) grew 8.7% year over year to $460.1 million.Transdigm Group Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Transdigm Group Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Transdigm Group Incorporated QuoteDuring fiscal 2017, TransDigm announced the acquisition of three add-on aerospace product lines, for a total consideration of roughly $100 million. These product lines mainly comprise proprietary, sole-source products with significant aftermarket content. The product lines are in sync with the company’s long-term plan and highlight its strategy to acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, in a bid to fortify its core business.The acquired business lines have combined revenues of about $32 million and will be consolidated into TransDigm’s existing businesses. The company financed the acquisitions through existing cash on hand.These acquisitions will add to TransDigm’s product range with their proprietary products that enjoy strong positions on high use of platforms, robust aftermarket content and an excellent reputation. Products offered by them include highly engineered aerospace controls, quick disconnect couplings, as well as communication electronics.LiquidityTransDigm ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $650.6 million, down from $1587 million as of Sep 30, 2016. At the end of the reported quarter, the company’s long-term debt was $11.4 billion compared with $9.9 billion recorded at the end of September 2016.During fiscal 2017, TransDigm repurchased 1,723,624 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately $390 million.Fiscal 2017 GuidanceConcurrent with the fiscal fourth-quarter results, the company issued strong earnings and revenues guidance for fiscal 2018. Sales are expected to lie in the range of $3,645 million to $3,725 million (compared with $3,504 million in fiscal 2017). Also, adjusted earnings per share are predicted to be in the band of $12.78-$13.42 per share, in comparison to $12.38 per share in fiscal 2017.The fiscal 2018 guidance assumes that commercial aftermarket and OEM revenues will grow in mid-single-digit percentage range, while defense revenues will be up in the low- to mid-single-digit percentage range.Additionally, projected net income from continuing operations is estimated to lie in the band of $702-$738 million and EBITDA is likely to be in the range of $1,805-$1,855 million.Our TakeTransDigm’s thriving commercial aftermarket and defense business proved to be staple growth drivers for its fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017 results. The aftermarket business comprises 55% of sales, but makes up more than 75% of EBITDA. This translates into consistent revenue-generation capacity through all phases of the aerospace cycle. The aftermarket business is expanding as majority of aircraft bought during the financial crisis is beginning to age, and requires more frequent and comprehensive servicing.We believe stable aftermarkets, which have historically produced higher gross margins, will continue to drive financial performance for the upcoming quarters.However, softness in business jet, helicopter and freighter revenues, have been hurting the company’s profits. In addition to this, weakness in the global macroeconomic conditions is affecting air travel, adding to the company’s woes. The company is concerned about the commercial transport industry in the coming times as well. These factors can play spoilsport for this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company in the near term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry include Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (TDY  -  Free Report), Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) and Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report). While Teledyne Technologies sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Rockwell Collins and Curtiss-Wright carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Teledyne Technologies has a positive average earnings surprise of 37.2% for the trailing four quarters, beating estimates strongly all through.Rockwell Collins surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average surprise of 2.6%.Curtiss-Wright has managed to beat estimates each time in the trailing four quarters, for a positive earnings surprise of 11.8%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

459,COL,"Given that the stock market is at its peak, investors are looking for both income and growth in their portfolios. This can easily be achieved by focusing on stocks that not only pay dividends but also consistently increase their payout.  Dividend Growth: A Winning StrategyStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth as opposed to those that pays high yields form a healthy portfolio with more scope for capital appreciation. This is because these stocks act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. Simultaneously, these offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals compared to other dividend paying stocks as dividend growth reflects a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. All these make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe.However, the long history of outperformance by dividend growth stocks compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stocks does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow.

460,COL,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 8, before the market opens.Last quarter, this military shipbuilder posted a positive earnings surprise of 22.52%. While the company’s Ingalls segment is expected to drive strong growth in the third quarter, the Newport News segment is likely to be a spoilsport.Let’s discuss these factors influencing Huntington Ingalls’ quarterly results, in brief.Ingalls Unit – A Key CatalystHuntington Ingalls’ Ingalls segment manufactures amphibious assault and expeditionary ships for the U.S. Navy and is the only builder of National Security Cutters (NSCs) for the U.S. Coast Guard. Notably, this division launched LHA 7, the second America-class amphibious assault (AAA) ship in May which has been driving sales volumes for this segment, lately. Based on the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter result, we expect the soon-to-be reported quarter’s results to reflect similar solid sales volumes, as well.  In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s Ingalls business segment is pegged at $595 million for the third quarter, reflecting an annual improvement of 4.4%.Newport News Segment May Dent Growth: Here’s WhyHuntington Ingalls’ Newport News is the nation's sole designer, builder and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.This division, which generates more than 50% of the company’s total revenues, has been underperforming for the last couple of years. Going ahead, no near-term improvement can be expected anytime soon for this business unit.In line with this, our third-quarter consensus estimate for Newport News unit stands at $988 million, reflecting an annual decline of 16.3%. However, at the onset of the third quarter, this business unit signed a contract with United Steelworkers of America as the largest bargaining unit, which in turn may boost this division’s results.Other Factors to ConsiderIn addition to the aforementioned facets of Huntington Ingalls’ quarterly results, a steady inflow of orders from Pentagon is expected to provide an impetus to third-quarter sales. Among the notable deals that the company won in the yet-to-be-reported quarter, worth mentioning is the $105-million modification contract for upgrading nuclear submarines, another modification deal worth $149 million to procure additional long-lead-time material for USS Enterprise (CVN 80) and a $2.8-billion contract to support the refueling and complex overhaul of USS George Washington (CVN73).Moreover, the company’s Technical Solutions business continues to gain traction from Camber Corp’s acquisition.As a whole, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects improvement of 22.5% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is estimated at $1.78 billion, implying a 5.9% year-over-year increase.What Does the Zacks Model Unveils? Our proven model shows that Huntington Ingalls has chances of beating third-quarter earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key components. While the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), its Earnings ESP is +0.84%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.80, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.78. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.A positive ESP along with a favorable Zacks Rank serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

Notably, 74.9% of these index members surpassed EPS estimates with a revenue beat ratio of 65.7%. Meanwhile, majority of the companies from the broader Aerospace sector have already released their quarterly numbers.A handful of companies from this space have released their financial numbers in the past five trading sessions. Defense stocks continued to receive a moderate flow of fund from the Pentagon. However, major indices of the Aerospace-Defense industry ended in the red over the trailing five sessions.

Also, its approval of additional stock repurchase reflects a strong cash flow result for the quarter.Let’s take a detailed look at the factors influencing Rockwell Collins' quarterly results.Government Systems Unit – A Key CatalystDuring the fiscal third-quarter earnings call, management stated that Rockwell Collins has witnessed positive sales and backlog growth in its Government Systems unit, on a year-over-year basis.

This, in turn, is expected to reflect strong quarterly cash flow results for Rockwell Collins.   .For the quarter, our Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects a 13.6% year-over-year growth.

468,COL,"TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 27.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.8%. TransUnion has an impressive average positive surprise of 10.6% for the trailing four quarters, beating estimates all through.We expect TransUnion to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that TransUnion has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: TransUnion has an Earnings ESP of +2.14%, as the Most Accurate estimate of 48 cents is pegged above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Growth Drivers for the QuarterTransUnion has an attractive business model with highly recurring and diversified revenue streams, significant operating leverage, low-capital requirements, and strong and stable cash flows. In addition, the inherent nature and significance of the company’s solutions in customers’ decision-making steps endow it with high-customer retention and revenue visibility. These factors have helped drive consistent operating results for the company in recent times, and will likely boost the upcoming quarterly results as well.During the quarter, TransUnion acquired leading provider of vehicle and driving records, Datalink Services, Inc. d/b/a Compass Driving Records. This acquisition will enable TransUnion’s DriverRisk solution to offer the insurance industry a full-driving record platform. We anticipate the acquisition to have a favorable impact on the quarter’s results.TransUnion Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise TransUnion Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | TransUnion QuoteTransUnion has been enjoying strong growth momentum in recent times. Particularly, the company’s USIS segment, which witnessed 16% year-over-year growth in revenues in the second quarter, will likely record sturdy top-line growth in the coming results as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the USIS segment revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $294 million, reflecting impressive growth of 13.5% year over year.Further, we expect the International segment to continue its strong growth trajectory this quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is pegged at $91 million, underlining striking year-over-year growth of 15.2%.In fact, the Consumer Interactive segment, which has been weak in recent times, is also expected to return to the growth track this quarter. The segment’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s sales is $102 million, indicating growth of 6.3% year over year. However, the revenues of the segment are expected to decline sequentially.The company’s collaboration with Carahsoft Technology Corp. — a trusted government IT solutions provider — will also likely boost the results in to-be-reported quarter.As emerging market economies continue to develop and mature, the company becomes well positioned to gain from the associated favorable socio-economic trends. Additionally, increased risk of identity theft due to data breaches, and higher consumer awareness about the importance and usage of their credit information are propelling the demand for TransUnion’s consumer solutions. These factors bode well for the company’s operating results.Per the company’s guidance provided in the last quarterly results, consolidated revenues are expected to be in the range of $470-$475 million for third-quarter 2017. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be between $185 million and $189 million, while adjusted earnings are expected to be between 45 cents and 46 cents per share.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Terex Corporation (TEX  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +3.17% and a Zacks Rank of 2, is expected to release quarterly numbers around Nov 1.

469,COL,"Leading packaging and paper manufacturer International Paper Company (IP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 25.In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.6%. Over the trailing four quarters, the company topped earnings estimates thrice, generating an average positive surprise of 2.1%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderDuring the third quarter, International Paper completed the divestment of its foodservice business in China, as part of its strategy to focus more resources on high-return capital projects in the company’s core businesses. The move is aimed to improve its long-term profitability amid tough competition from diverse players. The company has taken taking other initiatives as well to drive margin expansion, which are anticipated to reflect well in the upcoming results.The acquisition of Weyerhaeuser Co.’s pulp business has strengthened its position in the global fluff pulp market and augmented its operating cash flow. The synergies so generated, along with top-line contribution, are anticipated to bolster sales in the upcoming quarterly results.We expect the company’s Industrial Packaging business to continue its strong growth momentum in the third quarter. The segment’s revenues exceeded estimates by 18.6% and grew 5.3% year over year to $3,706 million in second-quarter 2017. In the upcoming quarterly results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s sales is pegged at $3,823 million, reflecting robust sequential growth.Sales numbers of Printing Papers segment are likely to remain flat sequentially, while the Consumer Packaging segment is expected to show slight positive sequential growth.International Paper depends heavily on raw materials such as wood fiber, purchased in the form of pulpwood, wood chips and old corrugated containers (OCC), and certain chemicals, including caustic soda and starch, energy sources, principally natural gas, coal and fuel oil. Rising energy, chemical and OCC costs remain headwinds, particularly under harsh winter conditions. This is likely to lower its profitability in the to-be-reported quarter to some extent.International Paper Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise International Paper Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | International Paper Company QuoteFurthermore, International Paper has a huge burden of pension obligations. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, changes in general interest rates and the number of retirees are likely to increase pension costs and reduce its cash flow, thereby limiting the growth momentum lent by the company’s acquisitions.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that International Paper will likely beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is currently pegged at 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.04.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: International Paper has a Zacks Rank #3. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Terex Corporation (TEX  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +3.17% and a Zacks Rank of 2, is expected to release quarterly numbers around Nov 1.

FLIR Systems has an average negative surprise of 1.3% for the trailing four quarters.We expect FLIR Systems to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that FLIR Systems has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: FLIR Systems has an Earnings ESP of +2.08%, as the Most Accurate estimate of 49 cents is pegged above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Growth Factors in This Past QuarterFLIR Systems’ diverse portfolio has been a staple growth driver, helping it offset weaknesses associated with any one market. The company’s restructuring efforts in the past five years have allowed it to streamline business operations and optimize growth. Key metrics like revenues, operating income, operating margin and adjusted EPS have materially benefited from such actions. We expect this trend to continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well.FLIR Systems, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise FLIR Systems, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | FLIR Systems, Inc. QuoteIn addition, impressive traction of FLIR Systems’ products, featuring the Lepton thermal microcamera core, is anticipated to boost the top line significantly. Since the launch of the Lepton technology, the company has witnessed a 58% compound annual growth rate in total unit volumes. Products launched during the year — including X6900sc SLS, X8500sc SLS cameras, upgraded version of FLIR M-series thermal cameras and third-generation FLIR ONE(R) and FLIR ONE Pro thermal imaging cameras — are expected to ramp up sales for the quarter under review.Moreover, FLIR Systems’ keen eye for strategic acquisitions is likely to be conducive to its inorganic growth. Previously completed acquisitions, including Armasight, DVTEL and Dynamics, are expected to boost the company’s top-line performance. Additionally, the company’s diligent CDMQ model will likely compound the sales of its government and military business, which should reflect well on its top line.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Terex Corporation (TEX  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +3.17% and a Zacks Rank of 2, is expected to release quarterly numbers around Nov 1.

471,COL,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Space Systems business segment recently secured a modification contract to exerc ise options for Trident II (D5) missile production and for providing associated system support for deployment. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Sep 30, 2022.Details of the DealValued at $522.3 million, the contract has been awarded by the Strategic Systems Programs, Washington, DC.Majority of the work for this agreement will be executed in Magna, Utah and Sunnyvale, CA. The remaining part will be carried out in Cape Canaveral, FL; Pittsfield, MA and in various other regions across the United States.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 weapons procurement (Navy), fiscal 2018 other procurement (Navy) funds, and fiscal 2018 research, development, test, and evaluation (Navy) funds to complete the task. Fiscal 2018 research, development, test, and evaluation (Navy) funds might also be utilized to partially finance the deal, subject to availability.A Brief Note on Trident II (D5)Trident II (D5) is the latest generation of submarine-launched fleet ballistic missiles, developed and produced by Lockheed Martin. It was first deployed in 1990 and is currently aboard the OHIO-class and BritishVANGUARD-class submarines.Markedly, these missiles are equipped with multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRV) and thermonuclear warheads.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin’s Space Systems unit is the prime contractor of the Navy's Trident missile. Notably, the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile is a program with the U.S. Navy for the only submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missile currently in production in the United States.Along with the United States and other powerful nations, developing countries across the globe are also revamping their missile strength due to the increasing geopolitical conflicts, war, and terrorism. As a result of this, the global rocket and missile market, which also includes fleet ballistic missiles, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.74% during 2017-2022 to reach a value of $70 billion by 2022 (as per Markets and Markets research firm). Such projects reflect improved growth opportunities for missile-makers like Lockheed Martin, in the years to come.In February 2018, the $716-billion proposal made by President Trump for the fiscal 2019 defense policy bill is surely anticipated to boost the overall defense industry. In particular, this budget provisions for an investment of approximately $6 billion in the United States’ missile defense program. We believe the latest contract won by Lockheed Martin is a reflection of the fact that the United States is rapidly expanding its missile strength and given the budget’s allocation for missile programs, the company will win more such deals in the days ahead.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has returned about 23.3% over a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 43.8%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally. Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report) and Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report).

472,COL,"American Outdoor Brands Corporation (AOBC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, after market close on Mar 1.The gun maker surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 11.89%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderOf late, American Outdoor Brands has been experiencing an increase in overall inventory levels. The upside can be attributed to the decline in shipments in the first half of fiscal 2018 combined with an inventory build related to new product introductions. To resolve this issue,, the company took measures to reduce its outsourced manufacturing of firearm parts as well as overall production output levels at certain of its facilities.Per management, these initiatives have the capability to reduce the inventory level but such reductions may take time. Meanwhile, in case demand rises, such manufacturing reductions may impact the company’s operating results in the second half of fiscal 2018.Moreover, according to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), firearm background checks dropped 9.5% year over year in fourth-quarter 2017 (October-December 2017), which indicates a decline in demand. This, in turn, might hurt sales of publicly traded gun manufacturers like American Outdoor Brands.While, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Outdoor Brands’ fiscal third-quarter earnings of 9 cents projects a decline of 86.4%, the same for revenues of $175.3 million hints at a decrease of 24.9% on a year-over-year basis.American Outdoor Brands Corporation Price and EPS Surprise American Outdoor Brands Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | American Outdoor Brands Corporation QuoteEarnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for American Outdoor Brands this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

473,COL,"The aerospace and defense sector has been on a rally since last year. This has primarily been due to President Donald Trump’s push to boost defense spending in the United States. Further, a steep reduction in corporate taxes late last year will prove to be instrumental in bolstering growth for the sector in 2018.Also, Trump’s fiscal 2019 budget plan beefs up spending on defense and military research by as much as $470 billion over the next two years. Under such circumstances, the space is poised to breach boundaries in 2018 as the momentum that the segment picked up in last one year will continue.Defense Rally to Continue The space has seen splendid growth over the last one year. This is evident from the rise that the three broader ETFs tracking the sector has experienced in a year. The iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF ITA, the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF XAR and PowerShares Aerospace & Defense PPA have all surged 34.9%, 31.3% and 31.9%, respectively. Notably, all these ETFs have surpassed the S&P 500’s (.INX) performance in the same period where the broader index climbed 17.4%.Coming to the top players in the industry, we find a similar trend of growth with each of the stocks individually surpassing the S&P 500’s performance in a year’s time. Shares of Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Orbital ATK, Inc. , General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) and United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) have gained 43.2%, 45%, 43.6%, 19.6%, 34.9%, 46% and 20.4%, respectively. Both the companies possess a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Trump’s Defense Budget ProposalThere’s no denying the fact that Trump’s presidency has come as a boon for the U.S. defense space, which was grappling with the budget sequestration act implemented by the prior government. While the fiscal 2018 (FY18) defense budget reflecting a noble 10% hike from the FY16 level was a major forerunner for this sector’s growth at the beginning of 2017, the FY18 defense policy bill worth $700 billion that extensively surpassed Trump's budget request took stocks to new heights in the second half of the year.On Feb 12, the Pentagon unveiled its fiscal 2019 budget proposal outlined by the President, in a bid to rebuild the U.S. military into a more agile and lethal force globally. Notably, the budget proposal aims at spending $716 billion on national security.Of the total, $686.1 billion has been reserved as funding for the Pentagon, reflecting 5% real growth over the initial FY18 President’s budget and 10% real growth over the current Continuing Resolution (CR). The budget includes $617.1 billion as base budget, highlighting a 17.8% increase from the 2018 current CR level, and $69 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations.Moreover, in the wake of North Korea’s ballistic missile threats, the budget proposal includes an investment plan of $6 billion for varied missile programs. The budget requests for increased investment worth $10.5 billion on facilities, reflecting a 7% rise over the fiscal 2018 base budget request. The funds will be used for fortifying military infrastructure to increase force lethality and minimize the cost of maintaining unneeded capacity.More Mergers & Acquisitions in PipelineIn the second half of 2017, we have seen a wave of mergers between big aerospace and defense companies in a bid to fend off competition, restructure business models as well as expand core operations and product lines. United Technologies has agreed to take over Rockwell Collins for $30 billion, while Northrop Grumman is set to buy Orbital ATK for $9.2 billion.While the deal will make United Technologies one of the world's largest aircraft equipment manufacturers, Northrop Grumman’s product line will benefit from Orbital's rocket motors, missiles and electro-optical countermeasure equipment. Slated to wrap up in 2018, synergies from these mega deals are sure to benefit the sector.Trump’s zeal to fortify the U.S. military has only strengthened the defense sector’s fortunes. The space rallied throughout last year, breaking boundaries in the second half of 2017 in particular. Most importantly, a reduction in corporate taxes to 21% has opened up more avenues for investments. Such developments have paved way for a plethora of acquisitions in the defense and aerospace segment in 2018.On Feb 12, the day Trump presented his second annual federal budget proposal, General Dynamics announced plans to purchase CSRA Inc  in a bid to venture and gradually expand the government sector business.Commenting on the deal, General Dynamics’ executive vice president of Information Systems & Technology Daniel Johnson stated that the company has an expanding budget and the analysts within the company believe that the services sector would spring back to pre-2011 conditions when the space was in its prime. This has encouraged the company to invest more on such ventures.Moreover, major defense contractors can expect a slew of contracts from the Pentagon. On the first day of 2018, Raytheon won a deal worth $333.4 million and Boeing secured a $193.6-million contract. With more such contracts anticipated, we expect major defense stocks to maintain the rally in 2018.U.S. Leads Global Defense ExportsEmerging nations like Japan and India as well as European countries are raising their defense budgets on account of the widespread geo-political uncertainties. As the United States is the largest supplier of defense equipment, it is without doubt a golden era for Aerospace & Defense stocks.According to the latest report from Aerospace Industries Association, United States led the global exports in the aerospace and defense segment in 2017. The country accounted for 34% of the total industry export. Further, U.S. Department of Commerce, the defense segment generated an astounding $143 billion from exports alone.Also, per the report from Aerospace Industries Association, China maintained the top spot as the largest importer of defense products from the U.S., accounting for a total of $16.3 billion worth of goods. Further, France and United Kingdom came in as the second and third, purchasing goods worth $12.9 billion and $10 billion, respectively.To ConcludeThe U.S. defense sector started off 2018 on solid note and is poised to witness stupendous growth in the days to come with a massive defense budget, steep reduction in corporate taxes and a plethora of merger deals and acquisitions lined up for 2018. Its recognition as the largest exporter of defense products in the world is another feather in its cap.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

478,COL,"Ahead of the opening bell for the final trading day of this week, new U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures were released, and, while not exactly disappointing, came up short of what many analysts had been expecting. The first read for Q4 GDP reached 2.6%, lower than the consensus estimate of 2.9%.Should this figure remain unchanged through future revisions — the second read is expected February 28 — this would amount to domestic economic growth of roughly 2.6%. This is nothing to sneeze at; in fact, it is almost exactly the average GDP growth rate of the previous 5 years. It’s a level which has brought the U.S. from the edge of the abyss during the Great Recession all the way to current all-time highs in the major stock market indexes.That said, the 30 basis-point miss does come as a bit of a surprise, especially considering a very strong Retail industry over the holiday shopping season, as well as a recovery in Oil & Gas and Construction and Manufacturing — all of which served as albatrosses in previous years. Indeed, some analysts were expecting a positive surprise for Q4 GDP that would have pushed the December quarter to 3% growth three times in a row for the first time this decade.This may yet happen, of course — future GDP reads have the benefit of more data points over time, and should this information break more to the positive, we could indeed see the most robust U.S. economy since the Recession. In particular, we look toward adjustments to private inventory investment, which shook out at 2.5% in Q4; personal consumption expenditures of 2.8% were the highest we’ve seen in a couple years.Q4 Earnings Roll OnWe finish the week as we began it — with a new batch of Q4 earnings results. Overall we’ve enjoyed a very strong earnings season, with positive surprises far outweighing negative ones. Even better: earnings revisions in future quarters for companies already having reported are currently up double-digits for the first time in many quarters, according to Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian.Industrial giant Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates by a penny to $1.85 per share. Revenues of $10.84 billion outpaced the $10.69 billion in the Zacks consensus.

482,COL," Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL  -  Free Report), is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 26, before the opening bell.The aviation electronics maker posted in-line earnings in the last quarter. Impressively, Rockwell Collins surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 2.61%.Let’s take a detailed look at the factors influencing Rockwell Collins' quarterly results.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Rockwell Collins is likely to beat earnings this season because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is +0.43%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Rockwell Collins carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayRockwell Collins remains the foremost global supplier of communications and avionics equipment for both commercial and military customers. The company’s balanced exposure to both types of customers allows it to use government funding to develop products for the dual-end market.Particularly, the $700-billion defense bill policy has improved the outlook for defense stocks like Rockwell Collins manifold. Evidently, its share price gained 5.6% since Senate approved the bill, last September.In the same month, Rockwell Collins entered into an agreement to be acquired by United Technologies Corporation for $30 billion. The deal is expected to create one of the world’s largest aircraft-equipment manufacturers.Notably, shareholders of Rockwell Collins will be given all-cash consideration of $140 per share, reflecting a premium of nearly 7.5% from the company’s closing price of $130.29 on Sep 1, 2017. Interestingly, shares of Rockwell Collins is presently trading near the acquisition price but has not yet attained it. Considering this, investors even now have a possibility of gaining from this stock.Moreover, even after announcement of its takeover, Azerbaijan Airlines selected Rockwell Collins in November 2017, to provide its global, high-speed broadband in-flight connectivity, overhead in-flight entertainment and a full suite of advanced avionics — including Rockwell Collins’ MultiScan ThreatTrack weather radar — for 10 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.We believe this contract will boost the company’s top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal first-quarter sales of $1.9 billion reflects a solid annual surge of 66.6%.This shows the huge demand that Rockwells Collins’ products enjoy worldwide and is thus a treasured acquiree in the Aerospace-Defense industry.Moreover the company’s B/E Aerospace buyout, which it completed in April 2017, has been adding value to its top and bottom-line growth since then. In fiscal 2017, its U.S. sales improved 18% as a result of improved accretions from this takeover. In line with this, we expect this acquisition to boost the company’s earnings in the first quarter as well and thus our consensus estimate for earnings of $1.53 per share reflects an annual growth of 27.5%.Rockwell Collins, Inc.

483,COL,"United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) recently moved a step closer to completing the acquisition of Iowa-based avionics firm, Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report). The strategic transaction, expected to close by the third quarter of 2018, will likely create an industry behemoth with an unrivalled competitive advantage.Shareholder ApprovalYesterday, Rockwell Collins announced that more than 96% of the total votes casted for seeking the approval for the transaction, representing above 72% shareholders, voted in favor of the merger. Both the companies are presently awaiting other regulatory approvals and the fulfillment of other mandatory closing conditions.The MergerIn September last year, United Technologies inked a definitive agreement to acquire Rockwell Collins for $140 per share in a combination of cash and stock. Under the terms of the agreement, each Rockwell Collins shareholder is entitled to receive $93.33 per share in cash and the balance amount or $46.67 in United Technologies’ shares. This equates to a purchase price of $30 billion, including Rockwell Collins' net debt. United Technologies funded the transaction through secondary debt offering and available cash while maintaining solid investment grade credit ratings.Post completion, Rockwell Collins and United Technologies’ UTC Aerospace Systems division will be integrated to create a new business unit called Collins Aerospace Systems.Probable BenefitsThe acquisition is expected to offer United Technologies a bigger clout in the industry and increase its bargaining power as it would emerge as one of the largest aircraft equipment manufacturers. The combined company would be better suited to meet the evolving global customer needs.With complementary products, the combination is likely to yield operating synergies through lower operating costs and more opportunities to cross sell the products. United Technologies expects the merger to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share after the first full year of combined operations with synergies to the tune of more than $500 million.United Technologies has outperformed the industry in the last three months with an average return of 13.6% compared with a gain of 1.8% for the latter.Moving ForwardWith a bigger product portfolio, the company is likely to become an even more critical supplier of components to big aircraft manufacturers like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Airbus SE (EADSY  -  Free Report). The consolidation of two industry heavyweights could further set off a wave of similar such deals across the defense industry.The acquisition is expected to boost United Technologies’ aerospace segment that has been struggling of late with severe delays in for supply orders in the Pratt & Whitney division. We remain bullish on the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock post the transaction.

485,COL,"Orbital ATK  announced that it has successfully clinched the first full-rate production (FRP) contract for its all-electronic FMU-167/B Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze (HTVSF).The $23 million award has been contracted through the U.S. Air Force, and is a follow-on FRP order to the low-rate initial production contract in 2016.What is HTVSF?Orbital ATK developed the all-electronic FMU-167/B, recognizing the need to fulfill a specialized and growing demand for penetrating weapons. As such, the HTVSF is an advanced technology with an intelligent, cockpit programmable fuze capable of destroying hard and deeply buried targets.It is capable of such an action with the help of advanced sensors, robust algorithms and hardened electronics technology that aid in improved performance against tactical targets. It provides multiple delay arming and detonation times, as well as a void-sensing function, which also allows precision activation of the fuze.Orbital ATK’s Contracts & R&DOrbital ATK currently boasts of over 100 major development and production programs that assure a steady revenue stream and inflow of new contracts. In the third quarter, the company invested $70 million in R&D and capital equipment. Notably, such continual investments will certainly help the company to come out with new products and upgrade existing ones to meet growing demand.Thanks to the company’s diverse product offering, it continues to win several contracts from its wide customer base.

486,COL,"Higher business activities leading to a rise in air traffic have been accelerating maintenance spending on aircraft, which is driving MRO services growth cycle and in turn boosting AAR Corp.’s (AIR  -  Free Report) business.This has helped the company to remain the largest independent maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) provider in North America.To expand its MRO business, the company has signed two contracts for heavy maintenance services with Air Canada in the fiscal second quarter. Moreover, the company won a long-term MRO deal from Republic airline to perform heavy maintenance on the latter’s fleet of 188 Embraer 170 and 175 aircraft.With its principal customers being The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Airbus Group (EADSY  -  Free Report), AAR Corp. expects to see strong improvement in its Aviation Services segment as demand for comprehensive supply chain and maintenance programs rises in domestic and overseas markets.Coming to its earnings performance, AAR Corp. delivered a positive earnings surprise in one of the last four quarters, with an average miss of 0.77%. Notably, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings per share is $1.79, reflecting an annual improvement of 272.1%.On the flip side, the U.S. government’s reduced role in Afghanistan as a result of the troop drawdown has had a significant impact on the company’s expeditionary airlift fleet operations in the country. The U.S. government had announced plans to reduce the number of troops in Afghanistan. Presently, the number of troops in the country is below 10,000.The company’s expeditionary airlift service revenues will likely be hurt further if more troop reduction occurs in Afghanistan. Challenges posed by the airlift business are thus persistent headwinds for the company.Moreover, a comparative analysis of AAR Corp’s P/E ratio reflects a relatively gloomy picture that might be a cause for investor concern. Evidently, the stock has a trailing 12 month P/E ratio of 26.45, which remains above the broader industry’s  P/E ratio of 23.71 over a year, making it a dearer stock.These may have led to AAR Corp.’s underperformance with respect to its broader industry. The company’s shares have returned 21.3% compared with the industry’s rally of 28.5%.  Zacks Rank & Key PickAAR Corp. has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

487,COL,"Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) recently secured a foreign military sales (FMS) contract from the U.S. Air Force for conducting Surveillance Radar Program operations. The deal is valued at $333.4 million. Work related to this agreement will be carried out in Massachusetts.The contract also includes maintenance follow-on sustainment package that incorporates contractor logistics support (sustainment); engineering services and technical updates to address equipment obsolescence. It also encompasses transportation and material costs associated with contractor repair and return services; spare and repair parts; support and test equipment; publications and technical documentation personnel training and training equipment; government and contractor engineering; technical and logistics support services; and other related elements of logistical and program support.A Brief Note on Radar SystemsRaytheon’s diverse product portfolio offers a wide range of radar systems that is utilized by the different divisions of the U.S. Department of Defense. For the U.S. Air Force, Raytheon’s 3D Expeditionary Long-Range Radar offers the first U.S. systems built from the ground-up with exportability in mind. This radar’s concurrent design enables more cost effective and timely fielding of systems for U.S. forces, allies and security partners. This radar enables war fighters to affordably detect, identify and track a wide variety of objects accurately from great distances.Apart from this, the company’s radar product line includes Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar that simultaneously offers anti-air and anti-surface warfare, electronic protection and air traffic control capabilities to aircraft carriers and amphibious warfare ships.What’s Favoring Raytheon?With the increase in cyber attacks, terror threats and geopolitical instability, there is an immediate need for all countries to elevate their level of security and defense. Major defense contractors in the nation like Raytheon, AeroVironment, Inc. (AVAV  -  Free Report), Orbital ATK, Inc.  and Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) are putting their best to make the most of this opportunity and expand worldwide. While surveillance plays a vital role in maintaining a nation’s security, upgraded radar systems form an integral part of those surveillance programs.Raytheon, being a producer of a wide range of next-generation radars, enjoys a pioneering position in the surveillance radar market. Its Intelligence, Information and Services (IIS)  business segment specializes in global Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); cybersecurity; analytics; training; logistics; mission support; engineering; automation and sustainment solutions.Although this segment saw a mere 1% sales growth during the third quarter of 2017, management expects substantial improvement in 2018 backed by solid demand in domestic as well as international markets. In particular, FMS contracts continue to be a vital growth driver for Raytheon as is evident from the fact that 32% of its third-quarter sales came from overseas.As far as demand for Raytheon’s radars in the international market are concerned, management continues to see significant additional demand for early warning radars as well as TPY-2 X-Band radars in the 2018 to 2020 period. We believe the latest contract from the U.S. Air Force further supports this expectation.Price PerformanceRaytheon’s stock has returned 14.2% over last six months, underperforming the 16.2% rally of the industry it belongs to. This might have been caused by stiff competition that the company faces  in domestic as well as overseas markets. Zacks Rank Raytheon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

488,COL,"Raytheon Company’s (RTN  -  Free Report) Missile Systems business recently clinched a foreign military sales (FMS) contract worth $634.2 million for manufacturing the 31st Lot of Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Jan 31, 2020.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Per the terms of the agreement, the company will make other AMRAAM system items, including spares and telemetry kits, along with AMRAAM. The deal will cater to Japan, Korea, Morocco, Poland, Indonesia, Romania, Spain, Turkey, Bahrain and Qatar.Fiscal 2017 production funds, research and development funds as well as fiscal operations and maintenance funds will be utilized to finance majority of the contract. Raytheon will carry out the production work at Tucson, AZ.A Brief Note on AMRAAMRaytheon’s AMRAAM is the world's most sophisticated air dominance weapon, with operational flexibility in a wide variety of scenarios, including air-to-air and surface-launch engagements. Its capabilities have been fully demonstrated in more than 4,200 test shots and 10 air-to-air combat victories.As per Raytheon, in the air-to-air role, no other missile compares to the AMRAAM missile. The weapon's advanced active guidance section provides aircrew with a high degree of combat flexibility and lethality. This weapon has been procured by as many as 37 nations, including the United States. It has been installed in top-quality military jets like F-16, F-15, F/A-18, F-22, Typhoon, Gripen, Tornado and Harrier.Its latest version, the AMRAAM-Extended Range missile is a new, ground-launched solution that will intercept targets at longer distances and higher altitudes.Our ViewWith the increase in cyber attacks, terror threats and geopolitical instability, there is a pressing need to boost security and defense by all countries. Major defense contractors in the nation like Raytheon, AeroVironment, Inc. (AVAV  -  Free Report), Orbital ATK, Inc.  and Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) are trying their best to make the most of this opportunity and expand worldwide.In particular, Raytheon’s Missile Systems segment has been clinching significant awards from the United States as well as international customers, courtesy of its high-end, combat-proven advanced arsenal. Toward this end, the company won a $302-million modification contract from the U.S. Navy for procuring 618 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) air-to-ground missiles and related spare parts last month.Based on the 10% sales growth at Missile Systems in third-quarter 2017 and the growing demand for Raytheon’s Integrated Air and Missile Defense portfolio in domestic as well as international markets, we expect this unit to scale new highs. This is further supported by the raised fourth-quarter sales outlook for this unit announced by Raytheon during the third-quarter earnings call.Price PerformanceRaytheon’s stock has returned 32.3% over a year, outperforming the 30.9% rally of the industry it belongs to. This may have been driven by rising demand for the company’s missile systems from the Gulf countries and Asia Pacific, apart from domestic customers.  Zacks Rank Raytheonhas a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

489,COL,"As 2018 fast approaches, we can’t help but look back on the past 12 months, a year that was a whirlwind politically, socially, culturally, and economically.While the U.S. dealt with everything from natural disasters and gun violence to protests about racial inequality and the sexual harassment reckoning, the stock market reached extraordinary highs.The market hit 62 daily all-time highs in 2017, notes CNBC, and the S&P 500 has returned almost 20% so far. And, the top performing sector, technology, which is up around 38% year-to-date, surpassed the worst-performing sectors (energy and telecom) by over 43 percentage points.Even with this overall positive economic sentiment, which has gotten a big boost from the new tax bill, merger and acquisition activity in 2017 has been relatively quiet; deals were down 35% year-to-date through mid-November.The deals that were announced this year, though, were major, and revolved around some of the biggest consumer and technology names. Here are 15 of the best mergers and acquisitions of 2017.1. Amazon Buys Whole FoodsEarlier this summer, e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced that it would be buying high-end organic grocery chain Whole Foods for $13.7 billion; the deal officially closed at the end of August. While the acquisition has been off to a rocky start, it gives Amazon hundreds of physical stores and provides the company a strong entryway into the competitive grocery and food industry.2. Intel Acquires MobileyeIntel INTC said in August that it had completed its tender offer for the outstanding shares of Mobileye, a company that develops sensors and cameras for Advanced Driver Assisted Systems (ADAS); the Israel-based company is also known for its computer vision and machine learning technology. The $15.3 billion deal gives Intel a huge advantage in the growing self-driving car industry, a market they estimate will grow to $70 billion annually by 2030.3. United Technologies Buys Rockwell CollinsIn a major industry deal, United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) agreed to buy Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report) for roughly $23 billion. This is one of the biggest moves in aviation history, and gives rise to an aerospace giant that will focus on the manufacturing of aircraft parts like touchscreen cockpit displays and jet engines, among many other things. United plans to combine its aerospace business with Rockwell Collins, creating a new unit named Collins Aerospace Systems.4. Disney To Buy Some of 21st Century Fox’s AssetsJust a few weeks ago, Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) and 21st Century Fox FOXA announced a historic $52.4 billion deal that would see Mickey Mouse’s parent scoop up a good chunk of the media conglomerate’s assets, including the film studio 20th Century Fox, the company’s TV production arm 20th Century Fox Television, Fox-owned cable networks (including FX and National Geographic), and FOXA’s stakes in international networks like Star TV and Sky; Disney will also gain majority control of streaming service Hulu. The deal, however, will likely face intense regulatory scrutiny.5. JAB Holdings Acquires PaneraFor $7.5 billion, European investment firm JAB reached a deal to buy bakery-café chain Panera Bread earlier this year, creating a formidable food-focused portfolio that includes Keurig Green Mountain, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Peet’s Coffee & Tea, and Caribou Coffee Company. Additionally, Panera is a restaurant that has managed to post steady comparable sales growth and rising revenue at a time when many chains are hurting.6. Michael Kors Acquires Jimmy Choo“Affordable” luxury retailer Michael Kors KORS agreed to buy footwear brand Jimmy Choo, a popular name in the fashion world known for its towering stilettos, for about $1.2 billion in July. The purchase had been a long-rumored one, and Kors plans on using its own massive global infrastructure to expand Jimmy Choo’s footprint. This likely won’t be Kors’ last acquisition either, as the company is now focused on forming a new, “luxury group.”7. Coach Buys Kate SpadeCoach, now Tapestry Inc. TPR, shook up the fashion industry back in May when the company announced that it would be purchasing its smaller rival, Kate Spade, for $2.4 billion. The deal is both an effort to reach younger consumers—it recently signed a deal with millennial and Instagram icon Selena Gomez—and to rebrand itself as a broader “lifestyle assortment company.”8. CVS Buys AetnaAfter weeks of rumors and speculation, drugstore chain CVS CVS announced that it would acquire insurance provider Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) for $69 billion. The two companies said this blockbuster deal would rein in health care costs and transform CVS’s 9,700 pharmacy storefronts into community medical hubs for primary care and basic procedures. It’s expected to close in the second half of 2018, and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.9. Gilead Acquires Kite PharmaIn October, Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) shelled out $11.9 billion for Kite Pharma, marking its biggest acquisition ever. The deal gives the biopharmaceutical company access to a promising cancer therapy, and hopefully makes it less reliant on antiviral treatments like its Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi. In particular, the cancer therapy is a CAR-T drug, which many in the industry believe will transform the cancer treatment market.10. Cisco Acquires BroadSoftIn a move that will grow its software footprint, Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) paid nearly $2 billion for BroadSoft , a company that sells cloud-based call control software, a product that is often re-labeled and sold by traditional telephone companies to their customers. This acquisition is what IT vendors dub “the future of work,” as it uses technology meant to make it easier for workgroups to communicate with each other.11. Apple Buys ShazamRecently, iPhone maker Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) confirmed that it has acquired Shazam for $400 million, a company that lets users identify songs, movies, TV shows, and commercials from short audio clips. The tech giant will be able to use Shazam to boost Apple Music. It also hopes to integrate Shazam more deeply into iOS, and utilize the app’s augmented reality technology to improve its ARKit efforts.12. Arby’s Roark Buys Buffalo Wild WingsJust last month, Arby’s owner Roark Capital Group announced that it would be acquiring chicken wing chain Buffalo Wild Wings BWLD for $2.4 billion. Arby’s has successfully executed a turnaround strategy by specifically emphasizing its unique fast-food menu selection; the firm hopes to apply this similar formula to Buffalo Wild Wings. Arby’s will also assume the debt of BWLD.13. Meredith Corp. Buys Time Inc.The Meredith Corporation MDP closed a $2.8 billion deal in November to buy Time TIME that would create a publishing giant. The Des Moines–based Meredith publishes the magazines Better Homes and Gardens, Family Circle, and Shape, among others, while Time owns Time, People, Sports Illustrated, Fortune, Entertainment Weekly, and many other print and digital media properties, and has been in business since 1922.14. Discovery Acquires Scripps Networks InteractiveIn November, Discovery’s (DISCA  -  Free Report) $14.6 billion acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive  received overwhelming shareholder support. The merger would unite two cable programming giants; Discovery owns the Discovery Channel, Investigation Discovery, OWN and TLC, while Scripp’s portfolio includes the Food Network, HGTV and Travel Channel.15. Google Buys Part of HTC Smartphone TeamThis fall, Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google division confirmed that it plans to acquire part of HTC’s mobile division team for $1.1 billion as it grows its smartphone hardware business. Google has become very serious about its hardware development with the debut of its Pixel line of smartphones, and scooping up a chunk of HTC’s team means that the tech giant can better directly challenge Android partners like Samsung, LG, and Huawei.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

490,COL,"Investors have been buoyed by TransDigm Group Incorporated’s (TDG  -  Free Report) recent winstreak, as TransDigm’s earnings have trumped estimates in the four trailing quarters. The company is anticipated to continue the momentum driven bycomplementary acquisitions, positive industry trends, solid operational execution and steadily growing end markets.TransDigm’s performance has reflected well on its share price, exhibiting investor optimism. The company’s shares have appreciated 6.4% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s average growth of 2%. We believe that the industry is witnessing favorable broader trends, which should have a positive impact on the company, in the quarters to come. Read on to find out the key drivers for the company right now.Factors at PlayTransDigm’s long-term growth strategy rests on five pillars namely, expanding proprietary aerospace businesses; executing value-based operating strategy; decentralized organization structure; strategic acquisitions and a diligent capital allocation strategy. The company’s excellent business operation model, which implements value-based operating strategies guided by three value driver concepts, has helped it generate sufficient organic & inorganic growth in the past few quarters. It has also aided operating margin expansion.TransDigm designs, produces and supplies highly engineered proprietary aerospace components and certain systems/subsystems with a significant aftermarket presence. 90% of the company’s net sales are generated by proprietary engineered products, for which the company owns the intellectual property. Moreover, its Defense business has also been performing better than expectations, consequently adding to the company’s strength. The diversified revenue base reduces the company’s dependence on any particular product, platform or market channel thus playing a significant role in maintaining financial performance.The company’s frequent acquisitions of proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, has helped it bolster footprint in core market and grab a higher market share. During the fiscal fourth quarter, the acquired businesses of Tactair, Young & Franklin as well as the three product lines generated $26 million of additional sales. The company anticipates these acquisitions to help shift focus to higher growth segments, consequently becoming more competitive.Despite the positives, TransDigm is currently affected by escalating debt burden and consequent higher interest expenses. Further, the company’s interest expenses have been trending upward for the last few quarters. In fact, it expects debt servicing costs to rise almost 24% year over year to around $600 million in fiscal 2017.Further, the company has been suffering from prolonged weakness in some of its major end markets, which has thwarted growth momentum. Softening discretionary retrofits, interior retrofits and weakness in jet as well as helicopter markets have impacted the top line in recent times.Considering growth drivers and the risks that the company faces, we have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) on TransDigm.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the same space include Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (TDY  -  Free Report), Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) and Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report). While Teledyne Technologies sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Huntington Ingalls Industries and Rockwell Collins carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

491,COL,"While a rise in interest rates might diminish the attractiveness of dividend stocks, these will still be in demand on optimism surrounding the biggest tax overhaul in decades. This is because lower corporate taxes will boost companies’ profits leading to handsome dividends and in turn lead to outperformance of stocks with a history of year-over-year dividend growth.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model, a long track record of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields. All these make dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term.Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe. Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform peers in all types of market environment.Growth Style Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 15 stocks that fit the bill:Louisiana-based H&E Equipment Services Inc. (HEES  -  Free Report) is one of the largest integrated equipment service companies in the United States with full-service facilities throughout the Intermountain, Southwest, Gulf Coast & Southeast regions of the United States.

492,COL,"Waters Corporation (WAT  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Oct 24.The company has a brilliant earnings beat streak, spanning 12 quarters of positive earnings surprises, which the company broke with in-line earnings in one of the quarters last year. Waters Corp.hasposted a positive earnings surprise of 2.3% in the last reported quarter. Overall, Waters Corp. has an average positive surprise of 4.1% for the trailing four quarters, having beaten estimates thrice.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Waters Corp. has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Waters Corp.has an Earnings ESP of +0.77%, as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.75 is pegged above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Drive Better-than-Expected ResultsWaters Corp.’s key strengths include a dominant position in the biopharma end markets and thriving sales in emerging markets. Global pharmaceuticals business, in particular, is the company’s largest single market and has been a major profit churner for the Waters Division over the past few quarters. We believe the company’s third-quarter financials will benefit from steady demand from the pharmaceutical business, growth in recurring revenues and modest recovery of industrial markets.Waters Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Waters Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Waters Corporation QuoteMoreover, the company’s Industrial business, which has gained momentum in the past few quarters due to increasing demand for improved food quality and safety testing, is likely to drive the quarter’s top line. In addition, demand for research intensive products, especially the company’s mass spectrometry solutions and liquid chromatography, has been on an uptrend lately and is likely to bolster the third-quarter sales.During the last reported quarter, Waters Corp.’s liquid chromatography benefited from the ACQUITY Arc System, while mass spectrometry sales grew on the back of QDa and Xevo family of Tandem Quadrupole. We believe robust market traction of the ACQUITY, CORTECS and Xevo line of products will supplement the top-line performance of the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Despite these positives, sluggishness in the company’s academic and government businesses are likely to restrict growth to some extent. Of late, unfavorable order timing and volatility associated with instrument-heavy business have played a spoilsport for the academic and government businesses. Also, weakness in the chemical industry on a global scale is likely to dampen sales performance for the to-be-reported quarter.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Terex Corporation (TEX  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +5.04% and a Zacks Rank #2, is expected to release quarterly numbers around Oct 30. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Scorpio Bulkers Inc. (SALT  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +13.24% and a Zacks Rank #2, is slated to report results on Oct 30.Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +6.79% and a Zacks Rank #3, is expected to report quarterly figures around Oct 27.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

493,COL,"Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 20.The company has a dreadful earnings history, with repeated, colossal earnings misses. Last quarter, the company missed estimates for the sixth consecutive quarter, recording a huge negative surprise of 60%. Ericsson witnessed an average negative surprise of 288% for the trailing four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement and whether Ericsson is set to add yet another earnings miss to its losing streak.Factors to ConsiderEricsson is in the midst of its worst crisis in a decade, grappling with shrinking markets and stiff competition from China's Huawei and Finland's Nokia. Slowdown in spending by wireless carriers severely hurt the company’s financials in the past few quarters and will likely hurt the third-quarter results as well.The beleaguered infrastructure giant’s repeated earnings misses, eroding profitability and precipitous revenue decline have left investors high and dry. The stock has lost 6.3% over the past six months, much wider than the industry’s average gain of 3%. Most of the company’s troubles have stemmed from drying-up investments by major telecom equipment makers across the world. Particularly, uncertainty in the financial markets, reduced consumer telecom spending and delayed auctions of spectrums pose significant threats for Ericsson. The company’s revenues and margins in the Networks and IT & Cloud segments continue to take a grave beating from adverse industry trends, which are expected to reflect in the upcoming results as well.Further, in the second-quarter 2017 earnings report, Ericsson noted that it expects a “high single-digit percentage” drop in the market for radio access networks this year, which is worse than previously projected. Network equipment sales, particularly in the North America and Europe markets, continue to contract. Europe and Latin America — the markets with the biggest impact — are likely to have an increasingly challenging investment environment in the quarters to come.Particularly, straight quarters of revenue declines and contract losses in Italy and Russia have made matters worse for Ericsson. This trend is unlikely to reverse itself in the to-be-reported quarter, thus thwarting profitability and sales.Ericsson Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ericsson Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ericsson QuoteSoft mobile broadband demand and slowdown in emerging markets will continue to put a significant dent in Ericsson’s performance. These factors will likely manifest in the company’s sales in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, it expects the industry trends and business mix in mobile broadband to prevail this year as well.To turn its fortunes, Ericsson came up with an elaborate restructuring plan to cut costs and focus on strategic areas.Despite these challenges, Ericsson is the world’s largest supplier of LTE technology, with a significant market share and has established a large number of LTE networks worldwide. Also, the Ericsson-Cisco partnership, which has been shaping up well ever since its inception in November 2015, is winning Ericsson lucrative awards, which should positively impact the upcoming quarterly results.We believe the only potential upside to earnings in the near future depends mostly on expense management. Ericsson had earlier announced a restructuring plan to cut costs and streamline the company’s focus areas, as well as explore options for the media business.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Ericsson will beat on earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is currently pegged at -260.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 2 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at earnings of 1 penny.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Ericsson has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Terex Corporation (TEX  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +5.04% and a Zacks Rank #2, is expected to release quarterly numbers around Oct 30.

494,COL,"Snap-on Incorporated (SNA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Oct 19.Snap-on has an outstanding earnings surprise history — it has not missed estimates in over seven years. Last quarter, the company registered a positive earnings surprise of 2%, generating an average positive surprise of 2.5% for the trailing four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement and whether Snap-on will be able to maintain its long-standing winning streak.Factors to ConsiderSnap-on’s successful earnings streak highlights its consistent capability to leverage on market opportunities for augmenting growth. Encouragingly, the company has been witnessing robust prospects in most of its business lines which signal brighter days ahead.Segment wise, Snap-on’s Commercial & Industrial Group has been enjoying strong performance in the European-based hand tools business. It has been benefiting from elevated sales to customers in critical industries, including the military. The segment’s contribution to revenues exceeded estimates by 4.4% and grew 8.5% year over year to $310 million in the second-quarter 2017 results. In the upcoming quarterly results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s sales is pegged at $313 million, reflecting slightly positive sequential growth.The Repair Systems & Information business has been the company’s strongest growth driver in the recent times, and we expect that higher sales of the diagnostics and repair information products will drive solid organic growth in the quarter under review as well. The Financial Services business is also anticipated to do well. Additionally, the company’s financial services portfolio has been recording steady growth for the past few years.Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Snap-On Incorporated QuoteSnap-On believes the recent Car-O-Liner buyout will strengthen its Repair Systems & Information Group offering, enabling the company to fortify its footprint in the auto and heavy-duty markets. Snap-On anticipates this company will generate operating income margin comparable to the RS&I undercar equipment business, going forward.Overall, we expect Snap-on to post $890 million in sales this quarter.Though Snap-On’s bottom-line performance remained unaffected amid macroeconomic woes, the company is faced with multiple issues that may hurt the third-quarter results. The prevalent softness in industrial markets has significantly impacted client spending, marring the company’s prospects. Also, sluggish oil and gas market activities are likely to thwart the company’s top line in the quarter to be reported.The Tools Group has also been seeing diminishing sales in the tool storage product line, which has hurt revenues in the recent past. Consequently, we expect the segment to see weak growth sequentially in the to-be-reported quarter.Further, persistent contraction in capital expenditure by auto dealers and intensifying used car asset quality pressure is a formidable headwind for the company. Year to date, Snap-on’s shares have declined 11.3%, grossly underperforming the industry’s average decline of 2.4%.Moreover, foreign currency fluctuations pose a major concern as one-third of the company’s revenues are derived from its European businesses. Due to foreign currency woes, in the second quarter, the Commercial & Industrial Group sales declined $4.9 million, Tools Group sales decreased $5 million, and Repair Systems & Information segment witnessed a $3.7-million sales reduction. We believe currency fluctuations will remain a risk to the company’s top line in the quarter under review as well.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Snap-on will likely beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is currently pegged at -0.07%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.42, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.43. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Snap-on has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). As it is, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Terex Corporation (TEX  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +4.63% and a Zacks Rank #2, is expected to release quarterly numbers around Oct 30.

495,COL,"Missile maker Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) recently secured a modification contract to repair the Advanced Targeting Forward Looking Infrared System (ATFLIR), which is used to support the F/A-18 aircraft.Valued at $54.2 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Supply Systems Command Weapon Systems Support, Philadelphia, PA. Majority of the work related to the deal will be executed in McKinney, TX. The rest of the operations will be carried out in Jacksonville, FL and El Segundo, CA. The company will utilize fiscal 2018 working capital funds (Navy) to complete the task by December 2019.A Brief Note on ATFLIR & F/A-18Raytheon's ATFLIR assures success by integrating advanced sensors with one of the most powerful lasers on the market. It can locate and designate targets at day or at night from ranges of more than 40 nautical miles and altitudes exceeding 50,000 feet, outperforming comparable targeting systems. ATFLIR is a powerful net enabler that can pass tracking and targeting information to other nodes in the networked battlespace with speed and precision.The Boeing Company’s (BA  -  Free Report) F/A-18 Super Hornet — a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet — is the U.S. Navy’s primary strike and air superiority aircraft. It is capable of landing and taking off from an aircraft carrier. A single-seat variant of the Super Hornet, F/A 18E, is about 25% larger than its predecessor — the F/A-18C/D — but contains 42% lesser structural parts.Our ViewWith the increase in cyber-attacks, terrorism threats and geopolitical instability, there is immediate need for all countries to elevate their level of security and defense. Major defense contractors in the nation like Raytheon, Orbital ATK, Inc , Rockwell Collins, Inc (COL  -  Free Report) are trying their best to make most of this opportunity and expand their business worldwide.Raytheon has a wide range of combat-proven defense product which helps it in securing scrumptious orders from both Pentagon as well as foreign allies. The company wins regular contracts from various sources, both domestic and international. To this end, Raytheon recently won a contract, worth $300.1 million, for supplying Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wireless-guided missiles. Earlier, in September, it secured a modification contract, worth $127.1 million, for procuring Excalibur Precision 155-mm Projectiles. Such contract wins will allow the company to boost top line in the future.Based on the company's performance witnessed in the second quarter of 2017, it expects the same in the upcoming quarters. We believe that the recent contract win along with the other anticipated deals in the near future, will substantially boost the company’s growth trajectory, in days ahead.Price PerformanceRaytheon’s stock has returned 32.2% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the 28.4% rally of the industry it belongs to. This could be because is one of the best-positioned large-cap defense players due to its non-platform-centric focus. Also, rising demand from the Gulf countries and Asia-Pacific boosts its revenues, which helps the company to grow.  Zacks RankRaytheon currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

496,COL,"The defense industry has experienced quite the boom since President Donald Trump took office. Back in February, he initially unveiled plans to significantly increase federal spending related to national security, seeking $54 billion to spend on a variety of defense-related systems and stoking a rally in defense stocks.Then there’s the multi-billion-dollar arms deal reached in May with Saudi Arabia. The transaction was a way to both improve a decades-long alliance with the world’s largest oil exporter, as well as potentially lead to additional sales to other countries in the region. Defense giants like Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report)—whose technology was part of the agreement—Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), and Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report) will all likely benefit.And recently, the industry has undergone a small wave of consolidation. United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) announced a major $30 billion deal to acquire Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report), creating one of the world’s largest aircraft-equipment manufactures. Not long after, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) said it would be buying Orbital ATK  in order to expand and increase its defense footprint; Orbital notably holds a contract with NASA to resupply the International Space Station with its Antares rocket.As defense stocks and funds like the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report) continue to gain this year, let’s take a look at three top picks for your portfolio.Engility Holdings Inc. (EGL  -  Free Report)Headquartered in Chantilly, Virginia, Engility Holdings provides government services in engineering, professional support, and mission support to customers in the U.S. Department of Defense, federal civilian agencies, and allied foreign governments. Its innovate solutions range from offering views of battlespaces to airborne platforms to providing advanced communications to support first responders, among many other services.Engility is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the past seven quarters, boasting an average earnings surprise of 23.5%. Looking ahead, Engility expects year-over-year earnings growth of nearly 40% for the current year, with three positive revisions in the last 60 days. Sales, however, are expected to dip about 5% in the same time frame, but should bounce back by next fiscal year.Shares of EGL have had a quiet 2017 so far, but the company sits in a strong industry; Aerospace-Defense is in the top 23% of all industries ranked by Zacks, and has returned well over 38% year-to-date. Engility reports its next quarterly earnings in early November.Northrop Grumman Corp.Northrop Grumman provides innovative solutions in systems integration, defense electronics, and information technology for the U.S. and international militaries, government and commercial customers, as a prime contractor, principal subcontractor, team member, or preferred supplier. Northrop is headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia.Sitting at a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, Northrop has started off strong in 2017. Both its earnings and revenue figures for the second quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and it looks like the rest of the year will continue to see improved growth. Northrop expects year-over-year earnings growth of about 14% for the current year, and sales growth of about 3.18% for the same time frame; nine analysts have revised their earnings estimate upward in the last 60 days compared to none lower.Northrop also has a history of beating expectations, soaring past consensus estimates over the past four consecutive quarters. The defense contractor has an average earnings surprise of almost 12.6%. Like Engility, the company resides in the Aerospace-Defense industry. Northrop is set to report its next quarterly earnings on October 25 before the bell.Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report)Known for designing nuclear and non-nuclear ships for the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard, Huntington Ingalls Industries develops and produces warships like destroyers, amphibious transport dock ships, and national security cutters. The company also provides complex nuclear project management, and is based in Newport News, Virginia.Shares of Huntington have gained well over 24% year-to-date, and the Aerospace-Defense player is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank. Looking at its current year, Huntington expects earnings growth of over 14% on sales growth of just 3.8%; four analysts have revised their earnings estimates upwards in the last 60 days compared to none lower. Historically, the company has seen EPS growth of 30.7%, and next fiscal year should see Huntington continue its earnings growth trend.Huntington has an average earnings surprise of about 8.5%, and is expected to report its next quarterly earnings on November 8 before the bell.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

497,COL,"Over the past few years, consolidation has become an important trend in nearly every major global industry. There’s no one reason why—although changing consumer trends, globalization, and emerging technologies are our primary culprits—but all around the world, we’ve seen countless household names join forces and shrink the competition pool.2017 has certainly extended this trend. In fact, according to the IMAA, the total global value of M&A deals is expected to once again eclipse the $4.0 trillion mark—on the back of a near-record 40,000 transaction year.Investors will also note that this year’s deals have included some of Wall Street’s most powerful brands and have had industry-rattling consequences. To celebrate this, we’ve compiled our list of the most important M&As of 2017!In no particular order, check them out now:1.       United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report)) Buys Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report)We’ll start with the newest deal on the list, as the details of this acquisition weren’t made official until early last month. Per the merger agreement, United Technologies will acquire Rockwell Collins for $140 per share in cash and stock.Upon completion, Rockwell Collins’ aircraft avionics business will merge with United Technologies’ wide portfolio—which includes aircraft engines, structures, cockpit and cabin controls, ventilation systems, and other devices—to create a brand new aircraft behemoth.Post-acquisition, United Technologies is expected to have global sales of around $67-$68 billion, and the deal is expected to generate $500 million of run-rate pre-tax cost synergies by the fourth year. Because of Rockwell’s status as a supplier to Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), the acquisition is also expected to give United Technologies greater negotiating power in the industry. 2.       Intel (INTC  -  Free Report)) Acquires MobileyeAs the public grows more and more obsessed with the impending rollout of self-driving cars, Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye has certainly emerged as one of the year’s most meaningful buyouts.The semiconductor giant scooped up the Israeli autonomous vehicle tech firm in a deal worth a staggering $15.3 billion, making it the biggest purchase of a company focused solely on the self-driving market to-date.The acquisition underscored the massive amount of cash that’s being spent on autonomous driving right now. Intel’s own automated driving group has now joined forces with Mobileye’s renowned computer vision technology, immediately cementing Intel’s status as a leader on the chip side of the business. 3.       JAB Holdings Purchases Panera BreadIn a move that has had major ramifications for the retail restaurant industry, German conglomerate JAB Holdings purchased fast-casual chain Panera Bread for $315 per share earlier this year. With the deal, JAB added Panera’s bakery cafes to its portfolio of breakfast-oriented brands, which includes Krispy Kreme, Einstein Bros. Bagels, and Keurig Green Mountain.The buyout was another major deal in a series of several purchases involving notable restaurant chains. Also this year, Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report) snapped up Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, and Burger King owner Restaurant Brands International (QSR  -  Free Report) bought out Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen.In its most recent quarter before the buyout was announced, Panera reported that company-owned comparable store sales increased 5.3%. It had been an up-and-down few years for Panera’s stock, but JAB appeared to snag the brand at an opportune time. 4.       Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report)) Scoops Up Kite Pharma Without a doubt, Gilead’s acquisition of Kite Pharma will go down as one of 2017’s most important biotech deals. Industry behemoth Gilead will pay $180.00 per share in cash for Kite, valuing the buyout at nearly $12 billion.How could a relatively small biotech research firm be worth that much money? Well, it comes down to Kite’s pipeline, which includes a CAR-T therapy that is expected to be approved by the FDA in November.CAR-T is a newly emerging method of treating cancer that includes making genetic changes to a patient’s immune T-cells and reinjecting them into the body to attack cancer cells. Many industry analysts believe that CAR-T will revolutionize the cancer treatment market, and Gilead’s deal with Kite was one of the first major investments in CAR-T by a large biotech company. 5.       Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report)) Buys Whole FoodsLast but not least, we have the monumental Amazon-Whole Foods deal. This one was obviously going to make the list, as it is has been perhaps the biggest headline on Wall Street all year and has major consequences for several industries.The deal was valued at $13.7 billion, or $42 per Whole Foods share. This was a somewhat surprising move by Amazon—and not because the company is shy about spending money. No, what shocked investors was the fact that Amazon was willing to spend nearly $14 billion on what many considered to be a gamble with a brick-and-mortar retailer.We’ve already seen Amazon slash prices on several popular products throughout Whole Foods stores, and we expect to see the e-commerce king parlay its new real estate into an advantage for delivering goods. Whether Amazon paid the right price for Whole Foods is up for debate, but this is a future-minded move that will take years to fully develop. Want more stock market analysis from this author?

498,COL,"Missile maker Raytheon Company’s (RTN  -  Free Report) business segment, Missile Systems, recently secured a contract for supplying Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wireless-guided missiles. These missiles will be provided to the U.S. Army, Marine Corps and foreign military sales customers.Valued at $300.1 million, the contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL. Work related to the deal will be executed in Tucson, AZ and Farmington, NM. The company will utilize fiscal 2010, 2015, 2016 and 2017 other procurement, Army; foreign military sales; and American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds to complete the task by Jul 31, 2020.Tube-Launched Wireless MissilesThe tube-launched, optically-tracked, wireless-guided (TOW) weapon system  comes with the multi-mission TOW 2A, TOW 2B Aero and TOW Bunker Buster missiles. These are the premier long-range, heavy assault-precision anti-armor, anti-fortification and anti-amphibious landing weapon system used throughout the world.With its extended range of performance, the TOW missile is the long-range precision, heavy anti-tank and assault weapon system of choice for the U.S. Army Stryker, Bradley Fighting Vehicle, ITAS High-Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle and Light Armored Vehicle-Anti-tank platforms. Upgrade programs will extend the missile’s life cycle beyond 2050. Raytheon has delivered more than 700,000 TOW weapon systems to the U.S. and allied warfighters.The weapon system is deployed with more than 40 international armed forces and integrated on more than 15,000 ground, vehicle and helicopter platforms. It is also the most preferred heavy assault anti-armor weapon system for NATO, coalition, United Nations and peacekeeping operations worldwide.Our ViewWith the increase in cyber-attacks, terrorism threats and geopolitical instability, there is an immediate need of all countries to elevate their level of security and defense. Major defense contractors in the nation like Raytheon, AeroVironment, Inc. (AVAV  -  Free Report), Orbital ATK, Inc. , Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) are putting their best to make most of this opportunity and expand their business worldwide.In particular, Raytheon’s Missile Systems segment has been clinching significant awards from the United States as well as international customers, courtesy of its high-end, combat-proven advanced arsenals. To this end, in August, the company won a $614.5 million worth modification contract from the Missile Defense Agency for manufacturing 17 Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIA missiles.Based on the 11% sales growth that this unit witnessed in the second quarter of 2017 and similar strong performance anticipated ahead, the company expects to see improved operating margin for this business in the second half of 2017. We believe the recently won award along with the similar ones, anticipated in the near future, will enable the company to achieve the target of its missile business growth.Price PerformanceRaytheon’s stock has returned 36.8% over the last year, outperforming the 34.5% rally of the industry it belongs to. This might have been caused by the earlier budget cuts inflicted by the U.S. government. Zacks RankRaytheon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

499,COL,"Companies with ties to defense spending have gained amid the nearly constant wave of missile testing from North Korea, escalating United Nation sanctions placed on the regime, and President Donald Trump’s unrelenting war of words against Pyongyang.President Trump spoke for the first time at the United Nations General Assembly yesterday, where he addressed a range of issues, including North Korea, the Iran nuclear deal, and terrorism. In his speech, Trump once again threatened Kim Jong Un’s regime with force if Pyongyang does not back down from its nuclear aspirations and cease its tests.“No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea,” President Trump said in his speech. “The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea… It is time for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future.”On top of the possibility of some type of military action in the Korean peninsula, a recent wave of mergers between big aerospace and defense companies has helped lift the industry.United Technologies Corp (UTX  -  Free Report) recently struck a $30 billion agreement to buy Rockwell Collins Inc (COL  -  Free Report), and earlier this week, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) announced its plan to buy Orbital ATK  for $7.8 billion (also read: Northrop Grumman to Buy Orbital ATK in Major $7.8 Billion Defense Deal).Now let’s take a look at some defense stocks and their fundamentals to see if investors might want to consider them during these tumultuous geopolitical times. 1.       Engility Holdings, Inc.

502,COL,"On Monday, shares of Orbital ATK  are soaring, up over 20% in morning trading after it was announced that defense giant Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) would be buying the company for $7.8 billion in cash while assuming $1.4 billion in debt. NOC stock is up about 1.5% in morning trading as well.Orbital shareholders are set to receive $134.50 per share, which represents a 22% premium to its Friday close of $110.04. Orbital has made a name for itself designing and manufacturing space, defense, and aviation-related systems, in particular rocket motors that power missiles and target launch vehicles that are used during missile defense systems tests.“The acquisition of Orbital ATK is an exciting strategic step as we continue to invest for profitable growth,” said Wes Bush, Northrop’s chief executive, in a statement. “Through our combination, customers will benefit from expanded capabilities, accelerated innovation and greater competition in critical global security domains.”Northrop has one of the largest footprints in the defense industry today, and is one of the Pentagon’s leading suppliers. Along with rival Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), the company is working with the Air Force on the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent program, designing a new intercontinental ballistic missile system. And, Northrop won a highly-coveted contract to develop the B-21 stealth bomber.With Orbital, Northrop’s presence could grow even bigger. Along with its missile designs, Orbital holds a contract with NASA to resupply the International Space Station with its Antares rocket. According to The LA Times, the company has also developed a rocket called the Pegasus that can be attached to its Stargazer L-1011 airplane, as well as the still-in-development Next Generation Launcher (NGL), which Orbital hopes to get certified by the U.S. Air Force.The Northrop-Orbital acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close in the first half of 2018. And after the deal closes, Orbital will operate as its own business segment within Northrop, at least at first, said Mr. Bush.As a whole, the defense industry has undergone some major changes recently, and this deal comes soon after another huge acquisition: United Technologies’ (UTX  -  Free Report) $30 billion purchase of Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report). However, defense stocks are responding positively, with the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report) having risen over 21% so far this year.New Report: An Investor’s Guide to CybersecurityCyberattacks have become more frequent and destructive than ever.

503,COL,"Defense equipments manufacturer Raytheon Company’s (RTN  -  Free Report) business segment, Missile Systems, recently secured a modification contract for procuring Excalibur Precision 155-mm Projectiles. Work related to this deal is expected to be over by Apr 30, 2019.Valued at $127.1 million, the contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ. Work will be carried out at various locations across the United States, U.K. as well as Karlskoga, Sweden. The company will utilize fiscal 2015 and 2017 other procurement (Army) funds to complete the task.A Brief Note on Excalibur ProjectilesRaytheon’s Excalibur is a precision guided extended range artillery projectile. Unlike “near precision” guidance systems, the Excalibur weapon provides accurate first-round effects at all ranges in all weather conditions. Per Raytheon’s management, the Excalibur projectile’s precision along with its ability to be integrated on multiple gun systems, enables both the United States and its allies to provide overmatch capabilities against land targets in a variety of combat environments. Excalibur is also highly resistant to Global Positioning System (GPS) jamming.This arsenal has a strong demand in the overseas market. Evidently, Sweden, Canada, Australia and the Netherlands have chosen Raytheon’s Excalibur precision-guided projectile to address vital security interests and several other international partners are finalizing procurement plans.Our ViewWith the increase in cyber-attacks, terrorism threats and geopolitical instability, there is an immediate need of all countries to elevate their level of security and defense. Major defense contractors in the nation like Raytheon, AeroVironment, Inc. (AVAV  -  Free Report), Orbital ATK, Inc. , Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) are putting their best to make most of this opportunity and expand their business worldwide.In particular, Raytheon’s advanced Missile Systems segment has been clinching significant awards from the United States as well as international customers, courtesy of its high-end, combat-proven arsenals. To this end, last month, the company won a $614.5 million worth modification contract from the Missile Defense Agency for manufacturing 17 Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIA missiles.With respect to the Excalibur projectile, Raytheon is currently developing a laser-guided version of the projectile — Excalibur S. This variant incorporates a digital semi-active laser seeker, which enables it to strike moving targets without precise location information. It also reduces the risk associated with GPS jamming. We expect the launch of this advanced variant to fetch higher profit for the Missile Systems segment.Based on the 11% sales growth that this unit witnessed in the second quarter of 2017 and similar strong performance anticipated ahead, the company expects to see improved operating margin for this business in the second half of 2017. We believe the recently won award along with similar ones anticipated in the near future will enable the company to achieve the target of its missile business growth.Price PerformanceRaytheon’s stock has returned 32.7% over the last year, underperforming the 37.9% rally of the industry it belongs to. This might have been caused by the earlier budget cuts inflicted by the U.S. government.Zacks RankRaytheon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

504,COL,"Geopolitical risks have been rising as North Korea refuses to stop its threats. Moreover, with countries expanding their weapons system, defense stocks have been rallying lately.Is North Korea Driving Defense ETFs?On Sep 3, North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test of a hydrogen bomb, which can be mounted on an intercontinental ballistic missile. Kim Jong-Un’s actions have created quite a stir in the United States and a number of Asian economies (read: Safe Haven Currency ETFs Gain, Dollar Loses Amid Geopolitical Uncertainty).Per a Bloomberg article, the state-run Korean Central News Agency citing a statement by the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee said on Thursday, “Japan is no longer needed to exist near us.” The statement further added, “The four islands of the archipelago should be sunken into the sea by the nuclear bomb of Juche”.Han Tae Song, North Korea's ambassador to the UN, told a UN conference, ""The forthcoming measures by DPRK (the Democratic Republic of Korea) will make the US suffer the greatest pain it has ever experienced in its history.""These threats come as UN passed new sanctions on North Korea. The sanctions are aimed at starving North Korea of oil to run its nuclear program by reducing oil imports by the country. Although the United States aimed at total oil embargo on North Korea, sanctions were watered down in order to secure China and Russia’s support, as they held veto power on the decision.North Korea has received repeated warnings from the United States, that if it does not stop its nuclear tests, it will have to face significant military response. As a result, major nations have started focusing on their defense systems in order to prepare for any mishap.Strong FundamentalsThe earnings performance for the sector has been impressive in the second quarter and is expected to continue in the third quarter as well. Moreover, a majority of companies from the sector beat earnings and revenue expectations in the second quarter (read: Here's an ETF to ""Make America Great Again"").The S&P Aerospace & Defense Select Industry Index is up 19% year to date compared with 11.6% increase for the S&P 500.

505,COL,"Missile maker Raytheon Company’s (RTN  -  Free Report) business segment, Missile Systems, won a modification contract for providing Navy Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) Block 2 guided missile round pack (GMRP) requirements. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by December 2019.Valued at $21.2 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Majority of the work will be executed in Tucson, AZ and Ottobrunn, Germany, while the rest will be carried out in Rocket Center, WV and Andover, MA. The company will utilize fiscal 2017 weapons procurement (Navy) funds to finance the task.A Brief Note on RAMRAM is a supersonic, lightweight, quick-reaction, fire-and-forget guided missile weapon system, designed to destroy anti-ship missiles.  According to the company, it is the world's most modern self-defense ship weapon. This guided missile weapon system is co-developed and co-produced under an International Cooperative Program between the U.S. and Federal Republic of Germany’s governments. It's currently deployed in more than 165 ships in eight countries, ranging from 500-ton fast attack craft to 95,000-ton aircraft carriers.RAM Block 2 is the latest variant in the development of the RAM missile, which comes with a larger rocket motor, advanced control section and an enhanced RF receiver capable of detecting the quietest of threat emitters. The improvements enhance the missile’s maneuverability by two and a half times and the effective intercept range by one and a half times.Our ViewWith the increase in cyber-attacks, terrorism threats and geopolitical instability, there is an immediate need of all countries to elevate their level of security and defense. Major defense contractors in the nation like Raytheon, AeroVironment, Inc. (AVAV  -  Free Report), Orbital ATK, Inc. , Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) are putting their best to make most of this opportunity and expand their business in the country.In particular, Raytheon’s advanced Missile Systems business segment won consistent orders from the United States as well as international customers. To this end, last month, the company won a $614.5 million worth modification contract from the Missile Defense Agency for manufacturing 17 Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIA missiles.Earlier, in late June, the U.S. State Department filed Congressional Notification for a potential deal with Taiwan valued at up to $1.4 billion, approximately half of which Raytheon expects to book within the next 24 months. These programs include the company’s Standard Missile-2s along with a handful of other defense equipment. This emerging opportunity reflects the continued solid demand that Raytheon enjoys in the foreign market, apart from its domestic front.Based on the 11% sales growth that Missile Systems unit witnessed in the second quarter of 2017 and similar strong performance anticipated ahead, the company expects to see improved operating margin for this business in the second half of 2017.

506,COL,"The U.S. aerospace and defense industry grabbed investors’ attention this week on the back of two significant developments. On Sep 5, defense stocks surged following North Korea’s ‘successful’ hydrogen bomb test — largest nuclear device test since 2006.The U.S. administration strongly condemned the act, wherein the U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis warned North Korea of dire consequences if the nation goes on encouraging such violent operations. This in turn boosted defense stocks on anticipation of escalated military actions from the United States.The finalization of the merger between United Technologies and Rockwell Collins however, dragged down defense stocks. The aerospace giant Boeing raised strong objections against the merger citing the deal’s potential to hinder competition in the aerospace supply chain market. This may have raised skepticism surrounding the deal.Meanwhile, keeping up with the trend, defense stocks continued to receive generous flow of funds from the Pentagon.Coming to the performance of the major indices of the Aerospace sector, in the last five trading sessions, the stocks ended up in the red zone. Notably, the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) Index dropped 2.6%, while the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense Index dipped 2.3% during this period.Among last week’s highlights, defense primes Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Orbital ATK, Inc.  secured notable contracts from the Department of Defense (DoD). Moreover, Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) and United Technologies Corp. (UTX  -  Free Report) finalized their merger deal.(Read Defense Stock Roundup for Sep 1, 2017 here)A Look Back at Last Week’s Key Stories1.

508,COL,"With the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq indices all in the red through morning trading on Tuesday, it’s clearly not been a hot start to September, which is historically the stock market’s worst month of the year.As investors returned from the Labor Day holiday this week, several major stories appeared to ratchet up fear and hesitation. For one, investors appear less-than-impressed with United Technologies’ (UTX  -  Free Report) $23 billion deal to acquire Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report). Shares of UTX, a component of the Dow, were down more than 4.7% through morning trading hours.On top this, broader concerns about a handful of domestic and international political issues continue to loom over investors’ heads.The threat of a nuclear conflict with North Korea has reached new highs over the past few weeks, and as result, President Trump looks ready to initiate a trade war with China. Here at home, the debt ceiling drama is far from resolved, and Hurricane Irma could be poised to add to the devastation in the Gulf region.“It’s probably a safe bet that volatility will pick up in September,” wrote Hinsdale Associates investments director William Lynch.September is widely accepted as the worst month for stock market performance. Since 1950, the Dow has averaged a 1.1% decline during the month, while the S&P 500 has averaged a 0.7% drop in September. The Nasdaq was first established in 1971 and has dropped an average of 1% during September since its founding.There are many theories as to why September is such a difficult month for stocks, although we do lack one universally agreed upon reason.Some think it’s fair to blame the dip on the unofficial end of summer. The summer months normally mark the lightest trading volumes in the calendar year—a fact that most people assume is related to investors taking vacation time.Also, many major mutual funds end their fiscal years in September. Many mutual fund managers will shed their losing positions as their fiscal years conclude, which could also contribute to a weaker month overall.This year, these traditional factors will be in play yet again, but it could be a caution-inducing combination of other external elements that results in new volatility.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

509,COL,"Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) announced that it has finally reached a definitive agreement with United Technologies Corp. (UTX  -  Free Report). Per the deal, the former will be acquired by the latter for a total transaction value of $30 billion. The deal is projected to wrap up by the third quarter of 2018, depending on consents from Rockwell Collins’ shareowners and other customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals.United Technologies had submitted an offer to acquire Rockwell Collins on Aug 4.Purchase ConsiderationPer the terms of the deal, United Technologies will acquire Rockwell Collins for $140 per share, in cash as well as its common stock. Each shareowner of the Rockwell Collins will get $93.33 per share in cash and $46.67 in shares of its common stock, depending on a 7.5% collar as of Aug 22, 2017 closing share price of $115.69.United Technologies expects to fund the cash part of the transaction through debt issuances and cash in hand. The company is also dedicated to take necessary steps to maintain strong investment grade credit ratings.The total transaction value of $30 billion reflects the total equity value of $23 billion and the balance includes Rockwell Collins’ net debt. This purchase consideration is higher than the $20 billion value estimated last week when both the companies were engaged in talks before signing the deal. (Read more: Rockwell Collins Nears $20B Deal with United Technologies)Post Acquisition ScenarioUnited Technologies expects the acquisition to be accretive to its adjusted earnings per share after the first full year, following the deal’s closure. The takeover is estimated to generate more than $500 million of run-rate pre-tax cost synergies by the fourth year.On completion, Rockwell Collins and United Technologies’ Aerospace Systems will be integrated to form a new business unit named Collins Aerospace Systems.Benefits of the AcquisitionWith the acquisition, Rockwell Collins’ commercial and military aircraft avionics business will merge with United Technologies’ wide portfolio that includes aircraft engines, structures, cockpit and cabin controls, ventilation systems and other electronic and mechanical devices used in aviation. In fact, the deal will create one of the world’s largest aircraft-equipment manufacturers.On completion of the deal, United Technologies will burgeon to a $93 billion group as a more critical supplier of components to aircraft companies such as The Boeing co. (BA  -  Free Report) and Airbus Group SE (EADSY  -  Free Report). Thus with the acquisition, a new aircraft bellwether will emerge, claiming a significant position in the aerospace-defense space.Post acquisition, United Technologies is expected to have global sales of around $67-$68 billion, based on anticipated results.Our ViewThe takeover will create a new giant in the space for aircraft parts makers. It is expected to emerge as the world’s fourth largest aerospace firm by revenue after Boeing, Airbus and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report). The move is intended to counter aircraft stalwarts like Boeing and Airbus, which are aiming to capture major portion of the profits earned by their suppliers. Both the aerospace biggies are putting pressure on suppliers to lower the prices and are moving into the high-margin aftermarket arena for parts and services. To this end, in July, Boeing had threatened Rockwell Collins with the warning that it will build up its own avionics business.Notably, United Technologies will gain a strong negotiating status with the consolidation of Rockwell Collins as it will be able to manufacture as many as components required on each aircraft.Price PerformanceRockwell Collins has outperformed the broader industry in the last 12 months. The company’s shares have soared 53.5% compared with the industry’s gain of 26.1% in the same period.The outperformance may have been driven by the fact that Rockwell Collins continues to be the foremost global supplier of communications and avionics equipment for both commercial and military customers.Zacks RankRockwell Collins currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The combined company would be better suited to meet the evolving global customer needs. With complementary products, the combination is likely to yield operating synergies through lower operating costs and more opportunities to cross sell the products. United Technologies expects the merger to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share after the first full year of combined operations with synergies to the tune of more than $500 million.Post completion, Rockwell Collins and United Technologies’ UTC Aerospace Systems division will be integrated to create a new business unit called Collins Aerospace Systems. On a pro forma basis, Rockwell Collins is expected to record sales in excess of $8 billion while United Technologies is likely to generate global sales of approximately $67 billion to $68 billion.  Moving ForwardWith an improvised product portfolio, the company is likely to become an even more critical supplier of components to big aircraft manufacturers like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Airbus SE (EADSY  -  Free Report). The consolidation of two industry heavyweights could further set off a wave of similar such deals across the defense industry.The acquisition is expected to boost United Technologies’ aerospace segment that has been struggling of late with severe delays in for supply orders in the Pratt & Whitney division.

512,COL,"Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) has won a contract to support the Maritime Strike Tomahawk Program. The deal has been awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the ContractPer the $119 million contract, Raytheon will offer services related to analysis, trade studies, architecture, modeling, simulation development, evaluation, and prototyping activities.

The contract will use fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy) funds for the same.A Brief Note on Tomahawk MissileTomahawk missile has become an important weapon in the U.S. defense arsenal for its precise capability to take out high value target from a very long distance. These missiles have a range of 1,000 nautical miles (1,150 statute miles) and can be launched both from the surface as well as from submarines. Its latest version, Block IV, has a satellite link that enables the missile to hover over the battlefield as it awaits target instructions.Why Raytheon?With the increase in cyber-attacks, terrorism threats and geopolitical instability, there is an immediate need of all countries to elevate their level of security and defense. Therefore, major defense contractors in the nation like Raytheon, AeroVironment, Inc. (AVAV  -  Free Report), Orbital ATK, Inc. , Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) are putting their best effort to make most of this opportunity and expand their business in the country.Moreover, the recent cross-border missile brawl between the United States and North Korea has created increased opportunity for missile-makers like Raytheon to gain from the consequences. In fact, the recent tension, wherein North Korea fired a missile in Japan’s sea boosted the company’s share price by 2.2% on Aug 30.Thanks to its next-generation missile systems, the company has been securing valuable contracts from the Pentagon, which in turn will significantly boost its revenue growth.

514,COL,"Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) is set to close a deal, per which it is expected to be acquired by United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), for more than $20 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal. United Technologies had submitted an offer to acquire the the company on Aug 4.Details of the AcquisitionRockwell Collins, which has a market capitalization of $19.3 billion, on being successfully acquired, would expand United Technologies’ aerospace group. This, in turn, will offer an opportunity to separate the group from the company’s other industrial units. However, this deal has not yet been confirmed as both companies are in talks and currently nearing the closure of the deal.If the transaction is finalized, Rockwell Collins’ commercial and military aircraft avionics business will merge with United Technologies' wide portfolio, which includes aircraft engines, structures, cockpit and cabin controls, ventilation systems and other electronic and mechanical devices used in aviation.Per the Journal, United Technologies and Rockwell Collins are considering an acquisition deal worth almost $140 per share.Benefits of the MergerThe buyout will help United Technologies to become a $93-billion group and a more critical supplier of components to aircraft companies such as The Boeing co. (BA  -  Free Report) and Airbus Group SE (EADSY  -  Free Report).In fact, the above discussed deal will create one of the world’s largest aircraft-equipment manufacturers. Moreover, it is expected to clear the way for Rockwell Collins to capitalize on connected aircraft, which can broadcast sophisticated data regarding onboard systems, routes and weather, facilitating airlines to develop operations and maintenance.Our ViewIn April, Rockwell Collins acquired B/E Aerospace, a maker of aircraft seats, lavatories and galleys, which broadened its product lines. With this buyout, the company currently has almost 30,000 employees, and projects its annual revenue to be more than $8 billion, based on 2016 results.Markedly, this acquisition combined Rockwell Collins’ capabilities in flight deck avionics, cabin electronics, mission communications, simulation and training, and information management systems with B/E Aerospace's array of cabin interior products. Also, Rockwell Collins expanded its avionics business on the back of this deal, in a bid to provide aircraft data networking services, known as FOMAX, for all new Airbus A320 aircraft starting in 2018.Considering this, if United Technologies eventually acquires Rockwell Collins, a new defense bellwether will emerge, boasting a significant share of the aerospace-defense industry.Price PerformanceRockwell Collins has outperformed the broader industry in a year's time. The company’s shares have soared 55.3% compared with the industry’s gain of 26.3% during the same period.Being the foremost global supplier of communications and avionics equipment for both commercial and military customers resulted in higher volume of sales for Rockwell Collins. This led the company to outperform the industry.Zacks RankRockwell Collins currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

515,COL,"According to various media reports, diversified industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) is reportedly giving final touches to a purported move to acquire Iowa-based avionics firm, Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report). The strategic transaction is likely to create an industry behemoth with an unrivalled competitive advantage, being one of the largest aircraft equipment manufacturers in the world in its individual capacity.The Proposed MergerAlthough both the company spokespersons refused to comment on the developments, persons familiar with the deal revealed that negotiations are in the final stages and an official announcement could be made as early as this weekend. United Technologies is apparently working on the modalities of the purchase price in the vicinity of $140 for each share of Rockwell Collins that equates to a deal value of about $20 billion.The news boosted investor confidence as shares of both the companies were significantly up during the trading hours yesterday. While shares of United Technologies rose 2.9% to close at $118.70, Rockwell Collins stock climbed 2.2% to $130.74. Incidentally, United Technologies has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of 8.3% as against a decline of 3.1% for the latter.Likely FalloutsThe acquisition is expected to offer United Technologies a bigger clout in the industry and increase its bargaining power as it would emerge as one of the largest aircraft equipment manufacturers in the industry. The combination is likely to yield operating synergies through lower operating costs and more opportunities to cross sell the products. With an improvised product portfolio, the company is likely to become an even more critical supplier of components to big aircraft manufacturers like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Airbus SE (EADSY  -  Free Report).In addition, the transaction will strengthen the aviation segment of United Technologies, which includes Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Sundstrand. This, in turn, could assist the company to spin off its aviation businesses at a later date to focus more on the sector dynamics.The consolidation of two industry heavyweights could further set off a wave of similar such deals across the defense industry. The proposed acquisition of Rockwell Collins by United Technologies is the third such transaction among aircraft manufacturers in less than a year. Rockwell Collins itself acquired B/E Aerospace this spring for $8.6 billion to gain a strategic footprint in cabin interior systems such as seats, galleys and lavatories. This was preceded by the acquisition of French aerospace equipment maker Zodiac by French aero-engine maker Safran earlier this year.Moving ForwardThe acquisition is expected to boost United Technologies’ aerospace segment that has been struggling of late with severe delays in for supply orders in the Pratt & Whitney division. We remain bullish on the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock post this transaction.

516,COL,"Northrop Grumman Corporation’s (NOC  -  Free Report) pending acquisition of Orbital ATK  finally got the approval from the latter’s shareholders on 29th Nov. Earlier, in September, the two defense majors inked a take-over deal worth $9.2 billion, by which Northrop Grumman agreed to buy  Orbital ATK by the first half of 2018.Notably, shareholders of Orbital ATK holding over 99% of common stock present at the meeting or represented by proxy, voted in favor of this merger agreement. This, in turn, represents 79% of the total number of outstanding shares of Orbital ATK’s common stock as of Oct 10, 2017.Benefits of the AcquisitionNorthrop Grumman continues to enjoy strong presence in Air Force, Space & Cyber Security programs. The company’s product innovation and focus on strengthening its ISR wing is anticipated to help maintain a stable earnings stream, amid rapidly changing requirements of the defense landscape.With the Orbital ATK buyout, Northrop Grumman is expected to benefit from the former's rocket motors, missiles and electro-optical countermeasure product lines. According to Wes Bush — chairman, chief executive officer and president of Northrop Grumman — the merger will offer increased competition, greater innovation and a broader set of capabilities that would aid its customers in solving their toughest challenges.Furthermore, Orbital ATK’s knowledge and expertise in satellites, spacecraft components and commercial space launch system will expand Northrop Grumman’s product offering, thereby providing tough competition to the existing defense companies.Per Orbital ATK’s 2016 financials, the company's contracts with the NASA and the U.S. Army is expected to boost Northrop Grumman’s product portfolio and rake in more than $4.4 billion, in the form of annual revenues.Earlier while announcing the deal Northrop Grumman had said that post merger this new business unit will be accretive to its earnings per share and free cash flow per share, in the second half of 2018.Also, the merger will be accretive to Northrop Grumman’s earnings per share and free cash flow in the first year of acquisition and lead to annual cost savings of nearly $150 million by 2020.Incidentally, President Trump has requested to increase fiscal 2018 defense spending by 10% from the present level. Considering this, we expect the combined company to hold a larger portion of the U.S. Defense order through its diverse product portfolio.Another Mega Deal in the SpaceExpansion through acquisition is not new in the defense industry. In September, United Technologies Corp. (UTX  -  Free Report) finalized the deal to acquire Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) for $30 billion. The deal is projected to be concluded by the third quarter of 2018, depending on consents from Rockwell Collins’ shareowners and other customary closing conditions including the receipt of required regulatory approvals.Price MovementFollowing Northrop Grumman’s announcement of Orbital ATK acquisition, shares of the former company have rallied 11.1% compared with the industry’s gain of 5.5%. This outperformance reflects that news of this acquisition has received positive response from the market.Zacks RankNorthrop Grumman carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

518,COL,"Aviation electronics maker, Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL  -  Free Report), is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 28, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.29%. Moreover, it surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 2.45%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayIn the defense arena, Trump’s victory in the Presidential race has likely turned out to be a significant growth catalyst for Rockwell Collins and other defense majors. In particular, the outlook for stocks in this space has improved manifold in the recent months, primarily owing to enhanced spending promises made by Trump in his latest “America First” budget.Following Trump’s budget proposal release in Mar 2017, the U.S. defense contractors are witnessing increased order from across the world, which increases investors’ optimism in such stocks.Consequently, during the fiscal third quarter, the company clinched a number of contracts. It signed a global alliance agreement with QinetiQ to collaborate on the development of next-generation, multi-constellation open service and secure Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers. The accord will support the critical mission needs of military, government and critical national infrastructure.Again, Rockwell Collins inked a reseller agreement with Beijing Marine Communication and Navigation Company, Limited (MCN) to provide broadband satellite connectivity services to its ARINC Direct customers in mainland China. These agreements are expected to have a material impact on the company’s financials in the to-be-reported quarter.For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects a 3.2% year-over-year decline. Meanwhile, revenues are estimated to be $2.03 billion, translating into 51.9% growth year over year.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Rockwell Collins will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Rockwell Collins has an Earnings ESP of -1.27%.

519,COL,"The defense industry has experienced quite the boom since President Donald Trump took office. Back in February, he initially unveiled plans to significantly increase federal spending related to national security, seeking $54 billion to spend on a variety of defense-related systems and stoking a rally in defense stocks.Then there’s the multi-billion-dollar arms deal reached in May with Saudi Arabia. The transaction was a way to both improve a decades-long alliance with the world’s largest oil exporter, as well as potentially lead to additional sales to other countries in the region. Defense giants like Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report)—whose technology was part of the agreement—Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), and Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report) will all likely benefit.And recently, the industry has undergone a small wave of consolidation. United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) announced a major $30 billion deal to acquire Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report), creating one of the world’s largest aircraft-equipment manufactures.

524,COL,"Defense major Raytheon Company’s (RTN  -  Free Report) business segment, Missile Systems, has clinched a modification contract for manufacturing 17 Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIA missiles. Work related to the deal is expected to be over by March 2020.Details of the DealValued at $614.5 million, the contract was awarded by the Missile Defense Agency, Dahlgren, VA. Per the terms of the agreement, Raytheon will provide production and engineering support, obsolescence monitoring, technical baseline engineering support as well as render quality assurance for the SM-3 Block IIA missiles. The company will also provide containers for the missiles. Work will be executed in Tucson, AZ. The company will utilize fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation funds to complete the contract.A Short Note on SM-3 missilesThe SM-3 is a ship-based missile system used by the U.S. Navy to intercept short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles as part of Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System. SM-3 interceptor continues to excel during testing on both land and sea. The program has more than 25 successful space intercepts, and more than 240 interceptors have been delivered to U.S. and Japanese navies.SM-3 Block IIA, the next-generation variant in the SM-3 family, developed in collaboration with Japan, will be deployable on land as well as on sea. It incorporates larger rocket motors that will allow the interceptor to defend broader areas from ballistic missile threats and a larger kinetic warhead. The Block IIA variant is the centerpiece of the European missile defense system. The program is on track for 2018 deployment on sea and land in Poland.What’s Favoring Raytheon?With the increase in cyber-attacks, terrorism threats and geopolitical instability, there is an immediate need of all countries to elevate their level of security and defense. Major defense contractors in the nation like Raytheon, AeroVironment, Inc. (AVAV  -  Free Report), Orbital ATK, Inc. , Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) are putting their best effort to make most of this opportunity and expand their business in the country.In particular, Raytheon’s advanced Missile Systems business segment enables it to win consistent orders from the United States as well as international customers. To this end, in April, the company won a $113.2 million worth contract from the U.S. Navy to provide engineering and technical services for Standard Missile (SM).Moreover, in late June, the U.S. State Department filed Congressional Notification for a potential deal with Taiwan valued at up to $1.4 billion, approximately half of which Raytheon expects to book within the next 24 months. These programs include the company’s Standard Missile-2s along with a handful of other defense equipment. This emerging opportunity reflects the continued solid demand that Raytheon enjoys in the foreign market, apart from its domestic front.Based on the 11% sales growth that Missile Systems unit witnessed in the second quarter of 2017 and similar strong performance anticipated ahead, the company expects to observe improved operating margin for this business in the second half of 2017. We believe the recently won award along with similar ones anticipated in the near future will enable the company to achieve its targets for missile business.Price PerformanceRaytheon’s stock has returned 26% in the last one year, outperforming the 23.9% rally of the industry it belongs to. This might have been driven by its wide range of combat-proven defense products, on account of which the company continues to receive orders from both Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the nation.Zacks RankRaytheon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

527,COL,"Leading provider of technology services, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) serves various end-markets such as aerospace, defense and commercial construction, that move according to their own cycles.Headquartered in Farmington, CT, the company’s business mix and diversification allows the it to remain profitable even during tough economic times, delivering consistent earnings and dividend growth. The company has an experienced management team and is likely to capitalize on the continued global economic recovery and deliver sustainable earnings growth in future. In order to fuel its growth momentum, the company further remains focused on four key priorities: flawless execution, innovation for growth, structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation. United Technologies is also seeking potential acquisition opportunities to achieve aggressive revenue targets and augment its market position.The company intends to expand its foothold in the aerospace industry with the acquisition of Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report). Per undisclosed sources, the company has submitted an offer to acquire the aircraft component manufacturer. Rockwell Collins has a market capitalization of $19.3 billion. This acquisition will enable United Technologies bulk up its aerospace group, separating it from its other industrial units. This deal has not yet been confirmed, as both the companies are currently in talks. On Mar 6, 2017, UTC Climate, Controls & Security (“CCS”) completed its planned acquisition of EcoEnergy, Wipro Limited’s (WIT  -  Free Report) energy services business division based in Bengaluru, India. EcoEnergy is a leading energy management solutions company. The completion of the CCS acquisition along with the Otis buyout closed last year, contributed to the company’s growth in the second quarter. The company expects to invest around $1−$2 billion in mergers and acquisitions this year. We expect these acquisitions to bode well for the company. These strategic acquisitions are expected to help the company stay ahead of its peers such as Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report).The company reported better-than-expected results in second-quarter 2017. Quarterly adjusted earnings from continuing operations came in at $1.85 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.77. The bottom line also came in 1.6% higher than the year-ago tally. The upside was driven by solid organic sales and acquisition-based growth. Net sales in the reported quarter came in at $15.28 billion, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.18 billion. In addition, the top line came in 2.7% higher than the prior-year figure.  United Technologies is also poised to grow on the back of innovation investments, robust backlog and strategic cost-reduction efforts. Backed by these positives, the company raised the lower end of its full-year 2017 earnings guidance. Adjusted earnings are currently anticipated to lie within the $6.45–$6.60 per share range versus the previously estimated range of $6.30−$6.60. However, the financial performance of the company depends on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries. It is also heavily dependent on the U.S. government’s budgetary allocation for defense. A reduction in capital spending for the commercial aviation or defense industries is likely to have a significant effect on demand for its products, which could in turn have an adverse impact on its financial performance. United Technologies designs, manufactures and services products that incorporate advanced technologies. The introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and high R&D expenses, and the degree or timing of benefits may not be correctly anticipated. At present, United Technologies seems to be facing challenges on most fronts and it would be prudent for investors to remain on the sidelines for some time.With over 8,000 employees, United Technologies has a considerable presence in the U.K. Consequently, the company is susceptible to high operating risks following the Brexit referendum. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also affect the company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause instability in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. These undermine its long-term growth to some extent.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

528,COL,"Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) announced that it has secured a $32.3 million modification contract from the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC.Details of the ContractPer the contract, the company will procure long-lead material for supporting the U.S. Navy’s fiscal 2017 Standard Missile-6 full-rate production requirements and spares.About 71% of the work related to the contract will be carried out at the Camden, AR facility of Raytheon, while the rest will be performed at San Diego, CA (9%); Middletown, CT (9%); Amesbury, MA (3%); Andover, MA and Irvine, CA (2% each); Verdi, NV and Needham Heights, MA (1% each); Anaheim, CA (1%); Warrington, PA, and Union, NJ (less than 1% each). The work is expected to be completed by Mar 2020.About Raytheon’s Standard Missile-6 (SM-6)The U.S. Navy uses the SM-6 missile on the cruisers and destroyers. These missiles are known to provide Joint Force and Strike Force Commanders fleet air defense against manned and unmanned aircraft, land-attack anti-ship cruise missiles in flights, ballistic missiles in their terminal or final stage of flight over land or sea along with the targets on the ocean’s surface. The SM-6 missiles are considered triple threats as they provide anti-air warfare, sea-based terminal ballistic missile defense as well as anti-surface warfare.SM-6 missiles by Raytheon possess both offensive and defensive capability by utilizing its Standard Missile airframe and propulsion system. Till date, the company has supplied more than 300 missiles and continues to improve the quality and the precision of the same with advanced research and development.Why Raytheon?While cyber-attacks, terrorism threats and enhanced geopolitical instability are one the rise, it is becoming increasingly important for all countries to elevate their level of security and defense. Defense Equipment manufacturers like Raytheon, AeroVironment, Inc. (AVAV  -  Free Report), Orbital ATK, Inc. , Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) are trying to put their best foot forward.Raytheon is one of the companies among the major large-cap defense players due to its non-platform-centric focus.

Earlier in June, the company announced that its business unit, Missile Systems, has won a contract from the U.S. Navy to procure full-rate production requirements and spares for fiscal 2017 Standard Missile-2 (SM-2). The procurement will be done for the U.S. and Allied Foreign Navies.Additionally, President Trump’s support toward increasing defense spending and the proposed hike in 2018 defense budget is currently in favor of companies like Raytheon. If the budget hike is approved by the majority, the funds would be utilized in procuring a handful of defense equipment that include tactical missiles and Lockheed’s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense interceptors.Price MovementIn the last six months, shares of Raytheon have gained 18.5% compared to the industry’s gain of 16.5% in the same period of time.Foreign military contracts continue to be the vital growth driver for Raytheon.
