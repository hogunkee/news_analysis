22,TIF,"At the start of the year, Macy's stock and a few others had begun to show signs of life. But retail stocks clearly were not leading the market. Dollar stores and building products were the only retail groups among IBD's top 20 industries. The retail sector weighed in at No. 20, among the 33 sectors that IBD tracks.But hefty advances — not only in Macy's stock price, but from Kohl's (KSS), Dillard's (DDS), Tiffany (TIF), Fossil (FOSL) and RH (RH), to name just a few — have placed retail among the market's highest fliers. Retail groups posted six of the 10 top gains among industries over the past eight weeks. Over the four most recent weeks, retailers notched four of the top five advances. Shoe and clothing manufacturers were close behind.A broad rise in jewelry retail stocks lifted that group to the best gain of the past four weeks, up 32.5%, with an eight-week advance of 35.8%. The eight-week tally also shows office-supply retailers outperforming, up 45.5%. Home furnishings and department stores are also in the top five gains among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.A broader look — at the year-to-date gains — shows only slightly different results. Jewelry retailers top the list, up 46.8% through Monday. Department stores are next in line with a 42.3% gain.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIt's a surprising chunk of data for those who had read the countless recent headlines heralding the demise of brick-and-mortar retail as the Amazon effect advances, leaving traditional retail markets scorched and salted in its wake.But many retailers have had time to put in place e-commerce units, and to launch in-store initiatives to bolster their strengths vs. online retailers. The industry has stripped down, restructured and shaken out. In addition, unemployment is at its lowest level in 18 years. And while wage growth has lagged, at least more consumers are bringing home paychecks. In addition, tax changes may mean more cash in pockets in the coming back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons.So which stocks led the retail charge through the first half of 2018?For jewelers, Fossil soared 294% through Tuesday. Movado (MOV) has pounded out a 56% gain, while heavyweight Tiffany logged a 31% gain. All three stocks are extended.Department store chains Macy's and Dillards each rose 61% for the year through Tuesday. Kohl's has a 47% gain. All three stocks are extended. Macy's is in a profit-taking zone, more than 20% above a flat-base buy point at 30.14.The industry with the third-largest year-to-date gain, internet retailers, has become a huge group. The 30-stock industry holds a combined market capitalization of $1.5 trillion – the sixth largest among IBD's 197 industries.IBD Leaderboard stock Amazon is the group's obvious flagship, up 45% since the start of the year. But Shutterfly (SFLY) has gained 95%; Etsy (ETSY), also a Leaderboard listing, has charged ahead 61%; and Stamps.com (STMP) has posted a 44% advance.Amazon is beyond buy range above a handle buy point at 1568.62. Etsy is also extended from a late-May rebound from support at its 10-week moving average.Stamps.com is working on its ninth straight weekly advance. It is beyond its buy range above a flat-base buy point at 215.86.There is no shortage of other standout retail stocks: Lululemon (LULU) is up 58% year to date. Urban Outfitters (URBN) has a 37% gain. RH spiked 33% Wednesday after reporting a 2,560% increase in its first-quarter earnings. Sales slipped 1%, missing analysts' targets. Five Below (FIVE) jetted 41% higher last week, after its first-quarter results.Other retailers set to report this week include Casey's General Stores (CASY) on Wednesday morning and Michaels (MIK) on Thursday morning.RELATED:Top Retail Stock Logs Another Win: Earnings Beat, Outlook UpRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchDepartment Stores: Is Kohl's Leading A Great American Comeback?

23,TIF,"It's the age-old story of the retail business: When one door closes, another opens.For years, experts have predicted a so-called retail apocalypse as well-known chains like Sports Authority and Payless ShoeSource went bankrupt. The most recent high-profile victim was Toys R Us, which liquidated in the middle of March after a failed rescue attempt.But a funny thing happened on the way to Armageddon. In the wake of the toy giant's collapse, a corner of the industry known as specialty retailing — where stores focus on smaller, niche categories — has been on a roll. And for investors looking to capitalize, that's meant a shift from large-capitalization stocks to midcaps, where many specialty retailers reside.Since March 15, the day Toys R Us announced it was going out of business, the S&P 500 Specialty Retail Index has more than doubled the return of the S&P 500 Internet and Catalog Retail index. The move is earnings driven, as over that time almost all of the companies in the S&P 500 Retailing Index have reported their quarterly results, with about 70% beating forecasts, according to Bloomberg data.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""A lot of the retailers had very good same-store sales, and what that shows is the traffic is still there for people, and now it's a matter of how do you convert traffic to buyers?"" Joe ""JJ"" Kinahan, the chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said by phone. ""Retailers themselves have gotten much more creative and much better at helping their clients.""Stellar earnings from companies such as luxury purveyor Tiffany (TIF) have powered the specialty retail index higher. Tiffany reported strong sales growth in the quarter ended April 30, raised its profit forecast and announced a share buyback plan of $1 billion. That's helped propel Tiffany shares to a gain of about 26% this year.One way for investors to play this growth without fully diving into retail is to buy a midcap index fund.For example, two-thirds of the companies in the specialty retail index appear in the $23 billion Vanguard Mid-Cap (VO) fund, which is the second-largest exchange traded fund focusing on midcap companies. It tracks the CRSP US Mid Cap Index, which targets companies that fall between the top 70% to 85% of investable market capitalization, according to the Center for Research in Security Prices website.Retail makes up 6% of VO, the fund's fourth-largest industry holding. The largest midcap ETF, iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH), has 5.2% of its holdings in the retail space. The $47 billion fund only allocates more cash to real estate and banking.There are 48 U.S.-centric ETFs that focus specifically on midcap stocks, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, compared with nearly 100 products that focus on small caps. Looking at the three largest midcap ETFs, retail makes up more than 5% of each, putting it among the five largest industry allocations.The strength of midcap retailers is hardly an anomaly — the entire industry is doing well. The S&P 500 Retailing Index is the best performing group this year, up nearly 22%. And there could be more room to run.Some retail stocks are cheap compared with historical valuations. The S&P Retail Select Industry's price-earnings ratio has fallen to 14 after peaking near 35 in 2014, putting the index 36% below its five-year average of 22.Still, the market isn't exactly buying the idea that specialty retailers can continue to beat their internet rivals — at least if fund flows are any guide.Investors poured about $42 million into the Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY) in May, making it the best month in the fund's history. The two-year-old ETF holds companies that make at least 70% of their revenue online. Meanwhile, VO lost around $5 million in assets this month, and the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT), which tracks the broader retail industry, has seen $15 million in outflows.""You definitely get some of the more hated retail names,"" Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas said of midcap ETFs. ""But keep in mind (that) if there's a real move to value, some of those could do well.""That's already starting to happen, as seen in the strength of specialty stores. It's no longer just the internet retailing moguls like Amazon.com (AMZN) that are leading the pack higher.""The retail sector is breaking out on both an absolute and relative basis to the broader consumer discretionary sector, and internet vendors can no longer take all the credit as the source for the industry's recent strength,"" Gina Martin Adams, chief equity strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a recent report.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:4 Top Ways To Profit From Twitter's Big Stock MoveAre Small-Cap Growth Stocks The New Market Leaders?New ETF Aims To Provide A Steady 7% Annual Distribution Rate

Revenue is expected to surge 25% to $292 million.Stock: Shares rose 2.1% to a new record high of 78.86 in the stock market today. The stock broke out of a 78.38 buy point of a flat base.

Some research has shown that the company's low-price strategy has managed to out-discount Amazon (AMZN). Big one-time crazes, like fidget spinners, juiced the company's sales last year. Squishies, fake slime and other items helped fill in when interest in spinners cooled.Five Below is targeting at least 20% net income and sales growth through 2020. The company also seems likely to benefit from Toys R Us' demise, as brands increasingly turn to Five Below for exposure.Estimates: A fiscal first-quarter net loss 11 cents per share, down from a profit of $1.03 a year ago, according to Zacks. Wall Street sees revenue up 2% to $1.429 billion. Same-store sale are seen down 4.3%, according to Consensus Metrix.Stock: Shares edged up 1% to 44.15. The jewelry chain crashed 20% in March after it offered a weak full-year financial forecast and announced a three-year restructuring plan.Signet, at that time, said it planned to relocate or close more than 200 stores by the end of the fiscal year to ""reduce the company's mall-based exposure."" The company operates the Kay and Jared jewelry chains. The nation's malls have become quieter places as more people shop online.The restructuring plan also includes cost cuts and efforts to make digital shopping a better experience. Signet said it wanted digital sales to account for at least 15% of overall sales in fiscal 2021, nearly double what they were in fiscal 2018. The company will also improve online appointment booking and ""online viewing capability.""More-upscale Tiffany (TIF) rocketed through a buy point following strong earnings last month.Estimates: A net loss of 16 cents per share, narrowing from a 50-cent loss a year ago. Revenue is expected to surge 49% to $79 million.Stock: Shares were off 4.85% to 54.58 on Tuesday. The stock began trading last year. It hit a record 58.56 on Tuesday.The identity-management cybersecurity firm, which facilitates secure connections between users and business' applications on the cloud, has grown thanks to some partnerships with big technology players like Facebook (FB) and VMware (VMW).Estimates: Wall Street expects Cloudera, a cloud data analytics company, to report a first-quarter net loss of 18 cents per share. Sales are expected to jump 26% to $101 million.Stock: Cloudera, which went public last year, gained 1.1% to 17.10 on Tuesday, reclaiming its 200-day line. Shares in April crashed 40% after its financial outlook failed to please investors.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Chip Stocks On The Rise: ASML, STMicro, OthersFive Below, STMicroelectronics Break Out; Akamai Retakes Buy PointStocks Mixed; Twitter Hits New High And This Retailer Breaks OutApple Debuts iOS 12, Group FaceTime, New Augmented Reality Apps

39,TIF,"In early March 2018, Congressional hearings began on the Trump Administration's ""Framework for Rebuilding Infrastructure in America.""While the President's proposals will be debated vigorously, and the approach that will finally emerge from such debate is uncertain, one fact is not in dispute: the nation's infrastructure is in dire need of investment. Our transit, water, electric power and other systems, many of which date back to the middle of the last century, are long overdue for renewal or upgrading.The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) gave America's infrastructure a D+ on its quadrennial ""Report Card"" last year.As a practical matter, the federal government will not be able to shoulder the entire burden of funding our nation's infrastructure revitalization effort. ASCE has estimated that the country would need to spend nearly $4.6 trillion on infrastructure from 2016 to 2025, but also cites a gap of almost $2.1 trillion between the overall need and estimated funding.A key part of the solution, according to ASCE, is to, ""…create incentives for state and local governments and the private sector to invest in maintenance, and to improve the efficiency and performance of existing infrastructure.""Fortunately, a number of states and localities are taking matters into their own hands, demonstrating strong leadership in recognizing the need — and assembling the requisite financing — for vital infrastructure projects.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA few of the major projects that are now underway around the country include: the California High-Speed Rail between San Francisco and L.A. ($68 billion), New York City's Second Avenue Subway ($10.5 billion), the Light Rail Expansion in Charlotte, NC ($1.2 billion), and the Tappan Zee Bridge replacement in New York State ($3.98 billion).While federal dollars do make up portions of the funding for these projects, state, local and private sources, as well as toll-fees, are significant contributors.It appears that the above-mentioned projects, among many others, are at the forefront of a movement toward greater local investment in infrastructure.The administration's proposal has sought to advance this trend, calling for  $200 billion in federal funding to stimulate an estimated $1.5 trillion in infrastructure investment. The intention is to use federal dollars as seed money to incentivize infrastructure investment, while moving more than 80% of the financing burden to the state and local levels.Testifying before Congress, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao conveyed the Administration's view that, ""States and localities are best equipped to understand the infrastructure investments needs of their communities. The infrastructure incentives program… would encourage increased state, local, and private investment in infrastructure. This program would provide for targeted Federal investments, encourage innovation, streamline project delivery, and help transform the way infrastructure is designed, built, and maintained.""Regardless of where one stands with respect to the administration's ""seed money"" approach, it seems clear that state and local governments are not waiting for lawmakers in Washington to arrive at a funding solution.Los Angeles passed a $120 billion infrastructure plan back in November 2016, funded entirely by a sales tax increase, as many local voters realized how desperately they need to invest in infrastructure.Many other states have taken the initiative to increase their own pools of infrastructure funding. For example, 17 states and the District of Columbia have raised their gasoline taxes in the past three years, and at least nine states, from Alaska to South Carolina, may be considering similar moves in the near future.Those state and local governments that want to support infrastructure development without depending on federal resources could consider several other options, including but not limited to:While a major spending program from Washington would be a welcome boost for infrastructure investment, state and local governments increasingly are taking the initiative to secure infrastructure funding independent of the federal budget.These government bodies are demonstrating their resolve — and developing the financial resources — to revitalize aging systems and create 21st century infrastructure to support future economic growth and more livable communities.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

Dow component Visa (V) made a new high in active trading. The small-cap Russell 2000 fared a bit better, up 0.3%.The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.2%.

Shares are now below the 50-day moving average and below the 289.37 buy point — a disquieting sign just a day before the company announces quarterly earnings. Ulta has been one of the most sturdy retail stocks, in large part because its format is resistant to online competitors. A sell-off in its shares would further weaken a retail sector that is short on winners.

"
68,TIF,"The fight over the border tax has been focused entirely on the impact a 20% tax would have on big importers. Supporters insist that retailers like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Best Buy (BBY) wouldn't really be hurt, because currencies would adjust to neutralize the tax.Yet, while the predicted 25% rise in the dollar isn't certain — it could rise by somewhat less or even more — it's curious that there's been almost no attention paid to the potential impact on the one industry that's likely to bear the brunt of a currency adjustment: U.S. tourism.Tourism Economics estimates that each 10% rise in the dollar causes a 2% decrease in international visitors. On top of that, visitors may shorten their average stay and otherwise limit their spending.International travelers could find that visiting a Disney (DIS) theme park, gambling at an MGM Resorts (MGM) casino, staying at a Marriott (MAR) hotel or shopping at Tiffany (TIF) would be much more expensive.Staying at a Trump International Hotel would be more expensive too, which might influence President Trump's view that the dollar is already ""too strong"" and is ""killing us."" Just how much more expensive would depend on the extent to which reduced travel leads tourism-related industries to lower prices.Another hit would come from increased overseas travel by Americans, who would find that their dollars go much further in London, Paris, Rome and other destination spots around the world and opt against a U.S. vacation.International carriers like United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) may not suffer as much, since more outbound American travelers could ease the pain of fewer U.S.-bound tourists. Similarly, global hotel chains like Marriott may also see additional bookings by Americans abroad. But more domestic-focused businesses won't have such offsets.A major, unilateral increase in the U.S. currency could come at a pretty significant price. International travel added $247 billion to the U.S. economy last year and generated an $88 billion surplus, relative to what Americans spent abroad, according to the U.S. Travel Association's analysis of Commerce Department data. That's down from a $98 billion travel surplus in 2015. It's not clear how much of the narrower surplus was related to a stronger dollar, but there is generally a lag before shifts in currencies affect travel, given advance bookings.The figures include educational tourism — foreign students attending U.S. colleges and universities and generally paying much more than local residents to do so. With a 25% rise in the dollar, the U.S. might not look like quite as an attractive place to study. In 2015, education-related tourism totaled $35.8 billion.""Regular exporters would, under border adjustment, receive a subsidy that would offset the exchange rate impact; but hotel owners presumably wouldn't,"" wrote American Enterprise Institute resident scholar Stan Veuger. ""Or would U.S. taxpayers start subsidizing the vacations of Chinese tourists?""That seems as unlikely as federal government subsidies to let foreign students attend the University of California at Berkeley, he adds.While the impact on tourism has been almost entirely absent from the debate, it could play a bigger role as GOP senators decide whether they can back the House plan. Georgia Sen. David Perdue, former CEO of Dollar General (DG), has already signaled his fierce opposition, meaning just two more GOP defections could kill it.Expect Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who both represent top-five states for foreign travel, to come under heavy lobbying pressure from the tourism industry. Border states Texas and Arizona also are big tourism destinations, with Mexican travelers spending $19.7 billion in the U.S. in 2015.IBD'S TAKE: If the dollar appreciates 20% to 25% against foreign currencies, U.S. investors holding ADRs of foreign equities like Alibaba or international ETFs would take a hit.The projected rise in the dollar would come from already lofty levels. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of advanced-economy currencies, surged 26% from July 2014 to March 2015, hitting the highest level since 2003.On earnings calls in the fall of 2015, Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide noted ""lower volumes of inbound international travelers due to the strong dollar,"" while Tiffany said it ""continued to experience a negative effect on foreign tourists spending in the U.S.""While the dollar eased off of those levels for most of 2016, it has strengthened again on expectations for a stronger U.S. economy under Trump.AEI's Veuger also points out that real estate is another ""quasi-exporting"" industry that might feel an impact from the border tax, since foreigners purchase some $100 billion worth of residential properties in a year, about half paid for in cash.RELATED:If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May CollapseTreasury Might Write Checks To Boeing Under GOP Tax Reform

With $1,457 in sales per square foot, it is the ninth-most productive mall in the country, according to a CNBC story from May, citing real estate research firm Green Street Advisors. So why spend $800 million on a makeover?Looks matter more than ever, particularly as social-media bragging rights become an essential part of the millennial shopping experience. So these days, every retailer has to put on a good show, ramping up the drama to boost foot traffic and cheat death as Amazon (AMZN) spells doom for more and more American malls.""(Young people are) very into cataloging everything they do via social media, and so these more luxury experiences have more social currency,"" said Talmage Advisors CEO Liz Dunn.That could mean Snapchatting from inside a Tiffany (TIF) — regardless of whether you buy something — or taking a topside photo of your artisanal lunch. (Never has flat lay photography been so popular.)""Whatever it is, there's a lot more social currency to that than saying 'I'm at a TGI Friday's,' "" she said.The mall's transformation into an ""immersive sensory experience"" contrasts with the post-World War II bloom of malls, which attracted Americans to cookie-cutter hubs with their one-stop-shopping convenience. That has since given way to the splendid isolationism of two-day shipping via Amazon Prime, hollowing out traditional malls and forcing the survivors to become purveyors of experiences that can be shared online.Fellow L.A.-based shopping center The Grove, owned by Caruso, underscores the trend and is a social-media maven's dream.It houses many of the same stores as a regional mall does — like Banana Republic, J. Crew and Anthropologie — but also features a fountain, trolley and live music, helping put it at No. 2 on CNBC/Green Street Advisors' list with a $2,200 in sales per square foot. The photogenic plaza was even once the backdrop for Hollywood-gossip show ""Extra,"" which has no doubt upped its social cred among tourists who want a glimpse of glam.""This is where all the B-list celebs, YouTube stars, and Instagram influencers shop (I saw an Instagram male model there myself when I went),"" gushed one Yelp reviewer visiting from Toronto.The lure of exclusivity, that close cousin of luxury, is another way retailers have amped up the theatrics.It's a tactic long employed by an athletic-footwear industry that routinely releases shoes in small batches, driving up demand from sneakerheads and high-schoolers alike. There's even a sneaker stock exchange, StockX, devoted to the resale of Jordans, Kobes and anything Kanye has ever designed for Adidas.Other retailers have since caught on. Coach (COH) and Disney (DIS) last year introduced a limited-edition House of Mouse-themed handbag line. Spice Girl-turned-fashion designer Victoria Beckham is behind Target's (TGT) upcoming capsule collection. And H&M seems to have an endless series of designer linkups in the pipeline.The New York Times even declared 2016 ""the year of the drop,"" referring to the slew of limited-edition releases and pop-up shops, like Kylie Jenner's blink-and-it's-gone store, designed to create shopper frenzy.The Hollywood Reporter called the December opening of Jenner's pop-up, located within the Westfield Topanga Mall in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, ""mayhem.""Mayhem is the antithesis of convenience, when it comes to shopping. But that is the point. No one wants to stand in line outside for hours waiting for laundry detergent. A Kylie Lip Kit, however, is not long for this world.To get a teen or 20-something to the mall — and most ""drop"" shoppers are under 30, noted the Times — the mall must act a little more like a nightclub, velvet ropes and all.Even supermarkets are in on the action: Some Whole Foods Market (WFM), Kroger (KR) and Gelson's locations feature wine bars, a premium add-on meant to keep grocery shoppers in stores longer.Such theater may seem gimmicky, but it works, and is also being seen in actual theaters. The local cineplex, a requisite component of any shopping mall, is also undergoing a revamp.On the defensive from Netflix (NFLX) and massive TVs, theaters have been making screens bigger, audio better, and seats more spacious. And as an alternative to grabbing popcorn from the concession stand and trying to find a decent seat, more theaters now serve cocktails and dinner to your reserved Barcalounger while that summer blockbuster plays in Imax 3D.AMC (AMC), for example, embarked three years ago on a $600 million reseating project to rip out traditional chairs and replace them with recliners.AMC, which has called its collective upgrades a ""winning playbook,"" outlined at a recent presentation that attendance has grown 53% and revenue leapt 70% in its 1,500 or so reseated theaters. It has thousands more theaters in line to be updated.Top exhibitor chain Regal Cinemas (RGC) also recently attributed recent outperformance to plush seating, calling out recliner sites as the ""biggest driver.""""Theaters have to do something to differentiate themselves from the in-home experience,"" said RBC analyst Leo Kulp. ""That's really what's driven these investments over the past several years.""Theaters, full-service restaurants and other bells and whistles have woven themselves into a successful mall's narrative, but it may be a while before the experiential stuff surpasses retail stores that sell shirts and shoes.""The future will certainly bring less retail, but it will take a few years to tip the scale"" so that retailers become a mall's minority residents, said NPD Group retail analyst Marshal Cohen.There is also some hope for once-reliable mall anchors like Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN), even as Macy's reportedly considers selling itself after a brutal holiday season.The Grove has a Nordstrom, and the revamped Westfield Century City is actually adding a department store to the mix, for a total of three major names. It will now house a two-story Macy's, three-story Bloomingdale's and a three-story Nordstrom that is being relocated from the next mall over.But the massive upgrades being made to shopping arenas could even further widen the gap between top-market malls and their less-moneyed brethren.Of the more-than-1,000 malls in America, the 300 or so top-market ""A-malls"" account for 75% of mall value (a metric comprised of sales productivity, size and other factors), according to Green Street Advisors.So what's a midtier mall to do? For developers, the answer may be: Change or die.Strong anchors are ""imperative"" for a shopping center's long-term viability, according to Green Street's 2017 mall outlook report, since income-generating tenants want malls with ""vibrant,"" traffic-driving anchors.As department stores waver, Green Street's research points to restaurants, movie theaters and ""traditional power-center tenants"" — like Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and pet stores — as rising power players.But Talmage Advisors' Dunn is not optimistic.""The problem is, it's a little bit of a self-fulfilling prophesy,"" she said. ""The landlords aren't willing to invest in the lower-tier centers, and the thing that would potentially take a lower-tier center to help it jump a bracket is investment. But it's hard to justify the investment if the center's performance isn't in that top-tier range.""

70,TIF,"Ah, romance! Valentine's Day is at hand. What better time to consider stocks that have romantic connotations. Financial advisors, money managers and investment strategists suggested them to IBD via email. But watch out. Several look more like broken hearts than dream dates.As for their efficacy in the romance department, we'll let you be the judge of that.Valentine's Day connection? ""There's a reason the phrase 'Netflix and chill' is a phrase,"" Reeves said. ""While perhaps not as romantic as dinner and a show, snuggling up on the couch with streaming video is a common courtship ritual in this digital age.""Netflix has a perfect 99 Composite Rating from IBD. The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher. In Netflix's case, after six quarters of declining earnings per share growth, EPS growth has accelerated for three stanzas in a row, advancing 50%, 71% and 114%.""The reasons (for Netflix's earnings rebound) were obvious,"" Reeves said, ""as (it) crushed expectations on international subscriber growth, and posted a better-than-expected outlook for the future.""""That momentum has continued in its most recent earnings report,"" Reeves added, ""which beat on both the top and bottom lines. A continued push into original content with smash hits 'Stranger Things' and 'Narcos' coupled with aggressive overseas growth makes this a stock to love in 2017.""Yepez describes a Valentine's Day meal at a Texas Roadhouse restaurant as a romantic occasion at a lovable price. For long-term investors, Yepez points to the stock's 27 consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth. ""And (it) continues to take market share from other restaurant chains,"" he said.The company runs and franchises 483 of its namesake restaurants in 49 states. The stock has a so-so 71 Composite Rating from IBD. It is ranked only No. 10 in IBD's Retail-Restaurants industry group.The stock's strengths include four straight years of annual EPS growth, a very strong 95 EPS Rating — which puts it in the top 5% of all publicly traded companies in terms of EPS growth — and 35% average EPS growth over the three most recent quarters. EPS is expected to rise 29% this year.Etsy runs online and offline markets where people and businesses buy and sell largely handmade goods. Magoon calls Etsy the premier online site for custom jewelry, vintage goods and other crafts. Online retailers like Etsy tend to see sales surge around Valentine's Day, Magoon says.And it has a protective moat, Magoon adds. ""Unlike other traditional and online retailers, Etsy's offerings are less likely to get 'Amazoned' due to their uniqueness,"" Magoon said.In addition, Magoon sees Etsy as a possible takeover target.After deepening losses since 2012, the company is expected to post a shallower loss of six cents a share for 2016 and post a profit of 14 cents for this year, according to Thomson Reuters First Call. Trading around 12, shares are 23% below their Oct. 7 high. The stock has a weak 40 Composite Rating.The Valentine's Day tie-in? The wholesale membership warehouse chain's wine and diamond sales, Wicker says.  Costco's jewelry pricing is competitive, Wicker adds. ""And for those who need to hedge their bets, Costco has a liberal and generous return policy,"" he said. In addition, Costco's membership fees give its near-term cash flow visibility. Plus, operating margins should benefit from the switch to a new credit card vendor and increase in membership dues.Annual earnings growth over the past three years averaged a modest 8%. Yearly sales growth was 4% over the same period. The stock has a weak 52 Comp Rating, though its trading at its all-time high. EPS growth the past three quarters was 6%, 2% and 7%, which followed two frames of declining growth.Over the past four quarters sales have fallen by 4.6%. EPS also fell. The company has a dividend yield of 2.3% and has a dividend growth rate of 11%. But Wilsey says the company uses 47.4% of earnings to pay its dividend. Before its most recent quarterly EPS gain of 9%, EPS growth fell six quarters in a row.RELATED:Where Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 2017Mutual Fund Managers Cite Tech, Financial, Energy, Industrial Names They Like For '17

74,TIF,"D.C. news moved markets during the week. The Dow and S&P 500 index hit record highs as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and other financials rallied on tax-cut hopes and rising bond yields. Stocks dipped Friday on a report that Michael Flynn, briefly President Trump's national security adviser, is willing to testify against Trump as part of a plea deal.Tech leaders, including many chip stocks and China internets, struggled. Bitcoin frenzy continued amid growing acceptance and concerns. General Motors (GM) said it will launch a robotaxi service for big cities in 2019.X The Dow and S&P 500 rallied to record highs as tax-cut hopes lifted stocks generally, with the Flynn-Trump news only paring gains. The Dow rose 2.9%, its best weekly gain of 2017. The S&P 500 advanced 1.5%. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup (C) and other financials also rallied on rising bond yields while many retailers rebounded on holiday sales hopes. The Nasdaq fell 0.6% as tech leaders struggled, including China internets, many chipmakers and FANG stocks Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB.)Bitcoin's roller coaster ride continued this week, clearing $10,000, then $11,000, then face-planting closer to $9,000 before moving back to around $10,700. The jolts came as smaller investors get more active in trading the much-hyped cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, big financial names continued to weigh in on the prospects of digital currencies: Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles called digital currencies a ""niche product"" that could pose ""serious financial stability issues"" if adopted more widely. Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein told Bloomberg that something that ""moves up and down 20% in a day doesn't feel like a currency."" But derivatives regulator CFTC OK'd Bitcoin futures at the CME (CME) and CBOE (CBOE), with CME saying it'll launch futures on Dec. 18. Cantor Fitzgerald and reportedly Nasdaq (NDAQ) also are moving toward offering futures in the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rose 55% for the week.Cyber Monday was the biggest yet: Adobe Analytics said shoppers spent $6.59 billion online, up 16.8% from the prior year, with nearly a third of that spent via mobile devices. Amazon (AMZN) also announced that this was its single biggest shopping day in history, overtaking the most recent Prime Day; the Echo Dot proved most popular. Adobe believes this will be the first holiday season to surpass the $100 billion mark in online sales. But shares of many brick-and-mortar retailers rallied on expectations of a strong or at least better-than-feared year-end performance. Macy's (M) said it will hire extra holiday workers due to strong demand.General Motors (GM) said it will launch a robotaxi service for big cities in 2019. The top carmaker in the U.S. sees self-driving vehicles as a cornerstone of future mobility — and a potential profit driver. It faces a slew of new entrants in a rapidly transforming auto sector, not least Alphabet (GOOGL) and its Waymo self-driving unit. Waymo — often seen as being furthest along on autonomous technology — said it will soon put passengers in driverless cars — without even a ""safety driver"" to take over the controls if things go wrong. But GM says its ability to both develop self-driving solutions and manufacture cars gives it an edge vs. tech rivals in the race to put self-driving cars on public roads on a commercial scale. GM shares look set for a 4% weekly drop but are up 22% on the year.Marquee auto and tech companies also looked to the future at Automobility LA, a curtain-raiser for the LA Auto Show. Intel (INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich sees self-driving cars as one of the biggest data collectors in the next decade or so. Intel's self-driving partner BMW (BMWYY) said its autonomous cars will hit the road in 2021. SUVs and crossover utility vehicles — the autos in hot demand today — dazzled on the floors of the auto show.General Motors reported a surprise decline in U.S. auto sales, while Ford (F) had stronger-than-expected gains. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) sales fell, largely in line, as the automaker slashes fleet sales.The Federal Reserve is on track for a December rate hike, Jerome Powell, the current Fed governor who will replace Janet Yellen as chair in February, signaled in a Senate hearing on his nomination. Powell also said that he sees the current 4.1% unemployment rate as about the lowest it can go without putting upward pressure on inflation. His remarks suggest that the Fed's hawkish-but-patient tilt probably won't change much after Yellen's exit. Powell also hinted that he favors a lighter touch on bank regulation.Meanwhile, the economy continues to show broad strength. New home sales in October surged to a 685,000 annual pace, a 10-year high.

The IBD 50 stock leapt nearly 11%. Fellow IBD 50 RV maker Winnebago (WGO) rose 4.45%.As expected, OPEC and Russia agreed to extend their current production cuts to the end of 2018. The deal includes caps on OPEC members Libya and Nigeria for the first time and provision to review the cuts at the June 2018 meeting. Saudi energy minister Khalid Al-Falih said that U.S. shale production growth will be ""manageable"" next year.Earnings per share rose 80% while sales grew 29%, both better than expected.

Autodesk plans to slash its workforce by 13%, cutting about 1,150 jobs, and close some non-core facilities. Synopsys earned an adjusted 69 cents a share on sales of $696.6 million in its fiscal fourth quarter, vs. views of 57 cents and $653 million.

84,TIF,"Look up ""sad mall"" or ""dead mall"" online and you're likely to be confronted with images of desolate, shuttered shopping centers that have been left for dead. Overgrown plants crack through abandoned storefronts; crumbled tile litters broken-down escalators. It's a common-enough phenomenon that entire photography projects revolve around the state of the country's retail centers.Is this what 2017 holds for American shoppers?Not quite, but the upcoming year isn't exactly going to be a cakewalk, either. The hundreds of collective store closures (from Macy's (M), Wal-Mart (WMT) and others, combined) and bankruptcies (Sports Authority, Sports Chalet) in 2016 are enough to make even the most devoted shopaholic wonder if the future of commerce is one big Amazon.com (AMZN) screen.""It's going to be a year of transition and a year of reckoning and a year of awakening for retailers,"" said Marshal Cohen, NPD Group's chief industry analyst.Retail sales excluding autos and gasoline rose 4% from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24, according to MasterCard's SpendingPulse. That suggests a stronger-than-expected holiday season, perhaps reflecting more optimistic consumers. But while digital sales continued to boom, with Amazon grabbing an ever-larger e-commerce share, brick-and-mortar locations faced declining traffic. And those trends are likely to intensify into the new year.The big discounts offered at apparel stores this holiday season echoed prior sales-heavy years, particularly 2015's. While retailers generally went into this important shopping period claiming that inventories were lean, stores feel they have no choice in an already cutthroat environment.""Consumers have been trained that if they hold out, they will get a promotion,"" said Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar. ""The other problem is that it's a really overcrowded space with no barriers to entry. A lot of retailers are choosing to compete on price.""IBD'S TAKE: What's holding Amazon back from becoming a major player in beauty? For an in-depth look, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""Retail Metrics President Ken Perkins said that outside of a few busy hours on the weekends, Holiday 2016 was ""somewhat eerily quiet"" at the mall.During store checks, his research firm observed but a ""handful of people"" at Foot Locker (FL), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) brand Hollister, American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) and Macy's. L Brands' (LB) Bath & Body Works ""always seems to have a buzz,"" he said, but even Apple (AAPL) stores seemed less bustling than in years' past.""Each year it feels like that lull is a bit deeper and deeper,"" said Perkins.Some of the lag can be attributed to holiday promotions being pushed up earlier in November, said NPD's Cohen, spreading out the spending. But the perhaps greater problem is the lack of product innovation and uniqueness on shelves, he said.In other words, there's not enough new, fun stuff to buy — for other people or for self-gifting purposes.NPD, which tracks the November-December shopping period week by week, said in its latest report that as of the week ending Dec. 10, dollar sales in the first six weeks of the holiday retail season were lagging the prior-year period by 4%.Brick-and-mortar traffic fell about 10% at stores through Dec. 17, according to Prodco Retail Traffic Index.One saving grace for brick-and-mortar locations: Christmas Eve — also the start of Hanukkah this year — was on a Saturday, while Dec. 26 was also a day off.The issues that faced retailers in 2016 are likely to continue to face them in 2017, without much abatement. Perkins highlighted the ongoing shift to online and mobile spending, a consumer taste for experiences instead of products, high promotional activity and a ""hollowing out"" of the middle class that leaves less disposable income on the table.And, of course, Amazon's insistent gains. On top of Prime shipping and Prime Video, the company's smart-home device, Alexa, can help Prime members place orders.""(Alexa) cuts retailer out of the equation for consumers that are pressed for time,"" he said.Upper-tier malls — the kind that house Tiffanys (TIF) and Louis Vuittons and Shake Shacks (SHAK) — are expected to continue to perform well enough. But the average mall might still see some individual stores close up shop, say experts, unless they go out of their way to attract more foot traffic.""Mid-tier malls are going to need to step up their game"" with restaurants, movie theaters and lifestyle stores, said NPD's Cohen, adding that ""the food court won't be good enough.""Simon Property Group (SPG), a major mall operator, has tumbled 24% over the last five months, sinking Wednesday to the lowest level in nearly 16 months.That young people are doing more mobile shopping and are craving experiences is no surprise. But how retailers respond may foreshadow the brick-and-mortar industry's fate.Wal-Mart (WMT) investments (which include its e-commerce efforts) may weigh on short-term income growth but lead to foreseeable rewards in the future, said Perkins, whose store checks found that Wal-Mart has been ""one of the busier stores"" this season.In 2017, the top-performers list should feature some familiar names, by Perkins' estimate. Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) are ""two of the strongest performers in retail."" He also sees off-price trio TJX (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Burlington (BURL) continuing to do well, as well as Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which is ""obviously a standout player.""Home improvement, off-price and beauty all involve some element of in-store necessity: looking for just the right part, digging through bargain racks and trying on new makeup brands are usually best done in person.Department stores have had a choppy year, though Nordstrom (JWN) frequently gets a shout-out from analysts for being an ""omnichannel"" retailer that knows how to engage its customers across platforms. And unlike Macy's or Kohl's (KSS), which compete ""with Amazon and everyone else on the internet,"" says Morningstar's Weishaar, Nordstrom has differentiated itself by catering to more affluent shoppers with a highly curated selection.""If you go to Amazon and type in 'red dress,' you're going to get literally hundreds of pages of results to sift through that (are) not useful,"" she said. ""If you go to Nordstrom, you're going to get 10 (products in line with) your price points and brands.""Even so, Nordstrom was recently handed a downgrade from JPMorgan after the department store's management team said brick-and-mortar levels hadn't been that bad since 1972.In the future, being omnichannel might not be enough, particularly in a world increasingly populated by Alexa and Google Home devices.Retail ""omnipresence"" is key, said NPD's Cohen.That is, instead of simply giving customers a way to buy products both in-store and online, it would behoove retailers to latch onto shoppers before, during and after the transaction, he said. Educate them and anticipate their needs ahead of potential transactions, allow them different ways to buy, then stay in touch via product reviews or other methods following the purchase.The goal, said Cohen, is ""that the store becomes the epicenter for the entire process.""RELATED:Amazon's Top Selling Holiday Products Came From ...

149,TIF,"Landlords on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue are sitting on a record amount of open space as retailers balk at committing to expensive new leases in one of the world's most prestigious shopping districts.The availability rate on the famed strip, home to Saks (SKS) Fifth Avenue and Tiffany & Co.'s (TIF)flagship store, jumped to 15.9% in the third quarter, up from about 10% a year earlier, according to Cushman & Wakefield. The rate has climbed steadily this year, surpassing the prior peak of 11.3%, set in the fourth quarter of 2014.The rise of empty storefronts isn't limited to Fifth Avenue. It's part of a Manhattan-wide space glut as retailers -- buffeted by e-commerce, tepid demand for luxury goods and a strong dollar that's eroded tourist spending -- push back against rents that have soared to records. Leasing costs have increased in tandem with property values in the past five years, outpacing gains in merchandise sales and making it impossible for retailers to run profitable stores at many locations, according to Richard Hodos, a vice chairman at brokerage CBRE Group (CBG).""Property trades are being based on achieving ever-higher rents, and nobody ever really looks at what retailers can afford to pay,"" Hodos said. ""In some cases, rents need to come down 30% or more for rents to be at levels where retailers are able to make sense of them again.""Retailers are being squeezed across the U.S. In 2016, malls and other types of shopping venues have been hit by 280 major-brand store closures, totaling 12.8 million square feet (1.2 million square meters), data from Reis (REIS) show. Another real estate research firm, Green Street Advisors, estimates that several hundred malls around the country will cease operations over the next decade.Shoppers continue to shift their spending from stores to computers and smartphones. Online sales in the U.S. are expected to reach $398 billion this year, up 16% from 2015, according to research firm eMarketer.On the stretch of Fifth Avenue from 49th to 60th streets, which commands the world's highest rents, landlords are asking an average of $3,213 a square foot, up from $2,075 a square foot in 2011, Cushman data show. In the tourist-heavy Times Square area, rents stand at $2,104 a square foot after tripling over a four-year period.The brokerage's retail availability rate takes into account vacancies as well as stores occupied by merchants that plan to leave when their leases expire. Retailers that signed leases at high prices in the past several years and are seeking a tenant to sublease their space are also included, according to Steve Soutendijk, an executive director at Cushman.""Tenants that signed at the absolute top of the market are looking to mitigate their exposure,"" he said.At 667 Madison Ave., a 24-story tower two blocks from Central Park, Michael Kors Holdings (KOR) is looking to sublease about 5,000 square feet of retail space at the base of the building, according to a person familiar with the plans. The store, with 22-foot ceilings, was the company's largest when it opened in 2012, the New York Times reported at the time.Four years later, the London-based fashion house is struggling to pay the rent, said the person, who asked not to be identified because negotiations aren't public. Michael Kors is seeking a tenant to take over the space on a lease that runs through 2023, the person said.A spokeswoman for Michael Kors declined to comment. Representatives for the company's landlord, Hartz Group, didn't respond to calls and emails seeking comment.Property owners with space to fill are starting to lower their expectations, according to Cushman's Soutendijk. Asking rents in some of Manhattan's prime shopping districts, including Soho and Times Square, have declined over the course of 2016, Cushman data show.""I think a lot of landlords are ready to make deals,"" Soutendijk said. ""Everybody understands there is too much space in the market. We are not in a state of equilibrium.""Buyers of real estate during the recent boom years may not have much room to maneuver. To justify paying record prices for buildings -- and the debt that financed the acquisitions -- owners are under pressure to get the highest rents possible, according to Patrick Smith, a vice chairman of the retail brokerage at Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL).""Typically, a building that has been capitalized over the past three years is very rent-sensitive,"" he said.Landlords who hold out for the right tenant can be left hanging on to empty space for years. A partnership of developer Thor Equities and General Growth Properties, the second-largest owner of U.S. malls, bought 530 Fifth Ave. in 2014. During a conference call with analysts that year, General Growth Chief Executive Officer Sandeep Mathrani highlighted the property's large, vacant block as an opportunity to attract new retailers.No new retail leases have been signed at the property since the acquisition, though three tenants are close to agreements, according to a person with knowledge of the plans. The prospective occupants are in the health-and-beauty and sporting-goods businesses, and will likely pay less in rent than what the building owners had originally aimed for, said the person, who asked not to be identified because negotiations are ongoing.Representatives for Thor and General Growth declined to comment on plans for the property. The building sits between 44th and 45th Streets, several blocks south of Fifth Avenue's most-sought-after addresses. The availability rate in the area has climbed to 29%, Cushman data show.Manhattan's empty storefronts will eventually be absorbed, according to Smith of Jones Lang. The way space is used may change to focus more on the experience than just the merchandise -- for example, Lululemon Athletica (LULU) offers yoga classes in its stores -- but New York will always be a magnet for retailers and shoppers, he said.""Will Fifth Avenue, which has been a multigenerational place to shop and has evolved over many, many decades, continue to be a successful place? Absolutely,"" Smith said. ""Will it look the same? No.""MORE ABOUT RETAIL PROPERTY:J.C.

Merchants including Tiffany (TIF) and Michael Kors Holdings (KORS) attributed recent weakness to the dearth of spending by travelers, who have been discouraged from visiting the U.S. by the dollar's strength and global economic uncertainty.

He said the company expects those stores to continue to weigh on the business for the rest of the year.Total sales fell 4.2% to $783.2 million, just missing analysts' $783.6 million projection.The shares slid nearly 14% to 19.75 in premarket trading. Abercrombie already had dropped 15% this year through Monday's close.

194,TIF,"Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said the case for a rate hike is stronger now, but investors weren't sure what to make of that. Pfizer (PFE) paid $14 billion for a one-drug biotech, but shares of drugs and pharma supply chain companies sold off as Mylan's (MYL) EpiPen price hikes drew outrage. Best Buy (BBY) earnings surprised investors, while dollar stores came under pressure.For the week, the Nasdaq fell 0.4%, the S&P 500 0.7% and the Dow 0.8%. The major averages are still in sideways action. Drug stocks were big movers on Pfizer's Medivation (MDVN) deal and Mylan's EpiPen furor. Dollar stores suffered heavy losses as competition from Wal-Mart (WMT) was heating up.Fed Chair Janet Yellen said at Friday's long-awaited speech that the case for an interest rate hike has ""strengthened in recent months."" That followed other modestly hawkish statements from fellow Fed policymakers. However, Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Yellen's comments were consistent with a September rate increase. He saw the possibility of two rate hikes this year. Markets had already priced a Fed move, perhaps in December, but they don't expect any quick follow-upNew-home sales soared to a 654,000 annual rate in July, by far the highest since October 2007, the Commerce Department reported. The 12% rise from June surprised economists looking for a slight dip to 580,000. Luxury homebuilder Toll Bros. (TOL) confirmed that the high end of the market is prospering, reporting a 69% jump in third-quarter earnings per share, a 23.5% rise in revenue and a strong backlog of orders. Existing-home sales fell more than expected in July, though that was from June's cycle high. But applications for loans to buy a home fell to a six-month low. Toll shares soared to a seven-month high, moving above their 200-day moving average.The generic drugmaker Mylan sold off 11.55% for the week as members of the Senate and other politicians started inquiring into its price increases on its emergency allergy drug/device EpiPen. That fueled selling in drug and biotech stocks. Mylan CEO Heather Bresch, daughter of Sen. Joe Machin, D-W.V., said only a fraction of the $608 list price makes it back to Mylan, due to all the middlemen, leading shares of Express Scripts (ESRX), CVS Health (CVS) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) to fall as well.Big pharma Pfizer agreed to buy Medivation for $14 billion in cash, snatching the cancer-drug specialist from Sanofi (SNY), which had been trying for months to acquire Medivation. Biotechs rallied Monday on the news, with BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) jumping on rumors that it was Sanofi's second choice of target. On Wednesday, Pfizer agreed to buy the antibiotics business of AstraZeneca (AZN) for $725 million plus possible future milestone and sales payments and royalties that could amount to $850 million.Oil prices may be settling into a trading range in the mid to high $40 range.

Ulta Beauty (ULTA) also raised full-year EPS guidance. But its Q3 profit range was a little cautious. Ulta shares have been on a strong run-up, so it may have been priced for perfection. Ulta shares tumbled 6% on Friday, undercutting its 50-day moving average.Workday (WDAY) reported a wider-than-expected Q2 adjusted loss.

Revenue rose 38% to $25.4 million, just beating. Talend sees Q3 losses in line with views, but it guided revenue slightly higher. Shares fell 4% after much bigger intraday losses.Best Buy (BBY) stock jumped 21% for the week to a 17-month high on better-than-expected sales and earnings for its fiscal second quarter, including a surprise increase in same-store sales. The consumer electronics retailer credited rising demand for wearable technology, appliances and home-theater systems for the increase. Video game and electronics retailer GameStop (GME) disappointed investors with in-line EPS and below-forecast sales.Discount retailers Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) suffered double-digit share price losses, as both reported second-quarter results that came up short of Wall Street expectations, with falling grocery prices and tougher competition hurting sales. Those results came as Wal-Mart is waging its own campaign to cut prices, a move that could draw more customers who have become more cautious with their spending.Meanwhile, the jeweler Tiffany (TIF) held to its full-year outlook, while its Q2 EPS beat views, helping to boost shares. However, Signet Jewelers (SIG), the parent of mall jewelers Kay, Jared and Zales, slashed its fiscal-year outlook, partly due to difficulties ""in the energy-dependent regions."" Those regions' economies have been hurt by cheap oil and other commodities.HP Inc. (HPQ) reported that its fiscal Q3 earnings per share minus one-time items jumped 37% in fiscal Q3 to 48 cents on a 4% decline in sales to $11.89 billion, both better than views. For the current quarter, the printer and PC maker sees non-GAAP EPS of 34-37 cents, vs. consensus for 41 cents. HP is reducing its printing supplies inventory and is deeply discounting printers to expand its installed base. Shares closed little changed after a brief Thursday morning sell-off.

196,TIF,"Kate Spade (KATE) plunged Wednesday after the handbag and fashion company missed estimates and slashed guidance, blaming tourism and general retail woes. The move also dragged down peers including Michael Kors (KORS) and Coach (COH) and exacerbated concerns about the consumer sector. Kate Spade's Q2 earnings per share rose 38% to 11 cents, missing estimates by 3 cents a share. The retailer topped earnings expectations in Q1 after missing the prior four quarters in a row.""Several factors contributed to our second-quarter results falling short of our expectations, the most impactful of which are the retail landscape and continuing tourist headwinds,"" CEO Craig Leavitt said in the written earnings statement.Terror fears and a rising dollar is hurting travel from Europe.The New York retailer sees full-year earnings of 63-70 cents, far below analyst consensus of 78 cents a share. It cut its 2016 revenue outlook to $1.37 billion to $1.48 billion, down from $1.39 billion-$1.41 billion, and below projections of $1.41 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Kate Spade's earnings miss and weak outlook is stoking fears that weakness in the consumer sector and a slump in tourism could be a negative economic indicator. To see how Kate Spade ranks vs. other retailers see the IBD Stock Checkup.Kate Spade shares dived more than 18% to 16.47 at the close on the stock market today. On Tuesday it fell more than 6% in sync with a broad consumer retail decline, falling below both its 10-week average and 200-day lines where it was trading on Wednesday.Rival handbag maker Michael Kors fell 2.6% to 49.02, while Coach was up slightly to 41.75.Luxury jewelry chain Tiffany (TIF), whose flagship New York location is highly dependent on tourism, was unchanged at 61.42 after falling as low as 58.76.

197,TIF,"The U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union has beaten up both U.S. and global markets, and the shakedown now presents a few medium- and long-term buying opportunities, say Jefferies analysts, who collectively chose 27 stocks that may be getting unnecessarily punished in the wake of Brexit.Here are a few highlights, including Apple (AAPL) chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Nike (NKE) and Wal-Mart (WMT):""Although it is domiciled in the Netherlands, we do not view Brexit to be materially impactful to NXPI,"" wrote Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis. ""Most semis are U.S. dollar denominated, and that is the case for NXPI, however 15% of its revenues are denominated in Euros, as is a similar level of its cost structure.""NXP shares tumbled 6.2% by the closing bell Monday on the stock market today, after sliding 8.4% Friday and slicing both its 50-day and 200-day lines. Apple shares dropped 1.4%.The big-box retailer gets about 8% of its total revenue from U.K.-based supermarket chain Asda, says analyst Daniel Binder, which is ""relatively small"" exposure. And a British recession could prompt a ""trade-down benefit"" for Asda, ""especially as it renews its emphasis on private label and executes a $1.5 billion price investment campaign.""""We think Wal-Mart's size and reliance on the U.S. consumer positions it relatively well as a safe haven for investors reducing exposure in other areas,"" he wrote.Shares dipped 0.6%.The high-end jeweler has European exposure, but Tiffany (TIF) should expand its gross margin due to lower commodity costs and a renewed push into silver accessories, among other things.Shares have ""already largely discounted weakness in Europe, where TIF generates (about) 12% of sales, but have not yet reflected the potential for improvement domestically as TIF implements its various strategic initiatives and top-line headwinds (largely related to tourism) abate,"" said Jefferies' Randal Konik.Tiffany stock lost 4.3% at the close.Young people probably don't care much about Brexit, at least, not enough to let it stop them from buying Nike, said analyst Edward Plank. The athletic apparel king's European exposure is ""well diversified"" and sportswear trends are still strong, he noted, affirming the firm's bullishness on Nike's opportunities for growth in China.Nike shares slid 1.3% to a 10-month low of 51.89. Nike reports quarterly earnings on Tuesday night.Foot Locker (FL) is another Plank pick for similar reasons. Shares fell 2.5% to 51.79.

Tiffany & Co. (TIF), Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF), HP Inc. (HPQ) and Williams-Sonoma (WSM) will announce earnings.Among the issues being watched at Exxon Mobil's meeting is a proposal led by New York’s comptroller that would force the oil giant to detail profit risks posed by climate change or laws meant to curb it. In March, the SEC said that Exxon must let shareholders vote on the proposal.Meanwhile, the Williston Basin Petroleum Conference and Expo continues in North Dakota where industry experts are expected to talk about how to survive the oil slump.

222,TIF,"Macy's (M) dismal first-quarter results and guidance Wednesday bolstered views of Amazon's (AMZN) unrelenting dominance, sending shares of the department store chain -- and most stocks in the retail and consumer sectors -- down.Companies ranging from Wal-Mart (WMT) to Michael Kors (KORS) to Nike (NKE) to Tiffany (TIF) to Williams-Sonoma (WSM), sold off. But Amazon stock rose 1.45%, hitting a fresh high.Macy's report followed Gap's (GPS) forecast late Monday of a 5% drop in Q1 same-store sales and weak earnings. The chain also noted a ""tepid macro environment for apparel retail.""""In light of AMZN and M's recent results, we feel more confident that AMZN will displace M as the #1 US Apparel retailer by '17,"" wrote Cowen analyst John Blackledge in a Wednesday note, doubling down on his assessment from last year.Macy's earnings fell 29% to 40 cents a share, 4 cents above views, on a 7% revenue decline to $5.77 billion that fell short of estimates for $5.93 billion.Same-store sales -- sales at facilities open more than a year -- at both Macy's-owned outlets and licensed operators dropped 5.6%. For Macy's-owned stores only, comps fell 6.1%.Shares plunged 15.2% on the stock market today to the lowest since December 2011. Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN), which report Thursday, fell 6% and 7%, respectively. JCPenney (JCP), which reports Friday, lost 1.85%. On Monday, it said it topped its own goal for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.IBD's Take: Is Macy's a premium or discount stock? And how does it compare to retail rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupMacy's is still in the best position among its department store peers, said Retail Metrics' Ken Perkins, despite Macy's recent struggles, although ""Amazon is doing so many things that a retailer like a Macy's, Target (TGT), Wal-Mart . . . just aren’t able or willing to do.""Adding to the sell-off was Macy's warning on weak consumer spending. Shares of companies not in direct competition with Amazon dropped as well, including McDonald's (MCD) and Panera (PNRA).""We are seeing continued weakness in consumer spending levels for apparel and related categories,"" Macy's Chief Executive Terry Lundgren said in a statement. ""In particular, our sales trend relative to expectations meaningfully slowed beginning in mid-March, and first-quarter results are below our original outlook.""The company now sees full-year per-share profit of $3.15-$3.40, down from its previous outlook of $3.80-$3.90 and far below Wall Street estimates for $3.80 a share. It also expects 2016 same-store sales on an owned-plus-licensed basis to fall 3%-4%, vs. prior outlook for a 1% decline.""We are not counting on the consumer to spend more,"" Lundgren said, so the department store is ""working harder to give customers more reasons to buy from us by delivering outstanding style, quality and value.""For the second straight year, tourist spending is falling in the double digits, he said, and noted a slowdown in some ""center core"" categories. But he also said that the first quarter is a ""relatively small portion of the total year"" and sees a chance to play catch-up over the next three quarters.Still, Macy's isn't exactly the next Sears Holdings (SHLD), which has seen years of falling sales and store closures.""That's a leap,"" laughed Perkins, though he also said the department store's current struggles are more than just a bump in the road.But like Sears, Macy's is evaluating real-estate proposals for joint ventures or similar arrangements. Macy's has been under pressure to spin off its real estate holdings to raise cash.

223,TIF,"Consumer sentiment unexpectedly fell for a third straight month in March, according to the latest University of Michigan survey, as Americans suspect that the era of cheap gas is ending. That's a bad sign for consumer spending from Apple (AAPL) iPhones to Tiffany (TIF) jewelry.The Michigan sentiment index's flash reading was 90, down 1.7 points from the February's final reading of 91.7, January's 92 and December's 92.6. It's the lowest reading since October. Wall Street expected a flash March reading on 92.2.The index hit 95.9 in April, the highest since January 2007, but quickly retreated to 87.2 in September.The survey measures consumers' attitudes toward current economic conditions and future expectations. The current conditions gauge fell 1.2 points to 105.6, while an expectations measure declined 1.9 points to 80.""Consumer confidence eased in early March due to increased concerns about prospects for the economy as well as the expectation that gas prices would inch upward during the year ahead,"" said Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist.But the connection between consumer confidence and consumer spending isn't always clear.Retail sales have fallen in the first two months of 2016. Much of that reflects cheaper gasoline, but shoppers haven't rushed to spend the extra cash. Electronics sales have retreated, with Apple iPhone sales declining this quarter and Apple Watch sales failing to excite. (Apple may hope for some sales boost as it reveals new products, including a new smaller phone at Monday's product event.)Auto sales have held up well, but General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F) remain down for the year and below their 200-day moving averages. GM, Ford and other automakers increasingly have relied on subprime and ever-longer long terms to boost demand, while cheap gas has fueled low-mileage, high-margin SUV sales.Meanwhile, Kohl's (KSS) issued a big profit warning, while Macy's (M) has shut some stores. But the Retail-Department Stores stock group has been one of IBD's strongest industry groups so far in 2016.Tiffany shares rose 2.1% in afternoon trade on the stock market today after the luxury jeweler reported declining earnings that still topped views. But Tiffany warned of more weak profit ahead, as tourists spend less.The rebounding stock market could fuel consumer spending, at least among higher-income households with large portfolios.

225,TIF,"A combination of the ""reverse wealth effect,"" U.S. political uncertainty, a strong dollar and a challenged China market led Cowen & Co. to downgrade luxury retailers Tiffany & Co. (TIF), Restoration Hardware (RH) and Swiss-based Compagnie Financiere Richemont.""We see risk the reverse wealth effect will slow high-end consumer spending in 2016 due to the S&P 500's negative start to the year (-6% YTD) and -1% return in 2015 after 3 straight years of (positive double-digit) gains,"" wrote Cowen's Oliver Chen. Plus, increased talk about raising taxes for the wealthy during the election cycle could curb high-end spending.Chen also said that the stronger U.S. dollar should continue to hit foreign tourism spending; he cited concern ""for the ripple effects to global luxury spending"" as a result of the economic slowdown in China.Cowen downgraded Tiffany to market perform and cut its price target to 70 from 75, on ""near-term caution that volatile tourism flows and global macro challenges will not be offset by TIF's improved & innovative product."" However, he noted that he still had faith in Tiffany's global long-term story.Restoration Hardware also received a downgrade to market perform ""on risk to 2016 estimates from a slowdown in high-end consumer spending, continuing promo pressure indicating a more challenged environment & likely lack of valuation upside."" The upscale furniture seller also discounted aggressively in December and January. Chen said that the company still has ""significant runway,"" however.""In our view, the biggest source of risk to 2016 could likely come from slowing revenue as the affluent consumer pulls back on home spending due to the reverse wealth effect, political uncertainty with the US presidential election, and late-cycle housing recovery,"" he wrote.Another downgrade to market perform was handed to Richemont, the parent company of Cartier, Montblanc, Piaget and other luxury brands, on exposure to Hong Kong, the U.S. and ""weakness in watches."" Richemont trades on the SIX Swiss Exchange.""We continue to prefer stocks positioned to benefit from a healthier low-end consumer in '16,"" wrote Chen.Last month, he upgraded off-price retailer Ross Stores (ROST) to outperform from market perform, calling it a ""prudent retail holding in 2016"" and an ""un-Amazonable"" retail stock. Amazon (AMZN) continues to present a challenge to many traditional brick-and-mortar retailers as they try to adapt to the shift to online and omnichannel shopping.Tiffany shares closed up 1.4%. Restoration Hardware shares fell 3.5%. Respective rivals Signet Jewelers (SIG) rose 4% while Williams-Sonoma (WSM) ended flat.

298,TIF,"Signet Jewelers (SIG) and Tiffany (TIF) reported disappointing third-quarter results Tuesday, reflecting regional slowdowns in luxury purchases and sluggish tourist spending amid heightened economic anxiety.Signet Jewelers missed on all key fronts, with weaker sales at its higher-end Jared stores weighing on results. It also sees Q4 EPS of $3.40-$3.60, below views for $3.59, and comp sales growth of 3.5%-5%.Third-quarter same-store sales rose 3.3%, aided largely by bridal sales, but that figure was shy of forecasts for 3.5% and a slowdown from a year ago. Same-store sales for Jared fell 2.7% but rose 7.1% at Kay.Revenue, as well, missed expectations, growing 3.3% to $1.22 billion, shy of views for $1.23 billion. Earnings per share jumped 57.1% to 33 cents, but that still came up short of estimates for 39 cents.CEO Mark Light said the company was ""currently experiencing an encouraging start to November particularly at Jared and Zales.""But shares closed down 4.1% on the stock market today on the disappointing results.Adjusted gross margin of 30.6% was flat from a year ago and was hurt by the credit mix resulting from softer sales at Jared compared with Kay.""As Jared typically has higher-credit-quality customers than Kay, this led to greater net bad-debt expense,"" Signet said. ""This mix shift unfavorably impacted gross margin by approximately $4.5 million.""The company's e-commerce sales grew 12.7% to $50.5 million, even though the company has largely grown in spite of e-commerce, with most customers opting to buy expensive jewelry in person at stores.Meanwhile, the stronger dollar, broader consumer anxiety and weaker foreign tourist spending in the Americas cut into Tiffany's Q3 results, prompting the company to now see fiscal year EPS falling 5%-10%, worse than a prior forecast for a 2%-5% decline as well as consensus views for a 4% decrease.Q3 EPS dropped 8% to 70 cents, below estimates for 75 cents. Sales fell 2% to $938 million, missing, but rose 4% on a constant-currency basis. Same-store sales rose 1% on a constant currency basis, but fell 5% otherwise.Comps in the Americas region fell 9%, the company's largest by sales, dragged by ""sharply lower foreign tourist spending in the U.S., which management attributes to the strong U.S. dollar"".Japan was the only segment to show a same-store sales increase on a GAAP reported basis, up 9%, on stronger tourism and demand from native shoppers, the company said.But investors and analysts seemed to be OK with those numbers. Shares reversed earlier losses to finish up 3.6% Tuesday.""3Q wasn't great and 4Q guidance was reduced but it is not the extreme weakness we believe many had been fearing,"" Citigroup analyst Paul Lejuez said in a note, according to Barrons. Cowen & Co., meanwhile, praised the company's ability to keep costs in line.Tiffany in general is more exposed to the ups and downs of foreign tourism spending than Signet. Tiffany gets around a quarter of U.S. sales from foreign tourists.Tourism spending on shopping in the U.S. was estimated to fall in the third quarter, RBC Capital Markets noted last week, with more Chinese tourists, whom by some measures account for a third of worldwide luxury spending, going to Japan and Europe.The terrorist attacks in Paris this month could also discourage spending, Cowen noted last week.Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.

312,TIF,"Stocks closed mixed to lower on Friday — on what was the slowest trading day of the year…but did you really expect anything different?  With the US mkts only open for 3 ½ hrs and no real catalyst to push it higher - it would have been hard for it to do anything other than what it did.All the hype over Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, and Cyber Monday continue to cause a bit of concern as investors/traders began to wonder aloud — what it all means. Will the news on Saturday morning suggest that Black Friday was a dud?  Have all the ‘pre-Black Friday sales’ taken the luster off?  Are retailers sending the signal that they are nervous and if they are, then how will that translate to traders/investors on Monday morning? Well — in a bit of 'forewarning' consumer discretionary and retailers led the way lower on Friday.  Wal-Mart  (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), Tiffany's (TIF), GAP (GPS), JC Penny  (JCP), Macy's (M),Best Buy  (BBY) etc…..all putting in weak performances ahead of the big shopping weekend as traders placed their bets.On Saturday morning — the papers announced the news — No, not the fights to get into the stores, or the lines of people who camped out just to be first in line,  but rather :  'Black Friday — Not so Black', 'Black Friday Sales Slip from Year Prior', 'Black Friday Store Sales Fall as Americans Buy More Online' and 'Black Friday Was a Bust!' SunTrust Robinson Humphrey summed it up by saying:  ""We believe that Thanksgiving shopping was a bust""…. but is that really what happened?  Is it just that the shopping moved from physical to virtual?  Consumers no longer feeling the need to get up and go out.....but rather sit home in their 'skivvies', open up their computers and shop online...spending some $4.4 bil online over the weekend.......in fact this morning's WSJ lays it out clearly: ""Online Shopping Surges on Black Friday Weekend - online shopping, especially via mobile phones, surges, showing how buying habits have changed"" What a contrast to years past? I mean who remembers the look of terrorized sales clerks as throngs of crazed, almost hysterical,  shoppers pushed their way into the stores at midnight? So what’s the consensus? Seems to me that it was a lot of wasted time and talk about Black Friday..... and since all of these 'sales' were happening 'online' as well as in the store in the week's prior to Black Friday and will surely happen in the weeks following Black Friday — why then should anyone rush out and shop on Black Friday?  What is the advantage?  Apparently Zero! The question then becomes - What happens to the margins?  Yes - we are told that sales rose 14%  y/y but at what cost?   Will retailers crush margins in order to entice the consumer to part with their dollars?  And then what does that really mean for the investment thesis?  Is that Bullish?  What is important to remember though — is that the shopping season is not made up of any one day…..it is the culmination of shopping that takes place from early  October — right thru Christmas and then it is the shopping that takes place on Christmas day thru year end when retailers slash the prices of anything that remains to get it 'off the shelf'.  So before anyone goes and makes an investment decision based on Black Friday — remember — Black Friday was a day created by the industry to create hype and excitement — in the end — the results will be what they are…..I am just not sure it will be what the retailers want them to be - but we shall see.OK — back to the mkts…on Friday we saw China get slammed (again) — down some +5% as concern over the slide in industrial profits once again takes center stage causing some analysts to ring the alarm about a deteriorating Chinese economy.  Add in the newly announced probe into some of China's largest brokerages and you had the perfect backdrop for investors to hit the SELL button.   This morning we saw a repeat of that story.... Asian mkts continued to come under pressure overnight as this story builds....   At one point China was off another 3.5% in early trading only to recoup those losses and end the day marginally higher.  The volatility in the Chinese mkts illustrates the difficulty that Chinese officials face as they try to transform their economy and allow the mkts to price in real risk as the gov't attempts to withdraw support.    Japan -0.69%,  Hong Kong -0.33%,  China +0.26%  and ASX -0.69%.In Europe this morning we are seeing those mkts flat to slightly higher as investors there discount the negative moves out of Asia and begin the week anticipating more stimulus to be announced by the ECB on Thursday. The  Eurostoxx index - an index of 50 blue chip stocks that represent the 'super sector' leaders from 12  Eurozone countries -  is up 2% this month and it is up 17%  off  the September lows as optimism builds over the strength of the Eurozone economy as well as the potential for more Kool Aid offered up by the ECB.  ECB Pres Draghi is expected to announce even more stimulus by pushing the cost of parking money at the ECB even higher ( rates to go further into NEGATIVE territory) as he tries to force the banks to lend vs. hoard. FTSE -0.04%, CAC 40 +0.67%, DAX  +0.97%, Eurostoxx  +0.76%, Spain +0.98% and Italy +0.62%.  Now US futures have been all over the place, down nearly 9 pts in early pre-mkt trading and have now swung back to positive territory - currently up  3 pts at 2093 -  as traders/investors return from the long holiday weekend. Get ready for 'macro data overload' as US investors/traders get hit with a slew of data.In addition  we will hear from Fed Chair Yellen as she addresses the Economic Club of Washington on Wednesday and the Congressional Joint Economic Committee on Thursday -  Expect traders to listen intently to what she has to say. What does that mean for rates? By now — everyone should realize that it is NOT about the December 16/17th meeting any longer — it is now about what happens next year.Will she indicate that further rate hikes are in store in quick succession in the new year? Is she setting up to be more aggressive in the months ahead?   In addition - watch for the  'FED Bus Tour' featuring a range of FED officials as they pontificate over the state of the economy and monetary policy.Tomorrow we will get Chicago's Evans, and Fed Gov Brainard . Wednesday gives us Atlanta's Lockhart and San Fran's Williams. Thursday brings us Cleveland's Loretta Mester and Fed Vice Chair Fischer....and not to be outdone - Friday will play host to Philly's Harker, St. Louis's Bullard and Minneapolis's Kocherlatkota.Now this week brings a ton of macro data: Today brings us Chicago PMI - exp of 54, Dallas Fed Survey of -10  and Pending Home Sales  of 1%. Tomorrow we get Manf PMI of 52.6, Construction Spending of +0.6%, ISM Manf of 50.5. Wednesday - ADP Employment of +190k....But the KICKER is on Friday when we get the final NFP report before the next FED meeting — expectations are for +200k jobs to be created — which would be down significantly from last month — but strong enough for her to say:  ""And we’re OFF!""(We would have to see a number sub 100k for there to be any concern that she will go into another holding pattern - not happening....)Stay tuned - it is sure to be a week of volatility and excitement.

The stock has also wiped out an 11% gain past a 52.08 buy point from a deep cup base cleared Monday, marking a sell signal. Rival BitAuto (BITA) dropped 5% in heavy trading, putting it on pace to end a three-session win streak. But the stock remains well extended from a 47.03 buy point from an earlier base.

416,TIF,"Retailers hit a rough patch in March as severe winter weather, an economic speed bump and merchandise delays resulting from the West Coast port disruptions dragged down results, leading to the month's sales gains falling below views.
"
417,TIF,"Even amid the headwinds, L Brands (LB), Stein Mart (SMRT), Cato Corp. (CATO) and PriceSmart (PSMT) came shining through with same-store sales that sailed past views, according to data out Thursday.
"
418,TIF,"March sales at stores open at least a year rose 0.5% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. Analysts expected a 1% gain.
"
419,TIF,"The results were weighed down by a big miss from warehouse club giant Costco Wholesale (COST), Perkins says. The company saw March same-store sales slide 2% from a year earlier, short of views for a 0.3% decline.
"
420,TIF,"That was the typical top retail performer's first decline in monthly same-store sales since August 2009, Perkins says.
"
421,TIF,"Fuel And The Freeze
"
422,TIF,"Costco's core U.S. same-store sales, ex gas and the effects of foreign exchange rates, were up a ""much healthier"" 4%, said Perkins. Still, they were below views for a 5.5% gain.
"
423,TIF,"""Costco was a huge drag on the month,"" Perkins told IBD. ""Part of that was attributable to them having lower year-over-year gas prices, and foreign currency translations also weighed on their sales.""
"
424,TIF,"The month's results were a mixed bag.
"
425,TIF,"Harsh winter weather conditions in parts of the U.S. such as the Northeast ""weighed on sales"" in those areas, said Perkins.
"
426,TIF,"Consumers weren't in the mood to buy seasonal goods like patio furniture and bathing suits or apparel when they were ""freezing,"" he said.
"
427,TIF,"But Jacksonville, Fla.-based Stein Mart and Charlotte, N.C.-based Cato, located in the South, where the weather was better, posted double-digit gains in March same-store sales, he adds.
"
428,TIF,"""Weather clearly played a big role overall (on the March results), both positive and negative,"" Perkins said.
"
429,TIF,"Another factor weighing on March sales was a slowdown in the economy in the first quarter, he adds. Perkins notes retailers also missed sales opportunities because of delays from late shipments due to the West Coast labor dispute.
"
430,TIF,"""Overall I would not read too much into the March numbers,"" Perkins said. ""The jobs market stands on pretty solid footing, and with warmer temperatures I would expect May, June and July sales to show significant improvement from the first quarter.""
"
431,TIF,"April Outlook
"
432,TIF,"This month is apt to be weak, Perkins says, mainly because the early Easter this year, on April 5, pushed holiday-related sales into March.
"
433,TIF,"The month's standouts are L Brands (which owns Victoria's Secret), value-priced apparel seller Cato and regional discount retail operator Stein Mart.
"
434,TIF,"L Brands posted a 9% increase in same-store sales for March, topping views for a 5.8% gain. The company's same-store sales for the month ""were positively impacted"" by the earlier Easter this year by about 3% to 4%, it said in a press release.
"
435,TIF,"Cato saw a 12% rise in the month's sales, sailing past estimates for a 3.8% gain. Cato also got a lift from the early Easter shift, the company said in a press release. But it expects April sales will be ""unfavorably impacted"" by the shift.

"
446,TIF,"Michael Niemira, chief economist at the research firm Retail Economist, calculates March same-store sales rose 0.2% vs. a year earlier.
"
447,TIF,"He called the month's sales performance ""dismal.""

"
449,TIF,"He expects April same-store sales to rise 1% vs. a year earlier amid tough comparisons with last year, when April same-store sales rose 6.2%.
"
450,TIF,"But overall, retailers should see better days, Perkins says.
"
451,TIF,"""I don't think you can extrapolate where the consumer stands from the March results and the related speed bumps (during the month),"" said Perkins. ""Consumer confidence is near the cycle high, gas prices remain low, interest rates remain low and the labor market is on solid footing. I think those factors should bode well for better economic growth in the second and third quarters, which should lead to better retail sales.""
"
452,TIF,"Still, he cautions that the vast majority of lower- and midincome consumers are not really seeing rising pay.
"
453,TIF,"""The ability for consumers to spend is still tied to significant wage gains, which haven't materialized,"" he said.
"
454,TIF,"Perkins said the high-end consumer is ""driving the lion's share of spending.""
"
455,TIF,"And they're buying a lot of cars. Perkins says the auto segment is doing better than other retail segments. That bodes well for auto parts retailers such as O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), AutoZone (AZO) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP).
"
456,TIF,"High-end retailers such as Tiffany & Co. (TIF) and Kate Spade (KATE) are among the luxury retailers Perkins cites as doing well. He says off-price apparel retail operators such as Ross Stores (ROST) and TJX Cos. (TJX) are also faring well.
"
457,TIF,"Niemira, looking toward the summer, expects apparel will be one of the stronger retail categories, driven by ""pent-up demand.""

"
606,TIF,"In addition, Perkins added, ""the economy has been unable to generate enough well-paying jobs to generate a higher level of consumer spending. That's had an impact on many middle- and lower-income consumers. Their wages are stagnant or in decline.""

609,TIF,"Williams-Sonoma and Restoration Hardware have had ""standout results,"" Thomas says. But chains that are more exposed to low-income consumers — such as rent-to-own operators Rent-A-Center (RCII) and Aaron's (AAN) — have had a ""fair amount of weakness this year.""
"
610,TIF,"The low-end consumer also has been faced with a ""litany of small cost increases that really add up,"" Thomas says. These include a reduction in food stamp benefits and unemployment benefits.
"
611,TIF,"Luxury retailers, meantime, have done their fair share to lure consumers.
"
612,TIF,"Take Williams-Sonoma, whose lineup of retail operations includes Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn and West Elm. It has seen double-digit profit growth in all but one of the past nine quarters.
"
613,TIF,"Thomas says one reason for the company's strong results ""comes down to their omnichannel model, which it does better than just about anyone.""
"
614,TIF,"""Omnichannel"" refers to the fact that each of the company's brands sells through its own stores, online and through their catalogs.
"
615,TIF,"""Williams-Sonoma has omnichannel in their DNA dating back to their heritage as a catalog business, which has translated very well into being an online business as well as a brick-and-mortar retailer,"" Thomas said.
"
616,TIF,"In a July report initiating coverage on Williams-Sonoma with a ""buy"" rating, Nomura analyst Jessica Schoen Mace said the company's ""numerous store formats, strong retail brands and established e-commerce presence (44% of the business) should result in continued market-share growth both in the U.S. and internationally.""

618,TIF,"Real Estate Restoration
"
619,TIF,"Restoration Hardware has also been a standout, with a long run of double-digit or better earnings and sales growth. The company is undergoing a real estate transformation that involves scrapping some smaller stores in favor of bigger ones, including Full Line Design Galleries of 25,000 to 60,000 square feet.
"
620,TIF,"As part of the transformation, Restoration Hardware is also revamping its supply chain and system platform. These initiatives have helped the company deliver industry-leading same-store sales gains.
"
621,TIF,"But times have been tough on the discount front — so tough that even the world's biggest retailer, Wal-Mart, has seen several quarters of declining U.S. same-store sales.
"
622,TIF,"Company officials hope a management shakeup will help turn things around. On July 24, Wal-Mart announced that its U.S. CEO, Bill Simon, is stepping down and being succeeded by Greg Foran, president and CEO of Wal-Mart Asia.
"
623,TIF,"Wal-Mart's core customer ""has been under pressure since the recovery,"" Perkins said. ""It's being forced to broaden its online effort to bring in more customers, and to expand its (small-format) Neighborhood Market stores to capture some of the business they've been losing to Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General.""
"
624,TIF,"Perkins points out that Simon noted just last month that the middle-to-low-end consumer has not seen much recovery.
"
625,TIF,"Deep Discount Powerhouse
"
626,TIF,"Meanwhile, Wal-Mart might be facing more competition. Deep discounter Dollar Tree, which sells everything for $1 or less, announced on July 28 that it had agreed to buy struggling Family Dollar in an $8.5 billion deal that would create a new No. 1 player in the deep discount space and create a 13,000-store retail powerhouse.
"
627,TIF,"The merger should result in improvements at Family Dollar, says Wedbush analyst Joan Storms. ""It clearly would improve its merchandise assortment.

"
633,TIF,"A blue box tied with a white ribbon is synonymous with Tiffany — the storied emporium from which dazzling jewels are bought and an acclaimed novella and Oscar-winning movie wrought.As for the true saga of Tiffany & Co. (TIF), it's as compelling as any jewel, novella or movie — and ongoing. Tiffany employs more than 9,900, with 290 stores in 25 countries, according to Mark Aaron, the company's vice president of investor relations.Tiffany & Co.'s flagship store on the corner of New York's Fifth Avenue and 57th Street opened in 1940 and it secures 12% of the company's global sales, according to the New York Times.Meanwhile, Tiffany shares have been on a 430% stock market run since 2009.Behind the sparkle is a story of struggle, discovery, risk taking and a passion for quality, luxury and craftsmanship. All from a visionary with the celebrated last name — Charles Lewis Tiffany.Tiffany (1812-1902) founded this glittering jewelry and silver store — now 177 years old — while helping shape the American ideal of luxury.Glittering Retail""Charles Tiffany fundamentally grasped the idea that shopping and retailing should be an entertaining experience,"" Linda Buckley, vice president of global relations for Tiffany & Co., told IBD. ""It should be fun, make you feel better and fulfill a shopper's dream. Tiffany saw his store as a way to add beauty to a person's life, and he had an innate sense that in 19th century America a growing affluent class could be reached with high-quality products.""Tiffany's journey, like so many brilliant 19th century entrepreneurs — think Dr. Scholl, Adolphus Busch, Oscar Mayer — was not an overnight success. He required a persistent ambition.The son of a textile manufacturer, Charles was born and raised in Killingly, in the northeast corner of Connecticut. He wasted little time getting a good feel for money, running the family mill store by age 15.Buckley notes that as Tiffany grew up in Killingly, he was close to Bridgeport, Conn., the home base of P.T. Barnum, the showman and businessman celebrated for his colorful marketing.""Undoubtedly, Barnum influenced Tiffany,"" said Buckley, ""and we clearly see it in how Tiffany developed his own set of promotional skills and its effect on key business ventures.""Two centuries later, he's Killingly's most celebrated resident.""We still rave about him,"" Marilyn Labbe, executive director of the Killingly Historical & Genealogical Society, told IBD.As he turned 25, Tiffany looked to the big time: New York City.He saw a chance to make serious money with a store, so he borrowed $1,000 — worth $25,000 now — from his father and, with friend Eben Young, founded Tiffany & Young. The shop sold stationery and fancy goods such as jewelry, silverware, bronze curiosities from India, Chinese porcelain and the latest French accessories.On opening day — Sept. 14, 1837 — sales totaled less than $5.Tiffany & Young limped along from there. Then came 1841, with marriage to Harriet Young, sister of his partner, Eben Young, on the way to six children. Also that year came a third business partner, J.L. Ellis.With a new name — Tiffany, Young & Ellis — Tiffany perfected the marketing tips he'd picked up from Barnum.Take the way Tiffany's profited from France's 1848 revolution and the fall of King Louis Philippe. Buckley notes how aristocrats who had benefited from the king suddenly ran for their lives, needed cash, looked to load their diamonds and crashed the Continent's jewelry market.Tiffany pounced. He persuaded his partners to pour profit from their fledgling business into diamonds — marking the first appearance of major gemstones on a mass scale in America.Tiffany & Co. went on to sell those diamonds at great profit, rocketing the firm beyond solvency.Further PR glory came when the press noted the carat-topping deal and crowned Charles Tiffany the King of Diamonds.""That move established Charles Tiffany,"" Buckley maintains.Mining For MoreIn 1851, Tiffany saw gold in the silver market.To meet Victorian society's rising demand for the bright metal, he teamed with New York silversmith John Moore and established the company's design and silver manufacturing heritage.Tiffany instructed Moore to make the silverware on par with English sterling — 92.5% silver and 7.5% base metals — a standard that America eventually adopted.That decade, Tiffany's firm shone as one of the world's leading jewelers and silversmiths.Also in 1851, Tiffany opened a shop in Paris, opening the door to establishing an international market, according to the Killingly Historical Society's files.Young and Ellis retired in 1853. Tiffany purchased their shares and renamed the firm Tiffany & Co.Tiffany's pursuit of excellence continued.Knowing in 1858 that a telegraph cable was winding its way under the Atlantic Ocean, he bought 20 miles of extra metal that the financier Cyrus Field was tossing in the trash heap.Tiffany cut it into 4-inch brass for paperweights, canes, umbrella handles and watch charms. A sensation resulted on the day the souvenirs went on sale. The clamoring crowds, vying for a slice of history, had to be controlled by police.Still another Tiffany PR coup came at 1867's Paris Exposition.""In America during the mid-19th century, said Buckley, ""Tiffany established dominance in the silver market, but the store was as yet little known in Europe. But at the Paris World's Fair, Tiffany challenged the Europeans and received the grand prize for silver, the first time an American design house was so honored by a foreign jury.""Rock-Solid MoveThen came another smart move.In 1877 one of the world's largest yellow diamonds was discovered in South Africa. Tiffany leapt again, buying the 287.42-carat stone for $18,000, which translates to $385,000 today.Acclaimed gemologist George Kunz supervised the stonecutting of the Tiffany Diamond into a cushion-shaped gem with a final weight of 128.4 carats and an unprecedented 82 facets. ""It sparkles as if lit by an inner flame,"" said Buckley.Audrey Hepburn famously wore the yellow gem in publicity stills for the 1961 film ""Breakfast at Tiffany's.""Buckley estimates the stone has the height and width of a quarter. It's on display at Tiffany's flagship store in Manhattan.Such Tiffany brilliance drew global plaudits. His company served as the royal jeweler to the crowned heads of Europe, as well as the Ottoman emperor, the czar of Russia and the shah of Iran.Tiffany died at age 90, leaving an estate worth $35 million — worth a billion today. Louis Tiffany, Charles' second son and heir to the business, became the firm's first official design director in 1902, immediately following his father's death.Louis established the Tiffany Artistic Jewelry unit, where precious objects were manufactured.Art historian Antonio Masi said of the son: ""Louis Comfort Tiffany was an internationally acclaimed American designer, a leader of the Art Nouveau Movement, who was revered for his whimsical jewelry and stained-glass creations. Though gone more than 80 years, his artistry moves and uplifts us still.""That style came from Charles Tiffany's brand, of whom Buckley said: ""We know when we see a blue box tied with a white bow that the same care and quality goes into that box, no matter what's in it.""

Signet soared nearly 8% Thursday after it beat views and raised its forecast.Blended earnings growth for the luxury retail category was 2% in Q2, according to figures from Retail Metrics. For home furnishings, it was negative 2%.Though Williams-Sonoma's earnings in Q2 were in line with views, same-store brand sales decelerated sharply from the first quarter, especially at Pottery Barn. Inventories also increased at a faster rate than sales, noted Wells Fargo analyst Matt Nemer.The company also promoted heavily during the quarter, analysts noted, particularly at its two largest brands, Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn.After a 0.4% jump in June, personal spending in July fell a surprising 0.1%, according to figures released Friday morning.Related: Luxury Watch: Tiffany Shines, Williams-Sonoma Cracks.

The bottom line surged more than 50% year over year, courtesy of higher sales, greater operating margin and reduced effective tax-rate.Net sales came in at $1,033.2 million, up almost 15% from $899.6 million in the prior-year quarter. The reported figure also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $960.7 million. Notably, the top line gained from sales improvement across all product categories and most regions. Also, the company’s comparable-store sales (comps) went up 10%. In constant currencies, worldwide net sales rose 11% and comps inched higher by 7%.Let’s Delve DeeperBy geographic segments, sales in the Americas rose 9% to $425 million, while comps increased by an equivalent rate. In the Asia-Pacific region, sales improved 28% to $329 million, while comps grew 14%. In Japan, sales went up 17% to $151 million, while comps jumped 14%. Sales in Europe came in at $107 million, up 13% and comps rose 2%. However, other sales came in at $22 million, down 21%.Gross margin expanded 90 basis points to 63% in the quarter under review, on the back of sales leverage on fixed costs, along with decline in diamonds wholesale sales. Operating margin increased 320 basis points to 19.8%, courtesy of improved gross margin and sales leverage on SG&A costs.Store UpdateIn the first quarter, this designer and retailer of fine jewelry opened one company-operated store and shuttered two locations. As of April 30, 2018, the company operated 314 stores (123 in the Americas, 87 in Asia-Pacific, 54 in Japan, 46 in Europe, and four in the U.A.E.). Management now anticipates gross retail square footage growth of 2% on the back of eight openings, 15 or more relocations and two closings.Other Financial DetailsTiffany ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,211.9 million and total long-term debt of $882.9 million.In the quarter, the company repurchased approximately 407,000 shares at an average cost of about $99 per share. Concurrently, management announced a new share repurchase plan, which authorizes buybacks worth up to $1 billion. This program will replace Tiffany’s existing buyback plan that was announced in January 2016. Also, the new program will terminate on January 31, 2022. The company incurred capital expenditures of $37 billion during the quarter.For fiscal 2018, management expects net cash from operating activities of roughly $700 million, free cash flow of at least $400 million and capital expenditures of roughly $280 million.Other Developments & GuidanceManagement remains impressed with the solid start to the year and remains focused on delivering sustainable improvements in comps, operating margin and earnings. The company plans to achieve this by working on its six strategic initiatives.To this end, Tiffany remains focused on evolving its brand, enhancing omnichannel experience, solidifying position in core markets, increasing operating model efficiency and enriching overall organization. The company remains committed to elevating in-store experience and replenishing product portfolio. Focus on renewing product portfolio is evident from recent launch of PAPER FLOWERS, which comprises solid collection in diamonds and platinum.Management also revealed intentions to increase investments in various areas from second quarter onward, in a drive to reach its long-term growth potential. This is expected to lead to a considerable rise in SG&A costs in fiscal 2018. Consequently, operating margin is expected to decline from the year-ago level, though improved gross margin on account of leverage on fixed costs and lower diamond costs is expected to provide some respite.Raised FY18 View Nevertheless, management now anticipates fiscal 2018 net sales to increase by a high-single-digit percentage on a reported and constant-exchange-rate basis. The guidance reflects an improvement from a mid-single-digit percentage increase expected earlier.Comps for the fiscal year are now expected to rise mid-to-high-single-digit, up from low-to-mid-single-digit projected earlier. Consequently, management raised its net earnings per share guidance. Net earnings per share are now envisioned in a range of $4.50-$4.70, compared with the prior range of $4.25-$4.45.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

728,TIF," Retail has been one of the hottest sectors in 2018, up 13% for the year versus a return of just over 3% for the S&P 500. High-end retailers have performed especially well as low unemployment and a generally strong economy have left consumers with more disposable income.(read about luxury retailers here>>)Some of those gains have come at the expense of discount retailers as shifting consumer tastes and means have customers looking for higher priced goods and a better shopping experience.Big Lots Inc (BIG  -  Free Report) is the nation’s largest retailer of closeout goods, selling a wide range of home products - primarily furniture and other household goods. In an otherwise strong retail marketplace, they have significantly underperformed the industry with shares declining 26% in 2018.The catalyst for the declining shares has been disappointing revenues, earnings and guidance.In their Q1 earnings report on June 1st, Big Lots reported gross sales of $1.27B, considerably lower than the $1.3B in revenues during the same period in 2017. The company reported earnings of $0.95/share, badly missing their own previous guidance of $1.15/share to $1.22/share.Bog Lots also closed several retail stores during the quarter and declined to buy back any shares under its authorized share repurchase program, even as the share price declined.The company’s future guidance didn't include any better news with both sales and earnings predicted to be essentially flat for the next quarter and full year 2018. At the end of a record earnings season - especially in the retail sector - the miss and flat guidance had investors running for the exits.Seven out of seven analysts represented in the Zacks Consensus Estimate subsequently lowered their estimates for 2018 to an average of $4.57/share, down from $4.88/share 30 days ago. Big Lots is now a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).In an environment where many retailers are beating estimates, opening new outlets and raising guidance, it doesn’t make sense for investors to stick with a company like Big Lots, which is barely treading water.Retail investors should take a look instead at luxury options like Tiffany (TIF  -  Free Report) or The Movado Group (MOV  -  Free Report), both Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.  Click for details >>

729,TIF,"With the U.S. economy humming along, unemployment at historic lows, and Consumer Confidence at an 18-year high, Americans are spending a chunk of their discretionary income on luxury goods, boosting the earnings of Movado, Burberry Group and Tiffany & Co.Swiss Quality TimepiecesWith a wide range of watches, jewelry and accessories at multiple price points, The Movado Group (MOV  -  Free Report) sells its own brands – Movado, ESQ and Ebel - and also manufactures goods under licensing deals with other fashion brands like Coach, Hugo Boss and Lacoste.

734,TIF,"Industry experts believe that the luxury goods market is likely to remain healthy, courtesy of steady economic growth, higher consumer confidence and rising disposable income. Given this scenario, it will be wise to focus on some luxury goods’ stocks. Here we have highlighted one such stock Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report), which holds a significant position in the world jewelry market due to its distinctive brand appeal.This designer, manufacturer and retailer of jewelry and other items has displayed an impressive run in the bourses. A glimpse of Tiffany’s share price movement reveals that it has increased roughly 28% in the past six months comfortably outperforming the industry’s growth of 22%. Further, the stock is hovering close to its 52-week high of $137.97. There is no reason why this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock cannot breach that mark in the near term.Tiffany remains focused on evolving its brand, enhancing omnichannel experience, solidifying position in core markets, increasing operating model efficiency and enriching overall organization. The company remains committed to elevating in-store experience and replenishing product portfolio.Focus on renewing product portfolio is evident from recent launch of PAPER FLOWERS, which comprises solid collection in diamonds and platinum. The company is also looking at other revenue generating avenues, and this includes expansion of its watch business. The company also intends to expand distribution network by adding stores in both new and existing markets.The company is steadily introducing new jewelry designs, new watch collection and fragrance, and additional jewelry SKUs. It also introduced “build-your-own program” on its website under which customers are allowed to personalize their own charm bracelets. Further, Tiffany is allowing customers to personalize their ring.

735,TIF,"We hope everyone has recovered this morning from excessive dosages of l-tryptophan and starch-heavy diets yesterday. Today is Black Friday, of course — the day retailers traditionally turn a profit on their ledgers, switching from red ink to black. Massive discounts and promotions from retailers big and small mark this beginning of holiday season, helping shoppers work off their extra calories in getting a jump on holiday gift-giving season.Stock market participants will be paying extra attention to how companies like Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Tiffany’s (TIF  -  Free Report) perform in their fiscal fourth quarters, especially as Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) online juggernaut continues relatively unabated. Can companies like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) beat back Amazon’s extensive stock and ease of delivery? That, as it has been the past several years, looks to be the dominant narrative.Otherwise, we’ve got a shortened trading day today, and volume is expected to be light. Futures are up aheads of today’s opening bell, but we’re not seeing earnings reports from any large companies today; indeed, Q3 earnings season is effectively over but for a small handful of S&P 500 participants yet to report this quarter. However, we may be seeing a new string of gainful weeks beginning — after a strong Tuesday that brought a fresh wave of new all-time market highs, if the markets close today in the green, and there’s nothing on the horizon in coming weeks to provide headwinds toward further upside.News of the WorldThat said, following German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s failed coalition between her conservative CDU party and more liberal political factions, her polling among German citizens has fallen precipitously. Merkel is attempting to reconcile parliamentary power with the rival Social Democrats party, but now a majority of Germans do not want Merkel to run for re-election.A changing of the guard in Europe’s biggest economy — especially with a burgeoning far-right party called Alternative for Germany posing the first right-wing threat to German democracy since the Third Reich — could ripple into issues within the greater Eurozone over time.And disturbing news from the U.K.’s DailyMail.com reports that the Saudi billionaires placed under arrest by Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman three weeks ago are now being beaten and tortured as they are holed up in the Ritz Carlton-Riyadh. These billionaires include the man known as the “Warren Buffett of Saudi Arabia,” Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. These “interrogations” are reportedly being conducted by mercenaries from a private firm from the U.S. called Academi, the successor to notorious black-ops firm Blackwater. A spokesperson for Academi denies being in Saudi Arabia or ever having engaged in torture.Reportedly, the Crown Prince is using these men’s incarceration — where they are reportedly hung up by their feet and beaten — to extort over $194 billion from their bank accounts and seized assets. In other news from the Crown Prince, he has more recently publicly called Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei “the new Hitler of the Middle East.”This presents a shot across the bough on another Middle Eastern front for the U.S. biggest Muslim ally in the region. Stay tuned; there may be more darkness developing here on Black Friday and beyond.

738,TIF,"The global luxury goods market is poised to grow at a faster pace in 2018. The last year saw luxury goods sales putting up an impressive show, growing 6%. According to a consultancy firm Bain & Company, the trend is likely to continue, driven by higher tourism and online spend. Also, an increasing number of millennials are willing to spend more, which will be integral to driving sales of personal global luxury goods such as handbags, shoes and clothing.Understandably, after a robust 2017 and a splendid first quarter, U.S. luxury goods’ stocks seem poised for a great year thanks to optimism surrounding steady economic growth, lower tax rates, higher consumer confidence, strong wage growth, and a 18-year-low unemployment rate. Given this scenario, it makes good sense to indulge in luxury goods’ stocks. Favorable Economic ScenarioThe S&P Global Luxury Index is up 5.41% on a year-to-date basis, driven by an increased number of millennials willing to spend on personal luxury goods and high tourist spending. Local consumption of personal luxury goods rose 4%, while tourist consumption grew 6%. Moreover, the online market for luxury goods continues to gain ground, thereby pushing up sales.Also, a bullish economic outlook, high wages, an 18-year-low and high consumer confidence bode well for the luxury goods market.

739,TIF,"Thursday, August 24th, 2017As monetary policy chieftains gather in Jackson Hole, WY today for the annual Central Bank Symposium and new Initial Jobless Claims hit the tape, we also see a few more earnings results worthy of our attention in the Retail industry, and the good news is there’s good news:Tiffany’s (TIF  -  Free Report), a household name synonymous with American wealth, posted better-than-expected results in this morning’s pre-market, beating on the bottom-line by 4 cents to 92 cents per share, a year-over-year increase of 9.5%. Quarterly sales of $960 million topped the $933 million expected, representing 3% growth from a year ago. Although comps were down 2%, improved strength in the Asia-Pacific region and moving more wholesale diamonds helped Tiffany’s in the quarter. Shares are up roughly 3% in early trading.Bargain retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) impressed the market this morning with earnings and revenue beats for its fiscal Q2: 99 cents per share easily outpaced the 87 cents expected, up 37.5% year over year. Sales of $5.28 billion topped the Zacks consensus by $50 million in the quarter, up 5.7% year over year. Same-store sales of 2.4% represent a combination 3.9% growth in Dollar Tree stores and 1% growth in Family Dollar. Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company with a Zacks Style Score of A are up strongly in the pre-market, +9%.And apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF  -  Free Report) is up a whopping 15% ahead of the opening bell today on narrower-than expected losses for its quarter. Bottom line losses of 23 cents per share was much improved from the -34 cents expected. Revenues of $779.3 million outpaced the $761.6 million we had been looking for. This is the first quarter in the last five where Abercrombie has actually topped earnings estimates.Jobless Claims Remain StrongStaying squarely within the 225-250K range of Initial Jobless Claims claims last week, a new read of 234K is a modest bump-up from the unrevised 232K from the previous week. Continuing claims of 1.954 million is also roughly unched for the week. While jobs growth has certainly moderated from levels we had been seeing over the past couple years, company layoffs and corporations moving offshore have been occurring less often of late, helping keep Americans relatively gainfully employed.Jackson Hole CommencesFor the next two days, Fed presidents and other monetary authorities gather to discuss global economic policies in light of Eurozone growth (European Central Bank [ECB] President Mario Draghi is scheduled to attend for the first time in 3 years) and adjustments in China and elsewhere in Asia. In the U.S., with employment looking strong and inflation yet to seep into the domestic economy, Fed Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and her cohorts have a lot to discuss ahead of their Fed meeting next month, and whether they will consider raising interest rates another quarter-percent.Draghi’s attendance is already generating interest; last time he attended Jackson Hole he foreshadowed the major program of euro buybacks (similar to the U.S.’s QE program under Fed Chair Bernanke’s regime) that ushered in very accommodative monetary policy that gained traction in the Eurozone since. What the ECB President has to say this time around will draw plenty of attention. Does he plan to tighten asset purchases at the next ECB, also coming next month? Stay tuned.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author? Click here>>

743,TIF,"Investors in Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the August 25th, 2017 $88.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Tiffany shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Tiffany is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Jewelry industry that ranks in the Top 40% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while no analysts have revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 87 cents per shareto 88 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Tiffany right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

745,TIF,"Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) posted second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both top and bottom lines improved year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, this marked the company’s second and fourth straight quarter of earnings and sales beat, respectively.Shares of the company rallied 10% during the pre-market trading session.

746,TIF,"Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (SKX  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8. In the trailing four quarters, it had underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 7.8%. However, in the preceding quarter, it surpassed the consensus mark by 37.2%.The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Skechers will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the fourth quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The company is likely to report bottom-line growth for the second straight quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the quarter under review is pegged at 13 cents compared with 4 cents in the previous year. Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $875 million, reflecting more than 16% growth on a year-over-year basis.Management had earlier projected fourth-quarter net sales in the band of $860-$885 million compared with $764.3 million in the prior-year quarter. Additionally, the company had envisioned earnings per share in the range of 9-14 cents compared with 4 cents in the year-ago period.Factors at PlaySkechers’ greater emphasis on new line of products, store remodeling projects, cost containment efforts, inventory management and global distribution platform are the primary growth catalysts. Moreover, its e-commerce business has contributed toward sales growth. Notably, the company currently operates e-commerce sites in Chile, Germany and the UK, and has launched additional sites in Spain and Canada.Skechers’ international business also remains a considerable sales growth driver for the company with Europe and China being the significant market outside the United States. Furthermore, the company is poised to enhance global reach in the footwear market through its distribution networks, subsidiaries and joint ventures (JVs).However, analysts remain concerned about rise in selling, and general & administrative expenses that may hurt the company's margin and in turn the bottom line. We note that selling expenses have increased 37%, 31.6% and 32.1% in the first, second and third quarters of 2017, respectively. Following the same chronological order, general & administrative expenses were also up 16.6%, 25.5% and 21%, respectively. Nonetheless, the growth rate of general & administrative expenses has decelerated sequentially.

747,TIF,"Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 23. In the trailing four quarters, this designer, manufacturer and retailer of jewelry and other items has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 4.5%. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.5%.Investors are counting on another estimate beat by Tiffany in the to-be-reported quarter. Let’s delve deep and take a look at the factors that will be influencing the results.Here Are the Deciding FactorsTiffany is well positioned to augment its top and bottom-lines performance in the long run by leveraging capital investments made over the past several years in distribution, manufacturing and diamond sourcing processes. The company is also looking at other revenue generating avenues. It also intends to expand distribution network by adding stores in both new and existing markets. The company is focused on opening smaller stores that offer selected collections of lower priced higher-margin product, which in turn boosts store productivity.The company is gradually coming up with new jewelry designs, range of watches and fragrance. It has also introduced “build-your-own program” on its website under which customers are allowed to personalize their charm bracelets. Also, Tiffany is allowing customers to customize rings. Apart from this, the company renewed its licensing agreement with Luxottica Group — slated to expire on Dec 31, 2027 — for the development, production and global distribution of sunglasses and prescription frames.However, despite the company’s efforts to boost the top line, rising SG&A expenses are likely to dent the operating margin. In this regard, we note that management expects fiscal 2018 SG&A expenses to increase at a rate higher than sales on account of increased spending on technology, marketing communications, visual merchandising, digital and store presentations. We noted that in the first, second, third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, SG&A expenses had increased 0.2%, 3.7%, 3.3% and 2.2%, respectively.Tiffany & Co. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Tiffany & Co. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Tiffany & Co. QuoteHow Are Top & Bottom Line Estimates Faring?After registering a bottom-line increase of 15% in the final quarter of fiscal 2017, Tiffany is likely to record year-over-year growth of more than 13% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 84 cents compared with 74 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks now project revenues of $960.7 million, up from $899.6 million in the year-ago quarter.If all goes well, this will be the fourth straight quarter that the company will surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the top and bottom lines.What Does the Zacks Model Suggest?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Tiffany is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Tiffany has a Zacks Rank #3 but an Earnings ESP of -1.66%.

748,TIF,"There isn't much on the calendar for next week. 
"
749,TIF,"Just 56 companies are confirmed to be report earnings. Seven of these are in the S&P 500. While we hope Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) gives its shareholders a little blue box, the only company likely to have any influence on market direction is homebuilder Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report). Even then, it's hard to imagine what the company could say that would sway current attitudes about the housing market. 
"
750,TIF,"First-quarter earnings season will not ""officially"" start until Apr 10, when Alcoa (AA) is scheduled to report. Nonetheless, 41 companies in the Zacks Rank universe1 have reported first-quarter results. Positive surprises are leading negative surprises by a margin of about 2:1 and earnings growth is running at 9.8%. A decent start, but given the small size of the group, investors should refrain from drawing any conclusions.
"
751,TIF,"Economic data next week will feature consumer confidence (Conference Board on Tuesday and University of Michigan on Friday), durable goods orders (Wednesday), final fourth-quarter GDP (Thursday), personal income and spending (Friday) and Chicago PMI (Friday).
"
752,TIF,"Sorry baseball fans, but opening day is still nine days away.
"
753,TIF,"So what will move the markets next week? Look for daily news (e.g. mergers) and sentiment to move stocks prices. The tail end of the quarter may bring some earnings preannouncements, but the number of earnings estimate revisions has been dropping significantly over the past several weeks.

754,TIF,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises During the Week of Mar 26 - 30
"
755,TIF,"A.G. Edwards (AGE) has given shareholders a positive earnings surprise during three out of the past four quarters. Most recently, the brokerage firm's fiscal third-quarter earnings were 12 cents above forecasts. Heading into AGE's fiscal fourth-quarter report, analysts are raising their projections. Over the past 30 days, the consensus estimate has been revised upwards by two cents to $1.04 per share. The Most Recent Consensus is more bullish at $1.06 per share. A.G. Edwards is scheduled to report on Thursday, Mar 29, before the start of trading.
"
756,TIF,"CarMax (KMX), which recently completed a 2-1 stock split, has topped analysts expectations by an average margin of 10 cents per share over the past four quarters. Ahead of the car dealer's fiscal fourth-quarter report, one analyst raised his forecast. The revision pushed the consensus estimate up by a penny to 41 cents per share. The Most Recent Consensus is more bullish at 42 cents per share. CarMax is scheduled to report on Thursday, Mar 29, before the start of trading.
"
757,TIF,"Three analysts have raised their fiscal fourth-quarter profit forecasts on Red Hat (RHT  -  Free Report) within the past 30 days, causing the consensus estimate to rise to eight cents per share (a one-cent increase). The open source software provider topped third-quarter expectations by a penny after matching estimates the past two quarters. The one caveat that investors should note, however, is that two analysts have lowered their forecasts within the past 30 days - so the signal for a positive surprise is not as strong as I prefer. Red Hat is scheduled to report on Thursday, Mar 29, after the close of trading.

763,TIF,"Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) posted third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both the top and the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, this marked the company’s third and fifth straight quarter of earnings and sales beat, respectively.Shares of the company rallied 6.7% during the pre-market trading session. Let’s see if the solid performance can revive Coty’s price performance. Shares of this cosmetics company have declined 2.5% in the past six months, as against the industry’s 7.2% rise.Let’s take a closer look at the quarterly results.Quarter in DetailThe company’s adjusted earnings of 13 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, the bottom line declined 13% year over year. On a GAAP basis, the company reported loss of 10 cents per share compared with a loss of 22 cents in the year-ago quarter.The company generated revenues of $2,222.7 million, which advanced 9.4% year over year and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,187 million. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, revenues increased 3.4%, driven by contributions from Younique and Burberry. Coty’s organic revenues inched up 0.2% including contributions from Younique. Organic revenues were also propelled by robust growth in Luxury and continued strength in the company’s Professional Beauty segment, partly offset by a modest fall in Consumer Beauty organic sales.Coty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Coty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Coty Inc. QuoteAdjusted gross margin increased 100 basis points (bps) to 64.3% in the quarter, driven by strong performance in all its segments. Additionally, adjusted operating income jumped 9.4% to $227.8 million on the back of improved gross margins and stringent cost controls. These upsides were partly offset by enhanced marketing spend. Further, adjusted operating margin contracted 10 bps to 10.2%.Segment DetailsLuxury: Luxury net revenues rose 18.6% to $752.5 million (up 11.8% on a currency neutral basis). Currency-neutral revenue growth is attributable to a 6.1% rise in organic growth that was backed by success of fragrances from Tiffany (TIF  -  Free Report) and Gucci as well as Chloe Nomade and CK One. It also includes 5.7% contribution from Burberry. Adjusted operating income for the Luxury segment surged 16.6% year over year to $100.4.Consumer Beauty: Consumer Beauty revenues advanced 3.3% to $1,021.7 million. However, sales in the segment declined 1.2% on a currency-neutral basis, thanks to 4.4% fall in organic growth stemming from wreak brands and pricing actions undertaken in Brazil. These were partially offset by growth in the ALMEA region. Adjusted operating income in the Consumer Beauty segment declined 19.9% to $97.3 million.Professional: Professional Beauty net revenues of $448.5 million improved 9.7% (up 1.9% on a currency-neutral basis). Currency-neutral sales were fueled by higher revenues from OPI, backed by growth in gel restage and lacquers. Adjusted operating income for Professional segment more than doubled to $30.1 million during the quarter.On a region-wise basis, net revenues increased 4% in North America, driven by gains from Younique and Burbery as well as strength in Tiffany and Gucci Bloom. However, the same was countered by weakness in U.S. color cosmetics. Sales in Europe improved 15.1% owing to success of Tiffany and Gucci Bloom fragrances.  Sales in the ALMEA region jumped 7%, courtesy of solid growth in fragrances and color cosmetics in China, partially countered by lower revenues in Brazil.Other Financial UpdatesCoty ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $460.8 million and net debt of $7,470.4 million.During the quarter, the company used net cash from operating activities of $118.9 million, owing to increased working capital requirements. The company’s free cash flow was negative $205.4 million.Concurrently, the company announced a dividend of 12.5 cents a share, payable on Jun 14 to shareholders of record as on May 31.OutlookManagement is pleased with solid growth in the Luxury business and ongoing momentum in the Professional segment. Although performance in the Consumer Beauty segment has been uneven, signs of improvements keep management encouraged. The company is optimistic about its recent launches that have been yielding favorably. Also, the company has been streamlining its portfolio to focus on brands with high growth potential and drive long-term growth.Considering these factors and the year-to-date performance, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company continues to expect modest net organic revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2018. Management expects healthy margin improvement over the second half, with maximum contributions coming from the fourth quarter. Looking for More Promising Bets?

764,TIF,"On Monday, U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain ruled that wholesale giant Costco (COST  -  Free Report) owes luxury jewelry company Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) over $19 million in a case over trademark infringement.Judge Swain ruled that Tiffany is entitled to $11.1 million in trebled profits, which is three times the loss it incurred from Costco’s actions, plus interest and $8.25 million in punitive damages. Costco had been selling products, like diamond rings and other jewelry, falsely identified and marked with the “Tiffany” brand, and the company’s management ""displayed at best a cavalier attitude toward Costco's use of the Tiffany name in conjunction with ring sales and marketing,” said Judge Swain in her opinion.“Costco's salespeople described such rings as ‘Tiffany’ rings in response to customer inquiries, and were not perturbed when customers who then realized that the rings were not actually manufactured by Tiffany expressed anger or upset,” Swain continued.Tiffany declared the judge’s decision a victory, with its lead counsel Jeffrey Mitchell saying that “this has been a long, hard fought battle to vindicate Tiffany’s rights.”The iconic jewelry maker first filed a complaint against Costco back in 2013, saying that it had actually learned from a customer that the wholesaler was selling fake Tiffany rings. ""There are now hundreds if not thousands of people who mistakenly believe they purchased and own a Tiffany engagement ring from Costco,"" the complaint said at the time. The 2013 complaint also said that Costco was not using the Tiffany trademark on its website, which made it difficult for the jeweler to track it down.Costco said it intends to appeal Judge Swain’s ruling; the company argued that it was using “Tiffany” as a generic word to describe a particular kind of ring setting, and that the rings were not marked with the Tiffany brand. ""This was not a case about counterfeiting in the common understanding of that word -- Costco was not selling imitation Tiffany & Co. rings,"" the company said in a statement.Additionally, Costco can no longer use the word “Tiffany” to sell products, said Swain.At market close, shares of COST were down a slight 0.65%, while TIF stock was down 2.89%.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

765,TIF,"Benchmarks finished at record highs on Friday as tech stocks gained. Tech has come a long way, evolving from the dot-com catastrophe to becoming a safety trade and are now favored by active managers. Investors are pouring money into Internet and tech companies, which are less vulnerable to tax cuts and changes in interest rates and are expected to benefit from lower corporate taxes, mainly on cash held overseas.Earnings season, meanwhile, kicked off. JP Morgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo all posted better-than-expected earnings results, but, their shares fell after reporting decline in trading sales. Investors also digested a couple of poor economic data on retail sales and inflation, which made market participants believe that the Federal Reserve may turn dovish.The Dow closed at a record high for the third time in a row, while the 30-stock index registered its 25th record close for this year. The Dow advanced 0.4% to close at 21,637.74. The S&P 500 also notched a record high, its first since June 19. The benchmark index rose 0.5% to finish at 2,459.27. The Nasdaq, however, finished slightly below its closing record of 6,321.76 set on June 8. The tech-heavy index gained 0.6% to close at 6,312.47.For the week, all the major indexes posted solid gains. The Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq increased 1%, 1.4% and 2.6%, respectively. The indexes have overcome series of bottlenecks from tech overvaluation fears to Russia’s involvement in the U.S. election to climb back into record territory.Big Bank Earnings In a NutshellBanking-behemoths JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) handily beat earnings and revenue estimates, while Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) beat earnings expectations but modestly missed revenue estimates. A big reason for the market’s lukewarm reaction to the seemingly positive bank earnings is the soft guidance for the current period, particularly from JPMorgan. Also, signs of a slowdown in trading weighed on bank stocks (read more: Bank Earnings Are Good, But Fail to Impress).Soft economic data on retail sales and particularly the Consumer Price Index, furthermore, reduced the chances of additional rate hikes this year. This has dragged down Treasury yields, which has lowered the chances of increase in profits from one of the major profit centers for banks – interest income.Retail Sales Fizzle Out, Inflation was FlatSales at retailers fell 0.2% in June, marking the second straight drop and the biggest decline of the year. Most of the retail segments including gas stations, grocers, restaurants, book stores, sporting-goods stores and department stores saw a decline in sales figures. Such disappointing numbers indicated that the U.S. economy hasn’t rebounded strongly in the spring, which may give the Fed a reason to reassess how quickly it withdraws stimulus from the economy.The consumer-price-index, meanwhile, was unchanged last month. The index showed that the prices Americans pay for goods and services aren’t rising very much. In fact, the rate of inflation over the past 12 months has slowed down to 1.6% in June from 1.9% in the prior month.

766,TIF,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 7. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 60.2%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Michael Kors has a remarkable history, at least in terms of the bottom line. The company’s second-quarter fiscal 2018 results marked its positive earnings surprise streak for the tenth consecutive quarter. In the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 23.7%.Well the obvious question that comes to mind, will Michael Kors be able to sustain its positive earnings surprise streak in the third quarter. Notably, the past trends do indicate toward that direction but it will not be wise to jump to a conclusion without analyzing the factors at play.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is $1.29, reflecting a year-over-year decline of over 21.3%. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,375 million, up nearly 2% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayMichael Kors has been constantly deploying resources to expand product offerings, open new stores, and build shop-in-shops along with upgrading information system and distribution infrastructure. Management intends to upgrade e-commerce platform and expects the channel to be a significant contributor in the long run. We note that despite the possibility of heavy investments weighing upon the margins in the short term, the company continues to take up strategic endeavors.Further, Michael Kors Runway 2020 strategic plan, which focuses on product innovation, brand engagement and customer experience, is likely to drive the top line. The company had earlier launched Bancroft in the Michael Kors collection line as part of its strategy of product innovation. This strategy aided the global Women's footwear comparable sales to increase by double digit in the preceding quarter.However, stiff competition, falling comps, aggressive promotional environment and waning mall traffic are making things tough. We noted that comparable sales dipped 1.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, following declines of 5.9% in the preceding quarter. We noted that comps had declined 14.1%, 6.9%, 5.4% and 7.4% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters, respectively. In fiscal 2018, the company continues to anticipate comparable sales to decrease in the mid-single digit range.Michael Kors Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Michael Kors Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Michael Kors Holdings Limited QuoteWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Michael Kors is likely to beat estimates this quarter as the stock has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.   Michael Kors has an Earnings ESP of +1.61% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

768,TIF,"As competition is intensifying in the retail space, Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) is leaving no stone unturned to drive revenues. The company, which has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 11.2%, is banking on several strategic initiatives to enhance customer base. The company's strategic endeavors have helped the stock to gain 8.5% compared with the industry’s decline of 1.2% in the past six months.Tiffany is gradually coming up with new jewelry designs, range of watches and fragrance. It has also introduced “build-your-own program” on its website under which customers are allowed to personalize their charm bracelets. Also, Tiffany is allowing customers to customize rings.Apart from this, the company renewed its licensing agreement with Luxottica Group — slated to expire on Dec 31, 2027 — for the development, production and global distribution of sunglasses and prescription frames. These initiatives reflect the company’s customer-centric focus which is likely to help strengthen its customer base.The company is focusing on opening smaller stores that offer select collections of low priced and high margin products. Tiffany also focuses on improving sales per square foot by driving customer traffic and converting visitors into buyers through targeted advertising, sales training and customer-oriented initiatives.Management also intends to expand its distribution network by adding stores in new and existing markets. On the international front, the company is now focusing on expanding business in the Middle East, Russia, Canada, Mexico and Brazil.However, despite the company’s efforts to boost the top line, rising SG&A expenses are likely to dent the operating margin. In this regard, we note that management expects fiscal 2018 SG&A expenses to increase at a rate higher than sales on account of increased spending on technology, marketing communications, visual merchandising, digital and store presentations. We noted that in the first, second, third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, SG&A expenses had increased 0.2%, 3.7%, 3.3% and 2.2%, respectively.Given the pros and cons embedded the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).3 Retail Stocks to Steal the ShowMacy's, Inc.

769,TIF,"Of late, Retail-Jewelry industry seems to have gained momentum. However, Signet Jewelers Limited (SIG  -  Free Report), which belongs to the same industry has witnessed a decline of 7.6% in the past three months, compared with the industry’s growth of 8.8%. Stocks such as Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) and Movado Group, Inc. (MOV  -  Free Report) have gained 14.5% and 15.2%, respectively in the same time frame. Let’s delve deeper and find out why Signet is lagging behind its peers.Signet Vs Industry ScorecardParametersSignetIndustryEarnings Growth F1-12.7%13.5%Sales Growth F1-1.5% 16.5%Long term Earnings Growth8.0% 9.9%Source: ZacksDismal Holiday SalesSignet has kicked off 2018 with dismal holiday sales and soft outlook. The company’s dismal holiday sales results were primarily due to negative effect of the credit outsourcing transition and weakness at UK Jewelry division. Further, challenging retail landscape, aggressive promotional strategies and waning mall traffic were the other reasons behind lower-than-expected results.Signet’s total sales for the nine-week period ended Dec 30, 2017, decreased 3.1% to $1,881.7 million from $1,940.9 million in the prior year, while same store sales fell 5.3%. This holiday season performance was more or less similar to that of 2016, where total sales decreased 5.1% and same store sales declined 4.6% in the nine-week period ended Dec 31, 2016.The dismal results compelled management to adopt a more conservative view. Signet now expects fiscal 2018 earnings (excluding the impact of U.S. tax reform) in the range of $6.17-$6.22, compared with the prior guidance of $6.10-$6.50. Moreover, earnings (including the impact of U.S. tax reform) are estimated to be in range of $6.45-$6.50. Meanwhile, the company continues to expect same store sales to decline by mid-single digits.Gross Margin Downtrend a ConcernGross margin, an important financial metric that gives an indication about the company’s health has shown constant deceleration in the past few quarters. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, gross margin contracted 170 basis points (bps) to 27.8% following a decline of 120 bps and 300 bps to 32.7% and 35%, respectively, in the preceding two quarters. Decline in gross margin is primarily due to rise in promotional activities, which in turn lowered merchandize margin rate.Signet currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). A better-ranked stock worth considering in the retail space include American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (AEO  -  Free Report), whose shares have gained 35.5% in the past three months. It sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

770,TIF,"Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) is well positioned to augment both its top and bottom-line performance in the long run by leveraging capital investments made over the past several years in distribution, manufacturing and diamond sourcing processes. The company is steadily introducing new jewelry designs, new watch collection and fragrance, as well as additional jewelry SKUs. It also introduced “build-your-own program” on its website under which customers are allowed to personalize their own charm bracelets.The company is also focused on opening smaller stores that offer selected collections of lower priced higher-margin product, which in turn boosts store productivity. Tiffany concentrates on improving sales per square foot through an increase in customer traffic and converting them into potential buyers by targeted advertising, ongoing sales training and customer-oriented initiatives. Management anticipates gross retail square footage growth of 2% in fiscal 2017.These initiatives seem inevitable given the company’s dwindling comparable-store sales performance. In the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2017, comps have declined 3%, 2% and 1%, respectively. However, we noted that the rate of decline has decelerated sequentially.Further, management had earlier guided SG&A expenses for the fiscal year to increase at a marginally higher rate than sales on account of sustained investment in new signature women's fragrance, launch of new luxury accessories offerings and additional jewelry SKUs. This may strain margins to an extent. We noted that in the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2017, SG&A expenses had increased 0.2%, 3.7% and 3.3%, respectively.Nevertheless, Tiffany is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers and attain incremental revenues. The company envisions net sales for fiscal 2017 to increase by a low-single-digit percentage on a reported and constant-exchange-rate basis. We believe that these strategies are likely to bolster performance and drive the stock further.

773,TIF,"Readers may be asking themselves, Wait a minute.  Hasnt retail hit a slump lately?  Thats very true.  According to the Commerce Department, U.S. retail sales dropped by  -1.1% in June.  While that did mark a +6.3% rise from June 2003, it was still below Wall Street expectations.  So how can investors generate profit in an industry impacted by the summer slowdown?  The answer lies in the specialty arena of the retail industry, where investors can get situated in a position that doesnt move in lock-step with the broader space.  As a result, the specialty retail industry currently holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.80, according to Nick Raichs  Weekly Earnings and Sector Update.   That places it 59th out of more than 200 industries.  Retail is a large enough industry that investors can always find some profit potential, so dont let this summer swoon shake your confidence in the space. 
"
774,TIF,"Consumers are not feeling super-exuberant right now, but some defensive sectors are worthy of attention, said Gary Holdsworth, an analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities.  June sales were below expectations for a variety of reasons, including unfavorable weather, difficult comparisons and high energy costs.  However, Holdsworth, a 5-star analyst, wants investors to remember that not all retail companies go with the flow, and he uses pet supplies companies as an example.   
"
775,TIF,"Regardless of whether the economy is slipping or surging, pet owners are not going to stop feeding their dogs and cats.  And pet food is only part of the game plan for companies like PETsMART (NASDAQ:  PETM ) and Petco (NASDAQ:  PETC ), who are continually adding new services to their stores, including spas for Spot and Fido.  Holdsworth also points out that sporting goods companies are a consolidation play right now, which is another avenue of potential for investors.  One recent example of this trend was Dicks Sporting Goods (NYSE:  DKS ) agreement to acquire Galyans Trading Company (NASDAQ:  GLYN ).  Galyans offer a broad range of products to people with active lifestyles, and Dicks believes its a nice fit.   
"
776,TIF,"Looking forward, the specialty retail industry should provide even more opportunity.  The end of July through August is the all-important back-to-school season, which is almost like a second Christmas for much of the retail sector.  The National Retail Federation says investors and retailers can look forward to a healthy season that should boost third quarter sales.  In fact, a survey by the (NTF) says families with school-aged children will be spending +7.2% more than they did last year.  That will obviously be a boon for a even more specialty stocks.   
"
777,TIF,"The retail industry may be a simpler space for the average investor compared to more complex fields such as technology.  However, though it may be easier to understand, the methods to generated profit can be just as engaging.  Holdsworth says investors must watch year-over-year comparisons closely, and should also pay attention to trends, especially in fashion.  Success in these regards are usually combined with a strong management team.  You cant just rely on current trends to hold unless you have a good management team that can see the next trend coming, said Holdsworth.  Analysts can be your greatest tool in this regard.  By using their insight, investor confidence in retail can stay at a high level, even when consumer confidence gets down in the dumps.

779,TIF,"Below are the top stocks recommended by the most  5-Star  analysts in the specialty retail industry.  Cost Plus, Inc.  (NASDAQ:  CPWM ) is a leading specialty retailer of casual home furnishings and entertaining products.  As of May 20, 2004, the company operated 218 stores in 26 states, vs. 184 stores in 23 states last year.  Cost Plus put together a strong fiscal first quarter in late May, as earnings per diluted share of 15 cents beat the prior years result of 12 cents.  The consensus was calling for 14 cents, accounting for a more than +7% positive surprise for Cost Plus.  Net sales reached $185.7 million in the quarter vs. $159.2 million last year, marking a +16.6% improvement.  Same-store sales improved +3.4%.  Tight control over operating expenses allowed Cost Plus to take additional markdowns in order to assure clean inventories as it moved into the summer selling season and maintain the sales momentum of certain high growth categories.  There was some disappointment among analysts concerning the companys fiscal second quarter earnings per share outlook, but that hasnt lessened their belief that Cost Plus is in a good position to be a dominant player in the home goods market.  In fact, seven All Star analysts are currently recommending the company, which is more than any other specialty retailer.  The company will report its fiscal second quarter numbers on August 19th.  To further research Cost Plus, Inc., click  CPWM .  Williams-Sonoma, Inc.  (NYSE:  WSM ) is a nationwide specialty retailer of high quality products for the home.

For the ninth consecutive quarter, Williams-Sonoma reported earnings per share that beat Wall Streets expectations.  Its fiscal first quarter diluted earnings result of 18 cents per share was more than +12% in front of the consensus, while also growing on a year-over-year basis.  Net revenues advanced +19.4% to $640.9 million.  Williams-Sonoma outlined several drivers to its quarterly results, including a strong merchandise assortment, higher order fulfillment rates in both its retail and direct-to-consumer businesses, and continuing benefits form successful supply chain and overhead cost reduction initiatives.  Our first quarter results once again demonstrate our ability to drive top-line sales growth and invest in long-term infrastructure initiatives, while at the same time consistently delivering on the financial and operational commitments that we have set for ourselves, said Chairman Howard Lester.

786,TIF,"A brokerage firm just initiated coverage on Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) with a buy rating, helping shares of the world-renowned jewelry retailer rise approximately 6%. The gain makes TIF a top-performing Zacks #1 Rank company for Tuesday.  
"
787,TIF,"According to the brokerage analyst, TIF could see positive same-store sales in the fourth quarter, and appears poised to pick up more market share.  
"
788,TIF,"Even before today's news though, TIF was in the good graces of several analysts thanks to a solid fiscal second-quarter report that included a raised guidance for 2009.  
"
789,TIF,"Earnings estimates have been trending higher, and volume today is around 2.7 million shares. The daily average is 2.6 million shares.  Earnings Estimates  
"
790,TIF,"In the fiscal second-quarter report from Aug 28, TIF raised its 2009 earnings from continuing operations guidance to between $1.65 and $1.75. Previously, the outlook had been $1.50 to $1.60.  
"
791,TIF,"As a result, earnings estimates have moved higher over the past 2 months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this fiscal year, ending January 2010, is $1.75 per share, up 10.8% from $1.58 in 60 days.   
"
792,TIF,"The gain includes a rise of 1.1% in the past 30 days as 2 of 13 analysts revised higher in that time.  
"
793,TIF,"Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year ending January 2011 is $2.04 per share, marking increases of 15.2% in 2 months and 3% in 30 days. (This fiscal year also enjoyed upward revisions from 2 analysts (out of 14) in the past month.)  
"
794,TIF,"Furthermore, the guidance for next fiscal year suggests year-over-year profit growth of 16.6%. Fiscal Second Quarter  
"
795,TIF,"Earnings per share declined year over year in its most recently-reported quarter, but TIF was still able to continue its streak of positive surprises. The company earned 41 cents per share in the fiscal second quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by more than 24%.  
"
796,TIF,"The company has now put together an average surprise of around 17.6% over the past 4 quarters.  
"
797,TIF,"Due to the challenging environment, sales declined 16% to $612.5 million from $729.6 million. Nevertheless, TIF was encouraged that many of its stores announced either narrower year-over-year sales declines or small sales growth.

"
800,TIF,"Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report), which holds a significant position in the global jewelry market, took a bold step in a bid to ramp up sales by appointing former Diesel as well as Bulgari’s chief executive Alessandro Bogliolo as the CEO of the company. Bogliolo is expected to take office by Oct 2, 2017. Following the news, Tiffany’s shares gained roughly 2%. The company hopes to boost sales performance under the new CEO.We note that sales performance of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company has not been spectacular in the past few quarters. In first-quarter fiscal 2017, sales increased only 1% and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In both fourth and third quarter of fiscal 2016, sales have inched up 1% each, while in the second and first quarter sales declined 8% and 9%, respectively.We also note that sales in Americas and Europe have declined for five straight quarters now with 3% drop recorded for each region in first-quarter fiscal 2017. Further, sales in Americas fell 3%, 2%, 9% and again 9% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of fiscal 2016, respectively. Maintaining the same chronological order we observed that sales in Europe dropped 7%, 10%, 12% and 9%, respectively.Moreover, a mature domestic market, foreign currency headwinds and cautious consumer spending also remain causes of concern. All these factors have hurt the stock that gained only 2.8% in the past three months but managed to outperform the Zacks categorized Retail-Jewelry Stores industry that declined 0.5%.There is no doubt that the current jewelry industry scenario is tough due to declining retail traffic and soft demand for Jewelry but Bogliolo’s rich experience in the luxury industry can help Tiffany to reinforce its position. Notably, Bogliolo has 16 years’ experience in luxury jewelry and watch firm Bulgari, and most recently he served as CEO of global apparel and accessories company, Diesel SpA. During his tenure at Diesel he not only helped the company to rejuvenate its brand but also enriched consumer experience. Bogliolo also has the experience of working in countries like Spain, China, Italy, Singapore, France, and U.S.Bottom LineWe hope that the company will be able to bring about a turnaround in performance under the new CEO. Moreover, Tiffany's strategic initiatives like omni-channel platform, store expansion plans, tapping of new markets and venturing into new revenue generating will act as catalysts.Some Shining Stars in the Retail SpaceBetter-ranked stocks which warrant a look in the retail space include G-III Apparel Group, Ltd.

801,TIF,"The mall is dead.O.K., maybe not completely dead – there are obviously still plenty of retail malls of all shapes and sizes in operation – but the mall is certainly sick.  On life support, even.Due mostly to changing consumer preferences and the rise of online retailing giants like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), mall traffic has been declining for years.  Mall real estate vacancies nationwide now top 10%, and this week, Moody’s Investor Service reported that the first Quarter of 2018 saw the highest level ever of default on retailer’s debt with nine firms failing to make scheduled interest payments – most notably, the long-struggling department store operator Sears Holdings  and privately held Claire’s Stores, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this year.Retail Jewelry Takes a BeatingSignet Jewelers Limited (SIG  -  Free Report) has been hit hard buy the shift from brick-and-mortar retailing in the jewelry sector to more efficient (and in most cases, less expensive) online options.  Operating well-known national brands like Kay, Zales and Jared as well as a number of smaller regional brands, Signet now finds itself on uncomfortable middle ground in the industry. Lacking the cachet of Super-Luxury brands like Tiffany (TIF  -  Free Report) or Cartier, or the online traffic of popular internet jeweler Blue Nile, Signet is in the midst of a three-year restructuring plan that aims to close 200 costly retail stores and attempts to replace the lost revenue with increased online sales.  Unfortunately, it may be a case of too-little-too-late.Despite the push to increase internet sales, Signet sold only $253M worth of goods online in fiscal 2018 (its most recent full year.) Although this is indeed a big increase from the previous year, it still significantly trails industry leader Blue Nile, which had revenues of $480M in 2015 (the last year it reported publicly before being acquired by private equity firm Bain Capital) and which presumably have grown even more since then.Disappointing GuidanceOwing partly to a quirk in the reporting cycle (a 15-week 4th quarter), Signet actually posted a $0.02 cent earnings beat in the fourth quarter - $4.28/share vs. a Zacks consensus estimate of $4.26 – but the company’s guidance for the coming year was abysmal.  Prior to the announcement, the consensus estimate for next year was for earnings of $6.45/share.  Signet shocked the markets by guiding lower by 40% to a range of $3.75 to $4.25/share.Analysts were quick to follow with an avalanche of downgrades, resulting in a new consensus estimate in the middle of that new range - $3.99/share.  This earns Signet our worst rating, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell.)Despite the fact that the stock price has been punished lately, trading around $38 – down from a 52-week high of $77.94, it’s still really not a value opportunity because of the significantly uncertain prospects for a successful restructuring.  There are plenty of stocks out there that are leading growing sectors.  There’s no reason to get involved in one that’s shrinking.Investors who want to have retail exposure in their portfolio would be wiser to consider Walgreen Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report).  Both currently have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)- due mostly to relatively flat recent earnings estimates, but in the retail sector, both of these stores are sell the categories of merchandise that consumers are willing to travel to an actual store to get. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies  It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.  See Them Free>>

802,TIF,"Much of our focus on economic data lately is in anticipation of the Fed meeting Tuesday and Wednesday next week, where odds are basically as a #1 seed versus a #16 that interest rates are going up 25 basis points for Jay Powell’s inaugural session as new Fed Chair. Mostly, analysts appear to be looking for signs of inflation accelerating in our current economy. Yet for every signal that may be happening, we see something else that walks some of that sentiment back.Take this morning’s Housing Starts and Permits reports for example, where we see a pullback in both measures for the month of February: -7% on new starts and -5.7% on the forward-indicating permits. And while this downturn in permits met estimates exactly, starts were roughly double the losses analysts were expecting. Last month, 1.236 million new seasonally adjusted, annualized housing starts were initiated, while 1.298 million permits were signed.This data has plenty of information “below the fold,” and often the headline can be somewhat misleading as a result. For today’s report, single-family starts actually went up; it was the multi-family units that were lagging. This betrays some of the disappointment here, as single-family units are generally of higher value and thus signs of an economy strengthening further.Then again, should we have seen big growth in starts and permits for last month, we may have seen evidence in the pre-market of inflation/interest rate jitters in the major indexes. But we don’t — the Dow looks to open up 41 points, the Nasdaq +17 and the S&P 500, which has yet to get off the mat this week, is trading up ahead of the bell 7 points.Tiffany Tops Q4 EstimatesLuxury retailer Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) reported earnings ahead of the bell today, beating the Zacks consensus on the bottom line by 4 cents per share to $1.67, whereas revenues of $1.33 billion topped the $1.30 billion expected. These figures represent growth on the bottom line of 15% and on the top by 8.5%.Guidance for full-year 2018 was pushed up measurably above the Zacks estimate of $4.09 per share to a range of $4.25-4.45. Traders look to be selling this news, however — shares are trading down 5% in today’s pre-market. For more on TIF’s earnings, click here. https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/TIF/detailed-estimates

803,TIF,"Earnings Season in the Last Stretch
"
804,TIF,"We don’t have much in terms of earnings releases this Thanksgiving Day week, but we still have 47 companies releasing results, including 5 S&P 500 members. The Q3 earnings season is mostly over, with results from 489 S&P 500 members, or 97.8% of the index’s total membership, already known. Most of this week’s reports are coming out on Tuesday, including Hewlett-Packard (HPQ  -  Free Report), Tiffany (TIF  -  Free Report), and Hormel Foods (HRL  -  Free Report). By the end of this week, we will have seen Q3 results from 494 of the S&P 500 members.
"
805,TIF,"Our overall verdict on the Q3 earnings season is favorable, particularly relative to the last few quarters. The fact that actual results have been better relative to the lowered pre-season expectations is no surprise given management team’s impressive track record in under-promising and over-delivering. There is still not much growth and most companies are still guiding lower, prompting estimates for Q4 to come down. But whatever little growth we have in Q3 thus far is better than we have seen in recent quarters. And for those keeping records, the Q3 earnings season appears on track a new quarterly record for total earnings, surpassing the level achieved in Q2.
"
806,TIF,"The Retail sector has been in focus lately, with the broadly underwhelming guidance from Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) and others pointing towards a soft holiday shopping season for the sector. Even before the earnings reports from these retailers, we knew that consumer spending growth had decelerated in Q3. We know that in the Q3 GDP report personal consumption expenditures were up only +1.5%, down from Q2’s +1.8% growth pace. A low-growth environment forces retailers to rely on promotional efforts to grab more consumer dollars. But this zero-sum drive for market share where one company’s gain is another’s loss typically drives down margins for everyone.
"
807,TIF,"Looked at this way, Wal-Mart’s sub-par outlook may not solely be a function of under-pressured household finances, but also reflective of a hyper competitive retail environment where some operators like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) are more than willing to sacrifice margins for more sales. Wal-Mart referred to this competitive dynamic in their earnings call, which apparently more than offset the beneficial effects of recent downtrend in gasoline prices.Q3 Earnings Scorecard (as of Friday, 11/22/2013)
"
808,TIF,"Total earnings for the 489 S&P 500 companies that have reported results are up +4.9% with 65.4% beating earnings expectations, while total revenues for these companies are up +3.0% and 42.1% are beating top-line expectations. The table below shows the current earnings scorecard.
"
809,TIF,"This is better performance than what this same group of 489 companies reported in Q2 and the 4-quarter average. As you can see in the chart below, the earnings and revenue growth rates for these companies is notably better than what we saw from this same group of companies in Q2 and the 4-quarter average.
"
810,TIF,"Unlike recent quarters, The Finance sector isn’t driving growth in Q3. Total earnings growth outside of Finance of +3.7% compares to earnings decline of -2.0% in Q2 and the average -0.4% decline in the preceding four quarters. Improved growth at the Technology, Basic Materials, and Transportation sectors accounts for the positive ex-Finance variance in Q3 relative to the recent past.
"
811,TIF,"Total earnings for the 97.0% of the Technology sector’s market capitalization that have reported results already are up +6.0% from the same period last year, which compares to earnings declines of -8.9% in Q2 and the 4-quarter average of -1.6%.
"
812,TIF,"At the medium industry level (or M level), we have 7 industries in the Technology sector, of which only Telecom Services hasn’t reported any results yet. The growth picture has improved for each of the other six industries, with the improvement particularly notable for the Software & Services and Semiconductor industries. These two industries combined account for 41% of the sector’s total earnings.
"
813,TIF,"Strong earnings growth at Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) accounts for the positive growth profile of the Software & Services industry and account for a big part of the Tech sector’s positive growth picture. Excluding both these companies form the Tech sector’s tally, the sector’s Q3 total earnings growth drops from +6% to +3.3%.   
"
814,TIF,"Total earnings for the Computer & Office Equipment industry, the biggest industry in the sector accounting for almost 44% of the sector’s total earnings, are down -1.9% from the same period last year, primarily driven by tough comparisons for Apple (AAPL). But this still better performance than what the industry was able to achieve in recent quarters. Apple’s negative year-over-year comparison has been a big drag on the sector’s growth picture. Excluding Apple, total earnings for the Tech sector would be up +9.9% (up +6% including the company).
"
815,TIF,"Total earnings for the Basic Materials sector are up +3.6% on +1.1% higher revenues. The improvement in the sector’s growth numbers is primarily a function of easy comparisons, particularly in the sector’s dominant chemicals industry (67.6% of total sector earnings come from the Chemicals & Fertilizer industry). The Chemicals industry earnings are up +11.3% at this stage, largely due to easy comparisons at Dow Chemicals (DOW). Dow missed and guided lower, but its Q3 total earnings were up year over year.The Composite Growth Picture
"
816,TIF,"Total earnings for the S&P 500 as a whole, combining the results from the 489 that have reported with estimates for the remaining 11, is for growth of +4.7% on +2.9% higher revenues. This compares to +3.7% earnings growth in Q2 on 2.0% revenues.
"
817,TIF,"Only five of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have double-digit earnings growth in Q3 – Consumer Discretionary (11.9%), Construction (+32.1%), Transportation (+13.2%), Autos (+32.3%) and Aerospace (+13.1%). Excluding Finance, total earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to be up +3.7% on +3.4% higher revenues, which is up from a decline of -2.0% in total earnings on +1.2% higher revenues in Q2.Q4 Estimates Coming Down
"
818,TIF,"Estimates for Q4 have started coming down, though they still have plenty of room to go before reaching ‘reasonable’ levels. The chart below shows how estimates for Q4 have evolved in recent weeks.
"
819,TIF,"Investors seem to be fine with the current record level of earnings as providing enough justification for the stock market’s all-time record level. We will have wait to see if this justification would work once the Fed starts getting out of the QE, which some suspect could happen as early as this December. But irrespective of when the Fed starts tapering, the stock market needs stronger earnings growth in the coming quarters than we have seen in the recent past to maintain its recent momentum.

822,TIF,"Benchmarks closed at record highs on Tuesday after the Senate advanced the Republican Tax Bill. This is seen as a major stride toward implementation of tax reforms. Further, Jerome Powell’s comments that he would follow Yellen’s path in terms of monetary policies also boosted investor sentiment. After a hiatus of two months, North Korea tested yet another missile on Tuesday. Such an event weighed on investor sentiment and partly pared gains for the markets. Lastly, Consumer Confidence hit a 17 year high, driven upward by a broadly encouraging U.S. economy.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) increased 1.1%, to close at 23,836.71. The S&P 500 Index (INX) gained 1% to close at 2,627.04. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,912.36, increasing 0.5%. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,784 to 1,045. On Nasdaq, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by 1,750 to 1,098. The CBOE VIX decreased 0.5% to close at 9.92.Senate Votes for Republican Tax BillIn a 12-11 vote on Tuesday, the Senate Budget Committee advanced the Tax Bill proposed by the members of the GOP. Senators Bob Corker and Ron Johnson also voted in favor of the Bill. Interestingly, both the Republicans had earlier been skeptical about the success of such a tax reform framework, objecting openly to the most important facet of the Bill which seeks to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%.Economists are estimating that a full Senate vote could be reached by Thursday. Such a development takes President Trump a step closer toward pushing through tax reforms. This development also boosted investor sentiment.North Korea Launches another MissileJust when geopolitical tensions between Washington and Pyongyang seemed to have ebbed, Kim Jong-Un’s regime tested another Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) on Tuesday. This test comes after a hiatus of two months. The launch was confirmed by Yonhap News Agency from South Korea. Per the report from the news agency, North Korea launched a missile around 3 AM local time (1:30 PM EST), which travelled around 620 miles before landing in the waters between Korean Peninsula and Japan.In retaliation, South Korea also fired missiles into its surrounding waters in order to let North Korea know that it can also be ‘taken under fire.’ In an interview with Fox News, Pentagon Spokesperson Robert Manning III, commented that the latest missile launch by Pyongyang did not pose any threat to “North America, our territories or our allies.”How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow amassed almost 256 points to finish at a record high, buoyed by gains notched up by JP Morgan (JPM), shares of which surged 3.5%. Moreover, progress on the tax Bill also boosted markets. Further, Jerome Powell, selected by Trump for the post of Fed Chief, commented that he would choose not to deviate from the path that Fed’s current Chief Janet Yellen has laid out.Powell mentioned that he would continue to work toward raising interest rates at the same time as gradually unwinding the Fed’s humungous balance sheet. Such comments from Powell boosted financial stocks, with the sector posting its best performance since Mar 1.

Moreover, the S&P 500 gained 25.6 points, gains for which was boosted primarily by financial stocks. Of the 11 major segments of the S&P 500, 10 ended in positive territory. Finally, the Nasdaq gained 33.8 points to end in the green.Consumer Confidence Hits a 17-Year HighConsumer Confidence for November came in at 129.5, surpassing the previous month’s reading of 126.2. The consensus estimate for the period was 123.9. This is its highest level since November 2000. Economists believe that such a reading was achieved under broadly encouraging economic conditions.U.S. economy is at full throttle, with GDP hitting 3% growth in two consecutive quarters.

823,TIF,"Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) posted sixth straight quarter of positive earnings surprise, when it reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 results. This designer and retailer of fine jewelry posted quarterly earnings of 80 cents a share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents and increased approximately 5% from the year-ago period on account of higher sales and improved margins.  Net sales came in at $976.2 million, up 3% from $949.3 million recorded in the prior-year quarter and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $960 million. The company registered sturdy sales in the Fashion Jewelry and the High, Fine & Solitaire Jewelry categories. However, comparable-store sales (comps) declined 1%. In constant currencies, worldwide net sales jumped 3%.Tiffany’s omni-channel platform, store expansion programs, tapping of new markets and venturing into new revenue generating avenues bode well for the stock.

"
824,TIF,"The retail industry has been forced to keep pace with the evolving consumer buying habits. Consumers today are knowledgeable, more inquisitive and choosier. Importantly, today’s customers have numerous shopping options at their disposal like in-store, online, mobile, social media and so on, that influence their purchasing decision. Satisfying customers and enriching their buying experience require new strategies. Modern retailing, interestingly enough, is a new game with new rules.
"
825,TIF,"The U.S. retail and food services sales data for Sep 2014 was up from last year but was marginally below the previous month. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, retail and food services sales rose 4.3% year over year while declining 0.3% sequentially to $442.7 billion.
"
826,TIF,"Some of the trends that are expected to rule the retail sector going forward include increased technological solutions, incorporating customer feedback and targeting additional audiences with products and services.Omni-channel Retailing the New Norm: The sluggish U.S. economy along with persistent weakness in Europe motivated retailers to focus on the buyers’ needs and lure them with innovative products, attractive discounts, free shipping and the ease of shopping through smartphones and tablets. However, as these efforts failed to pay off, retailers felt the need for a better channel to connect with customers.
"
827,TIF,"This gave rise to the “omnichannel” approach, which focuses on providing more touch points and multiple channels to customers. This approach facilitates the use of all possible mediums to engage consumers, including brick and mortar stores, online and mobile at the same time or alternatively.
"
828,TIF,"This strategy provides customers with the ease of selecting, purchasing and exchanging a product through multiple channels. For example, a customer may select a product online, buy it through phone and exchange the same at a store without any hassle. Some retailers who are already benefiting from this strategy include Staples Inc. (SPLS), Macy's Inc. (M  -  Free Report), Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) and Chico’s FAS Inc. (CHS  -  Free Report).Personalized In-Store Experience: With evolution to the .com era and advancement of consumers, retailers are working hard to reinvent their marketing style, gradually shifting from the mass advertising and promotion format to a more personalized method to impress today’s omni-channel customers. The consumers today seek a more direct communication and hence prefer to interact with an executive through their smartphone app or to chat with them on the company’s website. Moreover, the customers prefer tailored offers and recommendations online as well as in stores.Increasing Use of Mobile Wallet Technology: With everything in retail undergoing a sea change, the modes of payment used when shopping have also evolved drastically. The increasing use of smartphones, tablets and mobile technology has given rise to a new mobile application called ‘mobile wallet,’ through which customers can be make payments instantly by using their smartphones or tablets. Though cash and credit cards will remain the primary payment methods, the use of mobile wallet is catching up quickly among mobile users for the convenience it offers.
"
829,TIF,"The popularity of this app among customers is driving retailers to adapt this payment mode by collaborating with some of the mobile wallet providers available in the market like PayPal, Google Wallet, Square Wallet, Dwolla and more.
"
830,TIF,"In a recent stride in this direction, leading car rental company Avis Budget Group Inc. (CAR  -  Free Report) fused its express rental service “Avis Preferred” with the Google Wallet application. Moreover, the PayPal app has gained recognition with a wide array of retailers including Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF), Advance Auto Parts Inc. (AAP), Aeropostale Inc. (ARO), American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO), Barnes & Noble Inc. (BKS), Foot Locker Inc. (FL  -  Free Report), J.C. Penney Company Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) AND Office Depot Inc. (ODP  -  Free Report).Technology-Friendly Brick & Mortar Stores: With shoppers increasingly becoming tech savvy, the brick and mortar stores need to leave their old-fashioned layouts behind and improvise by adopting innovative in-store technologies. The simplest way to execute this is the implementation of in-store mobile devices, through which customers can make payments, see product demonstrations, gather information and connect to social networks.
"
831,TIF,"This has been well demonstrated by Apple Inc. (AAPL), which equipped its associates with iPhones enabling them to assist customers and receive payments anywhere in the store. This reduces billing queues and ensures efficient management of space, making stores less congested.
"
832,TIF,"Further, retailers are exploring new ways to use mobile devices in-store. They are looking to develop mobile apps that can track customers as they shop, send them tailored offers related to the store’s section they are in; recommend items based on past purchases; or allow shoppers to program automated shopping lists.
"
833,TIF,"In-store technologies, that customers look for these days include mobile point of sales, price checkers, self-checkout payment lanes, information kiosks, digital signage, etc. Other innovative technologies that will prove effective to engage customers both in-store and elsewhere are smart shelves, Wi-Fi hot spots, point-of-sales (POS) systems, virtual storefronts and endless aisles.Reinvention of Loyalty Programs: Loyalty programs offer an edge to retailers as customers keep coming back for more offers. However, the age-old reward programs are losing popularity among shoppers as the offers are sometimes irrelevant and benefit accumulation is slow.
"
834,TIF,"With the trends changing in the industry, retailers are now perking up their loyalty programs replacing loyalty cards with customized offers based on social information, behavioral patterns of shoppers, frequently bought items and other such details. Retailers who have shown stringent focus on enhancing rewards on their loyalty schemes include Nordstrom, Rite Aid Corp. (RAD  -  Free Report), Office Depot and many others.Impact of Social Media on Shopping Decisions: With the growing use of social networking sites by the masses, business firms have also entered social media to promote their business. Through the social media platforms retailers can advertise their brand and launch new products and campaigns. Companies also offer mobile coupons exclusively through these platforms, largely influencing shoppers’ buying decision.
"
835,TIF,"Additionally, these social networking sites provide an insight into customer preference based on the interest expressed by them on the products featured on these sites.Investing in Big Data to Track Shoppers: With the growing need for giving personal attention to shoppers, retailers are widely investing in analysis software like “Big Data” that help accumulate information regarding the behavioral patterns, history and background of customers. The analysis of this data facilitates the prediction of customer reaction, formulating pricing strategies, offering shopper-specific discounts and providing personalized recommendations to shoppers.
"
836,TIF,"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) is one retailer which has been involved in data analysis for quite some time now, offering tailored product recommendations based on the customer’s previous purchases.Growth of Retail in Emerging Markets: Having tapped most of the potential in the domestic market, retailers have started venturing into the emerging markets. Most retail chains are witnessing growing demand for their products in countries like Brazil, the Middle East, China and India and aims at growing their exposure in these countries over time. Some of the retailers venturing into these markets include The Gap (GPS  -  Free Report), Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL  -  Free Report), V.F. Corp. (VFC  -  Free Report) and Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report).Bottom Line
"
837,TIF,"Retailers are trying to remain competitive primarily by shifting focus to the long-term horizon and finding innovative solutions to create value, reduce operating costs and mitigate risks throughout the enterprise.
"
838,TIF,"Right-sizing inventories, enhancing efficiency and competence while bringing in technological advancements are the key agendas that retailers are focusing on. Moreover, cost-containment efforts and merchandise initiatives to improve margins are top priorities.
"
839,TIF,"Retail, owing to its huge spectrum, remains a lucrative investment avenue for investors. But the changing landscape wouldn’t kind to all operators and/or concepts. It will require flawless execution on the part of management teams to stay relevant in this day and age. The industry hasn’t done much in terms of stock price performance this year and the trend will likely remain in place some more.
"
840,TIF,"As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the retail industry over the long term. But what about investing in the space right now?

843,TIF,"Earnings Preview 3/19/10Earnings Season is winding down, but that does not mean it is over. Actually, it is about to start up again. Next week will bring 70 earnings reports, including 14 members of the S&P 500.We define the first quarter as any fiscal period ending in February, March or April, and 30 of the firms reporting will actually be reporting first quarter earnings (all February fiscal ends). Some of the higher profile firms to report will be Best Buy (BBY), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and Walgreen Co. (WAG).The economic data calendar will also be on the light side. The focus will be on housing data and then at the end of the week we get the final numbers on fourth quarter GDP. With a light earnings calendar, and a relatively light data calendar, there should be plenty of time to focus on the really important stuff, like college basketball.Political developments may also help set the tone of the market, as the vote on the Health Care reform bill is likely to happen this weekend. I think the vast majority of market commentators have it wrong, and that the market will react positively to its passage, and negatively if it fails.Monday• No significant data is due to be released.  We should know by the opening bell if Health Care reform has passed or not.Tuesday• Existing home sales are expected to slide to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.00 million from the January pace of 5.05 million. So far the second iteration of the “1st time buyer tax credit does not seem to be generating the response that it had the first time around in the fall. Existing home sales generate relatively little overall economic activity, and are thus much less important than are new home sales which are released the next day, even though there are far more existing home sales than new home sales. Existing home sales have been tumbling since November when they hit an interim peak of 6.49 million. The level of inventories will be very important, as will the months of supply.Wednesday• New home sales are expected to rebound slightly to an annual rate of 315,000 from 309,000 in January. The January figure was an all-time record low (the data goes back to 1963) and a far cry from the peak of 1.389 million set in July of 2005.  Normally, residential investment, which is largely the construction and sale of new houses, is the key locomotive in pulling the economy out of a recession. However, housing inventories, both new and used are still extremely high, especially if one considers the millions in “shadow inventory of people who are far behind on their mortgage payments or are already in the process of foreclosure. Unless new home sales pick up meaningfully -- and a rise of 1.0% from record-low levels is hardly meaningful -- it is hard to see how we will have a robust and sustained economic recovery. I consider this to be the most important data release of the week by a very wide margin.
"
844,TIF,"• New orders for Durable goods are expected to have risen by 0.5% on top of a 2.6% rise in January. However, the January numbers were all about autos. Excluding autos, they actually fell 1.0%, and are expected to rise by 0.3% in February.Thursday 
"
845,TIF,"• Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They fell 5,000 in the last week, to 457,000. After a huge downtrend from mid-April through the end of 2009, initial claims started to rise again, up in 7 of the 8 weeks before falling in the last three weeks. Last week was some good progress, but not good enough. We probably need for weekly claims (and the four-week moving average of them) to get down to near 400,000 to signal that the economy is, on balance, adding jobs. We are a lot closer now than we were last spring when they were running north of 640,000 on a consistent basis, but still have a ways to go.

846,TIF,"• Continuing claims have also been in a steep downtrend of late. However, that is in part due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks. If one factors in the extended claims paid by the Federal government as part of the Stimulus program, claims soared last week. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. Last week, regular continuing claims were 4.579 million, down 12,000 from the previous week. Extended claims (paid from Federal ARRA funds) were 6.044 million, a increase of 353,000. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.Friday

847,TIF,"• In the ""old news"" department, we get the final read on fourth quarter GDP. The second read showed growth of 5.9%, up from the first read of 5.7%, although 2/3 of the growth came from a slowdown in the rate of inventory liquidation (not actual restocking, just clearing out the shelves more slowly). The 5.9% figure is not likely to change significantly.Potential Positive SurprisesHistorically, the best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises are both a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. While normally firms that report better-than-expected earnings rise in reaction, that has not been the case so far this quarter. While pickings are getting slim, some of the companies that have these characteristics include:Phillips Van Heusen (PVH  -  Free Report) is expected to report EPS of 0.59, up from $0.31 per share a year ago. Last time out, PVH posted a positive surprise of 21.4%, and over the last month the mean estimate for its fourth quarter earnings is up 9.3%. PVH has a Zacks #1 Rank.Tiffany’s (TIF  -  Free Report) is expected to post ESP of $1.13, up from $0.85 a year ago. Last time, TIF beat expectations by 43.4%, and over the last month analysts have rised their estimates for the about to be reported quarter by 1.21%. TIF is a Zacks #2 Ranked stock.Potential Negative SurprisesConn’s (CONN) is expected to post EPS of $0.01 a share, versus $0.69 a year ago. Last time, they reported 480% below expectations (reported a loss when a profit was expected). For this Zacks #4 Ranked stock, analysts have cut the estimates for this quarter slightly over the last month by 81.3%.Texas Industries (TXI) is expected to lose $0.81 a share this quarter, versus earnings of $0.25 a share a year ago. They were 50% below expectations last time out. Analysts have cut the estimate for this quarter by 13.2% over the last month.  The stock holds a Zacks #5 Rank.Earnings CalendarCompany Ticker Qtr End EPS Est Year Ago EPS Last EPS Surprise % Next EPS Report Date Time Daily PriceBpz Resources BPZ 200912 -0.02 ($0.08) -166.67% 20100322 BTO 7.33China Transinfo CTFO 200912 0.22 $0.19  0.00% 20100322 BTO 7.9Copel-Adr Pr B ELP 200912 0.52 $0.29  11.54% 20100322 AMC 21.39Cti Industries CTIB 200912 0.09 $0.04  133.33% 20100322   2.65Cypress Biosci CYPB 200912 -0.13 ($0.19) 30.00% 20100322 BTO 5.04Gigamedia Ltd GIGM 200912 -0.04 $0.14  -140.00% 20100322 BTO 3.18Hasting Entmt HAST 201001 0.57 $0.41  -24.14% 20100322 BTO 4.21Maguire Pptys MPG 200912 -0.03 $0.04  -14.29% 20100322 AMC 2.63Rubio'S Restrnt RUBO 200912 -0.01 ($0.01) 20.00% 20100322 AMC 7.92Tiffany & Co TIF 201001 1.13 $0.85  43.48% 20100322 BTO 47.58Williams-Sonoma WSM 201001 0.73 $0.31  220.00% 20100322 BTO 24Adobe Systems ADBE 201002 0.3 $0.38  0.00% 20100323 AMC 35.75Antares Pharma AIS 200912 -0.03 ($0.04) -33.33% 20100323 AMC 1.48Carnival Corp CCL 201002 0.12 $0.33  20.00% 20100323 BTO 37.66Carnival Plc CUK 201002 0.1 $0.32  10.83% 20100323   39.83Cemig Sa -Adr CIG 200912 0.37 N/A N/A 20100323 AMC 16.62Darden Restrnt DRI 201002 0.92 $0.80  2.38% 20100323 AMC 43.49Digital Ally In DGLY 200912 0.06 ($0.06) -83.33% 20100323   2.08Inhibitex Inc INHX 200912 -0.09 ($0.08) 9.09% 20100323 BTO 1.36Jabil Circuit JBL 201002 0.22 $0.11  4.17% 20100323   17.73Kb Home KBH 201002 -0.45 ($0.75) -168.18% 20100323 BTO 17.64Lime Energy Co LIME 200912 -0.08 ($0.16) -84.62% 20100323 AMC 5.15Pharmathene Inc PIP 200912 -0.18 ($0.23) -105.26% 20100323   1.73Phillips Van He PVH 201001 0.59 $0.31  21.35% 20100323 AMC 54.08Progress Softwa PRGS 201002 0.38 $0.29  13.64% 20100323 AMC 32.44Sonic Corp SONC 201002 0.02 $0.08  -28.57% 20100323 AMC 11.15Steelcase Inc SCS 201002 0 ($0.04) 0.00% 20100323 BTO 7.27Sypris Solution SYPR 200912 -0.12 ($0.58) 85.71% 20100323   3.24Transcept Pharm TSPT 200912 -0.23 ($1.31) -2800.00% 20100323 AMC 7.46Unisource Enrgy UNS 201003 0.22 $0.64  3.70% 20100323 AMC 31.76Vertro Inc VTRO 200912 0.01 ($0.13) 0.00% 20100323 AMC 0.43Walgreen Co WAG 201002 0.71 $0.65  8.33% 20100323 DMT 34.82Amer Caresource ANCI 200912 0.01 $0.08  0.00% 20100324 AMC 1.84Cke Restaurants CKR 201001 0.07 $0.05  -6.25% 20100324 AMC 11.4Commercial Metl CMC 201002 -0.94 ($0.11) -340.00% 20100324 BTO 16.67Danaos Corp DAC 200912 0.26 $0.47  15.38% 20100324 AMC 4.56Delias Inc DLIA 201001 -0.06 ($0.01) 0.00% 20100324 BTO 2Genl Mills GIS 201002 0.93 $0.79  6.21% 20100324 BTO 73.64Lennar Corp -A LEN 201002 -0.32 ($0.27) 53.57% 20100324 BTO 16.54Omnova Solution OMN 201002 0.1 $0.02  73.33% 20100324 AMC 7.23Paychex Inc PAYX 201002 0.33 $0.36  6.06% 20100324 AMC 32.47Red Hat Inc RHT 201002 0.12 $0.14  8.33% 20100324 AMC 30.2Robbins & Myers RBN 201002 0.14 $0.46  0.00% 20100324 BTO 26.98Accenture Plc ACN 201002 0.61 $0.63  3.08% 20100325 AMC 42.28Ada-Es Inc ADES 200912 -0.35 ($0.10) -230.43% 20100325 BTO 7Amer Apparel APP 200912 0.04 $0.05  25.00% 20100325 AMC 3.37Best Buy BBY 201002 1.79 $1.61  23.26% 20100325 BTO 40.45Conagra Foods CAG 201002 0.43 $0.40  10.64% 20100325 BTO 25.86Conns Inc CONN 201001 0.01 $0.69  -480.00% 20100325 BTO 6.15Cost Plus Inc CPWM 201001 0.34 ($0.60) 8.18% 20100325 AMC 2.09Freds Inc FRED 201001 0.15 $0.20  -18.75% 20100325 BTO 10.41Full House Reso FLL 200912 0.07 $0.02  50.00% 20100325 BTO 3.18Inx Inc INXI 200912 -0.01 ($0.23) -500.00% 20100325 AMC 4.83Lululemon Athlt LULU 201001 0.29 $0.20  5.26% 20100325 BTO 34.83Mccormick & Co MKC 201002 0.47 $0.44  1.11% 20100325 BTO 38.85Ngp Cap Rsrcs NGPC 200912 0.17 $0.53  0.00% 20100325 BTO 8.88Oracle Corp ORCL 201002 0.36 $0.34  5.71% 20100325 AMC 25.38Saba Software SABA 201002 0.04 $0.06  25.00% 20100325 AMC 5.28Sabesp -Adr SBS 200912 1.39 $0.43  -42.20% 20100325   35.84Scholastic Corp SCHL 201002 -0.13 ($0.12) 21.16% 20100325 BTO 29.61Signet Grp Plc SIG 201001 1.2 $1.09  52.94% 20100325 DMT 29.33Smart Modular SMOD 201002 0.15 $0.04  20.00% 20100325 AMC 6.67Spectrum Contrl SPEC 201002 0.19 $0.17  0.00% 20100325 AMC 11.96Synnex Corp SNX 201002 0.62 $0.59  11.84% 20100325 AMC 31.38Texas Inds TXI 201002 -0.81 $0.25  -50.00% 20100325 BTO 38.15Tibco Software TIBX 201002 0.07 $0.07  16.67% 20100325 AMC 10.58Uti Worldwide UTIW 201001 0.15 $0.15  -5.26% 20100325 BTO 17.11Wet Seal Inc -A WTSLA 201001 0.08 $0.09  0.00% 20100325 AMC 4.47Finish Line-Cla FINL 201002 0.46 $0.36  100.00% 20100326 BTO 13.99Hearusa Inc EAR 200912 0.01 ($0.08) 0.00% 20100326   1.61Dirk van Dijk, CFA is the Chief Equity Strategist for Zacks.com.

852,TIF,"Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the last five quarters by an average of 22.7%.
"
853,TIF,"Company Description
"
854,TIF,"Tiffany & Co. is a jeweler and specialty retailer that designs, manufactures, and sells an extensive selection of jewelry as well as timepieces, sterling silverware, china, crystal, stationery, fragrances, and accessories.
"
855,TIF,"The Zacks Rank #1 stock has a dividend yield of 1.5%.
"
856,TIF,"Recent Results
"
857,TIF,"On January 12, Tiffany reported that worldwide sales increased 17% in November and December, due to growth in all three geographic segments.

"
865,TIF,"Industry Rank Analysis 2-10-10In evaluating the Zacks Industry Ranks, you want to see two things: a good overall score (low, meaning more Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks than #4 or #5-ranked stocks) and some improvement in the relative position from the prior week.It is also helpful to understand exactly what the Zacks industry rank is. It is the un-weighted average of the individual Zacks ranks of the firms in that industry. It does not matter if the stock is the 800-lb gorilla that dominates the industry or some very small niche player in the industry -- they have the same influence on the industry rank.Also, that means that the bigger the industry in terms of number of firms, the less influence any given company has on the industry rank. It also implies that small industries, with just two or three firms, should be the ones found at either the top or the bottom of the list.After all, if there are only two firms in the industry, it is relatively easy to get a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.00 (i.e. one with a Zacks Rank #1 and the other with a #3). Right now, that industry rank would be tied for 6th place among the 206 industries tracked.The same obviously goes for the bottom of the list as well. If there are 50 firms in the industry, and it ends up at one of the extremes, that means there has to be something pretty significant going on. Retail Rings It UpThe Retail sector jumped into first place at the sector level this week, with an overall score of 2.75, a very significant improvement over the 2.87 average last week. Given the number of firms in most sectors, the overall scores do not tend to move that far away from the neutral level of 3.00, and a 0.12 point move in a week is a noteworthy one.While being 0.25 points below the 3.00 level for a sector is not unheard of, it is not something that happens every week either. Note that the retail sector also has the highest revisions ratio for 2010 at 3.37, and its revisions ratio for 2011 is also extremely healthy at 2.61.The Auto sector, which is much smaller than Retail in terms of total number of firms, also posted a very nice improvement and is in second place.While most of the retail industries showed some improvement in their ranks, there were major differences in the overall levels the industries were at. For the best industries within the sector, it looked sort of  like a barbell strategy. Firms that cater to the lowest part of the income distribution did well, as did firms that were aimed at more frivolous luxury purchases.Jewelry SparklesWhile with Valentines Day almost upon us jewelry purchases might not seem that frivolous, but in the bigger scheme of things, does anyone really NEED jewelry? It is among the most discretionary of discretionary purchases. The group is relatively small with just four firms in it, but it moved up 57 spots to land in 9th place out of the 255 industries we now (just revamped and up from 206) cover.
"
866,TIF,"The overall Zacks Rank for the group is 2.00 -- a nice improvement from the 2.75 it had last week. The two firms sporting coveted Zacks #1 Ranks were Signet Group (SIG  -  Free Report) and Tiffany’s (TIF  -  Free Report).Discounters Make GainsThe customer profile for the average shopper at Big Lots (BIG  -  Free Report) could not be more different than the profile for the average shopper at Tiffany’s. Yet it too sports a Zacks #1 Rank and is part of the Discount Retailers. That group now sits in 22nd place after an improvement of 10 spots. Its overall Zacks Rank is at 2.31 vs. 2.38 last week. Other Discounters with Zacks #1 Ranks include Sears Holdings , the owner of K-Mart, and Tuesday Morning (TUES  -  Free Report).Convenience & Drug Stores Get BetterThe biggest improvement in overall positions were two stocks that ended up tied for 118th place among the 255 industries, both with perfectly boring overall industry ranks of 3.00. The Convenience stores vaulted 122 spots due to an improvement from an average rank of 3.50 last week, while the Drug stores improved 77 spots as last week they had an average rank of 3.17.Supermarkets Not So SuperAt the other end of the spectrum, though, is the Supermarket industry. While it too showed an improvement in rank of six spots, it is still mired in 232nd place overall with an average Zacks Rank of 3.40. Winn Dixie (WINN) decidedly does not look like a winner with a dreaded Zacks Rank of 5.The two big names in the industry, Kroger’s (KR  -  Free Report) and Safeway (SWY) look only a little bit better with Zacks Ranks of 4. In other words, it would make sense to do your investment shopping at places like Tiffany’s or Big Lots, not at the supermarket.Sector  ""This Week'sZacks Rank "" ""Week agoZacks Rank "" ""FY10Revisions Ratio "" ""FY10 EstimatesRevised Up "" ""FY10 EstimatesRevised Down "" ""FY11Revisions Ratio""Retail-Wholesale 2.75 2.87 3.37 717 213 2.61Auto-Tires-Trucks 2.81 3.08 2.57 118 46 2.84Consumer Staples 2.85 2.8 1.21 182 151 1.73Computer and Technology 2.86 2.86 2.22 1595 718 2.63Industrial Products 2.87 2.94 1.42 257 181 2.01Conglomerates 2.88 2.96 1.97 61 31 3.08Basic Materials 2.94 2.8 1.33 345 260 1.65Consumer Discretionary 2.95 3.02 1.74 462 265 1.9Oils-Energy 2.98 2.91 1.24 673 544 1.4Construction 2.99 3.04 1.1 121 110 1.09Medical 3 3.03 1.26 701 555 1.23Business Services 3.07 3.05 1.01 165 163 1.33Aerospace 3.1 3.02 0.98 83 85 0.64Transportation 3.15 3.15 0.81 240 296 1.06Utilities 3.16 3.1 0.63 150 239 0.6Finance 3.22 3.22 0.83 1014 1216 0.95Dirk van Dijk, CFA is the Chief Equity Strategist for Zacks.com.

879,TIF,"Analysts continue to raise more estimates than they are cutting. However, the ratio has slipped back for 2 weeks in a row now. Since the total number of revisions are still falling and near a seasonal low, the change is mostly driven by old estimates falling out of the totals, not a swam of new cuts. The increases are widespread with only 3 sectors seeing cuts on balance for 2009 and only 2 seeing net cuts for 2010.
"
880,TIF,"Total net income growth is in the process of turning around. The decline of 23.8% expected for the third quarter is well below the 30%+ declines we have been seeing in recent quarters, and growth should turn extremely positive in the fourth quarter. We are however talking about year-over-year changes, and the change says more about 2008 than it does about 2009. Almost all to the Q4 turnaround is due to the Financials. In the fourth quarter of last year, the S&P as a whole earned $69.7 billion before non recurring items as the Financial sector lost a total of $64.4 billion.
"
881,TIF,"In the fourth quarter of this year the S&P 500 is currently expected to earn
"
882,TIF,"$152.6 billion, for a swing of $82.8 billion. The financial sector is now expected to earn $17.1 billion (the quality of the earnings is still lousy), for a swing of $81.4 billion, or 99% of the total improvement. On a sequential basis, total net income is expected to fall for the S&P 500 by just 0.2% in the third quarter over the second quarter and to rise by 12.2% in the fourth quarter over the third quarter.
"
883,TIF,"Yes, the fourth quarter improvement is nice, but it is not as robust as the 119.9% year-over-year gain would seem to indicate. The third quarter is somewhat similar, in that year-over-year earnings growth excluding the financials is much worst than when including them, with a decline of 28.8% rather than 23.8%. The troubles started in the third quarter last year for the sector and then got really bad in the fourth quarter.

946,TIF,"Friday, March 16, 2018Much of our focus on economic data lately is in anticipation of the Fed meeting Tuesday and Wednesday next week, where odds are basically as a #1 seed versus a #16 that interest rates are going up 25 basis points for Jay Powell’s inaugural session as new Fed Chair. Mostly, analysts appear to be looking for signs of inflation accelerating in our current economy. Yet for every signal that may be happening, we see something else that walks some of that sentiment back.Take this morning’s Housing Starts and Permits reports for example, where we see a pullback in both measures for the month of February: -7% on new starts and -5.7% on the forward-indicating permits. And while this downturn in permits met estimates exactly, starts were roughly double the losses analysts were expecting. Last month, 1.236 million new seasonally adjusted, annualized housing starts were initiated, while 1.298 million permits were signed.This data has plenty of information “below the fold,” and often the headline can be somewhat misleading as a result. For today’s report, single-family starts actually went up; it was the multi-family units that were lagging. This betrays some of the disappointment here, as single-family units are generally of higher value and thus signs of an economy strengthening further.Then again, should we have seen big growth in starts and permits for last month, we may have seen evidence in the pre-market of inflation/interest rate jitters in the major indexes. But we don’t — the Dow looks to open up 41 points, the Nasdaq +17 and the S&P 500, which has yet to get off the mat this week, is trading up ahead of the bell 7 points.Tiffany Tops Q4 EstimatesLuxury retailer Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) reported earnings ahead of the bell today, beating the Zacks consensus on the bottom line by 4 cents per share to $1.67, whereas revenues of $1.33 billion topped the $1.30 billion expected. These figures represent growth on the bottom line of 15% and on the top by 8.5%.Guidance for full-year 2018 was pushed up measurably above the Zacks estimate of $4.09 per share to a range of $4.25-4.45.

949,TIF,"Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report), which designs, manufactures and retails jewelry and other items globally, is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 29. In the second quarter, the company posted positive earnings surprise of 4.6%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Investors are keen to find out whether Tiffany will be able to sustain its positive earnings surprise streak in the quarter to be reported. In the trailing four quarters, it had outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 7.4%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has decreased by a penny in the last seven days and is pegged at 76 cents, which is in line with the prior-year quarter figure. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $960 million, up more than 1% year over year.Factors at PlayTiffany’s omni-channel platform, store expansion programs, new design launches, tapping of new markets and venturing into new revenue generating avenues bode well for the stock. The company is well positioned to augment its top and bottom-line performance in the long run by leveraging capital investments made over the past several years in distribution, manufacturing and diamond sourcing processes.Analysts anticipate sales trends to improve across all operating regions. Per analysts surveyed by Zacks, revenues at Americas, Asia-Pacific, Europe and Japan are likely to increase 2.6%, 7.7%, 11.5% and 1.3%, respectively, during the third quarter.However, Tiffany’s comparable-store sales (comps) have been struggling for quite some time now. In the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, comps have declined 3% and 2%, respectively. Moreover, foreign currency headwinds and cautious consumer spending also remain causes of concern. However, the company plans to counter these obstacles through strategic initiatives and cost containment efforts.Tiffany & Co. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Tiffany & Co. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Tiffany & Co. QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Tiffany is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP — for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Tiffany has an Earnings ESP of +6.16% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. This makes us reasonably confident that the bottom line is likely to outperform estimates.Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Zumiez Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.69% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (AEO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.04% and a Zacks Rank #2.G-III Apparel Group, Ltd.

QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that TIF has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Tiffany, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

951,TIF,"Friday, November 24, 2017We hope everyone has recovered this morning from excessive dosages of l-tryptophan and starch-heavy diets yesterday. Today is Black Friday, of course — the day retailers traditionally turn a profit on their ledgers, switching from red ink to black. Massive discounts and promotions from retailers big and small mark this beginning of holiday season, helping shoppers work off their extra calories in getting a jump on holiday gift-giving season.Stock market participants will be paying extra attention to how companies like Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Tiffany’s (TIF  -  Free Report) perform in their fiscal fourth quarters, especially as Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) online juggernaut continues relatively unabated. Can companies like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) beat back Amazon’s extensive stock and ease of delivery? That, as it has been the past several years, looks to be the dominant narrative.Otherwise, we’ve got a shortened trading day today, and volume is expected to be light. Futures are up aheads of today’s opening bell, but we’re not seeing earnings reports from any large companies today; indeed, Q3 earnings season is effectively over but for a small handful of S&P 500 participants yet to report this quarter. However, we may be seeing a new string of gainful weeks beginning — after a strong Tuesday that brought a fresh wave of new all-time market highs, if the markets close today in the green, and there’s nothing on the horizon in coming weeks to provide headwinds toward further upside.News of the WorldThat said, following German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s failed coalition between her conservative CDU party and more liberal political factions, her polling among German citizens has fallen precipitously. Merkel is attempting to reconcile parliamentary power with the rival Social Democrats party, but now a majority of Germans do not want Merkel to run for re-election. A changing of the guard in Europe’s biggest economy — especially with a burgeoning far-right party called Alternative for Germany posing the first right-wing threat to German democracy since the Third Reich — could ripple into issues within the greater Eurozone over time.And disturbing news from the U.K.’s DailyMail.com reports that the Saudi billionaires placed under arrest by Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman three weeks ago are now being beaten and tortured as they are holed up in the Ritz Carlton-Riyadh. These billionaires include the man known as the “Warren Buffett of Saudi Arabia,” Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. These “interrogations” are reportedly being conducted by mercenaries from a private firm from the U.S. called Academi, the successor to notorious black-ops firm Blackwater. A spokesperson for Academi denies being in Saudi Arabia or ever having engaged in torture.Reportedly, the Crown Prince is using these men’s incarceration — where they are reportedly hung up by their feet and beaten — to extort over $194 billion from their bank accounts and seized assets. In other news from the Crown Prince, he has more recently publicly called Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei “the new Hitler of the Middle East.” This presents a shot across the bough on another Middle Eastern front for the U.S. biggest Muslim ally in the region. Stay tuned; there may be more darkness developing here on Black Friday and beyond.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

974,TIF,"Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 16. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Investors are keen on finding out whether Tiffany — a global designer, manufactures and retailer of jewelry and other items — will be able to sustain its positive earnings surprise streak in the fourth quarter. Notably, the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average of 5.3%. The consensus mark Estimate for the quarter is pegged at $1.63, up over 12% from the prior year. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,350 million, up above 6% year over year.Factors at PlayTiffany’s fourth-quarter results are likely to be driven by robust holiday season. In the quarter, net sales came in at $1.05 billion, up 8% from the prior-year period. Moreover, comparable-store sales (comps) increased 5%. While sales in the Americas rose 7% to $516 million, comps were up by 6%. Higher spending by local customers and growth across the United States, Canada and Latin America led to sales growth in the region. In the Asia-Pacific region, the metric was up 16% to $232 million while comps improved 7% primarily driven by fresh store opening and rise in wholesale sales. Increase in retail sales were owing to surge in spending mainly in mainland China, Hong Kong and Korea.Meanwhile, the company’s omni-channel platform, store expansion programs, new design launches, tapping of new markets and venturing into new revenue generating avenues bode well for the stock. Also, Tiffany is well positioned to augment its top- and bottom-line performance in the long run by leveraging capital investments made over the past several years in distribution, manufacturing and diamond sourcing processes.However, management had earlier guided SG&A expenses for the fiscal year to increase at a marginally higher rate compared to sales, on account of sustained investment in new signature women's fragrance, launch of new luxury accessories offerings and additional jewelry SKUs. This, in turn, might strain margins to an extent. In the first, second and third quarter of fiscal 2017, SG&A expenses had increased 0.2%, 3.7% and 3.3%, respectively.Tiffany & Co.

1052,TIF,"Nabors Industries (NBR  -  Free Report) fought through difficult challenges in its first quarter and achieved year-over-year improvements in earnings per share and revenue. As a result, the companys Average Broker Recommendation moved forward to 1.73. Nabors also believes it is on track for a strong year. Read what analysts are saying about NBR, along with three other companies with broker upgrades. Nabors Industries Ltd. (NBR  -  Free Report) had to contend with a number of challenges in its first quarter, including weaker market condition in its US and Canadian land drilling markets; but the drilling contractor still announced a solid performance. Revenues in the quarter advanced to $1.3 billion from $1.18 billion a year earlier, while earnings per share moved forward from 2006 and beat the consensus by 14.5%. A lower tax rate and share count aided in the quarters results. Nabors believes it is on track to achieve another strong year. Its Average Broker Recommendation has recently risen to 1.73.  
"
1053,TIF,"Analysts polled by Research Digest appreciate several of the companys fundamentals, including its efficient and experiment management, its projected strong free cash flow and its financial flexibility. Furthermore, the number of contracts it has secured allows for unprecedented visibility. Nabors also enjoys growth opportunities as land rig demand exceeds supply on a global basis. Also, high commodity prices and the scramble to increase global oil production capacity is driving international land drilling activity. Meanwhile, the company is increasing rig utilization rates and dayrates in a capacity-constrained, high demand environment.   View the Research Digest report for NBR.Other Large-Cap Stocks Recently Upgraded include:Nike, (NKE  -  Free Report) along with Foot Locker, announced earlier this week plans to open up to 50 House of Hoops by Foot Locker over the next three years. According to the companies, House of Hoops will be a hub for all things basketball offering exclusively Nike, Jordan and Converse basketball footwear, apparel and equipment product. The company reached 52-week highs on May 22 and May 23, and its Average Broker Recommendation is up to 1.63. 
"
1054,TIF,"Analysts like the Nikes increased focus on the womens markets, which they think is an attractive and underdeveloped opportunity for the company. It also boasts a strong balance sheet and cash balance, allowing Nike to make acquisitions where appropriate and leveraging its existing infrastructure. 
"
1055,TIF,"Analysts believe Nike is a good investment, according to Zacks Research Digest, and there is still upside in the stock since there is no other competitor at present that can match the companys scale, drive and innovation in footwear or apparel. Further, they think it could generate numerous growth opportunities over the longer term. Analysts also believe that China remains an opportunity for NKE, with 20% of the worlds population, and around five times the number of kids than in the US. The Chinese market has the potential to double (around $800M currently) by 2008.
"
1056,TIF," View the Research Digest report for NKE.Tiffany & Company (TIF  -  Free Report) recently announced that its Board increased its quarterly dividend by 20% to 12 cents per share from 10 cents. This marks the fifth straight year of dividend increases. Tiffanys chairman and CEO said the increase reflects the Boards confidence in its growth potential. The dividend will be paid on Jul 10 to stockholders of record on Jun 20. 
"
1057,TIF,"Tiffanys average broker recommendation is up to 1.82. Tiffanys brand strength remains the key to its long-term growth, according to most of the analysts at Zacks Research Digest. In addition to TIFs continuing strength in the international market, the company continues to add variety to product offerings at all price points, with fresh additions to the lineup procured indigenously as well as from its other designers. This helps to generate editorial coverage in the press and stimulate demand among new and existing loyal customers. Analysts are also positive on the addition of Frank Gehry to TIFs designer lineup, which should help drive incremental demand from a more contemporary customer. 
"
1058,TIF,"The recent weakness in consumer spending in Japan has created an additional challenge for the company. However, Tiffanys initiatives, such as new merchandise (Novo diamond), increased marketing, new management, and updated or relocated stores, should pay off in the long run and turn the business positive over time.
"
1059,TIF," View the Research Digest report for TIF. Rockwell Automation, Inc. (ROK) recently reached an agreement to acquire U.K. - based Industrial Control Services Group Ltd. for GBP 110 million (British pounds), or approximately $218 million. ICS trades and does business as ICS Triplex, which is a leading global supplier of critical control and safety solutions to process industries. With their industry expertise and strong customer relationships, ICS Triplex provides an important strategic fit for our rapidly expanding process control and safety solutions businesses, said ROK Chairman and CEO Keith Nosbusch.  
"
1060,TIF,"According to Zacks Research Digest, Rockwell has a great business model, with a significant number of diverse organic growth opportunities. Rockwell can generate good results even if execution is mixed in any one period. The company is steadily improving its ability to increase revenue in emerging economies, and in consumer facing industries. With integrated control and information platform, the companys relentless focus on execution is expected to produce incremental benefits in the future. Additionally, Rockwell has been generating strong free cash flow to help it reduce debt, support investment in growth areas and pay dividends, thereby making it an attractive choice for long-term investors.

1064,TIF,"Tuesday's pessimistic sentiment was a response Alcoa's (AA) disappointing report, which showed earnings and revenue that were below expectations, China's move to slow down growth and the possibility that the government will tax banks that received bailouts. 
"
1065,TIF,"Shares of AA were down 11% after the release the company's report post Monday's closing bell. The market found its results to be a discouraging indicator since, as one of the first big companies to report, it can often be considered a sign of overall corporate earnings. 
"
1066,TIF,"Also weighing on Alcoa and other raw materials producers, as well as the overall market, was China's tightening of its monetary policy. The country wants to contain growth, which could translate into a slower recovery in other countries and adversely impact companies that sell to China.

1068,TIF,"Tuesday's Dow slipped by 36.73 points, or 0.3%, to 10,627.26. The Nasdaq gave up 30.10 points, or 1.3%, closing at 2,282.31.
"
1069,TIF,"The S&P 500 declined by 10.76 points, or 0.9%, to 1,136.22. The index was up for the first 6 days of the year for the first time since 1987. 
"
1070,TIF,"Focus List UpdatesRehabcare Group (RHB) pulled back from its recent 52-week high at $33.61 after dropping 2.36% on the day. The surge of the last few days comes in response to shares breaking above a short-term level of resistance just above $31 that had developed over the last few weeks. 
"
1071,TIF,"Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report) also dropped in the weak market, falling 2.57% on the day after hitting a new 52-week high at $47.44 last week. We saw some slight upward movement on estimates this week, with the current year adding 2 cents to $4.68. The next-year estimate is also up 2 cents, pegged at $4.82, a 3% growth projection. 
"
1072,TIF,"China Green  got pummeled for 9.2%. China's government sent a signal that it will be on the lookout for runaway growth in the economy by selling higher yield bonds and raising reserve requirements for banks. The country has not hidden the fact that it is worried about inflation and speculative bubbles, but today hit home with investors. Today's loss was also exacerbated by profit taking. Estimates remain unchanged and there is no company specific news here. As far as I am concerned, there are still 1 billion mouths to feed and the global community is pushing the green movement. 
"
1073,TIF,"China Auto (CAAS  -  Free Report) was down about 6.2%. 
"
1074,TIF,"Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD  -  Free Report) announced an increase in its quarterly cash distribution rate paid to partners from 53 cents to 56 cents per common unit, or $2.24 per unit on an annualized basis. 
"
1075,TIF,"Perrigo Co. (PRGO  -  Free Report) has been surging lately, climbing 4.23% to $41.11 per share after earlier hitting a 52-week high of $41.53. There has been no major news on PRGO.    
"
1076,TIF,"Growth and Income UpdatesIBM (IBM  -  Free Report) gained 0.80% on no company news. However, famed value investor Bill Miller, of Legg Mason Trust, was on CNBC this morning talking up the stock as an excellent value play. His comments should not be a surprise. We've discussed the company's strong fundamentals repeatedly in the Elite Stock of the Day articles and in these commentaries since last May when we added it to the Growth & Income portfolio. Coach (COH) gained 0.73% on the session on sympathy with Tiffany (TIF  -  Free Report) which reported a strong holiday season and raised full year guidance. The luxury retailers are gaining some momentum as business appears to be strengthening. Coach is expected to report earnings on Jan 19.
"
1077,TIF,"Key Points:
"
1078,TIF,"•    Total Net Income for S&P 500 to almost double yr/yr in 4Q, mostly due to rebound in Finance
"
1079,TIF,"•    Total earnings expected to fall 7.1% sequentially, but look for positive surprises
"
1080,TIF,"•    After 2 years of declines, earnings expected to surge by 25.1% in 2010
"
1081,TIF,"•    Revenues to fall more than Earnings in 2009, rise less in 2010: Margins expanding
"
1082,TIF,"•    First quarter now expected to see 19.3% yr/yr earnings growth
"
1083,TIF,"•    2009 Earnings Revisions Ratio for full S&P 500 falls to 1.82, down from 2.12 last week - still high
"
1084,TIF,"•    2010 Revisions Ratio at 1.90, down from 1.92 last week
"
1085,TIF,"•    Firms up/firms down ratio at 1.65 for 2009, 1.45 for 2010
"
1086,TIF,"•    S&P500 expected to earn $571.6 billion in 2009, $715.0 billion in 2010
"
1087,TIF,"•    Bottom Up estimates: $62.27 for 2009, $77.74 for 2010
"
1088,TIF,"•    Top Down estimates: $57.45 for 2009, $73.45 for 2010Welcome to the new Earnings Trends. We have decided to start focusing our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so the new groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together. In addition, we for the first time are presenting top-line as well as bottom-line expectations and surprise information. This is very much of a work in progress, and we will be adding additional information, tables and perhaps even some graphs over the next few months.
"
1089,TIF,"The third quarter was a fantastic earnings season. With all of reports in, there have been 379 that exceeded expectations while only 72 have fallen short, a ratio of 5.26. While it is true that most companies will normally try to under-promise and over-deliver, this quarter the beats are beating the misses by about twice the normal margin of 3:1.
"
1090,TIF,"Nor have all the surprises only been by a penny or two, but there have been lots of companies that simply crushed the earnings estimates. The median surprise is a very high 7.07%. Over the last five years, a median surprise of about 3.0% has been normal.
"
1091,TIF,"Part of the reason is that expectations were set very low going into the earnings season. For most companies, their earnings are still below year-ago levels, just not as far down as people thought they would be. Only 226 firms have posted positive year-over-year growth, versus 271 which have fallen short of year-ago levels, a ratio of 0.83.
"
1092,TIF,"Now it is time to turn our focus to the fourth quarter. Saying that the market as a whole faces easy year-over-year comps is a bit like Noah remarking that it looks like rain. Total earnings in the fourth quarter are expected to be more than double year-ago levels, up 98.1%. This is mostly due to very easy comparisons after last year’s disaster.
"
1093,TIF,"However, the growth is very much concentrated in a few sectors, most notably the Financials, but with a nice assist from the Autos and Construction (although those sectors are far smaller). It is expected to be a quarter of huge margin expansion for the market as a whole, as year-over-year revenues are only expected to rise by 1.4%.
"
1094,TIF,"Because of the year-over-year distortion from the debacle that was last year’s fourth quarter, it is more instructive to look at the sequential growth (although keep in mind that some sectors, most notably Retail, are highly seasonal). There the picture is far more subdued, with total earnings in the fourth quarter actually expected to be 7.1% below third quarter levels. Although if we see even a normal amount of positive surprises, the level is probably going to be more like flat sequentially.
"
1095,TIF,"Aerospace is expected to be the sequential leader, but keep in mind that it was awful on a sequential basis in the 3Q, so that is not real strong evidence of a big underlying growth trend there. In all, 9 of the 16 sectors are expected to post lower total earnings in the 4Q than in the 3Q.
"
1096,TIF,"Looking at full-year earnings, total net income is still expected to be lower than that of 2008, but just by 5.6%, a much smaller decline than the 22.8% plunge of last year. Next year will be one of earnings recovery, with growth of 25.1% expected, but note that that will still leave earnings below 2007 levels.
"
1097,TIF,"While the data is still relatively thin for 2011, and thus should be taken with a grain of salt, further growth of 19.9% is expected for total earnings in 2011. In 2010, the percentage growth numbers will be astronomical for the Auto and Construction sectors, but that is due to dividing from close to zero.
"
1098,TIF,"Among the larger sectors, Basic Materials and the Financials are expected to be the growth leaders for the year. Energy is also expected to see a large rebound in its total profits. Together Finance and Energy will account for more than half of all the incremental earnings in 2010; even though together they account for only slightly over 25% of the total market capitalization of the index.
"
1099,TIF,"Cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings and earnings surprises. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company, or someone’s paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms. The bottom-up data coming out of all these individual firms seems to confirm what we have been getting from the macro statistics from the government.
"
1100,TIF,"The economy is growing due to increases in productivity -- higher GDP with fewer workers. While clearly companies cannot continue to grow earnings forever based only on cost cutting, it does mean that when they do start to see revenue growth, earnings growth could be explosive as the greater operating leverage kicks in.
"
1101,TIF,"The continued high revisions ratios for both 2009 and 2010 should give us confidence that those growth rates will actually be achieved, if not exceeded. The S&P 500 is selling for just 14.1x consensus expectations for 2010, or an earnings yield of 7.09%, or roughly twice the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. Stocks look very attractive, at least relative to bonds at this point.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise
"
1102,TIF,"•    Reports so far extremely positive relative to expectations
"
1103,TIF,"•    Earnings Surprise Ratio (#beat/#miss) at 5.26
"
1104,TIF,"•    Perfect: Conglomerates, 8 positive surprises, no disappointments; Business Service 8 and 0
"
1105,TIF,"•    Almost perfect: Medical with a ratio of 36 to 1; Industrials 20:1
"
1106,TIF,"•    Median Earnings Surprise 7.07%, a very strong reading
"
1107,TIF,"•    Year-over-year Earnings Growth Ratio (# Positive Growth/# Negative Growth) at 0.83
"
1108,TIF,"•    Massive positive surprises in cyclical Construction, Industrial and Discretionary sectors 
"
1109,TIF,"In evaluating the data presented here, keep the percentage reported in mind. For some sectors, the sample size is extremely small. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample.
"
1110,TIF,"Overall, two small sectors -- Conglomerates and Business Services -- appear to have the most impressive performance so far this quarter on the surprise front. Among the larger sectors, strong arguments could be made for Staples having the best surprise profile, although Industrials are also in contention.

"
1153,TIF,"The broad increases in earnings estimates seems to reflect a much better short-term outlook for the economy. Note that some of the most cyclical areas such as Transportation, Retailers and Autos are seeing a large preponderance of upward over downward earnings revisions, and that most of the firms in those sectors are seeing their consensus estimates increase.
"
1154,TIF,"On the other hand, the defensive Staples and Medical sectors have very high revisions ratio of 4.72 and 2.37, respectively, so it’s not just the cyclicals. Then again, given the great performance by the Staples on the surprise front, a strong estimate revisions performance is not surprising.

The revisions ratios are most useful when they are based on a large number of revisions, so take the numbers for the small sectors like Transportation and Business Service with a grain of salt.

Ahead of the company's fiscal second-quarter results, 2 of the covering brokerage analysts raised their profit projections.

1195,TIF,"In last week's edition of Trading Tools, we examined Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) after the Zacks Unusually High Option Volume screener indicated that the high-end jeweler was the target of a put spread. Employing the same filter for today's column, a different equity caught my eye: salesforce.com, inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) , the San Francisco-based provider of customer relationship management (CRM  hence the ticker) services to businesses worldwide. Before we begin, let's explain the contrarian stance that makes Schaeffer's so unique. When searching for a bullish pick, we like to see heavy skepticism toward an outperforming stock, as this leaves ample room for upgrades or other positive catalysts to fuel the stock higher. When searching for a bearish pick, on the other hand, contrarians are looking for significant bullish sentiment toward an underperforming stock, as we believe an excess of optimism is a sign that everyone has already bought into the stock and sideline money is virtually tapped out.  
"
1196,TIF,"However, keep in mind that some optimism and pessimism is genuinely warranted and isn't always a contrarian indicator  like an outperforming stock with many ""buy"" ratings or an underperforming stock with a plethora of ""sell"" ratings. Fascinated by 40
"
1197,TIF,"According to the Zacks screener, put players went crazy over CRM last Thursday. During the session, the security saw roughly 8,900 puts change hands  nearly 6 times its average daily volume of fewer than 1,700 contracts. As a result of the bombardment of bearish bets, the stock's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) jumped from 0.93 to 1.04 overnight. In other words, puts are now more popular than their call counterparts among options slated to expire within 3 months.  
"
1198,TIF,"Digging deeper into the data, it appears the CRM Jun 40 put was most popular Thursday, with approximately 4,100 new positions opened. On the flip side, the 40 strike also captivated call traders, with about 1,100 new contracts open. This round-number strike is now home to peak open interest in the front-month series, with roughly 5,500 puts and almost 2,000 calls in residence. A Victory for the Bears
"
1199,TIF,"Turns out, most visitors to the options pits were preparing for salesforce.com's turn in the earnings limelight after the closing bell Thursday. After scanning the firm's figures, it's clear the bearish options bettors won this battle.   
"
1200,TIF,"Though the business software sultan said first-quarter profit nearly doubled from a year ago, the company's prospects for the road ahead were not what the bulls wanted to hear. The firm said it expects to record revenue of $312 million to $313 million in the second quarter, below analysts' estimates. In addition, salesforce.com trimmed its full-year revenue outlook to between $1.25 billion and $1.27 billion, compared to prior projections for $1.30 billion to $1.33 billion in sales.  
"
1201,TIF,"""New business wasn't as strong as we hoped,"" said CFO Graham Smith, stating that new orders declined in the single digits on a percentage basis from a year prior. Plus, existing clients aren't adding new features as rapidly as a year ago, new customers are signing smaller contracts, and it's taking longer to close deals, according to Chief Executive Marc Benioff. Challenges on the Charts?
"
1202,TIF,"In light of the news, shares of CRM plummeted Friday. Furthermore, after outperforming the S&P 500 Index (SPX) by 18% during the past 60 trading sessions, the stock is now poised to close the month beneath support at its 10-week moving average for the first time since mid-February.  
"
1203,TIF,"What's more, the selling pressure could actually escalate in the near term, should salesforce's gloomy guidance spook the bulls. According to Zacks, the brokerage bunch had high hopes for CRM ahead of the report, with 14 out of 24 ranking analysts deeming the stock worthy of a ""buy"" or better rating. A fresh wave of downgrades from this optimistic outfit could spell trouble for the shares. 
"
1204,TIF,"Employing the Zacks Unusually High Option Volume screener, high-end jeweler Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) caught my eye.  Before we begin, let's explain the contrarian stance that makes Schaeffer's so unique. When searching for a bullish pick, we like to see heavy skepticism toward an outperforming stock, as this leaves ample room for upgrades or other positive catalysts to fuel the stock higher.

"
1206,TIF,"According to the Zacks screener, TIF was a favorite target among put traders on Thursday. More specifically, the security saw almost 20,000 puts cross the tape, nearly 7 times its average daily volume of fewer than 3,100 contracts. Most active was the stock's Jun 22 put, which saw roughly 12,250 contracts change hands. However, after digging deeper into the data, it appears that the majority of that volume crossed at the respective bid prices, suggesting they were sold.  
"
1207,TIF,"At 2:52 p.m. Eastern, several blocks totaling 12,000 Jun 22 put contracts crossed the tape at the bid price of $0.85. Since all were marked ""spread"", I searched for similar activity from other options at around the same time. After further research, I found complementary activity surrounding the TIF Jun 25 put, which saw several blocks totaling 6,000 contracts change hands near the ask price of $1.95, suggesting they were bought.  
"
1208,TIF,"Simply put, it appears that a savvy options player may have initiated a ratio spread with puts on TIF. A Posh Put Spread 
"
1209,TIF,"To initiate this strategy, a slightly bearish investor would buy a near-the-money put, and simultaneously sell two puts at a lower strike but with the same expiration. The strategy allows the trader to obtain the higher-strike put at a discount, as the premium paid is partially offset by the premium received from selling the lower-strike puts  resulting in a credit or small debit. Ideally, the spread strategist wants the underlying equity to end at the lower strike at options expiration.  
"
1210,TIF,"Breaking down the math for the aforementioned put-spread strategy, the trader  let's call her Holly, just for giggles  received $1.02 million for the 12,000 sold Jun 22 puts (premium of $0.85 x 100 shares x 12,000 contracts). On the flip side, Holly paid a premium of $1.17 million to purchase the 6,000 Jun 25 puts (premium of $1.95 x 100 shares x 6,000 contracts). When all was said and done, Holly incurred a net debit of $150,000 ($1.17 million - $1.02 million).  
"
1211,TIF,"In this case, Holly's ultimate goal is for the shares of TIF to end at the 22 level by options expiration on Friday, Jun 19. Her maximum potential profit is limited to $1.50, or $150,000, which is the difference between the strikes (25  22 = 3), minus the net debit paid ($1.50). If she would have established a net credit, her maximum potential profit would have been limited to the difference between the strikes, plus the net credit received.  
"
1212,TIF,"There are two breakeven points for this trade: 20.50, which is the strike of the sold puts less the maximum profit potential (22  1.50 = 22.50), and 23.50, which is the strike of the purchased puts less the net debit paid (25  1.50 = 23.50). In other words, shares of TIF can finish between 20.50 and 23.50 before Holly incurs a loss.   
"
1213,TIF,"Meanwhile, if the stock rallies past the 23.50 level by June options expiration, Holly's maximum potential loss on the position is limited to $150,000, which is the net debit paid. On the other hand, no matter how far TIF should fall before options expire, the most she can lose is $23.50, or $235,000, which is the strike of the sold put plus the net debit paid (22 + 1.50 = 23.50). In Conclusion... 
"
1214,TIF,"At last check, shares of TIF were flirting with the 25.50 level, a gain of 10 cents, or 0.4%, from yesterday's close. In order for Holly to capitalize on her strategy, the stock would need to backpedal about 12% from its current spot on the charts.    
"
1215,TIF,"What Holly has in her favor is time decay, which is eating away at the value of her 6,000 bought Jun 25 puts, but is also decreasing the value of her 12,000 sold Jun 22 puts. The maximum value of ratio spreads with puts is typically achieved closer to options expiration. What she must keep an eye on is the implied volatility of these two positions. Rising implied volatility is negative for her sold positions, and will overshadow any increase in the implied volatility of her purchased puts.  
"
1216,TIF,"Finally, before embarking on your own ratio-spread strategy, remember that although one of the puts you sold is covered with a bought put, your second sold put is still ""uncovered,"" and can leave you vulnerable to significant downside risk. In addition, investors will want to have stop-loss levels in place before initiating this strategy; if the stock falls too low, your portfolio could go from Fifth Avenue to Rikers Island. 
"
1217,TIF,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that offer solid prospects and selling those that appear risky. Again, at times it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential for further upside. Here we discuss one such stock, Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) with expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10.8% and a VGM Score of B. So far this year, the company’s shares have increased 15.6% compared with the industry’s decline of 2.6%.Driving FactorsTiffany holds a significant position in the world jewelry market owing to its distinctive brand appeal. The company is well positioned to augment both its top and bottom-line performance in the long run by leveraging capital investments made over the past several years in distribution, manufacturing and diamond sourcing processes. It is also looking at other revenue generating avenues, and this includes expansion into watch business.With nearly half of the total sales generated internationally, we believe that the company is well diversified from a regional perspective as well. Tiffany is also focusing on enhancing omni-channel platform. Previously, it had notified that its long-term objective is to attain ROA of at least 10% and ROE of at least 15%.The company is focused on opening smaller stores that offer selected collections of lower priced higher-margin product, which in turn boosts store productivity. Tiffany concentrates on improving sales per square foot through an increase in customer traffic and converting them into potential buyers by targeted advertising, ongoing sales training and customer-oriented initiatives. Management anticipates gross retail square footage growth of 2% in fiscal 2017.The company delivered fifth straight quarter of positive earnings surprise, when it posted second-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Net sales also grew and beat the Zacks consensus mark. The company registered sturdy wholesale sales of diamonds, higher wholesale sales in the Asia-Pacific region and robust e-commerce sales growth. Management continues to project mid-single-digit-percentage increase in earnings per share and low-single digit percentage growth in net sales in fiscal 2017.Hurdles to OvercomeManagement expects SG&A expenses for the fiscal year to increase at a marginally higher rate than sales on account of sustained investment in new signature women's fragrance, launch of new luxury accessories offerings and additional jewelry SKUs. This may strain margins to an extent.We also note that the company's comparable-store sales have been struggling for quite some time now. In the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, comps have declined 3% and 2%, respectively. Further, a mature domestic market, cautious consumer spending, foreign currency headwinds and stiff competition from Signet Jewelers Limited (SIG  -  Free Report) continue to pose concerns.Taking the pros and cons into consideration, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).2 Retail Stocks Hogging the LimelightIf you are interested in the retail space you can consider stocks such as Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

1231,TIF,"Markets closed mostly lower on Thursday after Core CPI data came in above expectations, increasing the overall rate of inflation to just below the Fed’s target rate. This raised speculations regarding a possible rate hike in the near future and weighed on the markets. Meanwhile, Dow gained for the third successive session and registered its 38th record close on Thursday. The S&P 500 declined after the retail shares tanked. In a series of latest threat, North Korea threatened to raze both Japan and the United States with nuclear weapons after the U.N. issued fresh sanctions against the country.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,203.48, gaining 0.2%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) decreased 0.1% to close at 2,495.62. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,454.28, declining 0.1%. A total of 6 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 5.8 billion shares. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1.09-to-1 ratio.  On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1.20-to-1 ratio.  The CBOE VIX increased 1.3% to close at 92.09.Dow Hits Another Record, Broader Markets End LowerThe Dow gained 45.30 points on Thursday to register its 38th record close for 2017. Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) contributed to most of the gains for the blue-chip index, rising 1.4% and 2.6% respectively. Shares of Boeing gained after the company announced plans to expand production of its 787 Dreamliner jets to 14 units in a month by 2019. Boeing possesses a Zacks Rank#2 (Buy), whereas United Technologies possesses a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 dropped almost 3 points to end lower after the consumer discretionary shares tanked. Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, five ended in the red, with consumer discretionary shares leading the decliners. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLY) was down 0.54%. Such losses were incurred due to a slump in the shares of retail stocks. Shares of Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) and Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) declined 4.8% and 2.2% respectively, weighing heavily on the S&P 500.An Uptick in Inflation Raises Expectations of a Rate Hike by FedThe Core CPI surged 0.4% for the month of August as compared to the consensus estimate of 0.3% increase for the same period. High rents and surging gas prices increased the cost of living in the United States in August. Gasoline prices surged last month as an aftermath of Hurricane Harvey and the economists do not expect the prices to go down anytime soon.Moreover, the shelter index –– an index for measuring the cost of shelter –– swelled 0.5% in August, posting its biggest monthly increase since 2005. Economists commented that such an increase was the result of surging housing costs in the United States. Moreover, the core index rose 0.2% for the same period, logging its highest increase in six months.Such high increase in the cost of living bolstered the rate of inflation to 1.9%, up from 1.7%. This resulted in speculations regarding a possible rate hike by the Fed as the figures for inflation came in just below the desired 2%. Such speculations caused broad based losses for the market.Meanwhile, the cost of medical care decreased in August. The cost of medical care gained a paltry 1.8% in the last 12 months, also marking its smallest gain since 1965. Economists believe such a low rate of growth can be owed to declining payouts to doctors. Moreover, the uncertainty about the future of Obamacare also contributed toward the retarding growth rate of medical care costs.Fresh Threats Surface from North KoreaIn the latest rhetoric, North Korea issued fresh threats to both Japan and the United States on Thursday in the wake of new sanctions by the UN on the Asian country. In a clear-cut statement, North Korea vowed to raze both Japan and United States with nuclear weapons. Geopolitical tensions between Pyongyang and Washington have escalated in the past after the Asian country tested a series of its nuclear missiles, one of them flying over Japan’s Hokkaido.Trump Agrees With the Democrats Once AgainOn Wednesday night, top leaders from the Democratic Party stated that they had reached an agreement with President Trump to protect the children of illegal immigrant in the United States. This comes in exchange of improved security at the border; however, it does not include funding for the physical wall along the U.S. - Mexico border. However, Trump tweeted on Thursday that no such deal had been reached with the Democrats.Stocks That Made HeadlinesBrown-Forman Boosts Investment in Cooperage, Cuts JobsBrown-Forman Corporation (BF.B  -  Free Report) has decided to invest $45 million in its cooperage located at MacLean Avenue in Louisville, KY, in order to manufacture high-quality barrels.

1232,TIF,"The recent struggles of the retail industry have been well-documented. While several major indices continue to flirt with new highs, traditional retail stocks have been hammered by changing consumer trends and a worldwide shift to online shopping.The popularity of e-commerce is nothing new, but it feels like 2017 has been the year that the floor has finally fallen out from under those companies who have not transitioned. And with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) deal to buy Whole Foods  getting approved this week, the online shopping king has entered a whole new market.Of course, some retailers are faring better than others. Big-box behemoths like Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) saw the writing on the wall years ago and invested heavily in their own digital platforms. Others, like Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and Tiffany & Co (TIF  -  Free Report), have proven to operate more “Amazon-proof” businesses.However, plenty of the world’s great retail brands have been hammered by digital competition. The once-iconic Sears  is hanging on by a thread, and department stores like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) have also tanked.But who has had it the worst? Take a look at three of the ugliest stocks in the retail industry below!1.       Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report)Just last week, Dick’s posted second-quarter earnings of 96 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.00. Management also significantly lowered its full-year outlook, guiding for earnings in the range of $2.80 - $3.00 per share—down from the previously announced $3.65 - $3.75 range.The report was the latest chapter in what has been an awful year for Dick’s. The stock tumbled to a 52-week low and is now down nearly 50% year-to-date. On top of this, we’ve now seen a whopping 13 negative revisions to its full-year and next-year earnings estimates, which have dragged the stock down to a Zacks Rank #5 (Sell). Dick’s will be further challenged by Nike’s (NKE  -  Free Report) decision to begin selling its products on Amazon—a move that only adds to the company’s competition. Looking ahead, profits are expected to slump by over 45% this quarter and 6% this fiscal year, and that regression is expected to continue into the next fiscal year as well. 2.       Ingles Markets (IMKTA  -  Free Report)In today’s retail landscape, it should come as no surprise that a regional supermarket chain like Ingles is struggling. As the staples of the grocery store become increasingly available online, it’s been tough enough for the industry’s giants to compete—let alone a company that doesn’t have the advantage of scale.Shares of Ingles have fallen more than 46% year-to-date, and the stock currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Earnings are expected to slump more than 12.3% this fiscal year, and the company’s cash flow has retracted nearly 1% already.On top of its questionable financial position right now, Ingles is the type of store that could be threatened the most by Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods. The suburban supermarket can keep up with trendy organic grocers because it can traditionally offer lower prices, but that might change soon. 3.       Vitamin Shoppe (VSI  -  Free Report)Vitamin Shoppe shares have been steadily dropping for years now, but 2017 has been a particular rough period for the company. The nutrition supplements retailer just missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings by over 40% in the latest quarter, extending its earnings-miss streak to three.The stock has now tumbled more than 75% year-to-date. Earnings are expected to slump more 66% this fiscal year, and sales are projected to tumble nearly 7%. That regression will continue next year, with earnings and sales expected to retract another 4% and 1%, respectively.   4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There’s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector. Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without.More importantly, it reveals 4 top stocks set to skyrocket on increasing demand for these devices.

1233,TIF,"On Thursday, shares of Signet Jewelers Ltd. (SIG  -  Free Report) have been rallying all day, and closed the day up over 16% in afternoon trading after the company, which owns jewelry brands like Kay, Zales, and Jared, reported strong second-quarter earnings and a new digital acquisition.Signet reported earnings of $1.33 per share, soaring past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 per share. Revenues came in at $1.4 billion, also beating our consensus estimate and growing almost 2% year-over-year. Same-store sales improved as well, increasing 1.4% during the quarter, while e-commerce sales rose 18.1% year-over-year. For an in-depth look at Signet’s earnings report, read: Signet Glitters on Q2 Earnings.Most notably, the company announced that it has scooped up R2Net for $328 million in an all-cash deal. Founded in 2007, R2Net has transformed over the years into a digital diamond supply chain platform, with technology that includes “proprietary 360° Diamond Display Technology, Virtual Ring Sizer and Ring Try-On mobile application,” according to Signet.R2Net’s current leadership team will remain in place, while co-founder Oded Edelman will become Signet’s chief digital innovation advisor. The company’s brands will be an independent division under Signet.One of R2Net’s biggest brands is online, millennial friendly jewelry retailer JamesAllen.com, and will likely become a huge asset for Signet going forward. Like many brick-and-mortar retailers, Signet has become increasingly focused on building its e-commerce presence as customers change the way they shop, especially for things like jewelry.In particular, JamesAllen.com will “add a leading, fast-growing online jeweler to our portfolio. The acquisition will enhance our innovation and digital capabilities with R2Net’s technology to create a best-in-class OmniChannel shopping experience across our banners,” said Virginia C. Drosos, Signet’s new CEO.This deal reminds me, at least, of Walmart’s (WMT  -  Free Report) $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com last year. With Jet, Walmart gained not only an e-commerce platform, but the retailer got Marc Lore, who is now the company’s president and CEO of Walmart eCommerce U.S. And under Lore, Walmart has bought Moosejaw, Modcloth, Bonobos, and Shoebuy, and is now collaborating with Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google to make shopping easier with the tech company’s voice assistant.Signet, too, is getting both a company with a strong digital and technological presence, in addition to an executive that is moving into a role overseeing a key area of growth.Signet In-DepthSignet is currently a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of ‘B.’ Year-to-date, the jewelry company has lost over 45% in value, while the S&P 500 has gained more than 8% during that same time frame. Its industry, Retail-Jewelry, sits in the top 41% of all 265 industries ranked on the Zacks Industry Rank.With a P/E of 7.77, Signet is very cheap compared to its overall industry, and especially compared to its market peers. Especially over the last 12 months, you’ll see how Signet’s valuation, while spiking late last year, has hovered below that double digit mark, and the stock has traded at a discount to the Retail-Jewelry industry since late 2016.Last year’s poor-performing holiday season, combined with lasting bad publicity from ongoing company scandals, have led to increased investor skepticism. Similar to apparel retailers, part of Signet’s valuation relies heavily on consumer perception. The stock trades cheap because of many factors, but its brands don’t resonate like they used to, and they certainly don’t have the same impact on consumers like jewelry competitors Movado (MOV  -  Free Report) and Tiffany (TIF  -  Free Report) do.Looking ahead, SIG still has some major growing pains to get through. Zacks expects the company to report an earnings loss of over 10% for the current year, with sales also declining about 3.5%. But if this latest earnings report is any indication, Signet is improving, and with its new digital initiative, the company has the opportunity to start changing both shoppers’ and Wall Street’s viewpoints.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.This proven stock-picking system is grounded on a single big idea that can be fortune shaping and life changing.

1234,TIF,"The struggling retail industry received a nice lift on Thursday morning following the release of several better-than-expected earnings reports, including those of iconic names like Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF  -  Free Report), Sears , and Tiffany’s (TIF  -  Free Report).Latest ResultsShares of apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch—a popular mall-based brand geared towards tweens, teens, and young adults—soared more than 15% in morning trading after the company reported narrower-than-expected losses.Abercrombie posted a loss of 23 cents per share, which was well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate calling for a 34 cent loss. This marked the first quarter in the last five in which Abercrombie surpassed estimates. Quarterly revenues of $779.3 million were also ahead of our $761.6 million consensus estimate, and the company cited strong sales from its Hollister brand as the reason for its improvement.Jewelry retailer Tiffany & Co. opened more than 2.5% higher after the company also posted improved earnings. Tiffany reported earnings of 92 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents and growing 9.5% year-over-year. Total revenues gained 3% to $960 million, which beat our consensus estimate of $933 million, and the company noted that strength in the Asia-Pacific region and moving more wholesale diamonds helped these results.Shares of Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) were also moving higher on Thursday morning. The bargain retailer gained more than 8.2% in early trading hours thanks to its strong earnings growth figures. Dollar Tree posted profits of 99 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents and soaring 37.5% year-over-year.Guess? Inc. (GES  -  Free Report), a clothing and accessories retailer, also soared after better-than-expected results. The stock gained nearly 17% in Thursday morning trading after the company notched earnings of 19 cents per share, crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents and gaining 26.7% from the year-ago quarter. For fiscal 2018, management now expects net revenues to rise between 6% and 7.5%, up from the previously-announced range of 3.5% to 5%.Specialty home goods retailer Williams-Sonoma (WSM  -  Free Report) reported its latest results last night. The stock is currently up more than 4% after posting positive comps and better-than-expected earnings of 61 cents per share. The company notched comps of 10.1% in its West Elm furniture stores.Finally, the once-dominant Sears, which has been hanging on for dear life over the past several years, moved more than 7.3% higher in early morning hours after posting narrower-than-expected losses. Sears reported a $2.34 per share loss, which topped the $2.48 share loss that analysts expected. Revenues of $4.37 billion also beat estimates of $4.21 billion, and Sears announced it would close a further 28 Kmart stores.The recent struggles of Sears have been well-documented, but if you want a better look at the rise-and-fall of one of America’s most iconic retail brands, check out this recent episode of the Shopping For Stocks podcast:Industry ReactionToday’s solid results gave the retail industry a much-needed boost. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) gained more than 2% in morning trading, while the VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH) was up about 0.35%. Overall, about 65% of the companies in our “Retail and Wholesale” sector were able to meet or surpass earnings estimates this quarter.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

1235,TIF,"Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report), which designs, manufactures and retails jewelry and other items globally, is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 24. In the first quarter, the company posted positive earnings surprise of 5.7%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?Investors are keen to find out whether Tiffany will continue with its positive earnings surprise streak in the quarter to be reported. In the trailing four quarters, it had outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 10.8%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 88 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of nearly 5%. We noted that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $931.5 million, almost flat from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayWe believe Tiffany’s omni-channel platform, store expansion programs, tapping of new markets and venturing into new revenue generating avenues have helped improve performance. These initiatives enabled the stock to outpace the industry in the past one year. The stock has surged 29.3%, while the industry has declined 3.3%.However, Tiffany’s performance in the Americas and Europe unveils a dismal picture. Sales in these regions have declined for five straight quarters now. Moreover, foreign currency headwinds and cautious consumer spending also remain causes of concern. However, the company plans to counter these obstacles through strategic initiatives and cost containment efforts.Tiffany & Co. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Tiffany & Co.

1236,TIF,"Today’s Bear of the Day is unique as it is a retail name but because it’s in the jewelry business it faces different risks. I’m talking about Signet Jewelers (SIG  -  Free Report). Signet Jewelers Limited engages in the retail sale of diamond jewelry, watches, and other products in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, and the Channel Islands. Its Sterling Jewelers division operates stores in malls and off-mall locations primarily under the Kay Jewelers, Kay Jewelers Outlet, Jared The Galleria of Jewelry, Jared Vault, and various mall-based regional brands. The bearish attitude in this stock isn’t centered on this upcoming quarter or even this year. It’s all about next year’s estimates. Our Zacks Consensus Estimate has come down from $6.52 to $6.18 for next year despite this year’s number looking strong. Estimates for this year have gone from $6.26 to $6.49. So while this upcoming earnings report may be solid, it’s the contraction next year down to $6.18 that should have investors worried.The bearish news has put the stock under pressure. It’s traded south of its 50-day moving average since diving below it after the November earnings report. After making new lows under $48 in early February the stock has poked its head above $50. The 50-day is still providing upside resistance overhead at $53.36. A decent earnings report could break this stock out of its funk, but only if next year’s numbers start to improve. Right now there’s not a single stock in this industry that’s ranked better than a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The retail jewelry industry ranks in the Bottom 7% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Both Movado Group (MOV  -  Free Report) and Tiffany (TIF  -  Free Report) are Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1237,TIF,"The recent volatility in the Wall Street rattled even the most ardent of investors, who started taking stock of their portfolio, overlooking the impressive earnings display by corporates for a while. Nevertheless, market for now seems to have somewhat settled trying to accommodate rising bond yields and a possible uptick in inflation with the backdrop dominated by the latest tax reform and healthy economic growth.Well, after the action-packed phase, the focus is back on the reporting cycle. The earnings season is in full swing, with results from more than 340 S&P 500 members out by now. But the main highlight of the show is yet to come for the Retail-Wholesale sector.How Is the Sector Faring?The Retail-Wholesale sector, which currently occupies the top 6% (1 out of 16) position in the list of 16 Zacks sectors, has advanced approximately 27% in a year and comfortably outperformed the S&P 500’s growth of roughly 14%. Moreover, according to the latest Earnings Trends, the sector is expected to record top and bottom-line growth of 8.9% and 7.2%, respectively, this earnings season.Favorable economic indicators along with friendlier fiscal and regulatory policies from the current regime bode well for the sector. Industry experts are of the opinion that gradual wage acceleration, a 17-year low unemployment rate and rising consumer confidence are enough to trigger consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.For obvious reasons, retailers are the end gainers. Moreover, National Retail Federation’s recent projection of an uptick in U.S. retail sales of 3.8-4.4% this year raises optimism. In addition, the recent cut in corporate tax rate will allow retailers to channelize the surplus money toward best possible alternatives. They may opt for a dividend hike or reduce debt load, or even create a corpus to fund acquisitions, otherwise invest in omni-channel capabilities, product launches and other innovations.Picking the Probable Winners This SeasonWe used the Zacks methodology and identified retail stocks that not only boast solid fundamentals but are also poised to beat estimates this earnings season. Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Thus, investors can count on these stocks which are most likely to trump estimates.Dillard's (DDS  -  Free Report), a fashion apparel, cosmetics, and home furnishing retailer, is a lucrative pick. The company is expected to announce fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Feb 20. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings is pegged at $1.73. The company registered a whooping positive earnings surprise of more than 100% in the preceding quarter. The stock has an Earnings ESP of +4.25% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Macy's (M  -  Free Report) is also worth a bet with a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.92%.

This department store retailer is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Feb 27.Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report), which is expected to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 7, is a solid bet with a long-term earnings growth rate of 13.3%.

This operator of membership warehouses is scheduled to come up with second-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results on Mar 7.We also suggest looking into Tiffany (TIF  -  Free Report), which is expected to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 16.

The company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.2% and has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 5.3% in the trailing four quarters.These stocks are not the only ones worth a gamble.

1238,TIF,"Valentine’s Day is here and people are splurging on gifts. This year, spending is expected to hit the second highest in the 15-year history as Americans are expected to spend an average of $143.56 or a total of $19.6 billion, as per the National Retail Federation’s survey.

1256,TIF,"The credit crunch has yet to have a meaningful impact on overall expectations for growth. Ahead of the ""official"" start of third-quarter earnings season, the Zacks Revisions Ratio, which measures the proportion of full-year earnings estimates being revised upwards relative to those being revised downwards over the preceding four weeks, is right about average at 0.82.
"
1257,TIF,"To put this number in perspective, I've compiled pre-earnings season trends in earnings estimate revisions for the past two years. These numbers represent the cumulative number of earnings forecasts that have been revised during the preceding four weeks for companies within the Zacks Rank universe1.
"

"
1259,TIF,"As you can see, brokerage analysts have not been more cautious (or less cautious) then they have at similar points over the past two years. A big reason is that in the face of a sinking greenback, record highs for crude and tightened lending standards, the economy and corporate profits are continuing to grow. As I stated last week, the median company within the within the S&P 1500 (S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600) is projected to have generated an 8.5% increase in profits during the third-quarter.
"
1260,TIF,"These numbers do conflict with some of the recent economic data that has been released. August durable goods orders declined 4.9%, the first decline since May. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index sank to a two-year low this month. The National Federation of Retailers predicted that this year's holiday shopping season will be the worse it has been in five years. Even Target (TGT  -  Free Report), whose sales had been holding up, recently slashed its September sales forecast. And I'm not even mentioning the housing numbers which just stunk.
"
1261,TIF,"So how does one reconcile this difference between the trend in earnings estimate revisions and the recent economic data? Durable goods orders are volatile and a single month's change really does not tell much. The trend over the next few months will be more important, especially if there is a notable, sustained drop because it will suggest that the credit crunch is widening. At this point, I don't believe that such a scenario will develop, but I do acknowledge that it is within the realm of possibilities. Consumer confidence surveys are interesting, but they do not necessarily reflect actual spending habits. A person can say he is more worried about the economy, but continue to visit Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) everyday. Retail sales were not strong over the summer, something that has already been factored into earnings forecasts. It is possible that profit projections for many retailers will have to be cut further.
"
1262,TIF,"On the other hand, there is evidence that Chicken Little is wrong about the outlook for stocks. There are many countries experiencing stronger growth than the U.S. and this adds to demand for exports. (The weak dollar makes U.S. exports more price competitive, an added plus.) Corporate balance sheets are strong overall. Demand for machinery, parts and technology (e.g. laptop computers), despite today's durable goods report, has been good. There are many companies that are enjoying pricing power. Even in retail, there are several companies that are doing just fine (e.g. Tiffany (TIF  -  Free Report) and Zumiez ). Plus, the U.S. economy is still growing, even if the pace of growth has slowed recently. Simply put, at the aggregate level, conditions for profit growth continue to exist.
"
1263,TIF,"Last week, brokerage analysts raised their full-year forecasts on five of the six stocks within Fertilizers. Those stocks were Agrium (AGU), CF Industries (CF  -  Free Report), Mosaic (MOS  -  Free Report), Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (POT) and Terra Industries (TRA). All five are Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy"") stocks.
"
1264,TIF,"The upgrades reflected optimism that these companies will continue to enjoy pricing power for the foreseeable future. Demand for potash and fertilizer have been strong and are expected to remain so. It's also worth noting that the upward revisions to estimates occurred as grain prices and other agriculture-related commodities are setting either record or 52-week highs.
"
1265,TIF,"The reaction to the fiscal third-quarter earnings reports from four of the major investment banking firms has been somewhat predictable given the numbers. Profit forecasts for both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 were cut on Bear Stearns (BSC) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report). Both firms missed the consensus estimate by sizeable margins because of the turmoil in the credit markets. Lehman Brothers (LEH) missed by a penny as it too was hit by the problems in the fixed-income markets. Brokerage analysts are split on the outlook, however, with two raising fiscal 2007 profit forecasts and three cutting fiscal 2007 forecasts. Notably, no analysts raised their forecasts for fiscal 2008, whereas four cut their forecasts. Forecasts for fiscal 2008 are down ten cents from a week ago to $7.66 per share.
"
1266,TIF,"Brokerage analysts raised their fiscal 2007 and 2008 forecasts on Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) after the firm topped expectations by nearly 40% with profits of $6.13 per share. GS was able to employ trading strategies to take advantage of the turmoil, though not all of its hedge funds followed the same practice. Forecasts for fiscal 2007 are at a new high with brokerage analysts now expecting profits of $23.67 per share versus $21.83 a week ago. Prior to the recent surprise, the consensus forecast had been falling. For fiscal 2008, the consensus estimate calls for profits of $22.45 per share versus $21.82 a week ago. Two months ago, the consensus estimate had stood at $22.80, however.
"
1267,TIF,"The big question going forward is how much merger and acquisition activity is going to occur over the next few quarters. The answer at this point is unknown. Higher raw material costs provide an incentive for companies to seek synergies through mergers as well as to grab additional market share. Investors are demanding better terms for companies that are not exhibiting financial strength, however, which is a headwind. In addition, the psychological impact of the credit crunch could make it harder for private equity firms to get favorable financing terms. This said, financing remains available for companies (and individuals) in strong financial shape.

During the past two weeks, all 12 covering brokerage analysts have raised their full-year earnings estimates on Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report). The current consensus estimate of $2.31 per share is 17 cents above the average forecast from a month ago.

1271,TIF,"Two weeks ago, TIF reported second-quarter earnings from continuing operations of 45 cents per share, 10 cents above expectations. Net sales rose 19%, paced by a very strong 7% increase in same-store sales (adjusted for currency fluctuations.) In the U.S., same-store sales rose 17%. CEO Michael Kowalski expects to maintain the pace of sales growth throughout the second-half of the year and raised his guidance as a result. Kowalski projects his company to generate full-year earnings within a range of $2.22 to $2.27 per share, up from previous guidance of $2.10 to $2.15 per share. TIF is a Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy"") stock and is classified in Retail-Jewelry Stores.
"
1272,TIF,"TIF's second-quarter report is noteworthy, because in general, the outlook for the overall retail sector has been mixed, at best. Even among high-end retailers, the outlook varies by company. For example, Movado (MOV  -  Free Report) reported better than expected results last week. (The company earned 45 cents per share versus expectations for 38 cents per share; net sales improved 10.2% to $139.5 million.) One of the covering brokerage analysts, however, cut his forecast for the third and fourth quarter following the report - a potential reflection of the fact that MOV experienced a decline in same-store sales at its namesake boutiques.
"
1273,TIF,"A similar picture exists for the high-end department stores. The majority of the covering brokerage analysts have upped their full-year forecasts for Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) within the past 30 days. The current consensus earnings estimate is $2.97 per share, three cents above the average forecast of a month ago. Conversely, the full-year consensus forecast for Saks (SKS) is down by a penny, to 45 cents per share. Six of the 10 covering brokerage analysts have lowered their projections, reflecting caution about key holiday sales. SKS has previously predicted that December same-store sales growth would likely be ""below average"". (Both JWN and SKS are Zacks #3 Rank (""hold"") stocks. JWN is classified in Retail-Apparel/Shoe and SKS is classified in Retail-Regional Department Stores.)
"
1274,TIF,"What this means to investors is that they need to use prudence when investing in retailers right now, including those targeting high-income consumers. There are some retailers, such as TIF, that are doing very well, but there are many others that are struggling. Although the current economic backdrop and the corresponding rise in consumer frugality are having an impact, there are many retailers who are being adversely affected by poor merchandising choices as well.
"
1275,TIF,"Tyson Foods' (TSN  -  Free Report) CEO, Richard Bonds, cut his company's guidance last week. Citing ""higher than expected live cattle costs and a decline in beef revenues"", Bonds guided for fiscal 2007 earnings to be in a range of 72 to 80 cents per share. At the end of July, the company had guided for profits to be in the range of 82 to 92 cents per share.
"
1276,TIF,"The reduction in guidance comes just two weeks after Smithfield Foods (SFD) exceeded fiscal first-quarter expectations with profits of 47 cents per share, six cents above expectations. Revenues rose by more than 20% to $3.4 billion, driven primarily by the acquisition of Armour-Eckrich. The majority of the covering brokerage analysts raised their fiscal 2008 forecasts following the report, pushing the consensus estimate 10 cents higher to $2.17 per share.
"
1277,TIF,"Although Smithfield Foods' CEO, Larry Pope, was optimistic about his company's prospects, he did acknowledge feed costs are rising. Higher feed costs are not only a problem for companies like SFD and TSN, but are also driving up costs for the consumer. Chinese inflation surged 6.5% last month as meat prices are up 49% over the past year. Grain costs are affecting human food as well. Yesterday, Sara Lee (SLE) executives told brokerage analysts that they intend to keep passing along higher wheat costs by raising bread prices. Wheat prices reached a record of $8.91 a bushel yesterday.
"
1278,TIF,"As I have said before, ethanol is the primary catalyst for rising food costs. It's simple supply and demand at work. The more farmland devoted to corn and sugar, the less there is for other foods. Similarly, the more corn and sugar devoted to ethanol, the less there is for humans and animals to consume. Add in worldwide economic growth and it is little wonder that trips to the grocery are more expensive than they used to be.

The revisions pushed the consensus earnings estimate up 2 cents to $1.39 per share. The most accurate estimate is slightly more bullish at $1.40 per share. It is possible that the revisions reflect the market share gained from the demise of Circuit City. BBY has topped expectations during 3 out of the last 4 quarters. Best Buy is scheduled to report on Thursday, Mar 26, before the start of trading.

These revisions pushed the consensus earnings estimate up by a penny to 44 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is slightly more bullish at 45 cents per share. The company has topped consensus estimates for 4 consecutive quarters. Dollar Tree is scheduled to report earnings on Tuesday, Nov 25, before the open of trading.
