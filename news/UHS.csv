1,UHS,"Stocks bets against a successful Trump presidency did nicely on Monday after his first big legislative initiative ended in massive failure.After the flop of RyanCare, which died on Friday before it even came to the House floor for a vote, hospital operators HCA Holdings (HCA) and Universal Health Services (UHS) were the best-performing S&P 500 issues.Shares of HCA jumped 5.2% and Universal Health surged 3.35% on the stock market today, while Tenet Healthcare (THC) closed up 1.4%, amid relief that House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to slash Medicaid spending has been tabled. Centene (CNC), a Medicaid-focused insurer with a big presence on the ObamaCare exchanges, gained 2.2%, and rival Molina Healthcare (MOH) rose 2.75%, as it continued to recover from a 30-month low hit early last week.But health care stocks weren't the only group expected to suffer under Trump's policies that were shining on Monday.Gold miners also rose as the precious metal appreciated to a one-month high on Monday. Newmont Mining (NEM) gained 1.3% and Royal Gold (RGLD) 2.4%. Gold prices perked up as the dollar and 10-year Treasury yield extended their recent declines amid doubts about President Trump's ability to deliver the promised fiscal fuel of tax cuts and infrastructure spending. IBD'S TAKE: The quick and sudden flop of RyanCare proved that President Trump knows how to cut losses. Expect him to do the same with deficit-neutral tax reform and quickly shift to old-fashioned, deficit-increasing tax cuts.Meanwhile, industrial commodity stocks were among the bigger losers amid concerns that faster growth might not materialize to improve the supply-demand balance.Copper miner Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) fell 4.7%, while oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL) lost 3.3%. Morgan Stanley (MS) shed 2.1% as falling market interest rates weighed on the entire financial sector.Most big health insurer stocks were lower on Monday, which might seem surprising after the demise of Ryan's plan that was estimated to shrink the ranks of the insured by 24 million.Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH) slipped 0.2%, while Anthem (ANTM) lost 0.3%. The investor reaction may be because health insurers would have benefited from the repeal of ObamaCare's health insurance tax and a further delay of its 40% tax on employer sponsored insurance plans that exceed a so-called ""Cadillac"" threshold. Further, health insurers pay tend to pay high tax rates and stand to benefit from a big cut in the corporate income-tax rate.RELATED:Stocks End Off Lows: ObamaCare Repeal Dead, Long Live Tax Cuts?Health Care Stocks Socked Again After CBO RyanCare ScoreFreeport-McMoRan Restarts Huge Mine; Rival Miners DiveThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

3,UHS,"Shares of hospitals and Medicaid-focused health insurers took another leg down on Friday as the divide among House Republicans over the bill to replace much of ObamaCare appeared to narrow.Among hospitals, Tenet Healthcare (THC) slid 5.3%, Universal Health Services (UHS) 1.7%, HCA Holdings (HCA) 1.3% and Lifepoint Health (LPNT) 1.8%. Medicaid-focused insurer Molina Healthcare (MOH) lost 2.5%, falling close to a 28-month low, while Centene (CNC) slipped 1.6%.Other insurers were faring better on Friday, with Anthem (ANTM) rising 0.1% and Dow industrials component UnitedHealth (UNH) 1.2%.After sinking on Tuesday after the release of the House Speaker Paul Ryan's American Health Care Act, hospital stocks had recovered the past few days. Mizuho Securities analyst Sheryl Skolnick noted that the apparent willingness of President Trump to back conservatives who want a faster phaseout of the Medicaid expansion might get the bill over the top in the House.The White House clarified Friday that it supports phasing out the Medicaid expansion after 2020, as the current AHCA would do. But that didn't help health stocks.Drug companies and biotechs including Mylan (MYL) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) also sold off on Tuesday as Ryan's bill was scrutinized. But that was likely due to a Tuesday morning Trump tweet: ""I am working on a new system where there will be competition in the Drug Industry. Pricing for the American people will come way down!""On Friday, Teva shares were up 1.3% Friday on the stock market today, while Mylan edged up 0.4%.Overall, markets were holding onto modest gains after a sizzling February jobs report. The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq were all up 0.2%-0.4%, although the Dow and other major indexes were on track to break a string of four straight weekly gains.In a research note, Mizuho Securities analyst Sheryl Skolnick said the upbeat assessment from House Majority Whip Steve Scalise offers something of a wake-up call to health care investors.""It has become clear that hospital investors were assuming that there was very little chance of a draconian repeal bill passing,"" Skolnick wrote.IBD'S TAKE: The parts of President Trump's economic agenda that investors are most excited about, tax cuts and infrastructure spending, are stuck in line behind ObamaCare.That still leaves plenty of doubt about how anything resembling the House bill can get enough support in the Senate. Five GOP senators have expressed serious concerns about unwinding the Medicaid expansion, let alone on the expedited basis that House conservatives want to see.Skolnick notes that Trump's support will carry a lot of weight in the House, but that may not be as true for senators in states like Maine and Colorado, where Hillary Clinton beat Trump. In Ohio, GOP Sen. Rob Portman far surpassed Trump's vote tally.Yet Skolnick is sticking with her bottom line that repeal and replace gets done. ""To be clear, we don't think the GOP can go home in 2018 without passing repeal, no matter how bad, no matter whether it's full repeal or not.""And Skolnick does think that any bill that emerges will be bad for the hospitals she covers: ""We see increased adverse selection in the individual market, reduced Medicaid funding in the long term, collapse of exchanges that currently work and soaring numbers of uninsured as creating real potential for pressure on hospital cash flows that likely hit hospital valuations in the next two years.""RELATED:Three Reasons TrumpCare Isn't Killing Hospital, Insurer Stocks Trump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesThe Biggest Puzzle About Paul Ryan's ObamaCare Repeal

Snap (SNAP) retreated in its first full week.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite fell modestly for the week, as plunging oil prices weighed on energy stocks, including Dow components Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX).

Saudi and other OPEC officials had been trying to convince markets that they will hold firm on cuts, but that's only encouraged U.S. shale producers to race in to fill the gap.Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) CEO Ben van Beurden said oil demand could peak as early as next decade but Chevron (CVX) CEO  John Watson said that peak demand is ""wishful thinking."" BP (BP) CEO Bob Dudley said Russia is ""very misunderstood"" and is a good business investment. Shell agreed to sell the majority of its Canadian oil sands assets and Exxon Mobil (XOM) bought natural gas assets off the shore of Mozambique. BP and Russia also announced natural gas expansion hopes during the conference.RELATED:The U.S. economy added 235,000 jobs in President Trump's first full month in office, while the unemployment rate dipped to 4.7%. Meanwhile, average hourly earnings rose 2.8% from a year ago, just a tad behind the fastest growth of the recovery. The Federal Reserve had already telegraphed a near-certain rate hike on March 15 before Friday's report confirmed the second straight month of stellar job gains. Job gains were lifted by warm weather, which fueled a 58,000 rise in construction employment. Yet enthusiasm about the Trump agenda of deregulation, tax cuts and infrastructure spending has clearly been a factor behind the spurt in job growth and economic confidence. The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index, though dipping slightly to 55.3 in March, remained close to February's 12-year high.The key question is whether the optimism — and strong job growth — is sustained throughout the spring, in which case the Fed's rate-hiking timetable will accelerate.RELATED:House Republicans rolled out legislation to repeal and replace much of ObamaCare, with the legislation clearing some hurdles despite opposition from various liberals, conservatives and moderates. Hospital operator, Tenet Healthcare (THC) sold off during the week amid concerns of losing paying customers. Rivals HCA Holdings (HCA) and Universal Health Services (UHS) also retreated. Insurers were mixed, with Anthem (ANTM) closing in on a 20-month peak. But Molina Healthcare (MOH) fell sharply. Meanwhile President Trump tweeted out that he's working on drug pricing, sending some drug and biotech stocks lower.RELATED:Shares of Snapchat-operator Snap (SNAP) reversed sharply following its initial public offering on March 2, when the stock jumped 44% from its IPO price of 17 on the first day of trading.

Snap fell 18.5% for the week to 22.07. Facebook (FB), which continued to roll out features that ape popular Snapchat offerings, hit a record high.RELATED:China mobile app Momo (MOMO) hit a record high after reporting fourth-quarter earnings that beat estimates, as did its first-quarter outlook.

Its stock soared 12% on Thursday, paring gains somewhat on Friday.RELATED:LGI Homes (LGIH) earned $1.01 a share, up 35% vs. a year earlier, while revenue climbed 34% to $234.6 million. Wall Street had expected EPS of 94 cents on sales of $235.9 million. The builder sees 2017 EPS of $4-$4.50, well above analyst targets of $3.74. LGI Homes shot up nearly 13% to a five-month high Tuesday. Meanwhile, other builders such as Lennar (LEN) and KB Home (KBH) continued to advance even with mortgage rates rising.RELATED:Ciena (CIEN) and Finisar (FNSR), both reported weaker-than-expected earnings and revenue, sending both stocks plunging and putting pressure on other fiber-optic gear makers. Ciena, a maker of fiber-optic systems, said fiscal Q1 adjusted earnings per share rose 44% while revenue climbed 8% but missed analyst forecasts. Ciena's current-quarter revenue guidance midpoint is above the Wall Street consensus. Finisar, a maker of optical components, reported adjusted Q3 EPS surged 136% while revenue jumped 23% to $380.6 million, also below targets.

5,UHS,"Health care ETFs fell on Tuesday, a day after Republican lawmakers unveiled their bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, replacing individual and employer mandates with age-based tax credits.Stocks in the sector were broadly lower at the opening bell, contributing most to a 0.3% decline in the benchmark S&P 500.Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV), the bellwether exchange traded fund offering exposure to health stocks in the S&P 500, gave up 0.9% on the stock market today. Top holding Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) was among the decliners in its 61-stock portfolio.The S&P's health care sector has outperformed the broad stock market so far in 2017 as it recovers from negative political rhetoric that contributed heavily to a rough 3% decline the previous year.XLV posted a 9.5% year-to-date gain through March 6, outpacing the S&P's 6.3% advance as well as returns for SPDR stablemates investing in other S&P 500 sectors.The health sector lagged postelection but is attempting to break to new highs after rallying for five straight weeks.

6,UHS,"The Republican plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare was finally unveiled late Monday, and analysts say it could lead to big drops in the number of insured.Under the proposed changes, 6 million-10 million Americans could lose coverage, according to estimates from S&P Global Ratings.Yet investors apparently saw little to fear from the House GOP plan that President Trump hailed as ""wonderful."" Among insurers with a big presence on the exchanges, Anthem (ANTM) closed 0.1% higher on the stock market today, while Centene (CNC) slipped 0.6% and Molina (MOH) fell 1.6%.The Dow Jones industrial average, Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index closed down.Anthem, Centene and Molina, along with Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH), also compete in the Medicaid managed care business and have profited from ObamaCare's expansion of the program for the poor and near-poor. UnitedHealth shares fell 0.2%.Hospital stocks did see a downdraft on Tuesday, with Tenet Healthcare (THC) tumbling 7.1%. But Universal Health Services (UHS) fell a more-modest 2.2% and HCA Holdings (HCA) shed 1.3%.Given the substantial future curtailment of government funding for health coverage built into the GOP plan, one might have expected more jarring losses. Insurers will no longer stand to benefit from ObamaCare's individual and employer mandates, which would be repealed.The House plan also would revive the so-called Cadillac tax on expensive health insurance plans in 2025, with a 40% tax on insurance the exceeds a certain cost threshold. Meanwhile, the rate of growth of Medicaid spending would be curtailed to the rate of the consumer price index for medical care, down one percentage point from a preliminary version of the House bill.So why are investors taking things more or less in stride? Here are three likely reasons:1) The chances of the bill ever becoming law appear to be fairly small. Both the relatively moderate and conservative wings of the GOP have signaled problems with the House approach. It's far from clear that the Ryan and Trump plan to thread the needle.IBD'S TAKE: The fight over ObamaCare is likely to increase doubts about President Trump's ability to enact the rest of his economic agenda including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. 2) For the insurers on the ObamaCare exchanges, the GOP changes might actually stabilize things in the near term, since the bill would lower the cost of coverage for younger adults and raise it for older adults.3) The House bill keeps the Medicaid expansion intact through 2020 and only gradually phases it out afterward. While the long run matters, investors are generally more focused on earnings within the next several years. That makes sense, given uncertainty about what Washington will do. Further, the House bill would restore government funds for hospitals that treat a disproportionate share of indigent patients.RELATED:The House GOP ObamaCare Repeal And Replace Plan: 7 Key PointsHow To Replace ObamaCare And Save Social SecuritySupernus, Valeant, Endo Stocks Lose Big After Trump Drug-Pricing TweetThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

7,UHS,"Leading indexes booked their third decline in four sessions Tuesday as stocks continued to consolidate below the market's March 1 high.The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.2%. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 each took looses of 0.3%.  Small caps continued to outpace the general market's decline, with the Russell 2000 ending off 0.6%.The Nasdaq and the Dow industrials made a brief, late-morning foray into positive territory as Apple (AAPL) reversed sharply out of its early losses. But the Dow did not touch 21,000 and both it and the Nasdaq quickly returned to narrow losses. Apple ended up 0.1%.Preliminary data showed volume climbing on the Nasdaq and the NYSE exchanges relative to end-of-day trade on Monday.Economic news appeared to have little impact on the stock market today, although the Federal Reserve's January consumer credit estimate showed credit borrowing contracted sharply during the month.  January trade data from the Commerce Department showed the deficit widening to $8.5 billion, in line with expectations.Data Storage led the roster of industry groups, bolstered by Nimble Storage's (NMBL) 45% gain, following news that Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) would acquire the company for $1 billion. Some other small plays in the group rose, possibly on takeover speculation: Pure Storage (PSTG) jumped 11%. Qualstar (QBAK) rocketed 14% higher. Shares of HPE ended effectively flat.The video game developer and cable satellite industries also marked up strong sessions.The recreational vehicle makers group dropped hard as Thor Industries (THO) dived 10% in powerful trade as investors took profits after the company reported a broadly solid fiscal second quarter. A 27% rise in earnings and a 63% revenue surge beat analyst expectations and validated management's strategy and execution of its $576 million acquisition of Jayco last year.Thor's decline broke below support at its 50-day moving average in heavy trade, and it reversed all gains from a 106.43 buy point. Both moves are sell signals.Other RV makers and suppliers also felt the undertow, with Winnebago (WGO), Patrick Industries (PATK) and Rev Group (REVG) all down more than 5%. LCI Industries (LCII) fell nearly 2%.Verizon Communications (VZ) dropped 1.2%, the only Dow stock to hit the 1% mark.

8,UHS,"A key House committee has proposed delaying any changes in Medicaid funding until 2020 to win over moderate Republicans as the effort to repeal and replace the major parts of ObamaCare runs into trouble.Although the ability of Republicans to bridge a wide divide between moderates and conservatives still looks iffy, especially in the Senate, the signal of retreat on Medicaid cuts had the health care sector breathing a sigh of relief.While the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite were slightly negative as of early afternoon in the stock market today, health stocks were mostly higher.Among hospitals, HCA Holdings (HCA) closed up 1.4% at 88.53, while Tenet Healthcare (THC) jumped 10% to 20.99 and Universal Health Services (UHS) gained 2.2% to 125.58.Among insurers, Molina Healthcare (MOH) was unchanged at 49.99, and Aetna (AET) climbed 0.9% to 130.69, while Dow component UnitedHealth Group (UNH) edged up 0.5% 168.20.Drugmakers, which also have benefited from President Trump backing away from earlier threats of an intervention to bring down the high cost of prescriptions, were mixed. Dow component Merck (MRK) rose 0.8%, but Pfizer (PFE), another Dow member, ended flat.IBD'S TAKE: The difficulty of Republicans in settling on a replacement for ObamaCare is threatening to sidetrack the rest of President Trump's economic agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending.The House Energy and Commerce Committee, which plays a key role in shaping health reform, will release a plan next week maintaining Medicaid funding levels until 2020, before cuts would take effect, the Wall Street Journal reported.The retreat by the House comes as GOP governors have been making their voices heard about preserving ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who has embraced the Medicaid expansion, met with Trump a week ago and has been among the leaders of the effort.RELATED:Biotechs Leap On Trump's Calls For Innovation, Speedy FDA ApprovalTrump's Big Speech Leaves Investors With Hope, Not Much Else

Nasdaq volume fell slightly.Markets hunkered down ahead of the 2 p.m. ET announcement, then turned sharply lower after 2:15. The downside also received an assist from oil prices, which veered 4% lower on news that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its production in November.That sent ExxonMobil (XOM) down 1.9%, the worst loss among Dow stocks. Energy issues took four of the five worst losses among S&P 500 listings.But at the bottom of the S&P 500 heap was Universal Health Services (UHS). The hospital operator dived 8% in huge trade after Raymond James downgraded the stock to market perform, from outperform. The report cited Sen. Chuck Grassley's request for an update on a federal investigation of the company.Hospital peers Tenet HealthCare (THC) and HCP (HCP) dropped more than 4% each.Nvidia (NVDA) easily topped the Nasdaq 100, ending up 6% after an upgrade to buy, from hold, by Evercore ISI Group.

GoPro announced late Tuesday that it would recall some 2,500 of its Karma drones sold amid a handful of reports of power failure. Last week GoPro missed on third-quarter revenue and gave weak guidance for the holiday quarter, signaling that the Karma drone and its new Hero 5 action camera were not going to be hits.GoPro plunged 4.1% to 10.41 in the stock market today. GoPro hit 9.75 intraday.RBC Capital Markets lowered his price target on TripAdvisor to 50 from 55 with a sector perform rating.

TripAdvisor plummeted nearly 16.2% to 52.95.Universal Health Services was downgraded to neutral from buy with its price target lowered to 135 from 150. Shares tumbled 6.9% to 119.26, but also climbed back from session lows. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to repeal ObamaCare. At the very least, he's unlikely to take aggressive action to shore up the faltering ObamaCare exchanges.Anthem (ANTM) last week said it may join other major U.S. health insurers in largely pulling out of ObamaCare's markets in 2018 if its financial results under the program don't improve next year.Anthem retreating from the Affordable Care Act would mean almost all major American for-profit health insurers have substantially pulled back from the law. The other big insurers — UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) — have already scaled back, after posting massive losses.Maxim Group lowered its price target on Wayfair to 45 from 49 but maintained a buy rating.

11,UHS,"The coming presidency of Donald Trump and the near-certain prospect he will try to unravel President Obama's Affordable Care Act sent shares of hospital stocks into cardiac arrest in Wednesday trading, while major insurers were mixed and drug wholesalers enjoyed a revival.Most of the nation's biggest hospital operators plunged by double digits, led by the likes of Tenet Healthcare (THC) and troubled Community Health Systems (CYH). Tenet stock lost a quarter of its value, dropping to 15.21. Community plummeted by 21.6% to 4.66.The nation's biggest hospital company, HCA Holdings (HCA), fell nearly 11% to 72.16, while LifePoint Health (LPNT) plunged 13.5% to 52.80. Universal Health Services' (UHS) drop was paltry by comparison, 6.9%, but still that gouged nearly $9 out of its shares, bringing it to 119.26.Hospitals are expected to take the brunt of an expected drop in federal health care funding. The demise of the ACA, commonly known as ObamaCare, could leave millions of Americans uninsured and unable to pay for hospitalization, thus cutting into the profits of major health care facilities' operators.Mizuho Securities analysts Sheryl Skolnick and Ann Hynes said in a note to clients that Trump's victory, along with Republicans managing to retain control of the House and Senate, does not bode well for health care companies.""(A) GOP Triple Play, the worst possible outcome for (health care) stocks, is a reality,"" the analysts said in a note to clients. ""We see extreme risk of ACA repeal-replace, loss of the Medicaid expansion, a primary driver of results for both hospitals and health plans, and reversal of the many value-based regulations that promote home health care.""Insurers, however, were beginning to cut ties with the ambitious health-coverage plan even before Trump's surprise victory in Tuesday's election, so the effect on them was mixed.

16,UHS,"One way to win a big contract is to persuade existing customers to buy your companion products.Another way to win is to buy your rival and sell your products to your ex-rival's customers.Cerner (CERN), one of the largest makers of software for the health care industry, did it both ways when it persuaded the second-largest publicly traded hospital chain in the U.S., Universal Health Services (UHS), to upgrade from its Siemens (SIEGY) Invision revenue-cycle software to Cerner's new Millennium Revenue Cycle suite.First, Cerner took out the competitor, Siemens Health Services, for $1.3 billion in February 2015. Then it went to work on Siemens' revenue-cycle client Universal Health, which was already a Cerner customer in that it used Cerner's  electronic health records (EHR) and health information management (HIM) software on the clinical side of the medical profession.But for the business side -- to handle patient eligibility, co-pays, coding claims, tracking, collections and following up on claim denials -- Universal Health was using Siemens' Invision.Cerner's new Millennium Revenue Cycle product handles both the medical and business sides, while integrating with the federal government's push toward electronic health records (EHR) and PopHealth analytics to inform medical and administrative decision makers, as well as regulators and policymakers.""The size of the deal is unknown, and considering UHS is switching from one CERN-owned platform (Siemens' Invision) to the core CERN Millennium platform, the contribution will not be as large as if it were a completely new customer,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Close in a research note Thursday.Hey, money isn't everything.""Just as important as the size of the deal, however, is the signature nature of the Siemens conversion to Millennium Revenue Cycle for Cerner,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst David Francis in a Thursday research note. ""While the clinical side of Cerner's Millennium offering has been highly regarded for some time, there have been pockets of questions recently about Cerner's revenue-cycle capabilities for large enterprises.""The UHS decision to replace Invision ... is a major conversion and should help Cerner in convincing other Siemens financial users to strongly consider not only moving their clinical platform to Millennium, but their financial solution as well.""Cerner announced the Universal Health deal after Wednesday's market close. In the stock market today, Cerner shares rose 1.4% to a two-month high of 55.98, 26% off an all-time high of 75.72 set nearly a year earlier, April 13, and down 12% for the year.Universal Health stock fell 1% to 123.04, 17% off  its record high of 148.57, set Aug. 5.

163,UHS,"There's nothing like a steady stream of acquisitions to bulk up a company's market position. Add to that ongoing internal expansion, strong demand, and a push into new market segments and regions and you've got the power behind the strong growth at Acadia Healthcare Co. (ACHC)Acadia is a provider of inpatient behavioral health care services. It operates 224 behavioral health care facilities with roughly 9,000 beds in 37 states, the United Kingdom and Puerto Rico. Acadia provides psychiatric and chemical dependency services to its patients in a variety of settings, including inpatient psychiatric hospitals, residential treatment centers, outpatient clinics and therapeutic school-based programs.The company has been on a long-running winning streak, with nine straight quarters of double-digit year-over-year profit growth. In each of the last three quarters, both profit and revenue were up more than 50%.Investors have taken notice. Acadia's stock price has jumped 25% since the start of the year.Becoming A Bigger PlayerAcadia, a major consolidator in its fragmented industry, is primed to keep up the robust growth pace as it benefits from a combination of acquisitions, which expand its reach in new and existing markets. And it continues to grow organically by adding new facilities and upping the bed count in its existing ones.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year 2015 earnings to climb 39% to $2.14 a share. They see a 25% gain in 2016 and a 30% increase in 2017.""Acadia has a very good balance between organic growth and acquisition-driven growth,"" Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut told IBD. ""It has been delivering fairly consistent organic revenue growth of about 10% since 2011.""Acadia's growth strategy, he adds, is to keep growing organically at a 10% ""clip"" from new facility development and bed additions and to ""supplement"" that growth with acquisitions.He estimates that Acadia is on track to reach a revenue run rate (annualized revenue) of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion as it exits 2015.The company's goal, he adds, is to increase the run rate to $4 billion by the end of 2018.Such lofty growth has been a draw for investors, says Tanquilut.""There aren't too many companies that can grow consistently at this healthy pace and at a very sustained level,"" he said. ""By 2018 it's looking at a $4 billion revenue run rate from (almost) nothing in 2011. For growth investors and those looking for consistent, sustainable upside, (this is) a company that has a track record of consistently delivering those two things.""Adds Deutsche Bank analyst Darren Lehrich: ""The company has benefited from two drivers of growth — acquisitions and organic growth — which have come together very nicely the past several years,"" he told IBD. ""They've been able to turn high single-digit to low double-digit same-store growth (in existing facilities) into very strong organic growth. They have a lot of operating leverage as the occupancy rates in the facilities continue to grow. It's a demand driven dynamic.""Lehrich says Acadia has created a ""pretty stable pipeline"" of new facilities and bed expansions. Every quarter, he adds, Acadia adds beds to facilities in existing markets where it sees high occupancy rates and the need for more beds.""When they add those beds they fill them instantly,"" Lehrich said. ""It's a very important tailwind to their growth rate: making decisions to meet market demand where they know they can fill those beds up over time.""Demand for Acadia's services, he adds, is being driven by a few factors, including better benefits for behavioral health care services and more awareness of psychiatric disorders in communities, homes and schools.Founded in 2005, Acadia went through a metamorphosis when a new seasoned management team entered the scene in 2011. The team was led by industry veteran and CEO Joey Jacobs, who came to Acadia from Psychiatric Solutions, which was acquired by Universal Health Services (UHS) in 2010.Evolving AcadiaJacobs and his team put Acadia on the acquisition trail at the start and have been on a buying spree since.Most recently it announced three acquisitions, two in the U.K., closed on June 1, and one in the U.S., which it expects to close on July 1.A key acquisition was the purchase of Partnerships in Care for $661.7 million in July 2014, analysts say. Partnerships in Care is the second largest independent provider of inpatient behavioral health care services in the U.K. It marked Acadia's entry into the U.K. market.""That acquisition diversified them outside the U.S. and opened them up to a new market opportunity,"" said Tanquilut.""The National Health Service in the U.K. is increasingly shifting more psychiatric services to private operators,"" he said. ""That is in the early stages of playing out. (The U.K.) is a new growth path for them. The U.K. has an even better growth profile than the U.S.""Another key purchase, which closed in February 2015, was the $1.3 billion acquisition of CRC Health Group, its biggest deal so far. CRC is a provider of treatment services related to substance abuse and other addiction and behavioral disorders. It's the largest player in the substance abuse space, says Tanquilut.""The substance abuse space is probably one of the fastest growing sub-segments in the health care space,"" he said. ""Acadia is driving even more growth by going beyond their legacy acute behavioral health care business.""In the first quarter, earnings jumped 54% from a year earlier to 43 cents a share. Sales surged 82% to $365.8 million.The strong first quarter growth in revenue and earnings, ""primarily"" reflected the acquisitions of CRC and Partnerships in Care, CEO Jacobs said in a statement.More deals are on tap.""There is acquisition pipelines across all our markets,"" Jacobs said on the conference call. ""We expect to announce additional transactions during the rest of 2015.""Tanquilut says management's experience in behavioral health care and in doing M&A works to the company's advantage.""They have a good reputation among other providers,"" he said. ""When people are looking to sell, they know they are good operators and they will take care of their assets. That's part of the reason why Acadia is a good acquisition growth story. Management has a lot of experience and knows where to go to find deals.""Acadia is part of IBD's Medical-Outpatient/Home Care industry group. It leads the group with a Composite Rating of 98 out of a possible 99, along with AmSurg (AMSG), while larger Mednax (MD) has a still-strong 93.

214,UHS,"ETFs that track the iconic S&P 500 index can produce very different results. They may approach that benchmark's investment universe from distinct angles. Most give investors plain-vanilla broad exposure to the U.S. stock market.

"
216,UHS,"These three S&P 500 exchange traded funds exemplify those differences:
"
217,UHS,"For most ETF investors, the mighty $174.28 billion SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) represents both the broad market and the benchmark against which they compare the performance of other investments. SPY has a simple goal — diversified, efficient exposure to roughly 500 U.S. large-cap and some midcap stocks.
"
218,UHS,"A market-cap-weighted ETF, it gives a bigger weighting to larger stocks. Big price changes in these holdings can have a dramatic impact on the value of a cap-weighted ETF.
"
219,UHS,"Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are its top three holdings, weighing in at about 4% for Apple and 2% for the other two. More recent additions include IBD Leaderboard stocks Mallinckrodt (MNK), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).
"
220,UHS,"SPY has a 0.09% expense ratio, or $9 in fees for every $10,000 invested. It's up 3% in 2015 and produced an average annual gain of 20.4% in the past three years.
"
221,UHS,"The $11.41 billion Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight (RSP) owns all the stocks in the S&P 500, but gives greater weight to smaller stocks. A smart beta ETF, it follows an equal-weighted index. This method gives each stock more or less the same portfolio weighting. Apple, with a market cap of $742.5 billion, gets a 0.2% stake in RSP. So does IBD 50 stock United Health Services (UHS), whose market cap is $12.6 billion.
"
222,UHS,"In SPY, United Health has a 0.06% weight.
"
223,UHS,"RSP has a 0.4% expense ratio. It has gained 2% year to date and averaged an annual 22.5% advance in the past three years.
"
224,UHS,"Its returns also beat SPY's in the past five- and 10-year periods. Its stock market gains were helped in part by the skew towards smaller stocks in the underlying index. These companies tend to outperform when the market's in a strong uptrend.
"
225,UHS,"PowerShares S&P Low Volatility (SPLV) is also a smart beta ETF. It selects the 100 S&P 500 stocks with the lowest volatility and gives bigger weightings to those that are less volatile. But those differences are relatively small.
"
226,UHS,"Stericycle (SRCL), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Allstate (ALL) are its top three holdings. They get a 1.2% portfolio weighting. The stocks with the smallest weightings get 0.9%.

"
228,UHS,"But this low-vol ETF should hold up better than its S&P 500 peers if the market trends down and in the long term, experts say. It does not have a five-year return history.

The Nasdaq fought to a 0.2% gain, and the S&P 500 — haltered by heavy losses from Akamai Technologies (AKAM) and Universal Health Services (UHS) — managed a narrowly positive finish. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 also made new highs before paring gains.Some of the day's most dramatic moves came from big caps, not just Boeing, but Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and AT&T (T). Akamai, United Health and Triumph Group (TGI) were on the casualties list.The Nasdaq briefly took a new high before trimming gains. The Dow took and held new high ground above 21,681. Small caps slipped out of their recent strong performance, with the Russell 2000 dropping nearly 0.6% after climbing 0.9% to a new high on Tuesday. The Russell remained positive for the week, up 0.6% and working on its sixth straight weekly advance.The Federal Open Market Committee voted to hold interest rates steady, and offered no signal that it had modified its stance toward an additional rate hike later this year, after increases in March and in June. The Fed also said it plans to begin reducing its $4.5 trillion in bond debt ""relatively soon,"" a process many analyst had not expected to begin until sometime in 2018.The major indexes had come off their highs well before the FOMC release, and mildly trended further lower after the 2 p.m. ET announcement.

272,UHS,"TrumpCare isn't going to pass, the U.S. economy won't get a Trump-fueled bounce and the S&P 500 index will end the year at 2400, slightly lower than current levels, Goldman Sachs analysts said on Wednesday.A day after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell scrapped plans for a TrumpCare vote this week amid growing opposition, Goldman political analyst Alec Phillips concluded, ""At this point, enactment of broad health legislation like the House passed or the Senate is contemplating seems unlikely.""Although financial markets slumped on Tuesday, with a late bout of selling after the TrumpCare news, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite all recorded solid gains in Wednesday trading intraday, with technology stocks bouncing after bearing the brunt of the prior day's sell-off.The good news from Goldman is that, unlike in March, when markets dove as prospects for ObamaCare repeal dimmed in the House, investor confidence in the ability of the Trump administration and the GOP Congress to push through sweeping legislation has already been wounded.Bank stocks rallied for a third straight day on Wednesday amid a rise in Treasury yields and good news on their stress tests. (Investors expect positive results and shareholder returns approved in the second round of stress test results late Wednesday.)Bank of America (BAC) climbed 2.6% and Wells Fargo (WFC) 2.2%. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) rose 2% to 89.82, breaking out of a double-bottom base buy point of 89.23. That's a big change from how bank stocks behaved when TrumpCare suffered its first big setback in March, with Wells Fargo sliding 3% on March 21, JPMorgan Chase almost 6% and Bank of America nearly 6%.""At this stage, it seems fairly clear that intraparty disputes and a thin margin in the Senate have made sweeping reforms difficult,"" so there's unlikely to be an significant market fallout, Phillips wrote.Hospital stocks, which could suffer from the steep cuts in Medicaid and a rise in the uninsured projected under TrumpCare, were among the leaders on Wednesday. Universal Health Services (UHS) rose 2%, HCA Healthcare (HCA) 1.1% and Tenet Healthcare (THC) 3%.Insurers were broadly, though modestly, higher, with UnitedHealth Group (UNH) rising 0.6%. UnitedHealth, a Dow industrials component like JPMorgan, has mostly exited the ObamaCare exchanges. But UnitedHealth is a big player in the Medicaid managed care market, which could be stunted by TrumpCare. On the other hand, TrumpCare would kill off a health insurance tax, a priority for UnitedHealth and other insurers.IBD'S TAKE: IBD revised the market trend to ""uptrend under pressure"" on Tuesday, a status that means investors should exercise extra caution in buying stocks and consider taking profits to raise cash for when the turbulence clears. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to get the latest on the market trend and what it means for your investing.The less encouraging news from Goldman is that there's not much reason for investors to be excited about prospects for the broader market or economy over the next several years. Goldman's chief equity strategist, David Kostin, raised his year-end target for the S&P 500 to 2400 from 2300, but that's about 1% below Tuesday's close. He sees dismal returns in the next two years as ""late-cycle dynamics"" yield positive but decelerating sales and earnings growth. His year-end targets for 2018 and 2019 are 2500 and 2600, respectively.Goldman now sees GDP growth of 2.1% this year, 2.2% next and 1.7% in 2019.The possible silver lining in Kostin's outlook is that he's not assuming any reduction in the corporate tax rate, so there's room for an upside surprise. In that respect, his outlook seems more or less consistent with that of David Bianco, chief investment strategist in the Americas for Deutsche Asset Management, who wrote recently that the S&P should trade at 2450 — but only ""upon clear signs of a significant and simple corporate tax cut"" to a 25% rate.The potential problem is that the legislative lift doesn't get any lighter after health care. This week, the House set aside plans to release a fiscal 2018 budget resolution as conservatives and moderates butted heads over whether to require $200 billion in entitlement savings. Doing so, moderates warned, could make tax cuts much harder to pass.RELATED:Senate Delays TrumpCare Vote, Pressuring Stock MarketJPMorgan, Bank Of America Lead Bank Rally Amid Strong Payout HopesTrumpCare: Almost Everyone Gets A Worse DealUnitedHealth, HCA, Merck Rally As Senate TrumpCare Bill Pares Near-Term Cuts
"
273,UHS,"XTenet Healthcare (THC) and other hospitals led a broad advance in health care stocks on Thursday as Senate Republicans unveiled their own version of TrumpCare.The short takeaway, courtesy of Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick, is that the Senate bill is ""Lots Less Worse Short-Term; Lots More Worse Long-Term,"" in comparison to the House version. In particular, Medicaid spending would suffer a smaller hit in the near term, but face even bigger long-term cuts.Among hospital groups, HCA Healthcare (HCA) rose 2.5%, Tenet Healthcare jumped 6.8% and Universal Health Services (UHS) gained 1.8%.The stock performance may have even taken management by surprise. Politico published a letter Tenet sent to employees asking them to rally opposition to TrumpCare.Investors have good reason to focus more on the intermediate term, because it's always possible that the big out-year cuts could be interrupted or delayed — if Democrats make a comeback, for example. On the other hand, the sharp eventual spending cuts relative to ObamaCare could threaten the support of moderate GOP senators. NBC News was reporting that three GOP senators planned to voice their opposition to the new legislation, enough to deny passage.Managed care companies also were solidly higher on Thursday. Centene (CNC) and Molina (MOH), both big players in the ObamaCare exchanges and its Medicaid expansion, were among the better performers. Centene climbed 3.6% and Molina 2.3%. Anthem (ANTM), the biggest ObamaCare exchange insurer, rose 0.65%. Anthem said on Wednesday that it's pulling out of the ObamaCare marketplaces in Indiana and Wisconsin.Centene is among the rare companies making a profit from the exchanges, but Medicaid is a big profit driver for the industry, including UnitedHealth Group (UNH), a Dow Jones industrial average component. All insurers would stand to benefit from the GOP plan to kill a tax on health insurance plans.UnitedHealth rose 0.7% to a record high, while Aetna (AET) gained 0.55% and Humana (HUM) advanced 0.3%.Skolnick's message to investors: ""Buy UNH and HCA.""Prospects of more modest health spending cuts than feared — assuming TrumpCare even passes — also lifted shares of drugmakers and biotechs. Among Dow components, Merck (MRK) rose 0.9%, Pfizer (PFE) 0.5% and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) 0.85%, with J&J notching a record high.Johnson & Johnson would also stand to benefit from the repeal of ObamaCare's tax on medical devices. Merck, which has been rallying on good news for immuno-oncology treatment Keytruda, crossed an aggressive entry and neared a conventional buy point.

302,UHS,"Three of the nation's biggest four hospital chains took diverging paths Thursday as the fortunes of Community Health Systems (CYH) continued to diminish — its shares free falling by 50% in afternoon trades — while the stock of HCA Holdings (HCA) and Universal Health Services (UHS) climbed on positive earnings reports.Community Health, based in a suburb of Nashville, Tenn., projected a loss for the third quarter and said it sees revenue down for the period. The quarterly loss is expected to be $83 million, swinging from a gain of $121 million for the same quarter a year ago. Revenue is expected to hit $4.38 billion, down from the $4.85 billion from the third quarter of 2015.Community Health has been struggling since it joined the ranks of the top hospital chains in 2014 with its acquisition of Health Management Associates and its 71 hospitals. Community Health shares did climb to an intraday peak of 53.50 in June 2015 but have plummeted since, and now are down roughly 91% from that precipice.Community Health shares gapped down 50% to close at 5.05 on the stock market today, a new low. Community Health said last month it was exploring the possibility of a sale of its assets, but it's unclear whether any hospital chain will or can absorb the company and its 158 hospitals.Analysts say HCA, based in Nashville not far from Community Health, can ill afford to take on the assets of its rival, whose hospital count is close to that of HCA's 169 facilities. HCA also has 117 free-standing surgery centers.Plus, HCA seems to have few issues with profitability. The company said Thursday that adjusted net income was $618 million, or $1.59 a share, compared with $449 million, or $1.05 a share, for the year-ago quarter. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.42 a share for the period.HCA shares closed up 0.5% at 79.31.Universal Health, meanwhile, reported income of $1.60 a share, compared with $1.53 a year ago. Revenue climbed 8.2% to $2.41 billion from $2.23 billion for the year-ago quarter. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.69 a share on sales of $2.4 billion. But the company raised the lower level of its full-year earnings estimate, which it narrowed to a range of $7.16 to $7.43 a share. Shares rose 2.7% to 122.35.Finally, the other hospital in the quartet of big chains, Tenet Healthcare (THC), is due to report next week. Shares lost 4.2% in trading Thursday.

Portland, Ore., Seattle and San Francisco logged the biggest increases.  The gain was in line with economists consensus projections.Consumer outlooks improved in March, lifting the Conference Board's Consumer Sentiment Index to 96.2, a big jump above February's 92.2 reading and easily clearing consensus views for 94.Oil prices continued lower, dropping 3% and putting West Texas Intermediate just above $38 a barrel.  Oil and energy related stocks packed into the low end of the S&P 500.Boeing (BA) dropped nearly 2%, the worst slip among Dow stocks. Chevron (CVX) and 3M (MMM) were also down more than 1%. At the top of the index, McDonald's (MCD) climbed almost 1%.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) dropped 3% to the bottom of the Nasdaq 100. Citi downgraded the stock to neutral, from buy. The note cited reduced opportunity in carrier aggregation, and said a 20% recovery in smartphone demand expected in the second half of the year was already priced into the stock. Shares are up 36% from a February low.Homebuilder Lennar (LEN) ran up 3% after a solid fiscal Q1 report. The gain lifted shares to a test of resistance at the stock's 200-day moving average.Universal Health Services (UHS) also popped 3% in heavy trade. It is up 22% from a February low and still below its 200-day line.At the extremes on the IBD 50 list, Francesca's Holdings (FRAN) climbed 3% in early action.

306,UHS,"Investors sent hospital stocks to the emergency room early Thursday after HCA Holdings (HCA), the largest for-profit hospital operator, reported troubling preliminary results for its third quarter late Wednesday, including a spike in uninsured admissions for the second straight quarter.HCA shares sank 5% to 72.21 on the stock market today, but that was up from an intraday low of 68.13. Other hospital operators also retreated, but pared losses as the overall market rallied. Universal Health Services (UHS) fell 0.8%. Community Health Systems (CYH) lost 2.4%, Tenet Healthcare (THC) 0.1% and LifePoint Health (LPNT) 3.8%.HCA's uninsured volume at same facilities grew to 8% of total admissions from 7.3% a year ago, continuing a trend that began in the second quarter. In Q2, uninsured admissions increased to 7.1% of the total from 6.8% in Q2 of 2014, leading analysts to opine that the benefits of ObamaCare were leveling off since enrollment in the Affordable Care Act system began in early 2014.HCA also signaled troubling signs for its bottom line. Expected Q3 earnings of $1.17 per share were below analysts' views for $1.22 per share. Operating margins were down on higher labor costs and a ""less favorable payer mix,"" the company said, noting that productivity fell, and the use of contract labor rose.The ""most concerning trend,"" said Wells Fargo analyst Gary Lieberman, ""is the continued negative mix shift in its same-facility uninsured admissions."" In a client note, he said the increase in uninsured admissions ""has been the primary focus of investor concern"" since second-quarter results were released in early August.Lieberman also chided HCA for its ""significantly higher"" labor expenses in Q3, which amounted to 46.9% of revenue vs. 45.7% in last year's same quarter.""Management should have more control over labor expense, and therefore this statistic is also concerning,"" Lieberman noted.Mizuho Securities cut HCA's price target to 86 from 103.In other preliminary results, expected Q3 revenue of $9.856 billion, up from $9.220 billion last year, was slightly above views. And overall volume increased 2.9% from a year earlier, while same-facility equivalent admissions increased 3.6% when compared to Q3 of 2014. Same-facility emergency-room visits increased 5.8%.HCA's adjusted earnings forecast for the full year was narrowed to $5.20 to $5.25 per share from $4.90 to $5.30 previously. Its new top-end range is four cents below analysts' views.HCA said it will report complete Q3 results on or around Oct. 27.

"
315,UHS,"Not that long ago, IBD Leaderboard company Acadia Healthcare was a small player in behavioral health, with only a handful of facilities in the U.S.
"
316,UHS,"Then a new management team arrived on the scene with aggressive expansion in mind.
"
317,UHS,"Acadia's (ACHC) new boss was Joey Jacobs. He previously was chairman and CEO at Psychiatric Solutions, which had been folded into Universal Health Services (UHS) after a $3 billion merger in 2010.
"
318,UHS,"Jacobs and his management team, including other executives from his merged company, arrived in the first quarter of 2011.
"
319,UHS,"They quickly got to work.
"
320,UHS,"In April, Acadia made its first acquisition — Youth & Family Centered Services, based in Austin, Texas — amounting to 13 facilities with 1,300 beds. A short time later, the team went after PHC, which is also known as Pioneer Behavioral Health.
"
321,UHS,"PHC wasn't that big; it had just five facilities with 270 beds. But it was a publicly traded company, and by combining with it, Acadia became a public company.
"
322,UHS,"""By getting access to public capital, they were able to accelerate their consolidation strategy,"" said Whit Mayo, an analyst with Robert W. Baird.
"
323,UHS,"Acquisitions In Mind
"
324,UHS,"Today, after several other buyouts, Franklin, Tenn.-based Acadia runs 76 behavioral health care facilities with more than 5,600 beds in 24 states, the United Kingdom and Puerto Rico.
"
325,UHS,"It's going to get even bigger.
"
326,UHS,"A pending acquisition of CRC Health Group, expected to close in 2015's first quarter, will give Acadia another 120 facilities in the U.S. and a much stronger presence in substance abuse treatment.
"
327,UHS,"The deal, valued at $1.175 billion, was announced in a third-quarter earnings release after the market closed on October 29.
"
328,UHS,"The next day, Acadia's stock shot up nearly 12% and another 5% the day after. It didn't hurt that earnings per share in the quarter jumped 53% from a year earlier to 46 cents on revenue of $294.5 million, which was up 59.4%.
"
329,UHS,"CRC Health, based in Cupertino, Calif., is expected to generate $450 million this year. It operates 36 residential facilities and 84 other kinds of treatment units, which together serve 40,000 patients a day.
"
330,UHS,"CRC will be Acadia's largest deal so far. Analyst Jennifer Lynch of BMO Capital Markets estimated in a research note that CRC could add 40-50 cents in per-share earnings for Acadia in 2015.
"
331,UHS,"She also noted that CRC's treatment for addiction, gambling and other problems ""presents another arena for expansion and investment.""
"
332,UHS,"Universal Health is still bigger than Acadia in behavioral health. Universal also operates 24 acute-care hospitals, which is why Acadia likes to call itself a pure play in behavioral health.
"
333,UHS,"Until Acadia closes on CRC, its $662 million acquisition in July of U.K.-based Partnerships in Care, or PiC, remains its biggest deal to date. PiC gave Acadia 23 inpatient facilities with over 1,200 beds in the U.K.
"
334,UHS,"PiC is known as the second-largest operator of independent inpatient behavioral health services in the U.K., with revenue last year of $285 million.
"
335,UHS,"""The move into the U.K. was a savvy one,"" Mayo said. ""The National Health Service in the U.K. is outsourcing (behavioral health) at an accelerating rate, and there is a shortage of beds.""
"
336,UHS,"He says that PiC had been ""a little starved for capital,"" and now Acadia will be able to help fund organic growth and acquisitions.
"
337,UHS,"""I look at the U.K. deal as expanding the entire addressable market for Acadia in the U.K.,"" Mayo said.
"
338,UHS,"""I would say the same thing for the CRC transaction (in the U.S.),"" he added, referring mostly to the new substance-abuse business that will come with it.
"
339,UHS,"Reimbursement Trends
"
340,UHS,"Insurance coverage for substance abuse has greatly improved with passage of the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) and other legislation that puts mental health coverage at ""parity"" with other medical and surgical benefits, Mayo says.
"

"
348,UHS,"Universal is Acadia's chief rival in the U.S. It's also a rival in the U.K., where it recently paid $335 million for Cygnet Health, which gave it 15 behavioral health units and two nursing homes.
"
349,UHS,"In the U.S., ""it's still a fragmented industry with a lot of single-facility operators out there,"" said Scott Brittain, an Acadia spokesman.
"
350,UHS,"Acadia's revenue growth in the third quarter reflected nearly 1,900 new beds added in the prior 12 months. More than 1,500 came through five acquisitions, including PiC and McCallum Place, which runs eating-disorder treatment centers in St. Louis and Austin, Texas.
"
351,UHS,"After reporting third-quarter results, Acadia raised its EPS guidance for the full year to $1.52-$1.53 from $1.44-$1.46 previously.
"
352,UHS,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings to come in at the high end — $1.53 — for a 43% gain over last year. They see earnings rising 34% in 2015.
"
353,UHS,"With a market cap around $3.8 billion, Acadia is the fourth-largest company in IBD's Medical-Outpatient/Home Care industry group, after Fresenius Medical (FMS), Davita Healthcare Partners (DVA) and Mednax (MD). The group ranks No. 21 in performance of 197 that IBD tracks.Not that long ago, IBD Leaderboard company Acadia Healthcare was a small player in behavioral health, with only a handful of facilities in the U.S.Then a new management team arrived on the scene with aggressive expansion in mind.Acadia's (ACHC) new boss was Joey Jacobs. He previously was chairman and CEO at Psychiatric Solutions, which had been folded into Universal Health Services (UHS) after a $3 billion merger in 2010.Jacobs and his management team, including other executives from his merged company, arrived in the first quarter of 2011.They quickly got to work.In April, Acadia made its first acquisition — Youth & Family Centered Services, based in Austin, Texas — amounting to 13 facilities with 1,300 beds. A short time later, the team went after PHC, which is also known as Pioneer Behavioral Health.PHC wasn't that big; it had just five facilities with 270 beds. But it was a publicly traded company, and by combining with it, Acadia became a public company.""By getting access to public capital, they were able to accelerate their consolidation strategy,"" said Whit Mayo, an analyst with Robert W. Baird.Acquisitions In MindToday, after several other buyouts, Franklin, Tenn.-based Acadia runs 76 behavioral health care facilities with more than 5,600 beds in 24 states, the United Kingdom and Puerto Rico.It's going to get even bigger.A pending acquisition of CRC Health Group, expected to close in 2015's first quarter, will give Acadia another 120 facilities in the U.S. and a much stronger presence in substance abuse treatment.The deal, valued at $1.175 billion, was announced in a third-quarter earnings release after the market closed on October 29.The next day, Acadia's stock shot up nearly 12% and another 5% the day after. It didn't hurt that earnings per share in the quarter jumped 53% from a year earlier to 46 cents on revenue of $294.5 million, which was up 59.4%.CRC Health, based in Cupertino, Calif., is expected to generate $450 million this year. It operates 36 residential facilities and 84 other kinds of treatment units, which together serve 40,000 patients a day.CRC will be Acadia's largest deal so far. Analyst Jennifer Lynch of BMO Capital Markets estimated in a research note that CRC could add 40-50 cents in per-share earnings for Acadia in 2015.She also noted that CRC's treatment for addiction, gambling and other problems ""presents another arena for expansion and investment.""Universal Health is still bigger than Acadia in behavioral health. Universal also operates 24 acute-care hospitals, which is why Acadia likes to call itself a pure play in behavioral health.Until Acadia closes on CRC, its $662 million acquisition in July of U.K.-based Partnerships in Care, or PiC, remains its biggest deal to date. PiC gave Acadia 23 inpatient facilities with over 1,200 beds in the U.K.PiC is known as the second-largest operator of independent inpatient behavioral health services in the U.K., with revenue last year of $285 million.""The move into the U.K. was a savvy one,"" Mayo said. ""The National Health Service in the U.K. is outsourcing (behavioral health) at an accelerating rate, and there is a shortage of beds.""He says that PiC had been ""a little starved for capital,"" and now Acadia will be able to help fund organic growth and acquisitions.""I look at the U.K. deal as expanding the entire addressable market for Acadia in the U.K.,"" Mayo said.""I would say the same thing for the CRC transaction (in the U.S.),"" he added, referring mostly to the new substance-abuse business that will come with it.Reimbursement TrendsInsurance coverage for substance abuse has greatly improved with passage of the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) and other legislation that puts mental health coverage at ""parity"" with other medical and surgical benefits, Mayo says.""The federal government is creating a whole new set of rules and mandates for the insurance industry to enhance the benefits they offer for mental health issues,"" he added.According to statements by Jacobs, who wasn't available for an interview, Acadia will keep looking for other acquisitions in the U.S. and the U.K., and will keep adding new beds to existing facilities.Acadia, Mayo says, indicated earlier this year that it would try to increase the number of beds at existing facilities by 16% over two years.""Each new patient that comes through will provide some level of incremental margin improvement,"" Mayo said.

604,UHS,"Mastering something you know how to do well is hard enough. Learning a skill that doesn't come naturally is tougher. Either way, with hard work and practice, you can find your passion.• Accept your limits. Sheryl Roush, CEO of Sparkle Presentations, a firm specializing in keynote speeches and workplace communication training, started out owning a publishing business. She had difficulty giving employees feedback and didn't know exactly how to improve. Then someone at a networking event suggested she check out Toastmasters, a nonprofit organization developing public speaking and leadership skills. San Diego-based Roush says even though she was terrified to talk in front of strangers, she gave it a try.• Leap. Roush, now an accredited speaker of Toastmasters, hardly started out that way. ""I had no idea how bad and ineffective I was,"" she told IBD. ""I was totally unaware of the lack of credibility I had.""In her first speech, she uttered 19 uhs and ums in six minutes.• Keep at it. Things didn't pick up immediately. ""My first three speeches, I still cried nervously before each one,"" Roush said.Still, she kept getting up there week after week until she slowly became more confident. ""I did a lot of practice, and it was done in the safety net of club,"" she said. ""(Toastmasters) gives you instant feedback, with support to change as fast as you would like to.""• Be brave. ""Believe that you can do it, even if it's not going to be perfect,"" Roush said. ""Do the best you can, every presentation.""Roush's drive paid off. Only six months after her first Toastmasters meeting, she was paid to give a college commencement speech. Now her resume shows thousands of speeches in nine countries.""I went from having no confidence or self-esteem to finding my true calling,"" she said.• Tap interests. For Dilip Abayasekara, an industrial scientist, public speaking was only a hobby. Then he got better.""One of the things I learned was how to read an audience and adapt presentations to the audience,"" he said.Harrisburg, Pa.-based Abayasekara spoke to different audiences as a requirement to become an accredited Toastmaster speaker.That forced him to tailor his message to various groups: professionals, blue-collar workers, seniors, youth.""In order to be effective, get the message across and connect, you have to know where your audience comes from, their expectations and how they view things,"" he said. ""The more you know about the audience, the more you can adapt. It's not about the speaker; it's about the audience.""• Find your voice. Growing up in Sri Lanka, Abayasekara saw public speakers as those who stood on a box and proclaimed a message to the crowd. ""I thought I had to be an orator and shout out my message,"" he said.He realized the image was outdated, that what people want today is someone to converse with them.""Nowadays, a good communicator has conversations with the audience one person at a time,"" he said. ""I learned to speak from my heart and really connect with people.""• Share knowledge. Abayasekara ran workshops where he worked on his own at lunchtime. ""This was for sheer joy of it,"" he said.Managers saw it as beneficial, as employees would speak up more during meetings.So Abayasekara's boss asked him to coach scientists and engineers for their presentations. He also presented at seminars and conferences for the company and eventually served as Toastmasters' president.

Of IBD's 197 industry groups, only 10 were up. The winners included gold miners, computer data storage and career schools.Two of those groups benefited from a single component that was up sharply.In data storage, low-ranked Data Domain (DDUP) rocketed 34% to 24.03 in more than 12 times its usual trade on a takeover bid.After Wednesday's close, NetApp (NTAP) announced that it would buy Data Domain for $25 a share.NetApp rose 0.48 to 17.82 in more than triple its usual trade.

The S&P 500 was off 1.8% while the NYSE composite and the Dow fell 1.7%.Volume was down 16% on the NYSE and 1% on the Nasdaq.While more top-ranked stocks were falling than rising in fast trade, the gold-mining industry group was on track for a fourth consecutive gain.The fundamentals in the group are patchy, but many of the stocks have either cleared bases or are near completing bases.Only two stocks in the group have EPS Ratings of 94 or better; Yamana Gold (AUY) and Iamgold (IAG).

"
710,UHS,"Trading volume strengthened through the day, ending 29% higher on the NYSE and up 24% on the Nasdaq. The combination of healthy gains and solid volume led to follow-through days for both the Dow and the S&P 500, sending markets into a fresh confirmed rally.

825,UHS,"The first-quarter earnings season is unwinding fast with 87 members of the elite S&P 500 index already having reported financial numbers. Per the latest Earnings Preview, performances of these index participants indicate a 25% increase in total earnings on 10.7% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 82.8% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 67.8% outperforming on the top-line front.The Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) is expected to deliver 9.4% earnings growth on 6.8% higher revenues in the first quarter. This is, however, shy of the projected 18.3% and 7.7% revenue and earnings growth, respectively, for the S&P 500 index.Healthcare is part of the broader medical sector, which includes diversified industries like health maintenance organizations (HMOs) popularly known as health insurers, clinical, laboratories and diagnostics research, medical equipment, hospitals & nursing homes, telehealth services and more. The sector is so diverse that a single factor influencing a sector positively can be a negative for the other sector. For example flu, which causes an increase in medical services utilization, is an earnings driver for the hospital sector while at the same time a negative factor for insurers it causes a spike in claim costs.  To put it into perspective, the January-to-March 2018 period was an unexpectedly brutal flu season, which led to a spike in medical cost for insurers. But because of UnitedHealth’s superior medical cost management, the flu season did not have any adverse impact on the company’s results. UnitedHealth is considered to be a bellwether for the other companies and its results provide a broad picture of the industry that despite increased flu, the first quarter will be profitable.The health insurers are likely to have witnessed an increase in premium and enrollment from the government businesses – Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. A surge in the baby boomer population has led to higher demand for these policies. Earnings should also see an upside from ancilliary and health service businesses, which the health insurers have been investing in for the past many years to diversify the revenue base. These businesses which focus on data management, management of clinical records, analytics, clinical care, pharmacy care and more have been a nice contributor to the group’s earnings in recent years and the trend is expected to continue.However, this severe flu season should be a shot in the arm for care providers and other companies all along the pharmaceutical supply chain, as it would lead to higher revenues from increasing hospital visits and drug sales. Companies in the hospital sector should see increased patient revenues and admissions as more patients seek medical help, which in turn should drive their top-line growth.Nevertheless, the hospital companies should continue to feel the heat, from walk-in clinics and other outpatient treatment options that have been eating into their admissions volumes for past many quarters.Let’s find out where the following healthcare stocks insurers stand ahead of their first-quarter releases on Apr 25.Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) revenues have been consistently growing over the past several quarters, driven by membership growth. The company’s fully insured and self-funded memberships have boosted total enrollment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $22.5 billion, reflecting a year-over-year rise of nearly 1%.The company’s Government business has been performing well over a considerable period of time, supported by increasing Medicaid and Medicare enrollment. The consensus mark for total operating revenues of Government business is pegged at $12.8 billion, up 7% year over year.However, higher medical costs for individual ACA-compliant products and more claims leading to an escalated benefit expense ratio from its Medicaid business are expected to drain the bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.85 for the yet-to-be-reported quarter reflects 3.6% year-over-year growth. Anthem carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its Earnings ESP of -1.83%, makes surprise prediction unlikely as the company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.

826,UHS,"Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25 after market close. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.70%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Universal Health’s Acute Care and Behavioral Health segments have been registering a strong performance over the past several quarters, on the back of a continuous rise in admissions, licensed beds and patient days, leading to higher revenues in turn.  The to-be-reported quarter is expected to have witnessed the same uptrend.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues in the first quarter is pegged at $2.7 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 5%.  Our consensus estimate for the metric from Acute Care and Behavioral Health segments stands at $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, up 6.4% and 3.5% each, year over year.Since 2012, the average number of licensed beds in the Acute Care hospitals and Behavioral Health centers has been increasing. Our consensus mark for Average Licensed Beds in Acute Care as well as Behavioral Health is pegged at 6.2 billion and 23.3 billion, respectively. Each figure is up 1.5% and 1.2% on a year-over-year basis.An increase in the bed count at both the facilities will likely drive admission volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Admissions in Acute Care and Behavioral Health is 78.3 billion and 120.7 billion respectively, up 5.3% and 2% year over year, each.In addition, the company’s continuous focus on enhancing shareholder value through share repurchases might have boosted its bottom line by limiting share count in the to-be-reported quarter.However, the company’s earnings are likely to be affected by the rising costs related to interest payment, reserves for settlements, legal judgments as well as lawsuits plus impairments of long-lived assets.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Universal Health has the right combination of the following two key ingredients to beat estimates this quarter:Zacks ESP: Universal Health has an Earnings ESPof +0.32%.

827,UHS,"Growth at a reasonable price or GARP is an excellent way for investors to make some quick gains. This strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount.The GARP approach leads to the identification of stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.That means a portfolio created on the basis of GARP strategy is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth and solid prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that are likely to offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 13.Here are seven of the 13 stocks that made it through the screen:Grand Canyon Education, Inc. (LOPE  -  Free Report) is a regionally accredited provider of online postsecondary education services focused on offering graduate and undergraduate degree programs in its core disciplines of education, business, and healthcare.

828,UHS,"The Ensign Group, Inc. (ENSG  -  Free Report) has acquired the real estate and operations of Peoria Post Acute and Rehabilitation, a 128-bed skilled nursing facility located in Peoria, AZ. The buyout was effective Apr 1, 2018. An adjacent 50-bed long-term acute care hospital, operated by a third party under a lease arrangement, is also included in this facility.Details of the DealEnsign Group operates in a large and highly fragmented skilled nursing industry, which generates significant acquisition and consolidation opportunities. The field is monopolized by numerous local and regional providers.Following the acquisition, Ensign Group now owns the real estate’s 66 of 233 healthcare operations. With this purchase, the acquirer expands its portfolio to 182 skilled nursing operations consisting of 21 assisted living operations, 51 assisted and independent living operations, 22 hospice agencies, 20 home health agencies and four home care businesses across 15 states.What Management ThinksManagement stated that it is actively seeking additional opportunities to own complete stakes in real estate activities or to lease both flourishing and struggling skilled nursing, assisted living and other healthcare-related businesses across the United States.The company is also confident that aligning with its focus on becoming the top-class post-acute care provider in the market, this acquisition will facilitate it to deliver high-quality services in Arizona.Inorganic GrowthEnsign Group is always inclined towards achieving growth via inorganic means. Much of the company’s historical growth can be attributed to its expertise in buying real estate or leasing both underperforming and proficiently executing post-acute care operations. Subsequently, the company applies its core operating know-how to improve upon each acquired service, both clinically and financially.Earlier this year, Ensign Group’s assisted and independent living portfolio company, Bridgestone Living LLC, acquired the real estate and operations of two assisted living facilities in Texas. We thus expect the company to continue with its inorganic efforts going forward.Consolidation in the IndustryThe hospital industry is witnessing consolidation due to rising expenses, declining admissions, increasing bad debts and a flurry of regulatory actions. These are compelling the players to gain in scale for survival. This month, MEDNAX, Inc. (MD  -  Free Report) closed the acquisition of Pediatric Urology Practice in South Florida.Share Price PerformanceDespite all the industry headwinds, the share price reflects shareholders’ confidence in the stock. The company’s inorganic growth endeavors have significantly aided its top-line growth. The stock has surged 45.6% in a year’s time, substantially outperforming the industry’s decline of 21.5%. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderThe Ensign Group carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Investors can also look check out a couple of other top-ranked stocks from the Medical sector like Align Technology, Inc.

830,UHS,"The U.S. investment market has scaled new highs on the latest Republican tax cuts and robust economic growth at home and abroad.In fact, the MedTech sector is looking forward to the latest decision of the Senate to postpone an industry-wide excise tax (Medical Device’ tax) by another two years. The bill will also delay the Cadillac tax (a 40% tax on employer insurance), until 2022. The Medical Device tax imposes 2.3% excise tax on MedTech manufacturers, reducing the research and development (R&D) prospects.Not just abatement of the taxes, the MedTech fraternity has also been riding high on the ongoing merger and acquisition (M&A) trends in the space. In fact various reports suggest that M&A has been the key catalyst of the U.S. healthcare space of late. Per data provided by BioSpectrum Asia, M&A activity in the MedTech space surged 50% in 2017, increasing the value of aggregate M&A to more than $200 billion.M&A in FocusWe believe the M&A strategies will reduce pricing pressure and competition in the MedTech space. Further, the companies with a strong acquisition policy will expand customer base faster, moderate leverage and enhance cash flow.Glancing through the major acquisitions of the recent past, Becton, Dickinson and Company’s acquisition of C. R. Bard, and JOHNSON & JOHNSON’s buyout of Actelion deserve a mention.Further, health insurers are trying to collaborate with pharmacy benefit managers to streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain. In this regard, the latest buyout of Express Scripts by Cigna, which follows just three months after drug chain and pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp announced plans to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna, is important.Combined with the postponement of the taxes and a solid M&A policy, the Medtech sector is poised to grow in the coming quarters.Our Screening ParametersIn order to save investors the time-consuming process of identifying the best performing MedTech stocks, we have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener.We have selected stocks that have a favorable Growth Style Score of A or B and carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

832,UHS,"“Every crisis has its own set of villains – but all require a similar ingredient to create a true crisis: too much leverage.” – Andrew Ross SorkinFinancial leverage is a popular investment strategy that refers to the amount of debt that a company uses to finance its operations. Although debt brings with it the burden of interest payment, it is preferred to equity financing because of its cheap availability. Another perk of debt financing is that the interest on debt is tax deductible.Interestingly, the United States — the world’s richest economy — is the biggest borrower as well. In fact, according to the FY19 Federal Budget, at the end of FY18, gross U.S. federal government debt is estimated to be $21.09 trillion, more than double the debt load in the last decade.Yet, debt is something that everyone likes to avoid. This is because debt financing means borrowing against future earnings, which simply means that instead of using all future profits to grow the business one has to allocate a portion for debt repayments.Nevertheless, this should not dissuade one from investing in U.S. stocks. After all, in spite of such high debt levels, the United States remains the largest economy in the world in terms of GDP, representing a quarter share of the global economy per the latest World Bank figuresThe problem arises when debt a company bears becomes exorbitant. In particular, companies with high debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt, especially in periods of high interest rate.With the Federal Reserve under new chief Jerome Powell targeting four interest rate hikes this year, more than previously expected hikes of three, the market scenario does not seem to be much in favor of companies opting for debt financing. Considering this, the need of the hour is to choose stocks prudently, avoiding those that carry high debt loads. So the crux of a safe investment lies in identifying low leverage stocks.This is where the significance of financial leverage ratio comes into play. This ratio measures the extent of financial leverage a company bears. Several leverage ratios have been developed for this purpose, with debt-to-equity ratio being the most popular.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio indicates improved solvency for a company.With the Q4 reporting cycle well behind us, companies that recorded higher earnings growth will attract investors on probabilities of outperformance in Q1 as well. But if such companies bear high leverage, they might not generate satisfactory returns. This is because during economic depressions, debt-ridden companies are prone to falling into a debt trap.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure safe returns.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy): Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 28 stocks that made it through the screen.Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LPX  -  Free Report): The company manufactures building materials and engineered wood products in the United States, Canada, Chile and Brazil. It pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 5.18% in the trailing four quarters and sports a Zacks Rank #1.ManpowerGroup (MAN  -  Free Report): It is a global leader in the employment services industry.

836,UHS,"Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation (IART  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 27, before the market opens.In the third quarter, Integra LifeSciences derived 41% of its total revenues from the Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies business. Let us take a sneak peek at what the fourth-quarter earnings season is expected to bring forth for this business segment.How Is Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies Placed?Notably, Regenerative Technologies is the largest franchise under Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies. In third-quarter 2017, the company registered mid-single digit growth in this franchise, primarily banking on the addition of Derma Sciences and strong growth in inpatient skin portfolio. Organic sales, excluding effects of storm-related disruption, increased 6%.Management is hopeful about gaining from continued strength in this business in fourth-quarter 2017 as well. Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies revenues of $123 million reflects an increase of 33.8% from the year-ago quarter.We encouragingly note that, in the fourth-quarter 2017, Integra LifeSciences introduced several products that have broadened its portfolio of solutions in the U.S. hernia repair market and in the European breast reconstruction market. In this regard, the company launched collagen matrices — Revize/Revize-X — for plastic and reconstructive surgery.Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation Quote Available in solid and 2:1 meshed configuration, Revize/Revize-X Collagen Matrix are derived from fetal bovine dermis which contains high levels of Type III collagen. Per the company, Revize/Revize-X will aid in implanting and strengthening weak soft tissue along with surgical repairing of damaged or ruptured soft tissue membranes.Solidifying its footprint in plastic and reconstructive surgery, this global medical technology company recently announced the launch of a collagen matrix SurgiMend PRS Meshed — featuring a 2: 1 meshing pattern. In a parallel release, Integra LifeSciences announced the launch of SurgiMend PRS Meshed for pre- and sub-pectoral breast reconstruction in Europe. These developments should boost the company’s revenue in the fourth quarter itself.Integra LifeSciences’ efforts to grow in the plastic and reconstructive surgery market seem to be strategic, per Technavio data published in Business Wire. Per the report, the global plastic surgery products market is expected to reach a value of around $15 billion, at a CAGR of 9% between 2016 and 2020. Thus, the latest launches will help Integra LifeSciences cash in on the opportunities in this niche market and boost the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.We note that the company has been seeing considerable progress in its extremity product line. Last March, Integra LifeSciences announced full commercial expansion of its Cadence Total Ankle System. The company developed the ankle prosthesis in collaboration with renowned foot and ankle surgeons. The Cadence Total Ankle System was made fully available in the United States, Canada and select European countries. In the same month, the company launched Titan Press-Fit Reverse Shoulder for Fracture. The latest introductions are expected to help the company gain traction.Preliminary ResultsNotably, Integra LifeSciences reported preliminary, unaudited revenues of approximately $365 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 40% year over year. The preliminary revenue figure is nominally higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $364.9 million.Per management, the stellar quarterly performance was strongly backed by strong organic growth at the Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies business.Integra LifeSciences expects fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share to cross the high end of the guidance.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Integra LifeSciences has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Integra LifeSciences is +2.66%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Integra LifeSciences’ Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 57 cents reflects a 9.6% rise on a year-over-year basis.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Universal Health Services (UHS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.96% and a Zacks Rank #2.

837,UHS,"Genomic Health, Inc. (GHDX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Mar 8, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 400%. Moreover, Genomic Health beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, the average being 116.7%.The fourth-quarter results are expected to show steady growth in Product revenues. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Genomic Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Genomic Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Genomic Health, Inc. Quote Product Revenues in FocusGenomic Health’s product-revenue unit continues to make significant progress with its Oncotype DX breast cancer test. Positive results related to Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score are also likely to yield solid results in the fourth quarter.In the third quarter, total product revenues grew 2.1% year over year. Product revenues grew domestically as well as internationally. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for product revenues is pegged at $89 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting 6% growth from the third quarter and 8.5% year over year.Notably, for the fourth quarter, Genomic Health again expects double-digit test growth at the international business. According to the company, as of Sep 30, 2017, majority of the product revenues has been derived from the sale of one product — the Oncotype DX breast cancer test.So far, Genomic Health has been witnessing healthy progress with regard to establishing coverage for its Oncotype DX breast cancer test. Also, Genomic Health and Biocartis Group NV had signed an agreement in last September to develop an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) version of the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Scoretest on Biocartis' proprietary Idylla platform. The company’s continuous focus to strengthen its position in the niche is likely to boost the top line.Other Factors at PlaySolid EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 9 cents reflects a 200% rise from the previous quarter and 125% from the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is pegged at $89 million, showing an increase of 6% from the preceding quarter and 7.2% from the year-ago quarter.Guidance StrongThe company has reiterated the guidance for 2017. Genomic Health expects to meet the low end of its full-year revenue guidance of $345-$355 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $343.1 million is below the guided range.Prostate-Cancer Business Drives GrowthGenomic Health’s U.S. prostate cancer business has been consistently improving over the last few quarters. The company has continued to make progress, delivering actionable results to increase adoption of this test and gather evidence to support private reimbursement. In the third quarter, revenues in this business more than doubled on a year-over-year basis with U.S. product revenues being driven by a 139% rise in Prostate test revenues.Recently, Genomic Health announced a multi-year research collaboration agreement with Janssen Pharmaceuticals. Through this, the companies will evaluate the responsiveness of Genomic Health’s Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score test to Janssen’s prostate cancer drug pipeline.Forex WoesWith a considerable portion of its revenues coming from outside the United States, the company faces the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Genomic Health is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Genomic Health has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 9 cents.Zacks Rank: Genomic Health carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Universal Health Services (UHS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.96% and a Zacks Rank #2.

838,UHS,"Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 28 after  market close.Last quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.64 per share, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.5%. The bottom line, however, grew 2.5% year over year on higher revenues.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Universal Health has the right combination of the following two key ingredients to beat estimates this quarter.Zacks ESP: Universal Health has an Earnings ESP of +0.39%. A stock’s positive ESP raises confidence about an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Universal Health Services, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Universal Health Services, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Universal Health Services, Inc. Quote Zacks Rank: Universal Health carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP as stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have significantly higher chances of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Q4 ExpectationsBoth segments of Universal Health namely Acute Care and Behavioral Health, have been delivering strong results over the past many quarters. Notably, the segments have also been continuously witnessing a rise in admissions, licensed beds and patient days, leading to higher revenues in turn.  Moreover, the fourth quarter is likely to have experienced this favorable trend.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $2.6 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 6%.  Our consensus estimate for revenues from Acute Care and Behavioral Health segments stands at $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, up 6% and 6.7% respectively, year over year.The average number of licensed beds in the Acute Care hospitals and Behavioral Health centers kept increasing since 2012. Our consensus estimate for Average Licensed Beds in Acute Care and Behavioral Health is pegged at 6.1 billion and 23.1 billion, up 0.5% and 5.7% year over year, respectively.An increase in number of beds at both the facilities will likely drive up admission volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Admissions in Acute Care and Behavioral Health is pegged at 73.2 billion and 116.3 billion respectively, up 5.4% and 4.7% year over year, respectively.In addition, the company’s continuous focus to enhance shareholders’ value through share repurchases might have boosted its bottom line by limiting share count in the fourth quarter.However, rising costs related to interest payment, reserves for settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits plus impairments of long-lived assets are likely to have weighed on margins.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other stocks also worth considering from the medical sector with the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this time around:Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AERI  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 28. The company has an Earnings ESP of +41.20% and a Zacks Rank #3.

(UHS  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Universal Health Services has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16.2, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Universal Health Services’ current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Medical – Hospitals industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Universal Health Services has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.9, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Universal Health Services stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Universal Health Services has a P/S ratio of about 1.1. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Universal Health Services currently has a Zacks Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Universal Health Services a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Universal Health Services might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of C. This gives UHS a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been pretty encouraging. The current quarter has seen four estimates to go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has seen eight up and no down in the same time period.This has had  a significant impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 12% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has gone up by 18 %. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Universal Health Services, Inc. Price and Consensus Universal Health Services, Inc. Price and Consensus | Universal Health Services, Inc. QuoteThis bullish trend is why the stock has  a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineUniversal Health Services is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 39% out of more than 250 industries) further strengthens its growth potential. In fact, year to date, the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, we believe that bullish analyst sentiment and favorable industry factors make this value stock a compelling pick.  Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

840,UHS,"Community Health Systems, Inc. (CYH  -  Free Report)  has been losing out on investors’ confidence due to the stock’s persistently poor performance in comparison to the industry as well as its peers. The company’s lower-than-expected volumes, payer rates, increased bad debt, a weak top line combined with higher operating expenses leading to a further drag in the margin have likely caused this underperformance.In a year’s time, shares of Community Health have tanked 50.5%, underperforming the industry’s rally of 10.7%. The company’s performance pales even more when compared with other hospital stocks like HCA Holdings, Inc (HCA  -  Free Report) and Tenet Healthcare Corporation (THC  -  Free Report), which have jumped 22% and 48%, respectively, over the same time frame. What’s Causing the Underperformance?Lower Revenues: This leading operator of general acute care hospitals in communities across the country has been witnessing a downward trend in its top line since 2016 on lower admissions, stemming from decreasing number of hospitals as a result of frequent divestitures. In both 2016 and 2017, revenues declined by 5.1% and 16.7%, respectively. Rapid sale of units might have further induced reduction in the bed count and patient admissions. Besides these, the company bore the brunt of falling payer rates and increased bad debt.Higher Expenses: Community Health has been enduring continuous escalation in operating expenses for many years now. Although in 2017, operating expense declined 10%, it represents 112% of the total revenues while in 2016, the same accounted for 104% of the metric. Mounting costs combined with dull revenues  have impelled the company’s disappointing performance with a loss report in the past three consecutive quarters, adversely impacting shareholders’ expectation from the stock.Tepid 2018 Guidance: Following discouraging 2017 results, Community Health has issued guidance for 2018, comparing unfavorably with 2017. Loss from continuing operations per share is expected within $1.50-$1.10 with the mid-point wider than the adjusted loss of $1.20 incurred in 2017. The company expects net operating revenues in the range of $13.6-$13.9 billion, reflecting a 10% drop from $15.35 billion generated in 2017.Does 2018 Look Promising?Community Health is focusing on future growth and margin expansion. The company adopts strategies like service line enhancements, physician practice development, incremental outpatient access points, investments in the behavioral health and post-acute care space plus the expansion of new transfer program initiative.Although the company anticipates trimming its expenses and improving volumes through these measures, we remain on the sidelines till any progress is reflceted in its earnings.Estimate RevisionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 was revised to a loss of $1.31 per share from a loss of 78 cents in the last 60 days. This movement reflects analysts’ pessimism on the stock, which is likely to exert a downward pressure on its share price going forward.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderCommunity Health holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(UHS  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

841,UHS,"Senate Republican leaders released a revised plan for President Donald Trump's health care reform, on Jul 13. The release was based on the The Republican administration’s vow to “repeal and replace” the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare.Earlier, Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders had to suffer setbacks with the healthcare bill for the replacement of Obamacare after failing to garner enough votes to pass the bill.  A key concern with the new health care act is that a large number of Americans would lose coverage.The concern was further justified by a report issued by the Congressional Budget Office. According to the report, if the new act were to go through, 14 million people would be uninsured in 2018. The number is expected to increase to 21 million in 2020 and 24 million in 2026.For Republicans it is now a race against time as the scheduled summer recess is knocking at the door. However, plans have already been chalked to delay the process and pass the bill through Senate.  The GOP’s new plan proposes major changes versus its original proposal to replace Obamacare. These changes include allowing insurers to offer cheaper services, no frills policies, taxing the wealthy and extra funding for opioid. The revision was made in an effort to garner more conservative support. However GOP’S internal misgivings about the plan alongside steep democratic opposition have put a question mark on the fate of the revised bill.Effect on Hospital StocksThe question that arises now is whether hospital stocks stand to gain or lose on Capitol Hill. The market remained jittery for a major part of the week due to the uncertainty surrounding the future of the healthcare act. Hospital stocks, which were suffering after election results were announced on Nov 8, 2016, were lukewarm over the proposed changes. These stocks benefited significantly under Obamacare, given the rise in the number of people with health insurance coverage.Supporters for the Republican alternative argue that if the proposed changes are implemented, the sector would get paid for several services that earlier were free of charge. Opponents point out that the customer base would shrink as a significant chunk of the population would lose their healthcare coverage.We believe that major hospital stocks like Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report), HCA Holdings, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report), LifePoint Health Inc. (LPNT  -  Free Report), Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC  -  Free Report) and Community Health Systems, Inc. (CYH  -  Free Report) will suffer immensely. The stocks will be affected because the no frills insurance policy would be akin to an increase in the uninsured rate. With bare bone insurance policies, patients will have less insurance coverage and must shell out from their pockets to avail of medical services. This would lead to an increase in bad debts.Medical - Hospital Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Hospital Industry 5YR % ReturnThe market perception can be gauged from the fact that only Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (ACHC  -  Free Report) currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here. Overall the Zacks classified Medical-Hospitals sub-industry posted a meager gain of only 0.7% over the past three months.

842,UHS,"Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 28 after market close.Last quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.64 per share, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.5%. The bottom line, however, grew 2.5% year over year on higher revenues.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Universal Health has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat estimates this quarter.Zacks ESP: Universal Health has an Earnings ESP of +0.39%. A stock’s positive ESP raises confidence about an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Universal Health Services, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Universal Health Services, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Universal Health Services, Inc. Quote Zacks Rank: Universal Health carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP as stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have significantly higher chances of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Q4 ExpectationsBoth segments of Universal Health namely Acute Care and Behavioral Health, have been delivering strong results over the past many quarters. Notably, the segments have also been continuously witnessing a rise in admissions, licensed beds and patient days, leading to higher revenues in turn.  Moreover, the fourth quarter is likely to have experienced this favorable trend.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $2.6 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 6%.  Our consensus estimate for revenues from Acute Care and Behavioral Health segments stands at $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, up 6% and 6.7% respectively, year over year.The average number of licensed beds in the Acute Care hospitals and Behavioral Health centers kept increasing since 2012. Our consensus estimate for Average Licensed Beds in Acute Care and Behavioral Health is pegged at 6.1 billion and 23.1 billion, up 0.5% and 5.7% year over year, respectively.An increase in number of beds at both the facilities will likely drive up admission volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Admissions in Acute Care and Behavioral Health is pegged at 73.2 billion and 116.3 billion respectively, up 5.4% and 4.7% year over year, respectively.In addition, the company’s continuous focus to enhance shareholders’ value through share repurchases might have boosted its bottom line by limiting share count in the fourth quarter.However, rising costs related to interest payment, reserves for settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits plus impairments of long-lived assets are likely to have weighed on margins.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other stocks worth considering from the medical sector with the right combination of elements to also come up with an earnings beat this time around:Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

846,UHS,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell on Feb 20.Last quarter, the company delivered earnings ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.1%. In fact, Medtronic’s bottom line outpaced the estimates in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 3.55%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsWe look forward to another quarter of solid growth on the company’s successful execution of three growth strategies such as therapy innovation, globalization and increasing the economic value for Medtronic. Combined with the demographics of an aging population, these positives have started to open up opportunities for Medtronic, which should get reflected in the third quarter as well.The space of therapy innovation is filled with multiple developments. Under the Cardiac and Vascular Group (CVG), new therapies are helping the company gain traction in the rapidly growing MedTech markets for left ventricular assist device (LVAD), transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), drug-coated balloons, atrial fibrillation ablation and insertable diagnostics.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC Quote In the fiscal third quarter, Medtronic is expected to have maintained a market share in the core pacing, ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillator) and CRT (cardiac resynchronization therapy) product lines within the scope of CRHF (cardiac rhythm and heart failure) while creating new meaningful markets to enhance the company’s weighted average market growth.Within the TAVR space, the company expects to see continued global growth on strong adoption around the world for Evolut PRO valve as well as expansion in the traditional U.S. TAVR centers and U.S. share capture resulting from Medtronic’s new intermediate risk indication.After several quarters of dull Drug Eluting stent (DES) performance in coronary, the company’s DES product line witnessed growth in both the United States and Japan since the last couple of quarters. This upside is driven by the recent launch of Resolute Onyx in the said markets. Further, these developments buoy optimism and strengthen our belief for a strong quarterly performance by the company in the to-be-reported quarter.In fiscal 2018, CVG is projected to rise 5.5-7% with growth pertaining to the third quarter of fiscal 2018 on a more favorable prior-year comparison. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CVG revenues in the fiscal third quarter is pegged at $2.77 billion, 9% higher than the year-ago reported number of $2.54 billion.Within Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG), surgical innovations should register sturdy growth, driven by new products in advanced stapling and advanced energy. Advanced stapling growth should come on the back of endo stapling specialty reloads with Tri-Staple technology as well as Signia. Advanced Energy growth should bank on a continued rollout of the company’s LigaSure instruments and Valleylab FT10 energy platform.Medtronic expects MITG revenue increase in the range of 3-3.5% in fiscal 2018. Notably, the first half of fiscal 2018 lodged lower MITG rise due to adverse impact from Hurricane Maria, implying an accelerated second-half improvement of 3.5-4.5%.Within the Restorative Therapies Group (RTG), the company witnesses encouraging developments regarding the brain therapy space. This division experienced a very strong second quarter, driven by high 20s’ growth in neurovascular with strength across the entire stroke portfolio, plus a mid-teens increase in neurosurgery. We expect this bullish trend to continue in the third quarter as well.Medtronic estimates its RTG growth of approximately 3% in fiscal 2018, balancing the impact of Hurricane Maria and in spine market, the projection is flat to slightly down with continued strength in brain therapies. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MITG revenues in the soon-to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.91 billion, 5.5% higher than the year-ago reported figure.Overall, Medtronic expects full-year revenue growth of 4-5% at CER. Currency fluctuation is expected to leave a positive impact of $275-$375 million on fiscal results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues remains at $29.49 billion.Adjusted earnings per share growth for fiscal 2018 is expected in the range of 9-10% at CER. Currency translation is expected to adversely impact with a couple of cents. The consensus mark for fiscal 2018 earnings is pegged at $4.76.Here’s What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Medtronic does not have the right combination of the two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP:Medtronic has an Earnings ESP of -0.08%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Medtronic carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Hence, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks you may want to consider from the same space as our proven model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in the upcoming releases:Universal Health Services, Inc.

847,UHS,"“When you combine ignorance and leverage, you get some pretty interesting results.” – Warren BuffettIndeed, in the complex world of investment, understanding the amount of financial leverage a company bears is crucial. Per the theory of cost of capital, a company’s capital structure reflects a mix of debt and equity that is used to finance its capital projects. Now a comparative analysis of the same theory reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity since debt is cheaper, especially in periods of low interest rates.Moreover, when a company opts for equity financing, a shareholder not only becomes a partial owner of the company but develops a direct claim on the company’s future profits as well. Another perk of debt financing is that the interest on debt is tax deductible.However, given the uncertainty surrounding the economy in recent times, no one can be fully sure of how a company will perform the next day. Companies bearing large amount of debts are more prone to financial crisis, especially at times of high interest rates.With the Federal Reserve set to raise interest rates for the United States thrice in 2018, the market scenario does not seem to be much in favor of companies opting for debt financing. That said, for the investor, the real challenge is determining whether the stock in which he/she is investing has a sustainable debt level, since a debt-free corporation is rare to find. This is where the concept of “leverage” comes in. Leverage simply indicates the level of debt a corporation carries at present. Historically, several leverage ratios have emerged as efficient tools to evaluate a company’s credit level to support prudent equity investments. The most popular among them is debt-to-equity ratio.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business, thereby making it a better investment pick.Although companies reflecting high earnings growth should be the ideal investment choices, those with high leverage might not generate satisfactory returns. So companies with low leverage instead of high earnings will be your perfect choice on Valentine's Day.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure safe returns.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy): Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 25 stocks that made it through the screen.MGIC Investment (MTG  -  Free Report): The company is the leading provider of private mortgage insurance coverage in the United States to the home mortgage lending industry.

848,UHS,"In corporate finance, leverage is a well-known business strategy adopted by companies  to borrow funds to finance working capital requirements, acquisitions or for some kind of business expansion. Now, the two most common financial resources corporates resort to are debt and equity. Interestingly, a comparative analysis of the cost of capital theory reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity, as debt is available at a lower cost compared to equity; especially in periods of low interest rates. This happens because when a company finances its operations with debt, it takes on fixed expenses in the form of interest payments for a fixed time period.Whereas, in case of equity financing, a shareholder not only becomes a partial owner of the company but develops a direct claim on the company’s future profits as well. Another perk of debt financing is that the interest on debt is tax deductible.Yet, debt financing has its drawbacks. The problem arises when the amount of debt a company bears becomes exorbitant. Especially, at times of high interest rates, companies with large debt loads become more prone to bankruptcy.That said, for the investor, the real challenge is determining whether the stock in which he/she is investing has a sustainable debt level, since a debt-free corporation is rare to find. Therefore, the debt level of a company is an important point of consideration while making  an investment decision. Several leverage ratios have emerged as efficient tools to evaluate a company’s credit level to support prudent equity investments. The most popular among them is the debt-to-equity ratio.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business, thereby making it a better investment pick.With the Q4 reporting cycle in full swing by now, companies reflecting high earnings growth should be ideal investment choices. However, such growth stocks may also be highly leveraged ones.Since a greater cohort of investors is risk-averse by nature, it is reasonable to expect that they will be more attracted to companies with low leverage than high earnings growth.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure safe returns.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome.

849,UHS,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 4.5% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is UHS due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Universal Health Q1 Earnings, Revenues Lag EstimatesUniversal Health reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of $2.45 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.4%. However, the bottom line grew 17% year over year.Net revenues increased 2.9% year over year to $2.7 billion. However, the top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2%.Total operating expenses of $2.4 billion at the end of the first quarter also increased 4.2% year over year.Segment UpdateAcute Care Hospitals:Adjusted admissions and adjusted patient days increased 2.3% and 5.4%, respectively, from the prior-year quarter. Net revenues (on a same facility basis) climbed 3.7% in the first quarter.Behavioral hospitals:On a same facility basis, adjusted admissions increased 1.6% while adjusted patient days declined 0.4%, both on a year-over-year basis. Net revenues increased 3% during the quarter under review on a same facility basis.Financial UpdateAs of Mar 31, 2018, the company had cash and cash equivalents of nearly $73 million, down 1.3% from year-end 2017.Total assets were $11 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, up 2.4% from year-end 2017.The company managed to lower its debt burden, evident from its long-term debt of $3.4 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, which declined 4% from year-end 2017.For the first three months of2018, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $364 million, down 24.7% year over year. Buyback ProgramIn November 2017, the board of directors authorized a $400-million increase in Universal Health’s stock repurchase program, raising the aggregate authorization to $1.2 billion from the previous $800-million approved in 2016 and 2014. Concurrently, during the first quarter, the company repurchased 42,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $4.6 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

850,UHS,"HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) has been witnessing consistent growth in its revenue base. In the past five years, revenues have recorded a compound annual growth rate of nearly 7% on the back of organic and inorganic strategies. For 2017, it expects revenues to range within $43-$44 billion, reflecting 4% year-over-year growth.The Nashville, TN-based company has been growing through buyouts over past many years. In 2017, its two major acquisitions of Florida and Texas hospitals from Community Health Systems, Inc (CYH  -  Free Report) are worth a mention.  These deals have boosted patient volumes and expanded network across several markets. The company’s strong financial position has supported its inorganic initiatives. HCA Healthcare has witnessed impressive cash flow generation over years enabling it to deploy capital in the most effective manner. The company has been paying dividends at regular intervals. It has also been taking up share buyback programs to enhance return to investors.However, lately, the company’s commercial business has been facing challenges from declining volumes of admissions. Its international business is also under pressure due to a fall in admissions in Middle East and London. High level of bad debt is also a major headwind for the company.Further, it also suffers from the prevailing industry-wide softness in volumes. Factors such as payor initiatives to move volumes away from hospitals, rising deductibles and prevalence of high deductible health plans, and increased proportion of hospital care to be paid by consumers are driving away volumes.The company also faces challenges due to the constant uncertainty stemming from President Trump and the Republican Congress’ efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. The recent tax bill that ends the “individual mandate” (which required most Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a fine) is also expected to result in higher uninsured rate going forward. Moreover, as continued losses from public exchanges led the health insurers to scale back their participation from exchanges, the uninsured rate continues to increase, hurting the company. Other players in the industry like Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) and Tenet Healthcare Corporation. (THC  -  Free Report) are also victims of this political uncertainty.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

851,UHS,"Tenet Healthcare Corp (THC  -  Free Report) will report fourth-quarter results on Feb 26, 2017 after market close.Last quarter, the company’s loss was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Let us see, how things are shaping for this quarter. However, the figure compared unfavorably with adjusted earnings of 20 cents in the year-ago period. This underperformance a year ago primarily stemmed from a decline in California Provider Fee revenues, lower revenues and higher expenses associated with hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Expenses related to the company’s divestitures also contributed to the downside.Factors to ConsiderTenet Healthcare’s fourth-quarter results are likely to reflect the industry-wide softness in volumes.Factors such as payor initiatives to move volumes away from hospitals, rising deductibles and prevalence of high deductible health plans, increased proportion of hospital care to be paid by consumers, are driving away volumes and the same is likely to be seen in the to-be-reported quarter. These might further result in lower admissions inducing a decline in patient revenues.However, the company’s Ambulatory segment has been performing well over the past many quarters. We expect fourth-quarter revenues to further benefit from this solid segmental performance.Tenet Healthcare’s cost management program primarily comprised headcount reductions and the renegotiation of contracts with suppliers and vendors. Its enterprise-wide cost-reduction initiatives are likely to decrease expenses and favor margins.Further, the company’s share buybacks during the quarter to be reported are expected to aid its bottom line.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Tenet Healthcare is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Tenet Healthcare has an Earnings ESP of -3.51%. However, a company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Tenet Healthcare Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Tenet Healthcare Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Tenet Healthcare Corporation Quote Zacks Rank: Tenet Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lowers the predictive power of ESP. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks from the medical sector that you may want to consider as these have the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this time around:Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.96% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 28.

852,UHS,"Universal Health Services, Inc.'s (UHS  -  Free Report) solid inorganic strategy positions it well for long-term growth. The acquisition of the adult services division of Cambian Group and Desert View Hospital in Nevada are worth a mention here.The company’s top line has been growing consistently since 2006 except for 2012, driven primarily by solid inorganic growth and strong performance from both of its segments — Acute Care and Behavioral Health.Its acute care platform has been delivering strong underwriting results consistently. The same trend continued in the first nine months of 2017 as well.In addition, its behavioral platform has been performing well too. In fact, behavioral facility acquisitions help Universal Health win market share in the fast growing addiction and mental health disorder market. The segment continued to deliver strong results in the first nine months of 2017.Month to date, shares of Universal Health have gained 5.6% while the industry has rallied 4.9%. However, the stock is currently trading at a  trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 15.3, which is at its median range, the same compares unfavorably with the industry average of 14.9. This suggests that the stock is overvalued compared to its peers. In addition, the company’s high-debt level has been a concern over the last few years. This also led to a rise in interest expenses which has been putting pressure on its margins.Another area of concern for the company is the increase in its operating expenses since 2013, which continued to rise in the first nine months of 2017. This also keeps weighing on the company’s bottom line.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderUniversal Health currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the medical sector can consider some better-ranked stocks like Align Technology, Inc.

854,UHS,"Shares of Universal Health Services Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) tumbled to a 52-week low of $99.56 during the trading session on Nov 8. The slide is believed to have stemmed from poor third-quarter results and a subsequent guidance cut.  Over the past 52 weeks, shares of Universal Health Services have ranged from a low of $99.56 to a high of $129.74. The average volume of shares traded over the last three months is approximately 0.8 million.Poor Results BotherInvestors were particularly disappointed by lackluster third-quarter earnings which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.5%. The top line also missed the estimate by 2%. This was the second miss in a row.Quite concerning was weak volumes reported by both operating segments — Acute Care and Behavioral Health Hospitals.In the Acute Care segment, adjusted admission growth slowed to 3.5% in the third quarter compared with growth of 6.5% in the year-ago quarter. Likewise, adjusted patent day witnessed growth of 1.5% versus 3.4% in the third quarter of 2016. Revenue per adjusted admission declined 0.6% compared with growth of 4.4% in last year quarter.Softness also persisted in the Behavioral Health Hospitals segment with adjusted admission growth declining to 1.1% in the third quarter compared with growth of 1.6% reported in the year-ago quarter. In the same vein, adjusted patent day declined 0.2% versus growth of 1.6% in third-quarter 2016.  Revenue per adjusted admission grew just 1.3% compared with growth of 3.3% in the year-ago quarter.Weakness in volumes from this segment is expected to persist in the coming quarter.Uninspiring OutlookShares also took a toll from its tepid 2017 earnings guidance. Based on the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first nine months of 2017, the company revised its estimated range of adjusted net income attributable for 2017 to $7.25 to $7.50 per diluted share from the previously provided range of $7.50 to $8 per diluted share.This revised guidance, which excludes the effect of electronic health records impact for the year, as well as the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, decreases the lower end of the previously provided range by approximately 3.3%, and decreases the upper end of the previously provided range by approximately 6.3%.Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, the stock has lost 16.7%, significantly underperforming the industry’s decline of 6.5%. Given the headwinds facing the company we do not expect any breather for the stock anytime soon.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderUniversal Health Services carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Some of the better-ranked stocks in the health care space are Amedisys Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report), Chemed Corp. (CHE  -  Free Report) and Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report).

It seems to be also encouraged by the increased cooperation between hospitals to handle stroke cases. Also, larger hospital systems are investing to increase the number of new centers. However, management is a bit cautious about the growth trend which might remain uneven in the coming quarters.Penumbra, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Penumbra, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Penumbra, Inc. Quote Strategies Buoy Optimism: The company is presently focusing on driving innovation, product development and geographic expansion. This is expected to help Penumbra maintain the bullish trend in the to-be-reported quarter.In this regard, Penumbra presented results from an independently-conducted COMPASS Trial and the company-sponsored PROMISE Study at the International Stroke Conference 2018 in January 2018. These studies were focused on Penumbra’s aspiration thrombectomy system for ischemic stroke revascularization.Moreover, we are encouraged by the company’s launch of 3D Revascularization Device, a technologically advanced stroke device developed for efficient aspiration with ACE Reperfusion Catheters in first-half 2017.Growing Peripheral Vascular Business: The Peripheral Vascular portfolio comprising Indigo System, embolization platform including RUBY Coil, POD (Penumbra Occlusion Device), and POD Packing Coil along with LANTERN microcatheter is quite strong. Moreover, the company has been witnessing solid contribution from this segment over the past few quarters. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Strong Geographical Performance: Penumbra has been delivering strong performance in both domestic and international markets on solid contributions from neuro business. We expect the trend to continue in the fourth quarter as well.Rising Operating Expenses: In third-quarter 2017, the company witnessed a rise in operating expenses. We expect escalating costs and expenses to continue to keep margins under pressure in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, research and development expenses increased 25.2% in the third quarter. With the company remaining focused on product launches, we expect fourth-quarter results to reflect high expenses.Further, foreign exchange fluctuations and stiff competition from major commercial laboratories and hospitals continue to raise caution.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues of $87.8 million reflects a 20.3% rise from the prior-year quarter.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Penumbra has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Penumbra is +200%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Penumbra’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of a penny is narrower than the loss of 8 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Universal Health Services (UHS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.96% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM Product Network revenues stands at $12,082 million, reflecting a sequential decline of 0.8%. While this is expected to mar fourth-quarter results, an expected improvement in other segments should help the company generate solid results this season.Interestingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM Home Delivery revenues is pegged at $11,541 million, showing a rise of 5.4% sequentially. We believe the company’s unique offerings of home-delivery pharmacy care, specialty pharmacy care, specialty benefit management, and medical and drug data analysis services buoy optimism. Express Scripts also distributes a full range of biopharmaceutical products and provides extensive cost-management and patient-care services.Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM Service sales is pinned at $368 million, showing an increase of 7.6% sequentially.Other Factors at PlayView Upbeat: Prior to the fourth-quarter earnings release, management raised the previously-issued adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2017 from $6.97-$7.05 to $7-$7.08. This indicates a 10% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.Per management, the raised projected range can be attributed to the combination of accretive acquisitions and strategic tax planning initiatives.Notably, the company has issued guidance for 2018, where it expects the acquisition of eviCore healthcare to prove accretive to earnings.Favorable Estimate Revision Trend: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter revenues is pegged at $25.12 billion, showing year-over-year growth of 1%.Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings per share stands at $2.09.

The beat ratio is strong with 100% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations.The sector has been in the limelight since the change of power at the White House.

New product launch, improving service, expansion into ancillary businesses, and cost control measures will accrue to the top line.Nevertheless, high bad debt, increasing investments in technological innovation, integration cost related to acquisitions and high interest expenses on debt-funded acquisitions will put pressure on the bottom line.Let’s take a peek at these healthcare companies that are gearing up to report their second-quarter results on Jul 25.HCA Healthcare, Inc.

862,UHS,"For Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC  -  Free Report), a leading health care services company in the United States, 2017 was not a good year.  Having suffered from falling revenues, weak volumes, high bad debts and overall industry weakness, the company’s performance was weak.The stock has lost 14% in a year’s time, underperforming the industry’s decline of 0.7%.The company’s performance pales all the more compared to other hospital stocks like HCA Holdings, Inc (HCA  -  Free Report) and Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) that have gained 9.7% and 2.1%, respectively, over the same periodWhat Affected 2017?The company incurred losses in the last two quarters owing to lower revenues and higher expenses. The last quarter, however, suffered from the adverse impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma.Tenet Healthcare’s revenues have been continuously declining over last two quarters due to reduced admissions, inpatient and outpatient surgeries, emergency department visits and total outpatient visits. At the end of the first nine months of 2017, revenues declined nearly 4% year over year.The downtrend in revenues was due to the high deductible plans that result in more out-of-pocket expenses of the patients. Increase in uninsured rates due to the uncertainty surrounding the Affordable Care Act also caused a reduction in volume of patients. This apart, the company also suffered from lower payer rates and increased bad debt. Lower net revenues combined with increased operating expenses adversely impacted its margin.Tenet Healthcare has been facing a continuous increase in its debt level over the past many years. The company uses a large portion of its cash flow to pay the interests on its debts, which in turn, lead to limited funds available for its operations, growth initiatives or capital expenditures. The cash flow started declining since 2016 and the company lowered its expectation for 2017. Tepid Guidance for 2017 and 2018Following disappointing results in the last two quarters, the company lowered its guidance for the second time in 2017 at the end of the third quarter.  Tenet Healthcare projects revenues in the range of $18.9 billion to $19.1 billion for 2017, down 3% from the previously guided range of $19.1 billion to $19.4 billion. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for 2017 are projected in the range of 59 cents to 74 cents, down 26% from the earlier projection of 69-99 cents.Tenet Healthcare expects the recently enacted “Tax Cut and Jobs Act” law to affect its 2018 earnings as well. The company now anticipates adjusted diluted earnings per share to range between 58 cents and 97 cents compared with the previously guided range of $1.07-$1.36. For 2018, it expects net operating revenues to range within $17.8 billion to $18.2 billion. This also compares unfavorably with $18.9-$19.1 billion guided for 2017.Does 2018 Look Promising?Tenet Healthcare recently announced that it will be undertaking three additional initiatives as an extension to its goal to improve the overall financial performance and enhance shareholders’ value. These initiatives include strengthening of its previously announced cost reduction plan, updating the ongoing process of its board refreshment and finding a buyer for its Conifer segment.The company’s cost reduction initiatives are expected to help it lower annual operating expenses by $250 million, with annualized run-rate savings to be achieved by 2018 end.The company’s accretive acquisitions and strategic divestitures are also expected to fine tune its operations in 2018, but the immediate impact of it on earnings is hard to predict.Despite these growth initiatives undertaken by the company, its shares are likely to remain under pressure until the actual earnings number reveal some positive developments.Downward Estimate RevisionThe company has also seen downward estimate revision over the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has been revised downward by 14.3% over the same time frame, reflecting bearish analyst sentiment.Zacks Rank and A Stock to ConsiderTenet Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the medical sector is Centene Corp (CNC  -  Free Report).

863,UHS,"Year 2017 was a dull one for Community Health Systems, Inc. (CYH  -  Free Report), a leading operator of general acute care hospitals in communities across the country.What Were the Dampeners in 2017?The company suffered from lower-than-expected volumes, payer rates, along with increased bad debt. The lower net revenue combined with increased operating expenses negatively impacted its EBITDA and EBITDA margin.On a same-store basis, net operating revenues for the nine months ended Sep 30, 2017 decreased 0.3%. Both same-store inpatient admissions and adjusted admissions decreased 1.9% year over year for the nine months ended Sep 30, 2017.For the first nine months of 2017, Community Health’s cash flows declined nearly 24% year over year led by the timing of payments for payroll,  decline in cash received from HITECH and other decreases, including divestitures and working capital changes.In the face of continued volume challenges and high operating costs, the reduction in guidance was disappointing. For 2017, it now expects revenues between $15.8 billion and $15.9 billion (compared with $15.85 billion and $16.05 billion projected earlier), and loss per share in the range of $1.20 to $1.30 (compared with loss of 30-40 cents expected previously).These headwinds weighed on its stock, which lost 24% in 2017, underperforming the industry’s growth of 6.8%. Its performance compared unfavorably with other players in the same space like HCA Healthcare Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Services Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report), which gained 18.7% and 6.6%, respectively.Will 2018 Turn Out to be Better?Community Health undertook a 30-hospital divestiture plan with the aim of streamlining its business and using the proceeds to repay its huge debt load.The company is focusing on future growth and margin expansion. This includes strategies such as service line enhancements, physician practice development, incremental outpatient access points, investments in the behavioral health and post acute space, and the expansion of new transfer program initiative.The initiatives are aimed at reducing operating expenses and increasing patient volumes. Though Community Health expects to see some progress on this front in the fourth quarter and in 2018, we remain on the sidelines til the progress is reflected in its earnings.Estimate RevisionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 was revised to loss of 86 cents per share from a loss of 62 cents per share in the last 60 days. This movement reflects analysts’ pessimism over the stock, which is likely to exert downward pressure on its share price going ahead.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCommunity Health carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Centene Corp.

864,UHS,"The year gone by was a dull one for Franklin, TN-based Acadia Healthcare Company Inc. (ACHC  -  Free Report) that provides behavioral health care services in the United States and the United Kingdom.What Were the Drags in 2017?This behavioral healthcare company is faced with anemic U.K. operations, which is suffering from low census and a tightening labor market for nurses and other clinical staff. These factors caused a 9.5% and 21% decline in the segment’s revenues and EBIDTA, respectively, for the first nine months of 2017.     In the face of continued volume challenges and high operating costs, the reduction in guidance was disappointing. For 2017, it now expects revenues between $2.82 billion and $2.83 billion (versus $2.85 billion and $2.87 billion), and EPS in the range of $2.23 to $2.25 (versus $2.42 to $2.47).Another concern is its high leverage. The company’s long-term debt has increased consistently for the past many years, leading to an increase in interest expense. At the end of 2016, long-term debt increased 48% year over year to $3.25 billion. Though it moderated slightly to $3.23 as of Sep 30, 2017, it remains at high levels. Its debt-to-capital ratio remains to the south of 55%. Such high debt levels may limit the company’s expansion plans and aggravate risks. Higher interest expense on debt is also expected to impact profits.These headwinds have weighed on its stock which lost 0.8% in 2017, underperforming the industry’s growth of 6.4%. Its performance pales all the more, relative to other players in the same space like HCA Healthcare Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Services Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report), which gained 18.7% and 6.6%, respectively.Will 2018 be Better?We do not expect any improvement in the company’s U.K. operations in the near term. Management anticipates pressure in the labor market to continue due to uncertainty around Brexit which is discouraging healthcare workers from coming to the country, consequently forcing the company to rely more on agency labor to fill its open positions.Also, the low admissions witnessed in the third quarter did not show up in October, making  management to expect soft volumes in the fourth quarter.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAcadia Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

865,UHS,"Tenet Healthcare Corp (THC  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter results after market closes on Nov 6, 2017.Last quarter the company’s loss came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This underperformance primarily stemmed from a decline in California Provider Fee revenues reduced electronic health record incentives. Let us see how things are shaping for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderThe Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s third-quarter earnings are likely to be affected by lower revenues and higher expenses associated with hurricanes Harvey and Irma. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Moreover, along with other hospital companies like Universal Health Services, Inc (UHS  -  Free Report), HCA Holdings, Inc (HCA  -  Free Report) and LifePoint Health Inc (LPNT  -  Free Report) that have reported so far, Tenet Healthcare’s earnings are likely to reflect the industry-wide softness in volumes.Factors such as payor initiatives to move volumes away from hospitals, rising deductibles and prevalence of high deductible health plans, increased proportion of hospital care to be paid by consumers are driving away volumes and the same is likely to be seen in the quarter.  These might result in lower admissions leading to a decline in patient revenues.Admissions also must have been adversely affected by the hurricanes that tore into parts of United States. However, the company’s Ambulatory segment has been performing well over past many quarters. Tenet Healthcare expects third-quarter revenues to benefit from the segment’s performance.Tenet Healthcare’s cost management program comprised primarily of headcount reductions and the renegotiation of contracts with suppliers and vendors. Its enterprise-wide cost reduction initiatives are likely to reduce the level of expenses and favor margins.Further, shares bought back by the company in the third quarter will aid the bottom line.Tenet Healthcare Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Tenet Healthcare Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Tenet Healthcare Corporation QuotePreliminary ResultsRecently, the company announced preliminary results for the to-be-reported quarter. It expects to report revenues of approximately $4.6 billion, down 3% year over year.Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be approximately $507 million, down 11% year over year. For the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA is likely to be negatively impacted by lower revenues and higher expenses associated with Harvey and Irma, lower-than-anticipated revenues from the Texas Medicaid Waiver program and the Florida Medicaid program.Tenet Healthcare expects to report an adjusted net loss of approximately $17 million, or 17 cents per diluted share. This compares unfavorably with adjusted earnings of 16 cents per share generated in the year-ago quarter.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

867,UHS,"Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25 after  market close.Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 6.3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The company’s two segments, Acute Care and Behavioral Health, have been performing strongly over the past many quarters. The segments have been continuously witnessing a rise in admissions, licensed beds as well as patient days that have significantly resulted in higher revenues.  This yet-to-be-reported quarter is also likely to see the same bullish trend.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenue is pegged at $2.6 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 8%.  Our consensus estimates for revenues from Acute Care and Behavioral Health segments are currently pegged at $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, up 10% and 6.4% respectively, year over year.Since 2012, the average number of licensed beds in the Acute Care hospitals and Behavioral Health centers kept increasing and the trend is expected to continue in the third quarter.. Our consensus estimates for Average Licensed Beds in Acute Care and Behavioral Health are pegged at 6.1 billion and 23.1 billion, up 3% and 6% year over year, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Admissions in Acute Care and Behavioral Health is pegged at 73.1 billion and 120.7 billion respectively, up 5% and 7% year over year, respectively. This in turn is expected to aid the company’s top line in the third quarter significantly.Other FactorsUniversal Health’s efforts to enhance shareholders’ value through share repurchases might have boosted its bottom line by limiting share count.Nevertheless, rising costs related to interest payment, reserves for settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, plus impairments of long-lived assets might have put pressure on margins.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Universal Healthis likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Universal Health has an Earnings ESP of -1.01%.

Price and EPS Surprise | Universal Health Services, Inc.

868,UHS,"Tenet Healthcare Corporation (THC  -  Free Report) announced the sale of its MacNeal Hospital and its associated operations to Loyola Medicine, an affiliate of Trinity Health.The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2018. It marks one of the many steps taken by the company to reorganize its business, which is suffering from a decline in admissions, inpatient and outpatient surgeries, emergency department visits and total outpatient visits, and high bad debt.Last month, the company reshuffled its top brass in an effort to steer the company toward growth. The changes included the resignation of its CEO Trevor Fetter, effective Mar 15, 2018 or earlier when the company finds a suitable replacement. The company is also reviewing its board composition to sharpen management’s expertise in areas required for its long-term growth.Tenet Healthcare posted loss in the last two quarters and missed earnings estimates in three quarters in a row prior to that. The company has also reduced its earnings guidance for 2017 after lackluster performance in first-half 2017.In a year's time, the stock has lost 37.3% compared with the industry’s decline of 13.3%.The company is making continuous improvement in its business portfolio by exiting non-core and least profitable business lines. Recently, the company completed the sale of its Huston-based hospitals and related operations to HCA Healthcare Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report).The proceeds from the sale of its units are being used to repay debt to lower its interest burden and strengthen balance sheet. The funds are also being invested in growth areas, such as its Ambulatory platform in which the company is targeting $100 million to $150 million in acquisition opportunities every year.Other actions to restore profitability include expense reduction via managing pricing and cost, integrating recent acquisitions, building facilities by expanding access points for patients and investing in key service lines.Though these actions will help the company’s hospitals to expand their market share for both inpatient and outpatient services over the long term, short-term business volumes remain challenged.The hospital industry is suffering from low patient admissions as they are increasingly choosing to stay away from hospitals due to high out-of-pocket (which shift the initial costs to patients) costs. Also, a pullback of insurers from public exchanges has increased the uninsured rate, which in turn is hurting the company. Given continued uncertainty over the future of Obamacare, the present scenario is likely to continue in the quarters ahead which will drain the company’s business volumes.Some players like Community Health Systems Inc. (CYH  -  Free Report) and United Health Services, Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) are suffering from industry weakness.Universal Health missed second-quarter earnings estimates and cut its 2017 earnings guidance.

869,UHS,"Mednax, Inc. (MD  -  Free Report) is suffering from a subdued pace of birth across the country, which has slowed growth of one of its core businesses — neonatology. This has put significant stress on its revenue growth.  Moreover, a change in payor mix in its anesthesiology business has kept its commercial volumes under pressure. This segment also suffers from growth in compensation expense for nurse anesthetists.Additionally, Mednax’s results have suffered due to huge investments made in diversification. These investments might create volatility in its quarter-over-quarter performance, before reaping long-term growth.Markedly, an increase in expenses as a proportion of revenues owing to growth in compensation expense for supporting acquisition-related growth curbed margins further. Also, growth in existing units, including compensation for non-physician clinicians, increased at a faster pace than in the previous periods.The company has been witnessing a dent in its bottom line led by a spike in its interest expenses for more than three years. It is also suffering from an increase in overall expenses, which has outpaced revenue growth compared with the last many years.These factors led the company to trim its earnings guidance. Mednax expects earnings per share (EPS) for three months (ending Sep 30, 2017) in the range of 66 cents to 71 cents, down from $1.04 per share in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EPS will likely be in the range of 83 cents to 88 cents, down from $1.09 per share in third quarter of 2016.The range for its third-quarter guidance assumes anticipated same-unit revenue of negative 2% to flat year over year. For the third quarter of 2017, the company expects EBITDA to decline by 17% to 21% year over year, against growth of 7.7% in the prior-year period.Per management, the challenges in its business are expected to continue in the near term. We thus expect shares of the company to remain under pressure in the coming quarters.Other companies in the same space HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report), LifePoint Inc. (LPNT  -  Free Report) and Universal Health Services Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) are all suffering from low patient admissions.

870,UHS,"HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report), one of the most diversified hospital companies in the United States, has achieved growth via a number of acquisitions made over the past many years.Since its IPO in March 2011 and through the second quarter of 2017, the company spent more than $4.4 billion on acquiring a number of hospitals.The company is due to acquire two hospitals from Community Health Systems.These deals have led to an increase in patient volumes and enabled network expansion across several markets. The company’s acquisitions are expected to add scale to its business, positioning it better to weather the regulatory uncertainty in the healthcare sector.These purchases are backed by HCA Healthcare’s strong balance sheet and consistent increase in cash flows for a number of years. These also provide room for shareholder-friendly capital deployment through buy backs and dividend payouts.The company’s superior performance is reflective in its share price performance which has gained 5.9% year to date compared with the industry’s growth of 4.2%.Nevertheless, the company’s commercial business has recently been facing challenges from declining volumes of admissions. Its international business is also under pressure due to decline in admissions in Middle East and London.Driven by weakness in business volumes which is expected to persist in the coming quarters, the company narrowed its earnings guidance. It expects adjusted EBITDA of $8.35 billion to $8.5 billion (versus the previous expectation of $8.4 billion to $8.7 billion) and earnings per share of $7.00 to $7.30 for 2017 (versus $7.20-$7.60 expected earlier).The hospital industry is suffering from low admissions as patients are increasingly choosing to stay away due to high out-of-pocket (which shift the initial costs to patients) costs. Also, a pullback of insurers from public exchanges has increased the uninsured rate which in turn is hurting the company.  Given the continued uncertainty about the future of Obamacare, the present scenario is likely to continue in the quarters ahead and drain business volumes.Other players in the industry like Community Health Systems Inc.

871,UHS,"Universal Health Services, Inc.'s (UHS  -  Free Report) is well positioned for long-term growth on the back of its solid inorganic strategy. This has been contributing to the company’s growth story since long. The acquisition of the adult services division of Cambian Group in 2016 is worth a mention here.Universal Health primarily specializes in providing low cost care to underprivileged patients. Its acute care platform has been delivering strong underwriting results consistently. The same trend continued in the first half of 2017 as well.In addition, its behavioral platform has been performing well too. In fact, behavioral facility acquisitions help Universal Health win market share in the fast growing addiction and mental health disorder market. The segment continued to deliver strong results in the first half of 2017.In the last six months, the stock has lost 9.4%, narrower than the industry’s decline of 11%. This reflects shareholders’ confidence in the stock despite the challenging environment.However, the stock currently has a trailing 12-month price-to-sales ratio of 1.1. This, although is below the median 1.2 of its range, it compares unfavorably with the industry average of 0.5. This suggests that the stock is overvalued compared to its peers. In addition, the company’s high-debt level has been a concern over the last five years. This also led to a rise in interest expenses which could weigh on its margins.Another area of concern for the company is the increase in its operating expenses since 2013, which continued to rise in the first half of 2017. This also keeps hurting the company’s bottom line.Zacks Rank and Key PicksUniversal Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

872,UHS,"Continued strong demand for mental and behavioral health and support from government for increased funding for opioid addiction programs along with strong fundamentals have driven growth at Acadia Healthcare Co., Inc. (ACHC  -  Free Report).The same is reflected in the company’s share price, which has gained a whopping 42% year to date, significantly outdoing the mere 3% growth for the industry it belongs to.Acadia Healthcare’s performance looks all the more superb when compared with the meager gain of 1.7% by another player, United Health Services, Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) in the same space.So what led the momentum in the stock?Favorable Industry TrendsAcadia Healthcare, a behavioral health care company, has been favored by spending on behavioral health services that has more than doubled in a decade. The company has witnessed an increase in the number of patient growth after the passage of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act by Congress in 2008. The act required health plans and insurers to pay for addiction and mental illness treatment just as they would for cancer or cardiovascular care.Cases of behavioral and substance abuse is on the rise, which has resulted in an increased number of deaths related to this. Given the fragility of the case, it seems that new regulations in process (under Trump’s presidency) should support the industry by providing greater patient access to care, growing awareness of treatment options, and solid long-term pricing support. This should driving sales and demand for the company’s services.Strong FundamentalsOther than industry-specific factors, the stock is gaining from the company’s strong performance. Its U.K. and U.S. facilities have been performing favorably and witnessed an increase in patient admission, revenue per patient and number of patient days. The company’s  superior operating performance its evident from its revenues, which witnessed a CAGR of 67% from 2011-2016. Along with top-line growth, the bottom line has also seen an impressive CAGR of 39.34% from 2012-2016.Management’s ability to execute on inorganic growth strategies has paid off. We favorably view the company’s extensive plans for bed expansion. The company added 91 beds in the second quarter and expects to add 800 this year. While a quarter of these additions will stem from a joint venture in Louisiana, Virginia and Arkansas, the rest will come from business expansion. Management also believes that bed expansion can accelerate over the next 3-5 years.The company made a number of acquisitions in the past that have amplified its growth. It is continuously seeking acquisitions, primarily in the U.S and remains open to joint ventures. More importantly, Acadia Healthcare is a sought-out partner for acute care hospitals.Acadia Healthcare’s ambitious growth plans are supported by its strong capital position. In 2016, cash flow from operations was $371.7 million, up 50% year over year. The same was up 2.6% in the first half of 2017. Apart from pursuing acquisitions, the company plans to use excess cash to reduce debt.Given the bunch of positives, we expect momentum in the shares of Acadia Healthcare to continue in the coming quarters.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAcadia Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked players in the health care space are Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report). Both these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

873,UHS,"Tenet Healthcare Corporation (THC  -  Free Report) has announced that its chairman and CEO Trevor Fetter will quit his position of director and chief executive officer. This will be effective Mar 15, 2018, or earlier when the company finds a suitable replacement.Though Mr. Fetter will remain in his role, he will not be regarded as the most senior official.Among other changes, the company has appointed the current independent lead director Ronald A. Rittenmeyer as the executive chairman, effective immediately. He will also be regarded as the senior most official at the company till the new CEO holds reins.The company’s board composition will also be reviewed to sharpen management’s expertise in areas required for its long-term growth.The company has also implemented shareholder rights plan to protect net operating losses which were $1.7 billion as of Dec 31, 2016. This implies that the company will be able to save $600 million in tax at a 35% tax rate.This change in Tenet Healthcare’s leadership position comes at a time when it is in rough waters. The company’s results have been suffering from a decline in admissions, inpatient and outpatient surgeries, emergency department visits and total outpatient visits.This also caused the company to post loss in last two quarters and miss earnings estimates in three quarters in a row prior to that.Tenet Healthcare has also reduced its earnings guidance for 2017 after lackluster performance in first-half 2017.The stock has given a poor performance in past one year as evident by a loss of 29.1% compared with the industry’s loss of 4.2%.We believe it will be no mean task for the new leader to restore the company’s profitability. Though on a company-specific level, assets sales by management will help it to reduce high leverage but its top line will continue to be troubled by weak volume trends expected to continue throughout the industry.The hospital industry is suffering from low patient admissions as they are increasingly choosing to stay away from hospitals due to high out-of-pocket (which shift the initial costs to patients) costs. Also, a pullback of insurers from public exchanges has increased the uninsured rate which in turn is hurting the company.  Given the continued uncertainty about the future of Obamacare, the present scenario is likely to continue in the quarters ahead which will drain the company’s business volumes.Other players in the industry like HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report), Community Health Systems Inc. (CYH  -  Free Report), United Health Services, Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) have been suffering from the industry weakness.HCA Healthcare and Universal Health missed the second-quarter earnings estimates and cut their 2017 earnings guidance.  Community Health on the other hand posted loss in the second quarter and reduced its 2017 earnings guidance.Tenet Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
