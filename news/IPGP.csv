1,IPGP,"Top growth stock IPG Photonics (IPGP) was a new addition to the IBD Sector Leaders list late Thursday. IPG was one of the top stocks of 2017, but that strength hasn't persisted into 2018. But that may be set to change, as the stock nears a proper buy point in the stock market today.Early May 1, the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, resulting in a 9.5% advance. The stock found much-needed support at its 200-day line.In that quarter, adjusted earnings and sales growth came in at 40% and 26%, respectively, vs. the year-ago period. But that growth is a step down from the torrid levels of growth two quarters ago. Then, the company posted year-over-year profit and revenue growth of 64% and 48%, respectively.Analysts expect the firm's full-year earnings to grow 17% in 2018 and 11% in 2019.According to analysts at Bernstein, IPG is the dominant player among fiber lasers and its competitive edge is expanding.

4,IPGP,"IPG Photonics (IPGP) — a top growth stock of 2017 — is adding a handle to its later-stage, cup-shaped base, as the Sector Leader trades about 6% away from a potential buy point in the stock market today. Shares fell 2.5% in midday trade Thursday, as it tries to maintain its 50-day support level.XThe laser maker's earnings and sales are still growing at a fast pace — respective increases of 34% and 29% in the most recent quarter — but that pace has slowed down compared with the previous three quarters. During that time frame, the company's earnings grew at a 50%+ clip each quarter. Meanwhile, quarterly revenue growth was accelerating from 38% to 46% to 48%.According to Stifel Nicolaus, China demand trends remain robust for high-power fiber lasers, which should continue to benefit IPG Photonics. The analyst firm believes that IPG has a unique competitive position based on automation. Despite the industry leadership position, Stifel has a hold rating on IPG's shares — largely based on valuation — and a 240 price target, which is about a 1% discount to the stock's midday Thursday price.A previous breakout Jan. 8 above a 248.33 cup-base buy point would eventually fail when the stock fell more than 7% below the buy point on Feb. 6 amid the general market's volatile downside swings.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

7,IPGP,"President Trump offered a plan Friday to reduce the prices of costly ethical drugs, and the speech spurred generally positive reactions within the pharmaceutical and related industries.The biotech group was among the day's top three industries of the 197 tracked by IBD, rising 2.7%. Generic drugmakers rallied 2.5% as a group, while ethical drug stocks bounded up 2.4%, drugstores were up 1.7%, managed care up 1.6%, and wholesale drug supply up 1.4%.Meanwhile, the major equity indexes played small ball throughout most of Friday's session. But they finished the week with smart gains as IBD upgraded the stock market current outlook to ""Uptrend resumes"" on Thursday. The Nasdaq composite rushed 2.7% higher for the week. The S&P 500 lifted 2.4%.  Apple (AAPL) also posted a second straight weekly gain.The iPhone giant halted a nine-session winning streak, but still closed the bullish week up more than 2% at 188.59. That's on top of a 13% jump the prior week in unusually heavy volume. The recent rally has hoisted Apple as much as 6% past a new proper buy point of 179.04 in a very mild seven-week double-bottom base. (Read the latest updates in stock market action by going to the Stock Market Today landing page.)The Nasdaq composite edged 0.1% lower, but the S&P 500 inched nearly 0.2% higher. The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 0.3%, thanks to gains of 1 point or more from Big Pharma components Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE). UnitedHealth Group (UNH), another Dow Jones industrial component, also rose 4.57, or 2%, to 238.28.Merck is still trying to clear stubborn upside resistance at the long-term 200-day moving average. A 38 Relative Price Strength Rating means Merck is outperforming only 38% of all companies in IBD's database over the past 12 months.The small cap S&P 600 ticked 0.1% higher. At 986, the index is now up more than 5.3% since Jan. 1.Strong corporate earnings in Q1, more signs of modest U.S. inflation, and valuation of equities vs. bonds still offer reasons to be bullish on stocks for the rest of the year.""Even when you compare the earnings yield of the S&P 500 with yields on Baa corporate bonds, and not the 10-year Treasury bonds, the stock market still looks attractively valued,"" Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at asset management giant BNY Mellon Wealth Management, told IBD in an interview. ""But you should not invest on a snapshot view. Looking 12 to 18 months out, even with a cooling in the economy I cannot see the 10-year yield at 3% or lower.""The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond continued to hover below the critical 3% level, finishing the day around 2.97%. Grohowski forecasts the yield will end the year at 3.25%.Back to Apple; the megacap turnaround tech play is now trading roughly 5.3% above the 179.04 ideal buy point after a breakout from a double bottom base. Try to buy shares no more than 5% past the correct entry so that you avoid getting prematurely shaken out. Even large-cap leaders are prone to testing or even falling briefly below the breakout point after a strong upward thrust in price.Apple's fundamentals continue to shine, with earnings climbing 11%, 18%, 24%, 16% and 30% vs. year-ago levels in the past five quarters. The Street sees fiscal Q3 profit rising 31% to $2.18 a share, which would mark a slight acceleration in growth.Apple is now up almost 60% since it cleared a first-stage cup with handle base entry at 118.12 on Jan. 6, 2017.Inside the IBD 50, another pharmaceutical play rejoined the list of premier growth stocks. Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) blasted 14% higher to 57.05 as volume jumped nearly quadruple usual levels. Up three straight sessions, the stock is now extended 14% past a 49.85 correct buy point within a seven-month cuplike base.In that base, Supernus formed a roughly two-week downward slanting handle in lighter trade. This handle on the base represents the final shakeout of weak holders before this week's huge breakout. The expert in treatments for epilepsy and ADHD posted a 158% leap in first-quarter earnings to 49 cents a share, crushing the consensus estimate by nearly 49%. Sales increased 57% to $90.4 million, a quarterly record.IPG Photonics (IPGP), an industrial laser maker, and oil and gas play Wildhorse Resource Development (WRD), also joined the IBD 50 in recent sessions.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary on top growth stocks, breakouts, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:What Other Stocks Are New To IBD's Top Growth Screens?

15,IPGP,"""Avoiding behavioral risk"" is more than a Wall Street slogan to Vladimir ""Val"" de Vassal. It is a tactic he has raised to an art form as he aims to remove subjectivity from his hunt for top-performing growth stocks for two Glenmede mutual funds of which he's lead manager. Fueled in recent quarters by leading growth stocks like Apple (AAPL), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Mastercard (MA), $4 billion Large Cap Growth (GTLLX) and $2.9 billion Large Cap Core (GTLOX) both outperformed the S&P 500 in calendar 2017 as well as over the three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.Only 10% of U.S. diversified stock funds with at least $100 million in assets racked up that four-way feat, which makes them winners of the 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award.De Vassal and his team — including managers Paul Sullivan and Alex Attanasiu — have become adept at avoiding behavioral risk in their investment process. Instead, they focus on more than 80 objective yardsticks to measure each growth stock's worthiness. They wear blinders to block out less-meaningful information that can be distractions from data that mark growth stocks poised to advance. Emotions are a major part of behavioral risk, de Vassal says.De Vassal, age 58, talked with IBD about his strategy from his office in Philadelphia.Best Mutual Funds Monthly Performance ReportIBD: How do your growth-oriented mutual funds differ from rival growth funds?De Vassal: First, both funds use a similar process. The difference is the benchmark. For Core, it is the Russell 1000 Index. For Large Cap Growth, it is the Russell Growth. We control industry and sector exposures against those benchmarks.Our strategies are a blend of quantitative discipline based on underlying fundamental insights.IBD: How do you avoid letting emotions interfere with your hunt for growth stocks?De Vassal: We've built a library of factors, over 80, across the two strategies. In any sector, there are about 15 to 25 factors that we use to differentiate stocks. They're a combination of such things as valuation metrics, fundamental metrics and estimate revisions from sell-side analysts. We include some technical indicators as well.IBD: Give me examples of subjective metrics that you avoid.De Vassal: Subjective metrics that we do not use include the popularity of a company — its brand name — and nonquantifiable intangibles such as future products and profits that are not reflected in sell-side analyst earnings or revenue estimates. ... We want to remove behavioral risks that may have adverse effects on portfolio performance.IBD: Limiting downside risk plays a big role in your approach, right?De Vassal: We aim to win by avoiding negative earnings surprises and at the same time tilting more toward stocks that are more likely to have positive surprises.IBD: Basically, the difference between these two funds is that one focuses exclusively on growth stocks while Core Fund can own various types of stocks?De Vassal: In simplest terms, yes. And that means Large Cap Growth has much heavier concentration in technology stocks, for example.IBD: These funds are 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winners. What does it take to outperform so consistently?De Vassal: We have a very disciplined process. And both portfolios are well diversified. Performance isn't driven by being lucky or unlucky in one or two names. And we try to avoid losers, not just identify winners. We try to improve every year. This year we added two new stock selection factors. One is supply-chain data. The other is ESG (environomental, social and governance) momentum. We've been managing for some form of ESG strategy for over 15 years. We've found ESG momentum works better in some sectors, like consumer staples, consumer discretionary and technology, than in others.IBD: Do you see the iPhone as the key to Apple's future? Or do you see additional services like the App Store, Apple Music and Apple Pay, playing a bigger role?De Vassal: We look at fundamental metrics like return on invested capital. We look at valuation. We look at cash flow per employee. We look at sell-side analysts' earnings estimates, revenue estimates, cash flow estimates. We ask ourselves whether new products and services are causing analysts to increase their estimates. (A sell-side analyst works for an outside firm, not the fund.)We don't have a fundamental analyst kicking the tires on Apple. We look at what's happened in the past. Which (outside) analysts have been the most accurate, looking back nine quarters? Then we look at what they have to say.IBD: Avoiding emotion in your decisions is a key part of your search for growth stocks. What's an example of that?De Vassal: Growth Fund started its stake in Adobe Systems in October. The stock was attractively valued. Later that month they gave (positive) guidance and the stock shot up. We sold in November with a gain over 18%. When a stock moves, we're out because it's no longer attractive.IBD: Mastercard earnings per share growth has accelerated for three quarters. What's your view going forward?De Vassal: We bought it in June 2016. It's done well. It's a holding. We're comfortable with it. But it's not a position we would add to.IBD: You've got Visa (V) as well. Do you like it better?De Vassal: At this point, Visa looks a little more attractive. Mastercard outperformed over the past 12 months, so its valuation is up. Visa's is better. Visa is still a buy for us.IBD: IPG Photonics (IPGP) is another newcomer to Growth Fund. Do you still like it?De Vassal: We started this in August 2017. The valuation was reasonable. Cash flow yield was around 2.4%. Not that strong. But fundamentals were good. Revisions were fairly positive. Price momentum was fairly good. We think revisions are more likely to have positive surprises than negative surprises.IBD: You more than doubled your share count in TD Ameritrade (AMTD) recently. Why?De Vassal: It was September 2017 when we doubled. Its dividend yield was reasonable, and so were its profitability metrics. Analysts were raising their earnings and revenue estimates. It got good (share) price momentum. We've done well with it.IBD: Brick and mortar retailers aren't very popular these days. But you've got discounter Ross Stores (ROST). Why?De Vassal: We still consider it a buy. We've been underweight in consumer discretionary. But we're getting more neutral. Part of the reason is rebalancing the portfolio in industry groups. Looking at Ross' metrics, it's got a healthy combination of valuation, fundamentals and sell-side earnings revisions.IBD: Citrix Systems (CTXS) is in Core Fund. What's driving the speed up in its quarterly EPS growth?De Vassal: It has good profitability metrics. And we've seen more analysts covering the stock, which could lead to increased investors interest.IBD: What's driving the uptrend in CBRE Group (CBRE), which provides property management, loan servicing and origination services?De Vassal: This is one of the best ranked REITs based on our proprietary stock-ranking screens. In terms of metrics, we look at EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and we look at the consistency of its risk-adjusted growth. Analysts are raising their estimates consistently.IBD: You've trimmed your exposure to Nvidia (NVDA). Does that mean you don't like it as much anymore?De Vassal: We cap a stock's maximum weighting at 2% of Core Fund and 3% of Growth. In contrast, benchmarks are too top heavy. They have too much exposure to the top names.We initially pursued Nvidia in Core in May 2016. The stock had an attractive valuation and improving fundamentals and estimate revisions. Its share price gained a lot, and it bumped our 2% limit so we had to trim it. It has continued up. It's no longer cheap, and it's not a position we would add to.IBD: What has driven the uptrend by F5 Networks (FFIV), which makes data center computing gear?De Vassal: Its valuation isn't cheap, but it's reasonable. Its fundamentals have been strong. Its return on invested capital and cash flow per employee have been favorable vs. its peers. It's got increased coverage from sell-side analysts. So there's a stronger likelihood for positive earnings surprises than some of its peers have.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Growth Stocks In Tech And Health Care: Fund Managers Like Their OutlookSee Which Stock The Best Mutual Funds Have Been BuyingU.S. Treasuries Led Bond Funds Higher As 10-Year Yield Tumbled To 2.8%You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeFour Ways You Can Cut Spending In Retirement — With Little Lifestyle Sacrifice

Top-ranked stock Arista Networks (ANET) sold off in the stock market today.X All three major indexes — the tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials — were down about 0.3%-0.4%, looking to end five-day win streaks. On the week, the Nasdaq is on pace for an more than 5% advance.Within the Dow industrials, Coca Cola (KO) trimmed a gain to 0.7% Friday after its top- and bottom-line results exceeded analyst targets. Still, the beverage and snack giant is stuck under its 200-day moving average line — where it appears to be finding resistance — after giving up the level on Feb. 5.Elsewhere, Apple (AAPL) rose 0.9%, as it quietly traded after five days of solid gains. Shares recaptured their 50-day line Thursday amid the stock's over-10% gain this week.Among companies reporting earnings, IBD Sector Leader LogMeIn (LOGM) traded more than 7% lower amid weaker-than-expected current quarter and full-year revenue guidance. The stock is now about 3% below its 128.45 cup-with-handle entry after Wednesday's solid breakout.Deere (DE) rose 0.9% despite missing top-line estimates early Friday. Shares have rebounded back above their 50-day line and are up about 35% from a 124.94 cup-with-handle buy point. Bullishly, the stock's relative strength line continues to make new highs, indicating substantial market outperformance.Graphics-chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) continued its winning ways with a 0.8% advance, but is giving up some gains after hitting a new high. The stock reached a new high amid immense volatility after the stock's breakout above a 218.77 cup-shaped base buy point on Jan. 8. Shares are about 13% from that buy point after finding support at the 50-day line.Inside the IBD 50, Arista Networks (ANET) plunged 18% after its sales and gross margin outlook in the current quarter were weaker than expected. The No. 1-ranked IBD 50 stock's fall puts it right back at its 50-day line. Heading into the earnings release, the stock had reached the 20%-25% profit-taking level from a 245.75 cup-shaped base entry.Elsewhere, IPG Photonics (IPGP) stumbled 10%, sending it back near its 50-day line after five straight up days. The stock's breakout above a 248.33 cup-base buy point failed amid the market's recent turmoil.RELATED:Want Access To Top Dow Jones Stocks Apple, Boeing And More?S&P 500, Dow, Nasdaq Soar Despite Inflation Data; Cisco, China Internets,  Hotels Report Earnings: Weekly ReviewThese 3 Hot Stocks Plus Food Giants Lead Earnings: Investing Action PlanDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisHow To Capture A Big Gain In Leading Stocks?

31,IPGP,"With the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow industrials suffering their worst weekly losses in two years, it's not surprising that top-rated growth stocks retreated. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Apple (AAPL) supplier Qorvo (QRVO), Atlassian (TEAM), IPG Photonics (IPGP), Paylocity (PCTY) and Cypress Semiconductor (CY) all broke out recently, but in the past week or so have slipped modestly below buy points.X These stocks are worth keeping on watch lists, in case they retake their buy points, preferably with robust price gains and in strong volume. Keep in mind that the market uptrend is under pressure. Investors should be cautious about new purchases, quick to cut losses and may want to consider taking some profits in winning stocks.But with futures selling off hard once again, it's likely that many of these stock futures will come under further pressure at the open.Vertex Pharmaceuticals cleared a 167.95 buy point in late January, closing above that level on Jan. 26, but in below-average volume. Shares of the biotech dipped just below the entry. They retook the buy point on Feb. 1 with a 3.7% jump in strong volume. That followed strong earnings and Vertex choosing two cystic fibrosis treatments for late-stage testing. But the stock fell 3.9% to 166.24 in Friday's market sell-off.Vertex fell 1.1% to 164.45 in morning trade on the stock market today.Vertex's relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging. (The RS line is the blue line in the charts below.) The lagging RS line reflects the stock's sideways action during its seven-month shallow consolidation, while the S&P 500 and the broader market rallied strongly.Vertex is a member of Leaderboard, IBD's premium service offering annotated charts of a handful of stocks, mostly growth names in or near buy zones.Chipmaker Qorvo gets an estimated 34% of its revenue from Apple. That may rise further thanks to a big new contract win for the Apple iPhone announced last week.Qorvo's stock had been trending lower since early November and its RS line had fallen to a 52-week low as of late last month. But Qorvo shot up 16% on Thursday to 83.34 on the Apple iPhone wind, vaulting above an 81.30 cup-without-handle base buy point. That capped a 26% rally over five sessions.On Friday, shares retreated 3.1% to 80.77, after Apple itself plunged 4.3% on weak iPhone sales and guiding low on current-quarter revenue. Other Apple chipmakers also sold off.Qorvo shares were down 0.1% in morning trade while Apple rose modestly from a 200-day test.Qorvo's RS line is well off the highs of its recent consolidation and late May's peak, but did shoot up last week with the stock and jump above a short-term high.IBD'S TAKE: While some recent breakouts are struggling, others have weathered the recent market retreat. Facebook leads five top stocks holding in buy zones.Atlassian, which makes collaboration software for businesses, cleared a 53.55 buy point on Jan. 16, closing above that level on Jan. 17 and rising as high as 55.91 on Jan. 18, with all three sessions in strong volume. After the Jan. 18 closing bell, Atlassian gave weak earnings guidance after topping fiscal second-quarter estimates.Shares fell 4.55% to 53.07 on Jan. 19, back below the entry. Since then shares have been hovering just above below the buy point. On Friday, shares fell 1% to 52.72 in light volume.Atlassian shares fell 2.3% to 51.53 in morning trade Monday.The RS line is lagging, but not much. A strong retaking of the buy point could not only claim a short-term high but also approach the November peaks.IPG Photonics shot up 6.8% to 258.84 on Jan. 8, part of a 21% surge to start 2018 as it ran up the right side of a short cup-without-handle base. That pushed the stock to the near the top of the 5% buy zone from the 248.33 entry. The fiber laser maker's RS line almost hit a new high on a daily chart, and did hit a new high on the weekly chart.IPG's shares then moved sideways, moving slightly extended from the buy point. Then shares began pulling back on Jan. 24, but in light volume and closing within buy range through Thursday. On Friday, the stock slid 2.1% to 246.75, back below the entry, but on volume that was 51% below normal.IPG shares lost 2% Monday morning.The RS line is now lagging, as the stock has drifted lower over several weeks while the market fared better.Paylocity is a cloud-based provider of payroll and human resources software, mostly for small- to mid-sized businesses.The stock cleared a 50.62 cup-with-handle buy point on Jan. 29, but in volume that was only 17% above normal. The RS line cleared a short-term high, but was still near the bottom of its consolidation. Shares kept rising until reversing lower on Thursday. On Friday, shares slid 1.7% to 50.60 in volume that was 26% above normal.Palocity dipped 0.3% to 50.43 intraday.Paylocity is in strong field. Paycom (PAYC) has fallen back into a buy zone ahead of earnings Tuesday night. Workday (WDAY), which targets larger enterprises, is one of the five leading stocks cited in the IBD'S TAKE above that is still in a buy zone.Cypress Semi closed above a 17.52 buy point on Jan. 20, but in light volume and with a lagging RS line. Two sessions later, the stock fell back below the entry. Cypress moved back into the buy zone on Jan. 29, again in light trade, but then pulled just below the entry once again.Cypress reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and sales late Thursday and gave bullish Q1 guidance. Shares fell just 1 cent to 17.15 on Friday. But Cypress lost 3.1% Monday morning.A strong retaking of the buy point likely would push the RS line above a short-term high.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stocks Fall Broadly; Is A True Correction Near?Did You See The Big Flaws In These IBD 50 Stocks' Charts?Anatomy Of A Chart: Breaking Down The Buy And Sell Zones

38,IPGP,"Major indexes continued to stage a healthy rebound, breakouts gained more steam, and a key Bitcoin-driven ETF showed more signs that a longer-term correction in the alternative digital currency may be in the works.X Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), which staged a tremendous price run of more than 1,500% in 2017, plunged as much as 18.3% intraday before shaving a majority of those losses.Yet shares in the Bitcoin-tracking exchange-traded note still dropped more than 7% to 1,607 and severely undercut the critical 50-day moving average for the first time since peaking at 3,522 in December. Bitcoin Investment had broken out on Nov. 22 from a large, deep cup with handle at 958.10 and gained more than 250% before topping. Concerns of South Korea mulling a move to ban cryptocurrency trading are apparently still weighing on traders.At 2:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite, the leading major index in 2017 with a 28.2% gain, rose nearly 1.1%, while the S&P 500 practically matched that advance. The Dow Jones industrial average spurted 1.1% higher, helped by gains of 1 point or more in at least 12 of the 30 components.Longtime Dow Jones industrial component IBM (IBM) staged a bullish gap up as shares rose more than 2% to 168.59 in volume running double its 50-day average. The stock has also risen past a 162.61 buy point in a first-stage saucer with handle.This base is part of a long bottoming base process. The buy zone goes up to 170.74.Optimism is rising among analysts that Big Blue will finally break its multiyear slump in revenues. Q4 profit, meanwhile, is expected to inch up 3% to $5.16 a share, which would be the biggest increase in four quarters.IBM drums up a terrible Composite Rating of 42 on a scale of 1 to 99 in IBD Stock Checkup, but low Composite and other scores are typical for companies that have been lagging for years but are aiming at a real turnaround. On the positive side, a B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating points to net buying among fund managers in IBM over the past 13 weeks.Buying only those stocks that show an Accumulation Rating of C+ or higher generally increases the odds of making money when buying a stock at the proper entry point.The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 25.1% in 2017.The Dow transports edged up 0.3%; the Russell 2000 was up almost 0.6%. Volume is running mildly lower on both exchanges following a distribution day, or session of unusually intense institutional selling, on both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.Top-ranking stocks as seen in IBD's key stockpicking screens mostly thrived, with several hailing from the semiconductor and related sectors. Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment ranks first among 197 industry groups tracked by IBD with a 3.5% lift. Homebuilding, computer networking, leisure products and oil drilling stocks also led the upside with gains of 2% each.Universal Display (OLED), No. 1 in the IBD 50, moved out of buy range as shares rolled nearly 3% higher to 204 in volume running more than 25% above normal levels.The expert in organic light emitting diodes for a range of electronic devices broke out past a 192.85 entry in a six-week cup without handle on Jan. 8 and has acted well since then. The 5% buy zone goes up to 202.49.Universal Display has sported four quarters in a row of excellent top and bottom-line growth. The Ewing, N.J., firm earned 28 cents a share in the third quarter vs. a 3-cent loss a year earlier. That followed EPS increases of 41%, 450% and 115%.No wonder, then, that Universal Display gets a top-notch 99 Earnings Per Share Rating from IBD, which means that the company's profit growth over the past three to five years and in recent quarters is superior to 99% of all companies in IBD's database.The Street expects earnings in Q4 to rise 53% to 84 cents a share on a 33% jump in revenue to $99.3 million. In Q1 of this year, Universal Display is seen growing earnings 41% to 31 cents a share and revenue up 20% to $66.9 million.Universal Display is ranked No. 1 in the IBD 50 and has a relatively small float of 41 million shares out of 47 million shares outstanding. A small float is bullish for growth stock investors, as it helps constrain supply of shares, one of tenets of IBD's CAN SLIM seven-point selection system for outstanding stocks. Plus, it takes fresh demand from only a few institutional investors, including hedge funds, pensions, banks and sovereign wealth funds, amid a limited supply of shares readily available for sale, to send a stock into breakout mode and into new highs.Universal Display is now a mid-cap stock with a value of $9.6 billion. Mutual funds and hedge funds owning shares in the stock have climbed from a combined 344 funds at the end of 2016 to 416 at the end of last year.Laser maker Coherent (COHR) (breakout at 320.83), scientific instruments maker IPG Photonics (IPGP) (cleared a cup at 248.33), semiconductor lithography systems expert ASML (ASML) (186.47 buy point in a solid flat base) have also broken out and shown positive action.Lam Research (LRCX), a huge winner since 2015, is building a base. Watch to see if shares can remain above the key 50-day moving average. If it does, it would boost the chances that the wafer cleaning and etching systems supplier can continue to flesh out the right side of a potential new base.Lam had cleared a 170.10 entry in a good flat base on Sept. 11 and rallied 29% before correcting in price. One of IBD's key sell rules is to take at least partial gains when a stock breaks out and advances at least 20% to 25% from the proper entry.Going back to Bitcoin Investment Trust, IBD noted in a prior Stock Market Today column how a definitive cross below the 10-day moving average offers a good exit point for short-term traders. Bitcoin Investment Trust violated its 10-day line on Dec. 20, just two days after it posted a closing peak of 3,463.Given the climax-run-style move that it made in mid-December, following strong gains earlier in the year, it's sensible to expect that it will take weeks, if not months, for the ETF to set up another proper buy point.Bitcoin, itself, took years to digest strong gains after it broke out in October 2013 and ran up from a breakout near 120 to a peak of 1,087 just two months later, an 800% gain in just two months. It took more than three years of basing before Bitcoin eclipsed that high.(Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary on breakouts, growth stocks, and other financial markets.)RELATED:How To Trade Stocks: Do You Know This Critical Chart-Reading Skill?How To Invest With Success: The Latest In Investor's CornerStocks Near A Buy ZoneWhen To Sell Stocks: What Does A Climax Run Look Like?How To Find Excellent Growth Stocks: Start With A Simple Routine

40,IPGP,"Futures for the S&P 500 index edged higher Tuesday morning. Several highly rated stocks cleared buy points on Monday as the major averages continued to rise in every trading session of 2018: Nvidia (NVDA), Universal Display (OLED), Arista Networks (ANET), IPG Photonics (IPGP) and Entergis (ENTG).X All five stocks have Composite Ratings of 95 or better: Nvidia and Entergis have 97 Composite Ratings, Universal Display a 98 CR while Arista Networks and IPG Photonics have a best-possible 99. All-time stock winners often have a CR of at least 95 near the start of their runs.But another crucial factor is the Relative Strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. You want to see a stock's RS line lead or at least confirm a breakout. Such breakouts are more likely to succeed because they highlight the true market leaders.But this is hard to find in the current steady, strong uptrend, when even top stocks become laggards when they pause for even short, proper bases. The upshot is that about the only way in the current environment for a stock's RS line to confirm a breakout is if the breakout surges beyond the buy point and the old high.S&P 500 index futures rose a fraction vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.1%. Dow futures advanced 0.15%.IPG Photonics shot up 6.8% to 258.77, barely within range of the 248.33 buy point of a cup without handle base in volume that was 69% above normal. The fiber laser maker's RS line almost hit a new high on a daily chart, and did hit a new high on the weekly chart.Arista Networks, the other 99 Composite Rating stock, almost achieved this. The stock popped 6% to 251.03, hitting a new high in strong volume. As today's The Big Picture points out, Arista looked like a cup-with-handle base with a 241.60 entry, but was one week short of seven-week minimum. So it's classified as a cup-without-handle, with a 245.75 entry.That has implications for the RS line. Arista's RS line is now above where it was at the top of the psuedo-handle, but still has some ways to go to hit a new all-time high.Nvidia climbed  3.1% to 222 in solid volume on several CES-related autonomous driving deals, but did not blast past a 218.77 buy point. As a result, the RS line is still modestly below its old highs.Universal Display shot up 8.7% in more than double normal volume, rebounding from its 10-week moving average to 194.85, pushing it above a 192.85 entry, by about 1%. Like Nvidia, Universal Display's RS line was a little below its old high.The chip-equipment maker's stock rose 2% to 33.40, slightly past a 33.15 flat base. That wasn't enough for the RS line to confirm the move, which came on volume that was only 3% above normal.Investors should focus on breakouts with volume that's at least 40%-50% above normal.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:This Chip Leader Broke Out As 4 Other Top Techs Hover Near BuysFive 2017 Stock Winners Have Carved Bases For New RunsArtificial Intelligence Software To Grow Nearly 30 Times By 2025These 3 Electric Vehicle Plays Are LIT: Action PlanThese Top China Stocks Rocket Into 2018 With Bases And BreakoutsThe Basics: How To Analyze A Stock's Cup With Handle

42,IPGP,"Stocks closed mixed Monday as the main indexes recorded all-time highs despite lagging action in the Dow Jones industrial average.X The Nasdaq climbed 0.3% while the S&P 500 added 0.2%.The Dow Jones industrial average fell less than 0.1%, dragged down by UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Disney (DIS), General Electric (GE) and Goldman Sachs (GS), each of which fell more than 1%. GE shares met resistance at the 50-day moving average, which may worsen an already steep downtrend.The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 0.2%.Volume was lower on the NYSE and higher on the Nasdaq, according to early figures. Winners led losers by a 7-to-5 ratio on the NYSE and were even on the Nasdaq.Despite the sleepy market, more than two dozen stocks broke out past buy points in today's market. Among the most notable:Weight Watchers (WTW) leapt past the 52.17 buy point of a cup with handle in heavy volume. After a potent rally from a breakout last February, shares of the weight-loss company had been rangebound since mid-August. Monday's breakout increases the chances for a new advance.The stock surged after Sunday night's Golden Globes entertainment awards, where a speech by Oprah Winfrey got a lot of media attention and rekindled rumors she may run for president. Winfrey owns 10% of Weight Watchers.Lithia Motors (LAD) cleared a base with resistance around 123 although volume was unimpressive. The chain of auto dealers is trading near record highs, although profit growth has been lackluster, ranging from 7% to 16% the past four quarters. Sales growth ranged from 13% to 19% and has been trending higher.IPG Photonics (IPGP) surged past the 248.33 buy point of  a cup without handle in heavy trading. The relative strength line is almost at a new high, a good sign. The stock closed barely still in buy range. The maker of high-power fiber lasers has nearly perfect EPS Rating after quarterly profit gains of 50%, 53% and 64%.In the industry group table, automakers rose nearly 5%, thanks largely to a 6% surge in shares of Tesla (TSLA). The electric car maker is expected to report Q4 deliveries sometime this week.Networking, dairy products, oil drilling and auto dealers (a group that includes Lithia) were among the best performing. Trucking and rail contributed the most to the Dow transports' 0.8% rise for the day.Health care was the sector with the most lag. Biotech, generic drug, managed care and hospital industry groups were in the bottom 20 of 197 groups.RELATED:GoPro Chief Goes From $287.2 Million A Year To $1; Sale Talk SurfacesWalgreens Tops Q1 Views, CVS Health Sees Cash Flow Boost

43,IPGP,"Tesla (TSLA) helped push the Nasdaq composite into higher ground after a fantastic start to the new year last week. Meanwhile, a top Bitcoin play cut initial losses and continues to begin what may eventually become a new base pattern.XTesla scored its biggest single-session gain in months, rising 19.22, or more than 6%, to 335.80 in volume running more than 50% higher than normal. The rebound was strong enough to hoist the electric vehicle innovator back above two important technical levels: the 50- day moving average (near 317) and the still-rising long-term 200-day moving average (currently at 332).At 3:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite gained roughly 0.3% while the S&P 500 was up less than 0.2%. Last week the Nasdaq powered 3.4% higher for the week, its biggest weekly gain since a 3.8% surge during the week of the pivotal U.S. elections in November 2016.The Dow Jones industrial average inched barely higher. Volume is running virtually unchanged vs. the same time on Friday on both exchanges.The S&P SmallCap 600 kept apace, rising nearly 0.2%.Despite a strong gain for Tesla, it should not be bought now if you are following IBD's system for selecting and buying stocks 100%. The simple reason: It has yet to truly break out. The stock needs more time and work to fashion the right side of an emerging new base.Other stocks that broke out today include trucking play Forward Air (FWRD) (cup with handle showing a 58.90 buy point), sleep disorders treatment specialist ResMed (RMD) (flat base, 87.91 entry), fiber optics gear expert IPG Photonics (IPGP) (six-week cup, 248.33) and longtime Sector Leader Arista Networks (ANET) (245.75 in an odd shaped cup).Forward Air is part of the leading Transport-Truck group, which has been in the top 20 among 197 IBD industry groups for months in terms of six-month relative price performance. A strong leading stock market leader tends to be part of a top-performing industry group or sector.The Greenville, Tenn., firm has grown profits at a slow yet steady pace after a tiny dip in 2013. Earnings fell 5% in the fourth quarter of 2016, then grew 9%, 12% and 14% the next three quarters. The Street sees earnings lifting 7% to 62 cents a share for a full-year gain of 12% to $2.32 a share.2018 profit is seen rising another 13% to $2.62 a share.The Dow transportation average is leading the major indexes on Monday, rolling ahead 0.6%.Tesla has certainly grown into a big cap within the Automakers industry group. Yet with a market cap of $56 billion, it still isn't one of the largest companies on the Nasdaq. You can see the tickers of the 30-some largest companies by market value at the top of the Nasdaq chart on the large ""General Market Indicators"" page, accessible via the Market Trend section of Investors.com, or via The Big Picture.Tesla surged from its initial breakout near 40 in the first week of April 2013 as the company proved it can turn a profit. The stock galloped more than 625% to a high of 291.42 by September 2014, then jumped out of a new base on base pattern at 287.49 during the week ended April 7 last year.That breakout, essentially from a first-stage base given how long the stock took to digest its first huge advance, produced a solid return of 34.6% before Tesla peaked at 386.99 in June. Since then, the stock has been in basing mode.In September, Tesla attempted a new breakout past 370.10 in a somewhat wide and loose cup with handle. Wide and loose action is a clear flaw. You want to see controlled, relatively tight action as a stock declines significantly, bottoms out, then builds the right side of a new base.Given that in November, Tesla dropped below the low of 303.12 in the prior cup with handle, one could argue that the company is now forming a new first-stage base. Early-stage bases tend to have higher rates of success than late-stage ones.The company is forecast to loss $3 a share in the fourth quarter as it invests heavily in production capacity for the Model 3 entry level all-electric sedan and other new products.According to IBD Stock Checkup, the Palo Alto, Calif., firm gets an awful 36 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, but that mostly has to do with a tamped down EPS Rating of 22, caused by net losses in 11 of the past 12 quarters. However, the bright spot in Tesla's proprietary ratings can be found in its Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which is a positive B- on a grade scale of A (heavy institutional buying on net) to E (huge selling).The Accumulation/Distribution Rating tracks price-and-volume action over the past 13 weeks and serves as a good indicator when deciding which stocks to buy. In general, prefer those stocks with an Accumulation Grade of C+ or higher. Sometimes, a terrific winner will break out with a lowly Accumulation grade, caused by a few instances of sharp declines in steep turnover. In such situations, look closely at the daily chart of the stock; it may have bounced off the lows during a big sell-off, and that can be bullish.Also, the Stock Checkup shows the up/down volume ratio, which tracks price and volume over the past 50 sessions. If this ratio is 0.9 or higher, that can offset a poor Accumulation rating.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), a huge winner in the fourth quarter of 2017, shaved losses to 5% at 2,220 in bone-dry turnover.The ETF is still in early basing mode. As noted in a prior Stock Market Today column, the Bitcoin play will need more time to build a new base and stage a breakout in the way that it did on Nov. 22, when it hauled out of a deep cup with handle at 985.10.RELATED:IBD's The Big Picture: What The Current Rally Says About This Bull RunStock Market Today: When To Buy This Hot Bitcoin ETFDo You Know How To Spot The Next Major Market Top?

44,IPGP,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose slightly early Monday morning. Several top-rated stocks that were notable winners in 2017 are moving toward fresh buy points. Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), IPG Photonics (IPGP) and Arista Networks (ANET) are five stocks that have formed bases recently and are approaching entries.XWal-Mart Stores and UnitedHealth are both Dow industrial components, each doubling the S&P 500's performance in 2017.  The latter three all more than doubled last year. Tencent Holdings is one of a slew of top-rated Chinese stocks near buy points. Laser maker IPG Photonics is on IBD's Rising Profit Estimates list while Arista Networks is an IBD 50 member.S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures rose less than 0.1% vs. fair value. Dow futures were up 0.2%.Wal-Mart Stores has been trading in a narrow range since hitting 100.13 on Nov. 17, a day after gapping up 11% on third-quarter earnings. Shares have trended up slightly for the past four weeks, rising as high as 100.38 on Friday, just exceeding a 100.23 flat-base buy point, before settling to close at 100.13.As Wal-Mart has consolidated, the Relative Strength line has drifted lower, reflecting the S&P 500 index's modest outperformance over that time. But the RS line did rise modestly for most of last year, as booming online sales and other steps convinced investors that Wal-Mart would be a survivor in the age of Amazon (AMZN) and even pose real challenges to the e-commerce giant.Wal-Mart rose 43% in 2017 vs. the S&P 500's 19% advance.Ideally, Wal-Mart would blast past its buy point in heavy volume, pushing the RS line to confirm the breakout and signal institutional support.Tencent Holdings is a Chinese messaging and online gaming giant, operating the uber-app WeChat. Tencent is the archrival of Alibaba (BABA) and owns a stake in JD.com (JD) and several other notable Chinese companies, as well as Tesla (TSLA).Tencent shares shot up 114% last year. Not surprisingly, the RS line climbing steadily during the year, reaching a recent peak on Nov. 21, when Tencent hit a record 56.05.  Shares fell sharply to the 50-day line but found support and quickly rebounded.Tencent rose 7.6% last week, far outpacing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, closing at 55.87 and finishing a 6-week cup base.UnitedHealth has just carved out a short flat base with a 231.87 buy point. Shares rose 3.75% last week to 228.73, setting a record close on Friday.The stock's RS line gradually rose from late February to the end of November. UnitedHealth's RS line is moving closer to that old high.IPG Photonics has just completed a cup-base pattern going back the minimum six weeks, giving it a 248.33 buy point. IPG Photonics tumbled from record highs in late November and early December. Shares then began to rebound, but for the rest of 2017 held below the still-rising 50-day line. IPG retook its 50-day line on Tuesday and then kept rising, surging 13% for the week to 242.34.IPG Photonics' RS line advanced in 2017, especially from July to late November. IPG shares leapt 117%Arista Networks was a huge 2017 winners, sprinting 143%.The stock is now in a cup-with-handle base with a 241.60 buy point. Handles offer a chance to shake out weak holders before the stock blasts out of a base. But the handle largely formed as the rest of the market had big gains, pushing the RS line lower last week despite a fractional stock gain. Ideally, the RS line should confirm at least a short-term high, like a handle, on a breakout. That might be challenging for Arista, unless it advances while the market pauses.Arista Networks closed Friday at 236.77.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:These 5 Top Techs Are Near Buys — Now Study The ChartsAdobe, PayPal Lead 5 Stocks Near Buy Points With Rising Earnings EstimatesThe Top 16 China Stocks Surge, In A Fast-Moving Start To 2018Bitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing YetDepartment Stores, Malls In 2018: Amazon Will Let You Live — For Now

57,IPGP,"Many of the same exchange traded funds that performed best last year continue leading the broader market so far this year. But will that continue?XProspects on Wall Street for the new year likely depend largely on the effect of the tax overhaul and potentially higher interest rates. About three rate hikes both this year and next year are ""appropriate,"" Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester said Thursday. That's a slightly faster pace than some Fed officials prefer.Speaking of the Fed, unless Senate Democrats agree to a temporary bridge measure, a government shutdown was poised to go into effect at midnight Friday.List Of Top Performing ETFsARK Invest CEO Catherine Wood On Bitcoin, Tech StocksTop ETF Picks For 2018The U.S. tax overhaul will likely boost the U.S. economy, which is already running at full capacity, says Richard Turnill, BlackRock's Global Chief Investment Strategist. Lower taxes and capital spending incentives could lead to more consumer and business spending.""The overhaul of the U.S. tax code includes supply-side reforms and injects significant near-term demand stimulus into a U.S. economy running at near-full employment,"" he noted in a recent commentary. ""A faster-growing U.S. may accelerate global growth, and result in rising inflation, higher Treasury yields and steeper yield curves.""Overall, he sees strong earnings momentum at home as we head into 2018. He likes financial, technology and dividend-growing stocks.Let's take a look at how last year's winners are doing. Note that since we're only a few weeks into the new year, the ETFs were ranked by 2017 performance, instead of the year to date. So the year-to-date returns are more telling, for now.Last year's U.S. diversified stock winners continued to outperform the past month. The top ETF, iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor (MTUM), returned 6.3% YTD. Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY), which came in second in 2017, was close behind with a 6% gain.A pair of ARK Invest funds, ARK Innovation (ARKK) and ARK Web x.0 (ARKW) topped the sector funds category last year with gains of 87.3% each, according to Morningstar Direct. They've also continued to outperform the broader market. As of Jan. 17, ARKK and ARKW posted YTD returns of 7.2% and 6.1%, respectively, vs. the S&P 500's 4.9%.They were the first ETFs with significant exposure to Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), which made their top 10 holdings last year. The investment trust, which has suffered some steep declines this year, is no longer among the funds' biggest names. ARKK's top five include Tesla (TSLA), Stratasys (SSYS)and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO). ARKW's top 10 holdings include Amazon (AMZN), Twitter (TWTR) and Nvidia (NVDA).Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence (BOTZ), which placed sixth last year, boasts the biggest YTD return of 12.3% through Jan. 16. The $2.2 billion fund, which tracks the INDXX Global Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Thematic Index, targets companies involved with industrial robotics and automation, nonindustrial robots and autonomous vehicles.Japan accounted for over 51% of BOTZ's assets in the Greater Asia region, while North America made up 28% and Greater Europe, about 16%. BOTZ's biggest holdings were Japan's Yaskawa Electric, Fanuc and Keyence, as well as U.S. graphics chip designer and AI player Nvidia, and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), which makes the da Vinci surgical robot.Another robotics-focused ETF, Robo Global Robotics & Automation (ROBO), has returned 8.7% this year. The $2.3 billion fund has greater exposure to North America, at nearly 43%. Greater Asia represented 36% (27% from Japan) and Greater Europe made up the rest. Its top holdings include Roomba maker IRobot (IRBT), laser company IPG Photonics (IPGP), Yaskawa and Fanuc.Over in the foreign stock arena, KraneShares CSI China Internet (KWEB) saw the biggest YTD gain, 8.8%.

59,IPGP,"First Trust Technology AlphaDEX (FXL) got rich in 2017 as technology shares enjoyed sustained demand. A hot start this year for the sector has investors hoping for more.X The exchange traded fund surged nearly 36% last year, a fairly typical return for a domestic tech-based ETF. Shares climbed for 11 straight weeks last autumn, an unusual run that reflected the superb strength in chips and other tech stocks.In the first week of this year, the ETF topped a 63.72 buy point from a flat base and remains in buy range. But can the ETF stretch its gains? Its five-week consolidation sets the stage for a possible new advance. Of course, the longer a stock or ETF rallies, the lower the chance that gains will be prolific.The sector's outlook remains positive, which gives the fund some potential fuel.

""One factor driving the increase is the unusually high number of companies in this sector issuing positive revenue guidance."" Overall, 27 tech companies have issued positive revenue guidance for Q4, well above the five-year average of 16 for the sector.First Trust Technology AlphaDEX is mainly concentrated in semiconductors (about 28% of the portfolio) and software (24%). Nearly 80 stocks are in the fund, with a median market cap of $15.6 billion as of year-end. The portfolio's price-to-earnings ratio is nearly 24, reflecting the rich valuations in the sector.The ETF tracks the StrataQuant Technology Index, which uses a lot of number crunching to ranks stocks in the Russell 1000 on growth factors such as price appreciation over various periods, sales growth, cash flow to price and other data. Weightings of each stock range from 0.4% to 2.75%.Some of the ETF's top performing stocks are the same brands that helped make 2017 a huge year for the tech sector.IPG Photonics (IPGP), the maker of medical and industrial lasers, more than doubled from a breakout in April at 124.37.

64,IPGP,"Wall Street saw some rotation out of outperforming technology stocks and some money going into other sectors, particularly finance and banking. Transportation and select retail stocks also gained ground.XThe Dow Jones industrial average paced the upside among major indexes, up around 0.4% as nine of the 30 Dow Jones industrial components rallied 1 point or more. American Express (AXP), Goldman Sachs (GS), Home Depot (HD) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) led the Dow's upside amid a gentle uptick in long-term interest rates.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond moved up to 2.38%, a two-week high.The broad-based advance offset a 4.51-point drop by fellow Dow 30 stock Apple (AAPL).The iPhone, iPad and digital services giant is still up from a breakout at 160.97 in a cup-with-handle base. The stock is now back in buy range, but it's preferable to see if Apple can dust itself off after Wednesday's steep fall and rally before considering a new buy.At 3:45 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 was off less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite fell 1.4% but remains close to its all-time high of 6914.Among the leading industry groups, department store chain, auto parts retailing, airline transport, hospital, home furnishings and medical services stocks all rallied hard, up 2% or more. (See the day-to-day performance of all 197 industry groups tracked by IBD by going to Data Tables in ""Stock Lists"" at Investors.com.)The Bitcoin-tracking Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) ETF suffered a negative reversal, rising to as high as 1,823.99 before sliding nearly 4% to 1,414. Volume is running nearly quadruple the normal pace.Despite the drop, Bitcoin Investment Trust is still sharply extended from last week's breakout past a 985.10 buy point in an unusually deep cup with handle.Meanwhile, a bunch of names in the IBD 50, which through Tuesday's close was up more than 39% since Jan. 1 vs. a 17.3% lift for the S&P 500, sold off hard. Many of  the 50 top-rated companies saw losses of 5% or more, including YY Inc. (YY), IPG Photonics (IPGP) and Ichor (ICHR). Yet among these three, only IPG Photonics has issued an IBD-style sell signal.IPG lost as much as 8.7% to a session low of 220.47 before shaving some of those losses. Watch to see how the industrial laser maker closes; the biggest single-session point loss in heavy turnover since the breakout is one key defense-type sell signal.However, as seen in a daily chart, the midcap still holds a decent air pocket above the rising 50-day moving average. So holders with large gains can of course lock in some profits, but they can also see if the stock generates a new high-quality base, which could potentially set up a new breakout.While IPG is showing the type of action that may signal a change in character and good reason to lighten one's exposure, it's still unclear whether the general rally in tech stocks is done or simply taking a well-needed pause.The chip sector certainly got pounded on Wednesday. The Philadelphia semiconductor index at one point fell more than 4%. Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX), both part of the IBD Big Cap 20, got pummeled as well.As seen in their daily charts, both of these large-cap leaders in semiconductor equipment have now undercut their respective 50-day moving averages. That alone is not a sell signal, however, as great stocks can recover and eventually move back above the key medium-term support line.In these situations, it's good to examine the weekly action and watch how a leading stock ends on Friday. If stocks such as Applied and Lam can bounce off their weekly lows and finish high in the range, it's a telltale clue that institutional appetite for growth stocks is still healthy.The 50-day moving average for Lam is currently near 197.85; the 50-day line is painted in red on an IBD daily chart. The 10-week moving average, found only on a weekly chart, is also painted in red.Another reason to keep holding tech stocks: Earnings are strong and revenue is likely to keep increasing in the current quarter. Plus, some observers are noting stable economic growth in the EU despite controversy over Brexit and problems for Germany to create a new coalition government. In the U.S., GDP growth is accelerating.A third reason: IBD's current outlook for the market, for now, remains ""Confirmed uptrend."" In recent days, the distribution-day count on the Nasdaq has declined, meaning that pronounced institutional selling has abated.Wednesday's sell-off, however, is a sign of heavy profit-taking amid concern over the fate of the tax-reform package proposed by Congress, which could get a final vote in the Senate later this week. Also, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book, released in the afternoon, pointed out that ""price pressures have strengthened."" This could give the U.S. central bank more conviction to raise the cost of money sooner than later.A quarter-point hike in the fed funds rate to a target range of 1.25%-1.5% is all but assured when the Fed meets on Dec. 12-13.RELATED:Broad Sell-Off Hits Tech, Investors Rotate To Banks, Value StocksBitcoin Crashes Below $10,000 After Spike Above $11,000Do You Know How To Employ This Key Defense-Type Sell Signal?Can You Spot Major Market Tops?

One reason tech leaders — including FANG stocks Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) — are getting hit is that fund managers are raising cash to buy financials, says BMO Capital Markets.From a macroeconomic perspective, JPMorgan says that higher bond yields are another factor in a market rotation out of growth stocks such as technology and into financials.There's also the nitty-gritty of tax reform. The Senate's version, passed late Friday, would cut the U.S. corporate rate from 35% to 20%; limit interest deductibility to 30% of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization); and lower the tax on repatriated overseas cash to 14% from the current full 35%.It also will allow the immediate expensing of capital spending over the next five years, which was helping telecom and cable companies on Monday. Comcast (CMCSA) surged 4.9% to close at 40.32, AT&T (T) was up 2.1% to finish at 37.27, and Verizon Communications (VZ) gained 0.9% to end the day at 51.72.The trouble for tech companies, though, is that they hold the most cash overseas, and the Senate's proposed 14% tax rate on such earnings is higher than expected. President Trump had proposed a one-time tax of 10% on offshore earnings, while the House has proposed an 8.5% rate.Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL) are among companies with the most overseas cash.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.While tech companies may bring back some cash if Congress passes tax reform, the legislation disallows some accounting measures by multinational companies. Another concern for tech companies is what happens with the research-and-development tax credits many companies use.Many biotech, pharma and manufacturing companies benefit from a research-and-development credit under which firms recoup some of the costs for spending on innovation, according to the Wall Street Journal. This is often for the wages of scientists and engineers.The GOP tax plan could hurt the R&D tax credit in lieu of retaining the corporate alternative minimum tax, a provision that was initially expected to go by the wayside in the plan. Companies worked over the weekend to change congressional opinion on the tax ahead of the late-hour Senate vote.Amazon was down 2.4% to close at 1,133.95 on the stock market today, Netflix fell 1.5% to finish at 184.04, Facebook slid 2.1 to end at 171.47, and Google dropped 1.3% to 1,011.87. Apple was up a fraction to 169.80.Among stocks in the IBD 50, IPG Photonics (IPGP) plunged by more than 10% to 200.80, Cognex (CGNX) dropped 8.6% to 63.31, and PayPal (PYPL) fell 8.6% to 70.97. Adobe Systems (ADBE) stumbled by 6.2% to finish at 168.44, Nvidia (NVDA) fell 5.6% to close at 186.66, and Alibaba Holdings (BABA) lost 2.9% to 169.58.The Nasdaq dropped 1.1% to close at 6,775.37.RELATED:Bitcoin Futures Trading To Start Even Sooner; These Brokers Are ReadyBank Stocks Rise As Senators Add These Last-Minute Perks To Tax BillThese 3 Dow Stocks Have Entered Buy ZonesHow The Senate And House Tax Bills Would Affect You

77,IPGP,"JPMorgan Mid Cap Growth Fund (HLGEX) has heated up this year thanks to leading-stock holdings like electronic parts maker Amphenol (APH), electronic payments processor Global Payments (GPN) and hotels-resorts-timeshares operator Hilton Worldwide (HLT). Their gains year to date range from 22% for Amphenol to 36% for Global.XAnd to help keep the good times rolling, the $3.2 billion fund is betting on top new buys as of its latest disclosure such as IPG Photonics (IPGP), a maker of fiber-optic lasers for industrial and medical applications; Linux operating system distributor Red Hat (RHT); and semiconductor test-equipment maker Teradyne (TER).Year-to-date gains by those newcomers ranged from 45% by Teradyne to 87% for IPG. On Tuesday, Red Hat gapped up 4% the day after reporting a 40% jump in adjusted fiscal second-quarter earnings per share, which topped analysts' expectations. It also raised its guidance for revenue and profit for the full year.The company's software runs computer servers in corporate data centers. Red Hat's cloud-computing revenue is mainly from customers using software-as-a-service.IBD'S TAKE: Red Hat is the No. 1 ranked stock in IBD's Computer Software-Desktop industry group.

That's one of several premium IBD features you can take for a test drive for free through Oct. 8. Other popular premium offerings include exclusive stock lists and The Big Picture, a daily update of what's driving the market.For the fund, all of that good news translated into a 21.64% gain this year going into Thursday. That outperformed 87% of the fund's midcap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Direct and easily topped the S&P 500's 13.66% return.The fund produced a three-year average annual gain of 9.13% vs. the big-cap bogey's 10.43% pace and the fund peer group's 8.59%.One reason the three-year tempo lags year-to-date gain is the three-year average includes the fund's paltry 2016 gain of 0.19%, which lagged 91% of its direct rivals.That makes this year, so far, the poster child for the fund's approach, which aims for capital growth through midcap- stocks with above-average growth. As the fund's latest fact sheet puts it, the fund's managers seek companies that are industry leaders, with business models that hold up in a variety of markets and whose executives know how to steer their charges to outsized growth.Timothy Parton just notched his 13th anniversary at the helm of the fund. Felise Agranoff has been a manager for about a year and nine months.Take a closer look at some of the fund's leading stocks. Portfolio newcomer Teradyne has IBD's next-to-highest-possible Composite Rating of 98. Scored on a scale of 1 to 99, stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.The maker of automated test equipment for the chip industry also has an A SMR Rating, which means it is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.The chip-testing systems firm serves the automobile, computing and game markets.In addition, Teradyne is in IBD's 85-85 index. The index tracks stocks whose EPS and Relative Strength Ratings are 85 or greater, and whose prices are above $15, are within 15% of their 52-week high and whose average daily trading volume is 10,000 shares or more.In July, the company's second-quarter report showed earnings per share up 64%. The 31% jump in revenue was the biggest jump in at least 19 quarters. Teradyne said results in the first half of the year were driven by strength in mobility, automotive, analog, microcontroller and memory end markets.Bright Horizons (BFAM) is another top new buy. Earnings per share growth has accelerated, having climbed 14%, 19%, 20% and 21% the past four quarters. The firm provides child care, early education and other services.It sports a 95 Comp Rating and an A SMR Rating.The rise in Q2 revenue and EPS growth was driven by both new full-service child-care centers and improved results from existing ones, the company said. Price increases averaged 3% to 4%. In addition, sales of backup dependent care and educational advisory services expanded.Fortive (FTV), a newcomer to the portfolio, makes equipment for testing and measurement, many for field instruments. EPS rose 13% and 11% the past two quarters, up from 1% the prior stanza.A spinoff from Danaher (DHR), Fortive was held by 1,388 mutual funds as of June 30. That was up from 1,305 funds as of Sept. 30, 2016. Funds' collective stakes rose to 148.3 million shares, up from 135.1 million shares.RELATED:Looking For Winning Stocks?

85,IPGP,"Stocks continue to catch their breath on Monday after posting big gains last week, but Apple (AAPL) made a statement in the stock market today — that the institutional crowd is not yet ready to cash in their large year-to-date gains.X While the Dow Jones industrial average inched barely higher and the Nasdaq composite was fractionally lower with less than half an hour to go, Apple rose more than 0.3% to 149.55, climbing back above the 50-day moving average for the first time since a two-day, 5.3% slide on June 9-12. Shares on Monday got as high as 150.90.The seventh up day in a row for the iPhone and iPad maker suggests that Apple is not only trying to keep its uptrend intact but also may try to form a genuine new base.Apple (72 EPS Rating, 84 RS in Stock Checkup) initially cleared a 118.12 proper entry in a cup-with-handle pattern on Jan. 6-9 and rallied more than 32% before cooling off. The company is into its third quarter of rebounding from a three-quarter slump in both the top and bottom lines.IBD's TAKE: A savvy investor can get an edge in finding new entry points in turnaround stocks and strong companies at the end of a severe market correction by looking for the bottoming base pattern. Check out the one that Apple formed in the spring of 2009 before going on its big stretch run of gains.An aggressive shareholder could opt to buy shares of Apple if it can continue to rally back above the 50- or 10-week moving average with authority, preferably in rising volume. (The 50-day average turnover of Apple is 28.1 million shares.) A more clear-cut entry would be if the stock breaks out to new highs.The S&P 500 was virtually flat, as gains in steel, metal ores, retail, gold and generic drug firms offset declines in the automaker, airfreight, specialty retail, logistics, railroad and movie fields of the market. The Russell 2000 outperformed, up 0.3%.Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, notes that low inflation, a U.S. monetary policy that ""should remain equity-market friendly,"" and a global monetary policy that is beginning to normalize all pose as positive factors for equities in the second half of 2017.""We think these trends can continue, but also believe investment selectivity is growing more important,"" Doll wrote in a weekly investment commentary.Indeed, the IBD Mutual Fund index, which tracks some of the best active fund managers on Wall Street, is up 15.8% since Jan. 1, pounding the S&P 500's 9.8% gain so far. See the index and its components by going to the latest IBD Big Picture and clicking on the General Market Indicators page via a link at the bottom of the daily article.Apple is slated to report fiscal Q3 results on Aug. 1 after the close. The Street sees sales rising 6% to $44.92 billion, which would mark the biggest year-over-year increase in seven quarters. Earnings are expected to lift 11% to $1.57 a share.Apple is part of IBD's Telecom sector. As seen in IBD Weekly, Electronics, Chips, Leisure and Building dominate the 33 sector rankings within IBD's stock research tables for mid- to long-term performance. A strong sector helps a high-quality stock succeed in its breakouts.D.R. Horton (DHI) (breakout from a long saucer with handle at 34.64), Home Depot (HD) (saucer-with-handle breakout at 137.42), Nvidia (NVDA) and IPG Photonics (IPGP) are just some of the stocks from these four sectors that are showing unusual strength lately.Nvidia, the top chip-technology player in the video gaming markets, is No. 5 in the IBD 50 and has made big strides in the fields of deep learning, artificial intelligence, data center and self-driving cars. The big-cap tech is now extended after surging off its 10-week moving average near 140 three weeks ago. The stock is also up 35% after bolting out of a 13-week base in heavy turnover in the week ended May 12.Among top-performing new issues, Ichor (ICHR) worked on a fourth straight up day, rising nearly 3% to 22.27. While volume is running sharply below average, the semiconductor equipment firm hoisted itself back above the key 50-day moving average. A new base may be forming, with the correction in the base currently at 35% from head to toe.That 35% correction is typically the maximum amount of decline you'd like to see in a cup-with-handle or double-bottom base, two of the seven principal chart patterns that the biggest stock market winners produce before breaking out to new highs and unleashing strong price runs.Ichor broke the $100 million-revenue barrier on a quarterly basis during the third quarter of 2016, when sales jumped 40% to $105.7 million. Since then, revenue leapt 104% and 103% in the next two quarters while earnings made triple- to quadruple-digit increases.The Street sees Q2 profit exploding 329% higher to 60 cents a share, boosted in part by a 7% decline in the year-ago quarter.RELATED:How Much Will Q2 Earnings Rise For The Top Growth Firms?How To Learn Top Buy And Sell Rules For Growth InvestingThe Latest Names In Stock SpotlightSelling Stocks Like A Pro: What Is A True Cut Of The 50-Day Moving Average?

89,IPGP,"The major indexes rebounded off early-morning lows despite a bullish report in smaller jobless claims last week, yet stocks still traded moderately in the red Thursday. Given the market's strong gains in recent weeks, it would not be a surprise to see the averages finish lower for the week.However, the market continues to show elements of strength as well. The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 major averages are all still well above their rising 50-day moving averages. Watch to see if the Dow Jones industrial average can hold above its 50-day line.The Dow Jones industrial average at 1 p.m. ET shaved its loss further down to just 0.2%. The 30-member blue chip index hit as low as 20,798, just 11 points above its 50-day line.The Nasdaq composite whittled its initial large decline of nearly 0.9% to less than 0.5% while the S&P 500 was off 0.4%. The NYSE composite, down 0.5%, is also facing a fresh test of support at the 50-day moving average. Snap (SNAP), meanwhile, suffered its worst single-day decline since going public March 2 at 17 a share. The stock dropped more than 18% to 18.76 and skidded to as low as 17.59. The stock would now need to rally more than 56% just to match its all-time high of 29.44.The 18% drop represented a $5.4 billion hair cut in market value for Snap, which has 1.157 billion shares outstanding, including Class A, B and C shares.Investors were clearly disappointed by the much bigger than expected net loss of $2.31 a share for the Snapchat social networking site operator, vs. a net loss of 14 cents in the year-ago quarter. Research and development costs ballooned to $805.8 million vs. $28.1 million. A lot of that likely had to do with high stock-based compensation expense, which totaled almost $2 billion for the quarter.Another concern: Snap showed a $155 million drop in operating cash flow. But the company does have $1.43 billion in cash and $1.82 billion in marketable securities, which usually tend to be highly liquid bonds. Elsewhere in the market, Essent Group (ESNT) continued its rebound, rising nearly 2% to 37.30 in light trade. The mortgage insurance firm retook a 36.91 buy point in a shallow double-bottom base.Coherent (COHR), a specialist in industrial-use lasers, also defied the market's decline, rising more than 1.4% to 254.37 in heavy turnover.Other top-rated growth stocks to keep watching for potential entry points include IPG Photonics (IPGP) and Grubhub (GRUB), formerly on IBD Sector Leaders. Grubhub, which enables restaurants to attract more customers by being on the company's popular food service app, edged slightly up to 45.03, extended 6% past a 42.35 buy point in a long double-bottom base.Grubhub, currently No. 26 in the IBD 50, was featured as early as mid-January in IBD's Sector Leaders column, which noted that the software firm's 22% decline from head to toe in a new base was well within the appropriate range for a good cup base or double bottom.IPG gained nearly 1% to 136.73 and volume is running slightly ahead of its normal pace. The stock, which gapped up sharply on May 2 on a strong Q1 report (adjusted earnings up 50%, revenue up 38%), is for now well extended past a 124.37 flat-base entry.Meanwhile, certain retailing stocks got pummeled, reaffirming the problems that some brick and mortar store chains continue to have amid big gains in e-commerce.Macy's (M), which had joined the Leaderboard Short Sales list on March 6 when it crossed back below its 50-day moving average near 31.72, got slammed on Thursday with a 14% drop to 24.99. Volume has already shot well beyond 29 million shares vs. its 50-day average of 5.7 million. The department store chain, which already has plans to close 100 locations, reported a 40% drop in earnings to 24 cents a share, missing views by 31%, as revenue dipped 8% to $5.34 billion.That marked the ninth straight quarter of falling revenue.Luxury furnishings firm RH (RH) and Nordstrom (JWN) also fell hard in the stock market today, losing 8% and 7%, respectively. Unlike Macy's, however, both stocks continue to tread on the north side of their 50-day moving averages.RH, formerly known as Restoration Hardware, has generally been acting well since it cleared a first-stage deep bottoming base pattern with a 39.38 buy point on March 29 in triple average turnover.RELATED:Where Is The Market Headed?

Volume also was well above average the previous two days, as institutional investors pile up shares of the social media company ahead of its earnings report Wednesday after the close.The S&P 500 fell 0.1%. The Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.1% increase. Gains of more than 1% in Visa (V) and Intel (INTC) helped the industrials in today's trading.

Taiwan Semi remains a group leader, with one of the highest Composite Ratings in the industry.IPG Photonics (IPGP) soared to a new high after the company beat profit estimates. Shares gapped up to a gain of more than 8% in big volume and are now extended from a breakout on April 24. IPG Photonics reported first-quarter earnings of $1.38 a share, up 50%. Sales increased 38% to $285.9 million. It forecast Q2 revenue of $320 million to $340 million and EPS of $1.50 to $1.70, both well above analysts' estimates.The agricultural chemicals industry group came under fire, with a few stocks in that group falling in heavy volume after disappointing earnings reports.Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG) gapped down to a loss of 5% after the company's Q1 adjusted earnings of $2.78 a share missed Wall Street estimates. Scotts also announced that it agreed to sell its European and Australian consumer operations to Exponent Private Equity in a deal valued at about $250 million. The stock is now dwelling in the lower half of a saucer-type base with a 98.91 buy point.Mosaic (MOS) gapped down and lost nearly 8%, to the lowest level since November. The fertilizer company reported Q1 earnings excluding items of 4 cents a share, down 71% and below expectations. Sales of $1.58 billion were 6% lower than in the year-ago period.That drop extended a streak of year-over-year declines in the top line to seven quarters.Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) plunged more than 8%, sinking to the lows of its current pattern in big volume. The company, which is in IBD's food grains industry group, reported adjusted earnings of 60 cents a share and sales of nearly $15 billion, an increase of 4%.RELATED:Trump Infrastructure Play Soars As Earnings Top On Price HikesWhich Commodities Will Rise This Year?

93,IPGP,"The stock market held strong gains Monday afternoon as the technology sector stood out with several breakouts.The Nasdaq composite, the most weighted with tech stocks among the major indexes, was up 1.2% while the S&P 500 gained 1%.The Dow Jones industrial average also rose 1%. Dow component Home Depot (HD) cleared resistance around 150 and is rising from support at the 50-day moving average. Home improvement rival Lowe's (LOW) topped an 84.10 entry, but the stock dipped below it and volume was light.The small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 1.4%. Although U.S. stocks gains were solid, they didn't match the fervor of European indexes. The London FTSE 100 rallied 2.1%, the German DAX 3.4% and the Paris CAC 40 4.1% as investors applauded the French election results, which left a pro-EU candidate in good shape to win the presidency. The iShares MSCI Eurozone (EZY) ETF jumped 4.7% to the highest level since August 2015.On the main exchanges, volume was tracking higher on the Nasdaq and lower on the NYSE.  Winners led losers by 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq and better than 13-to-5 on the NYSE.Banking, travel and some cyclical industry groups led the market. Regional banks, whose shine had been fading for weeks, were among the better-performing stocks in today's market. Western Alliance (WAL), Zions Bancorp (ZION) and Citizens Financial Group (CFG) were up in heavy trading and back to the 50-day line or getting closer to it as they rebound.But it was the technology sector that stood out in terms of chart action, as several names broke out past buy points.Dell Technologies (DVMT) leapt past the 65.88 buy point in more than double its usual volume as shares rose 2.5% to 66.02. The computer hardware company is a member of Leaderboard.IPG Photonics (IPGP) moved above the 124.37 buy point of a flat base. Shares jumped 3.5% to 124.78. Volume was merely average, which invites suspicions about the otherwise bullish move. Earnings for the maker of specialized lasers are due May 2 before the open.A pair of IBD 50 stocks also broke out.Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) rose past the 52.32 buy point of a cup-with-handle base in heavy trading. Shares soared 4% to 53.78. The maker of semiconductor technologies for optical, wireless and satellite networks tried to breakout out initially last week, but got turned back. Earnings are due Tuesday after the close.Synopsys (SNPS) broke out past the 73.18 buy point of a flat base. Shares rose 1% to 73.63.

101,IPGP,"Fiber-optic laser maker IPG Photonics (IPGP) jumped to a record high Wednesday after the company late Tuesday posted Q4 earnings and gave Q1 guidance that beat analyst expectations, with the company citing strong growth in China, Europe, Russia and Japan.IPG stock was up 4% to end regular trading at 121.75 on the stock market today, peaking earlier at 124.27. Shares are now past the 20%-gain level where investors should have locked in at least some profit from the stock's Dec. 8 breakout from a cup-with-handle base at a buy point of 99.08.The Oxford, Mass.-based company, which also has strong roots in Russia and Germany, in its earnings release said its book-to-bill ratio, which measures new orders booked to old orders billed, was more than 1, indicating growth.The company has preannounced its expectations of a Q4 beat. Late Tuesday, it said earnings per share rose 22% from the year-earlier quarter to $1.39, with sales up 25% to $280.1 million, both metrics ahead of Wall Street estimates. Last year marked its first year with more than $1 billion in revenue.IBD'S TAKE: IPG Photonics is not the only stock hitting a new high Wednesday. For the good look at topping stocks ranked by Composite Rating, investors can keep tabs of IBD's New Highs list.For Q1, the top maker of fiber lasers expects EPS of $1.10 to $1.25 on sales of $245 million to $260 million, the EPS midpoint in line with estimates and sales ahead of views.Needham & Co. analyst James Ricchiuti called the Q4 report ""stellar"" in a research note in which he hiked his price target on IPG stock to 130 from 120, maintaining his buy rating. Benchmark hiked its PT to 125 from 116, while Dougherty & Co. boosted its rating to buy from neutral.IPG says fiber lasers continue to gain market share vs. other lasers such as crystal, solid-state and gas; use less energy; require very little service and are easy to use. They are used in a wide range of industrial applications for cutting, welding and more.In his research report, Ricchiuti said Asia Pacific and China led the way in Q4.""Asia Pacific (53% of Q4 revs) increased 32% (year over year) to $147.9M,"" he wrote. ""Sales in China rose 43% to $98M, reflecting strong demand in automotive and for cutting applications from nearly all of IPGP's major (original equipment manufacturers).""RELATED:Why The Needham Aggressive Growth Fund Likes IPG

102,IPGP,"Stock funds seemed only slightly less frenetic than President Trump setting policy in his first 100 days, as the average domestic stock fund rose 1.83% in January, padding gains of 1.46% in December and 10.81% in 2016.World equity funds did even better in January, advancing 3.86%, according to Lipper Inc.Taxable bond funds rose 0.76%, while municipal bond funds rose 0.46%.The S&P 500 rose 1.90% last month.Not all of the young year's gains are attributable to the new president and new Congress, say stock fund managers and strategists.""Regardless of who was elected, the economy was already improving,"" said Kimberly Scott, lead manager of $2.4 billion Ivy Mid Cap Growth (WMGAX) and co-manager of $288 million Ivy Mid Cap Income Opportunities (IVOAX) funds. ""The trajectory of corporate profits had already turned up. The outlook for corporate profits for the end of 2017 into 2018 was already quite strong. The policy changes concerning taxes, repatriation of overseas corporate cash (and) unwinding some onerous regulations that President Trump talked about could boost corporate profits more. But the economy was already getting stronger.""And mutual fund professionals expect the uptrend to continue this year.""The market could go in two very different ways,"" said Omar Aguilar, Charles Schwab Investment Management's chief investment officer of equities. ""On the one hand, there is a very powerful combination of factors that could translate into record levels for equities.""On the other hand, the market could go south. ""The attempt at reforms (of taxes, corporate cash repatriation and regulatory burdens) could increase the federal budget deficit,"" Aguilar said. ""There is a potential for trade wars. Emerging markets are still landing. A strong U.S. currency could hurt exports. Those headwinds could backfire into our economy and markets.""On balance, Aguilar is guardedly bullish. ""On a net basis we will see the market trend up,"" he said. ""But it will be volatile.""Scott is favoring stocks in sectors that typically benefit at the outset of a rally. ""Many think we're in the midcycle of a recovery,"" she said. ""But we had a significant corporate-profits recession. So to me this feels like an early-stage economic recovery, and that's when you want to shift more asset weight into technology, financials, energy and industry.""Consumer discretionary is usually part of that early-stage recovery party. But this time brick-and-mortar retailers are battling digital retailers. Brick-and-mortar retailers are being forced to spend on their own websites and low-cost delivery services, Scott says, which will continue to sap their earnings.Large-cap growth mutual funds' 4.10% gain on average in January led all U.S. diversified stock fund categories.Yet investors were still jittery enough at times to drive precious-metals funds, a defensive category, up 14.94% last month, higher than any other sector. That beat basic-materials funds, which gained 7.31%.Latin American funds paced foreign stock fund categories by tacking on 7.67%.Taxable bonds were led by flexible-income funds 1.61% gain. Treasury funds inched up 0.36%.Trailing precious metals and several other sector fund categories, tech funds notched a 5.13% January gain. IPG Photonics (IPGP) is a technology name that John Barr, manager of $60 million Needham Aggressive Growth (NEAGX) — whose 9.32% average annual gain over the past 10 years topped 96% of its small-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. — likes in a market poised to continue higher but with volatility. The company makes fiber-optic lasers, which can be used for cutting and welding in industrial applications. As costs fall, laser systems become increasingly attractive, especially in welding, Barr says. ""Big automotive makers are quite interested in using this for welding,"" he said.Revenue grew 19% and 17% in the two most recent years. Earnings grew an average of 18% annually from 2014 to 2016. ""It has a long runway ahead, with great returns and great management,"" Barr said.PDF Solutions (PDFS) is another tech name Barr likes. The firm produces software that's the core of electrical testing of newly made semiconductors. It has the potential for taking share from more conventional optical testing systems, Barr says.Two major chipmakers signed on as customers in 2016. PDF's service is delivered on a subscription basis. ""So it has high margins and could double company earnings"" in the near term, Barr said, especially if it wins customers in China as the Middle Kingdom builds out its own semiconductor manufacturing industry between now and 2020.Ivy's Scott likes MercadoLibre (MELI), an Argentina-based online retailer that offers an electronic payment service. ""It's still in an earlier phase of development than Amazon (AMZN) is here,"" said Scott. ""There is no reason to think that demand for online buying and payment will not be as attractive to Latin Americans as it is in the U.S. and Asia.""Video-game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) is another of Scott's favorites. The video-game publisher benefits from a console-upgrade cycle and the shift to digital game downloads, which carry higher profit margins, as IBD has reported. Scott says now, ""I continue to like the tremendous changes in the products and innovation there. They make games that consumers love. And the way that these products are developed and distributed digitally is such a profit enhancer. We think that story continues.""Among financial services stocks, Scott likes regional banks such as First Republic (FRC) and Signature Bank (SBNY), which should benefit from rising rates and from a reduction in their regulatory burden. Trump targeted the Dodd-Frank Act for review on Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Midsize regional banks have gotten a boost from congressional moves to raise the threshold of the Dodd-Frank Act's systemic risk designation. The existing rule applies to banks with at least $50 billion in assets, subjecting them to costly regulations. As IBD recently reported, Congress is looking at raising that to $250 billion.Scott also likes MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), an electronic bond-trading exchange that claims cheaper transaction costs than traditional investment-bank bond trades, easier odd-lot trading and specialization in corporate credit. ""There are others trying to do this, but none has gained the traction that MarketAxess has,"" she said.Amid the rally in energy stocks, Stephen DeNichilo, co-manager of $2.9 billion Federated Kaufmann Large Cap (KLCAX), likes small-cap Independence Contract Drilling (ICD). The company offers customers of energy exploration and production very sophisticated drilling rigs. ""They're on the leading edge of what E&P companies want,"" DeNichilo said. ""They have only 12 working rigs, so essentially they are fully utilized. They have leverage to the U.S. shale-pad drilling rally. They have a clean balance sheet. They are trading below their $10-a-share replacement value. And they could be a takeout candidate.""In addition to trading below 10, earnings per share growth has declined at triple-digit paces the past four quarters.Among industrials, DeNichilo likes Dycom Industries (DY). ""We like long-term investment themes,"" DeNichilo said. ""Dycom is the largest specialty contractor for fiber-(optic cable). They're the only national specialty contractor that puts fiber into the ground at a time when AT&T (T), CenturyLink (CTL), Charter (CHTR), Verizon (VZ) and other (telecoms) are about to ramp up.""That cycle will be sparked, DeNichilo says, by AT&T embarking on a massive plan to lay fiber so the telecom giant can offer customers high-speed internet service. ""Their plan is to bring 1-gigabit speed to (at least) 12 million customers by 2019,"" DeNichilo said. The industry has seen that when dramatically higher speeds are offered at the same or comparable cost, customers switch providers. ""Competitors will have to follow,"" he said. ""This will be a big cycle for Dycom. Also, fiber investments could be part of any large infrastructure (upgrade) plan by the government.""At the average U.S. broadband speed of about 18 megabits, downloading a two-hour movie takes more than 10 minutes. It takes eight seconds via 1-Gig fiber, according to fastmetrics.com. And AT&T's speed upgrade can be achieved solely through street-side fiber, and will not require any in-home rewiring or cable replacement, DeNichilo says.Dycom's earnings grew an average of 74% annually over the past three years. ""Despite earnings growth way above the market, they are trading below the market multiple,"" DeNichilo said.DeNichilo also likes Martin Marietta Materials (MLM). As the U.S. economy heats up, demand for construction aggregates will grow. ""Even without Trump's Mexican wall, nonresidential construction — which is the bulk of aggregate consumption — is still below its 55-year normal level,"" he said. ""This company has essentially doubled earnings per share over the past three years, so its outlook is fantastic whether there is a (federal government) infrastructure plan or not.""Ivy's Scott likes water-heater-maker A.O. Smith (AOS). ""There isn't a lot of cyclicality in their business,"" Scott said. ""Homeowners have to replace their heaters every 10 to 12 years. And they have a growing business in China for water heaters and water-purification systems. It's a nice growth engine for Smith.""Smith's average annual earnings growth rate was 24% from 2014 through 2016. ""They're a consistent grower and reliable payer of dividends,"" Scott added. The company's dividend yield is 1.1%. ""We're not a dividend fund, but it's nice to have on top of everything.""RELATED: Where Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 20172017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewClick Here To See A List Of New Buys Of Top Mutual FundsClick Here To See A List Of Latest Sells Of Top Mutual Funds

447,IPGP,"International stocks, in the broadest sense, are sometimes based in the U.S.But some U.S.-based companies get most of their revenue outside the country.Let's look at three IBD 50 stocks and one blue chip that fit that description.IPG Photonics (IPGP) makes fiber lasers for industrial uses. The company is based in Massachusetts, but last year about 82% of revenue came from outside North America.Annual earnings grew 842% in 2010 and 113% in 2011. Revenue jumped 61% and 59%, respectively, in those periods.IPG made several acquisitions in 2010-11, but they weren't the growth drivers. The drivers were new products and a growing market acceptance of fiber lasers, along with a rebound from a depressed world economy in 2009.The Street expects 19% EPS growth this year on a 19% revenue pop. Q4 results are expected to be reported in early February.IPG is slightly extended from a 61.61 buy point in a double-bottom base.Western Digital (WDC), a California-based hard drive maker, derives about 77% of revenue from outside the Americas. In Q3, Asia accounted for 59% of revenue.Annual earnings fell 46% in fiscal 2011 ended in June and leapt 162% in fiscal 2012. Revenue fell 3% and rose 31% those same periods.The Street sees an 11% drop in EPS this fiscal year on an 18% revenue gain.The stock is climbing the right side of a cup base.Online marketer eBay (EBAY) receives about 52% of its revenue from outside the U.S. Ten years ago, the international footprint was 7%.Annual earnings grew 9% in 2010 and 17% in 2011. Revenue improved 5% and 27%. The Street expects 16% EPS growth this year on a 21% revenue spurt.The stock is modestly above a flat base and could be forming a base-on-base pattern.Blue chip heavy equipment maker Caterpillar (CAT) is the only stock in this group that isn't in the IBD 50.The company is based in Peoria, Ill., but 63% of Q3 revenue came from outside North America.Annual EPS rose 120% and 77% in 2010-11 on revenue gains of 31% and 41%.

"
448,IPGP,"When the road gets rough, most folks tighten their grip on the wheel.But how exactly do you do that with stocks?The most common strategy for growth investors in a correcting market is to move to cash. But there are sometimes signals that a correction may be short-lived. Or, investors may own a stock that appears set to advance despite the overall market conditions.These are just two of many reasons that may urge growth investors to decide not to take profits and rotate entirely to cash. Under these and other circumstances, two of your most effective offensive precautions include scaling down your price target and narrowing your loss allowance to less than 5%.In the healthy market, your nominal price target on stocks might be 20%. IBD founder William O'Neil, in his book ""The Successful Investor,"" recommends ""selling a few of your stocks when they are up 20% to 25% from your purchase price.""Investors using the price-to-earnings expansion method may chart sell points well beyond 20%.But correcting markets are stingy and unpredictable. Gains of 10% or more can be tough to muster. And a 10% gain can turn into a quick loss in the first few seconds of a panicked trading session.It happens to even the most fundamentally sound stocks.To defend against such volatility, narrow your top-end target to 10% to 15%. Consider taking profit even earlier — at 3% to 5%, for example. Remember, pulling off a pair of 5% to 10% wins in a correcting market leaves you well above where you would have been if you'd rotated entirely to cash. And it puts you far above those who watched their holdings correct along with the market.Impax Laboratories (IPXL) broke out of a first-stage, base-on-base pattern 1 just as the market was starting to correct in September. It rose 9% through Oct. 2, then pulled back and dropped below support at the 10-week moving average. It collapsed Oct. 31 in massive trade. A downsized sell target could have captured the bulk of that advance.Cirrus Logic (CRUS), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and IPG Photonics (IPGP) are among other leaders also to come under stress in the current correction.On the downside, don't wait for the normal 7% to 8% loss to exit a stock. Dips, especially in heavy volume and those that break support at their 50-day or 10-week moving averages, tend to rapidly worsen in correcting markets.Tighten your baseline loss allowance. If you use trading stops, set them to a 3% to 5% maximum. For investors with a high risk tolerance, this can be a tough sacrifice. It means being shaken out of some stocks that dip 5% or 7%, then turn and run higher.

462,IPGP,"While known as a staple in chipmaking, lasers also are used to manufacture everything from razor blades to jet engines, and companies such as IPG Photonics  (IPGP) and Newport (NEWP) see the list of applications growing.
"
463,IPGP,"Smaller sizes and lower costs have made lasers easier to incorporate in precision tools, replacing older technologies in factories and research labs.
"
464,IPGP,"""You can do things with a laser that you just can't do with a mechanical blade,"" said Newport CEO Bob Phillippy.
"
465,IPGP,"Lasers aren't just for cutting and welding. They're also used in scientific instruments, like those that generate images of cell membranes and what lies underneath them.
"
466,IPGP,"Military To Civilian
"
467,IPGP,"The military has long used lasers in targeting and surveillance, areas that could expand into some civilian uses, Phillippy says.
"
468,IPGP,"Laser makers IPG Photonics, Newport, Coherent (COHR) and Rofin-Sinar (RSTI) have been logging double- and triple-digit profit and sales growth in recent quarters, helped by a rebounding manufacturing sector and federal stimulus spending.
"
469,IPGP,"Fiber-based lasers and their lower operating costs also have been replacing gas-based lasers as users upgrade, says Mark Miller, an analyst with Noble Financial. Shares of IPG, which is especially known for its fiber-based lasers, have doubled this year. Coherent, Rofin-Sinar and Newport also make fiber-based lasers.
"
470,IPGP,"Other factors helping laser makers include a revival among their chipmaker customers and the shifting of production to China, which boosts profit margins, Miller says.
"
471,IPGP,"The end of stimulus spending and the cyclical nature of chipmaking are challenges, but laser makers are aided by having a diverse set of products and customers, he says.
"
472,IPGP,"""It limits their exposure,"" Miller said.
"
473,IPGP,"Some trends favor laser makers.
"
474,IPGP,"For example, carmakers are adopting use of lasers to produce lighter, more fuel-efficient cars.
"
475,IPGP,"Bill Shiner, IPG's vice president of industrial sales, says the car industry was slow to embrace fiber-based lasers, but IPG's laser sales to carmakers have taken off the past few years as the auto field began to recover and consumers started demanding better gas mileage.
"
476,IPGP,"IPG's fiber-based lasers are good at penetrating the high-strength steel that car companies prefer for their lighter weight, Shiner says. Also, making car batteries, including those for hybrid and electric vehicles, is easier using laser welding.
"
477,IPGP,"Laser prices have fallen, so more plants can afford to retool and upgrade for high-volume, high-precision manufacturing.
"
478,IPGP,"Newer lasers are more powerful, use less energy and need less maintenance than older versions, Shiner says. Even diamond-based cutters, an alternative to lasers, wear out.
"
479,IPGP,"""Finally, it's cost-justifiable,"" he said. ""It's just made things much more doable.""
"
480,IPGP,"In new, fuel-efficient jet engines, lasers are used to drill millions of tiny holes in surfaces to keep the components cool, Shiner says.
"
481,IPGP,"The wind-energy sector is looking to lasers to improve the corrosion resistance of turbines, which can be covered with another metal in a process called laser cladding, he says.
"
482,IPGP,"Conventional energy companies like oil and gas drillers are also turning to laser cladding to refurbish their drill bits and pipes.
"
483,IPGP,"Solar Picture Also Bright
"
484,IPGP,"Solar energy has been shining on lasers as well, though Noble's Miller says the alternative energy industry is still a relatively small share of manufacturers' business.
"
485,IPGP,"Lasers are needed in manufacturing thin-film solar cells because mechanical systems can't quickly and accurately etch tiny lines and holes in the film, said Phillippy. A mechanical tool can't make a hole a millionth of a meter wide.
"
486,IPGP,"Even if the solar module market doesn't pan out, due to cuts in government subsidies or other factors, laser makers like Newport will be OK, Phillippy said.
"
487,IPGP,"He sees more uses in scientific research, including gene sequencing and diagnostics. Utilization of lasers to correct vision impairment and to carve custom dental and medical implants also will grow, he says.
"
488,IPGP,"Military technology like night-vision optics could find its way in commercial applications like car safety features and security cameras, he says.
"
489,IPGP,"Advances in technology that have made lasers easier to use, smaller, more efficient and less costly will continue, Phillippy says, expanding the range of potential applications.
"

Going ahead, for the fourth quarter, VeriSign projects domain name base registration to increase in the range of 0.4 million to 0.9 million.Also, gTLD prospects, international expansion through IDNs and investments in intellectual properties will boost results in our view. The company continues to benefit from strong demand in the United States as well as in international markets.

604,IPGP,"Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) announced a number of initiatives in its attempts to build a safer community.In its latest blog post, Facebook revealed that “engagement bait” posts that forcibly seek an individual’s attention by provoking them to like, share or comment will be demoted by the company.The social media giant also unveiled tools to prevent harassment on the platform as well as on Messenger by preventing friend requests and messages from a separate account of a user who has already been blocked.Facebook is also coming down heavily on fake accounts by using signals like the IP address of the user.Facebook also rolled out changes to tackle unwanted conversations on Messenger. Per the company, once the conversation is ignored by the reader, notifications will be disabled and it will subsequently be moved to Filtered Messages Folder. The sender will not be intimated whether the message has been read, thus eliminating any chance of abuse outside the platform.Facebook also unveiled an advanced version of its face recognition technology to help users identify pictures in which they are not tagged as well as help them detect when others use their images as profile picture.  Facebook’s aim as reported by the company is “to reduce the spread of content that is spammy, sensational, or misleading in order to promote more meaningful and authentic conversations on Facebook.”We believe these initiatives will significantly drive Facebook’s user base and sustain the share price momentum. Notably, Facebook has gained 50.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 24.6% rally.Developing Social InfrastructureFacebook is considered to have pioneered the concept of social networking, which is why it enjoys a first mover’s advantage in this market. The company’s user base continues to grow at a significant pace driven by new features and tools that improve engagement.Facebook’s continuous efforts clearly indicate that the company is on track to accomplish its mission to protect the community.In February, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in his statement, “the most important thing we at Facebook can do is develop the social infrastructure to give people the power to build a global community that works for all of us.”We note that rising abuse on social media is a serious concern these days. Cyber bullying and trolling are a serious threat to user growth on social networking platforms.Facebook’s initiatives to declutter News Feed, which is the first thing the user views after logging on the platform, and provide more security to users will help drive user satisfaction in our view.The company’s emphasis to drive user engagement by making the platform safer to use is expected to be accretive to its growth.

Moreover, adjusted earnings improved 16.6% on a year-over-year basis.Quarter DetailsFactSet’s revenues of $329.1 million increased 14.3% from the year-ago quarter and came ahead of the guided range of $321 million-$328 million. Organic revenues increased 5.8% year over year to $304.3 million during the quarter. Successful integration of newly acquired businesses along with expansion in workflow-based solutions backed the company’s top-line performance. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $331 million.In the reported quarter, FactSet’s revenues from the United States increased to $208.8 million while international revenues grew to $120.4 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, acquisitions and disposition, U.S. revenues and international revenues rose 4.8% and 7.7%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.FactSet Research Systems Inc.

QuoteThe company’s Annual Subscription Value (ASV) increased to $1.32 billion as of Nov 30, 2017, up 12.8% from the year-ago quarter figure of $1.17 billion. Of this, nearly 84.2% was generated by buy-side clients while the rest came from sell-side firms performing functions like mergers & acquisition, advisory work and equity research. Organically, it had increased 5.1% on a year-over-year basis.FactSet added 65 clients in the reported quarter, taking the tally to 4,809. The company retained 90% of its clients. The percentage of client retention was more than 95% of ASV.Coming to the operational metrics, FactSet reported a 21% rise in total operating expenses. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased approximately 400 basis points (bps) to 73%.FactSet’s adjusted operating income increased 10.6% from the year-ago quarter to $105.1 million. However, operating margin decreased 130 bps year over year to 31.7%, owing to increased operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Adjusted net income during the quarter was $80.9 million compared with $70.1 million in the year-ago quarter.FactSet exited the quarter with $221.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $194.7 million from the previous quarter. Long-term debt at the end of the quarter amounted to $574.7 million.Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $61.1 million. The company generated free cash flow of $55.2 million.FactSet repurchased $30.9 million worth of its common stock under its existing share repurchase authorization during the first quarter. The company has still $213.2 million remaining under the share repurchase authorization as of Nov 30, 2017.GuidanceStarting this quarter, the company has decided not to provide quarterly guidance. Instead, it will issue a fiscal guidance. The company initiated guidance for fiscal 2018. GAAP revenues are expected to be between $1.34 billion and $1.36 billion (mid-point $1.35 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.36 billion.Organic ASV for fiscal 2018 is projected to increase by $65 million to $85 million, representing year-over-year growth of 4.9% to 6.5%. The anticipated range for adjusted operating margin is 31% and 32.5%.Adjusted earnings are expected to be within $8.25 and $8.45 (mid-point $8.35). The midpoint represents 14% year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $8.18 per share.Bottom LineShares of Factset have gained 25.3% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 30.7% rally. Investors seem concern about lower-than-expected revenues and unimpressive top-line guidance for fiscal 2018. Furthermore, declining client retention ratio remains a major concern. The company’s client retention ratio in the first quarter came in at 90%, tanking 300 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter and 100 bps from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. It should be noted that a strong client retention ratio signifies more stable revenues.Although the company continues to add clients every quarter, it has failed to retain old clients. This will negatively impact its near-term top-line growth.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderFactset has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some of the better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), NetApp, Inc.

The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day, but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price.

609,IPGP,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for IPG Photonics Corporation (IPGP  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 6.6% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is IPGP due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsIPG Photonics delivered first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.93 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13 cents. The figure was better than the guided range of $1.62-$1.87.The strong year-over-year growth was driven by a 26% surge in sales from the year-ago quarter to $359.9 million. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $347 and also outperformed managements guided range of $330-$355 million.Materials processing jumped 28% year over year and accounted for approximately 94% of total sales driven by strength in 3D printing and cutting applications.IPG Photonics is benefiting from strong adoption of fiber lasers over conventional lasers as well as non-laser cutting and welding equipment. According to management, secular transition to high powered products and increased electric vehicle battery production were the primary drivers behind the increased adoption of the high powered lasers.The year-over-year sales growth was driven by robust performance in China, Europe and Japan with strong demand across a variety of applications and industries. Apart from strong order flow, robust integration of the company’s business model with vertically-integrated manufacturing operation, production & operations management, customer credit management and global administration aided growth.Geographic Revenue DetailsChina reported year-over-year sales growth of 28.5% and represented 41.7% of total sales. The robust performance was driven by strong sales of high-power CW lasers for cutting and welding applications.However, welding sales were down year over year due to the anticipated reduction in demand pertaining to the smart-phone investment cycle. Electric vehicle battery welding, which are project driven, were also down in the region.Sales in Japan surged 39% from the year-ago quarter. In spite of the ongoing softness in sales in the region, growth was achieved on the back of increasing adoption of its cutting, engraving, and marking and welding applications.Further, Japan lags other regions regarding adoption of fiber laser technology. To address the issue, IPG Photonics is making investments in new sales personnel to enhance capabilities in the region.Sales in Europe increased 35% from the year-ago quarter. Europe benefited from strength in medium-power lasers for 3D printing applications, and high power lasers for cutting and welding applications. Moreover, pulsed laser sales for marking, solar cell manufacturing and engraving continued to drive growth in the region.Sales in the United States and other North America grew 3.4% year over year. Sales in America benefited from strength in welding and cutting applications which offset the softness in communications. Further, ILT acquisition contributed meaningfully to domestic sales.Product DetailsSales of high-power CW lasers (64.1% of total revenues) surged 37.3% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, management also noted that demand for 6 kilowatt ultra-high power CW lasers gained momentum.Medium-power CW laser sales (6.0% of total revenues) increased 8.8% as increased demand for fine welding and 3D printing mitigated softness in cutting. Management noted that within the lower-end cutting applications, many OEMs are moving away from medium-power to high-power lasers at 1 kilowatt and 1.5 kilowatt.Sales of low-power CW lasers (1.1% of total revenues) climbed 15.76% from the year-ago quarter.Pulsed lasers sales (10.6% of total revenues) grew 17.9% year over year. Sales of new green and high-power pulsed lasers across broad-based applications drove results. Sales of low-power pulsed lasers for marking and engraving applications also contributed significantly.An expected reduction in demand pertaining to the smart-phone investment cycle led to a 24.2% decline in the sales of QCW lasers (4.5% of total revenues) on a year-over-year basis. However, management anticipates IPG Photonics’s rich laser technology portfolio to enable it to capture market share, given the increasing complexity of new smart-phones, from non-laser processing.Other products revenues (13.7% of total revenues) advanced 20.8% year over year due to solid sales growth witnessed across systems and beam delivery accessories.Operational DetailsIPG Photonics reported gross margin of 56.5%, which expanded 150 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis and came ahead of management’s guided range of 50-55%. This can be attributed to improved cost reductions, manufacturing efficiency and favorable product mix that offset lower average selling price (ASP).As a percentage of revenue, sales & marketing expenses, R&D expenses remained flat year over year.

610,IPGP,"Shares of Twitter Inc. (TWTR  -  Free Report) surged 11.02% to close at $24.68 on Dec 18, following the company’s decision of enforcing the rules announced last month to handle content that promotes violence, hatred and harassment.Per the blog post by Twitter, “Specific threats of violence or wishing for serious physical harm, death, or disease to an individual or group of people is in violation of our policies.”Twitter revealed that accounts of organizations that promote violence or content that “glorifies violence or the perpetrators of a violent act” will be removed from the platform. Frequent violations of rules will result in permanent suspension of accounts, the company warned.Twitter also added that accounts that engage in derogatory and hateful remarks “to silence another person’s voice” through abusive profile information in the form of username, display name or biography will be permanently suspended.Images promoting abhorrence on the basis of race, caste and creed, disability or sexual orientation will also be removed from the platform.As part of Twitter’s move to create a “safer environment”, it suspended the accounts of far-right group Britain First along with the profiles of its leaders Jayda Fransen and Paul Golding.Moreover, Twitter users can now report profiles that they consider offensive as against reporting only individual posts previously.Notably, shares of Twitter have gained 51.4% year to date, outperforming the  industry’s 34% rally.Focus to Increase EngagementTwitter’s focus to drive user engagement by making the platform easier to use is expected to be accretive to its growth. The latest developments to make the platform more attractive to users are positives in our view.We note that rising abuse on social media is a serious concern these days. Cyber bullying and trolling are a serious threat to user growth on the social networking platforms.For a company like Twitter that has been facing lackluster user growth, the initiatives taken to combat hateful activities on the platform is prudent in our view.On the last conference call, CEO Jack Dorsey was quoted saying, “we're taking a more aggressive stance in our abuse rules and how we enforce them.”He also added that by publishing the company’s upcoming safety work planned through January 2018, the company has for the first time provided such visibility into its work and expects it to build “trust along the way.”We believe that enforcement of strict policies will help the company battle extensive PR damage.Twitter, Inc.

611,IPGP,"On Dec 16, Zacks Investment Research downgraded VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY  -  Free Report) to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The downgrade can be attributed to negative estimate revisions witnessed over the last seven days following fourth-quarter 2017 results.Although the company reported impressive results, the soft guidance provided by the company for the forthcoming quarter makes us skeptical about near-term prospects.The company witnessed eight downward revisions for the current quarter and seven for fiscal 2018 over the last seven days, with no upward revision. The trend has caused the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2018 to decline 24.4% and 3.8% to 25 cents and $1.51, respectively.Notably, VeriFone’s shares have gained 3% year to date, substantially underperforming the 38.3% rally of its industry.Key FactorsVeriFone’s business has been affected by macroeconomic headwinds in emerging markets. Apart from this, the Electronic payment system and services market is highly competitive and fragmented. Increased pricing pressure is an overhang.VeriFone faces significant competition from a number of local providers in the domestic as well as Latin America and Asia Pacific markets. In the last reported quarter, non-GAAP revenues from North America and Asia Pacific fell 9.6% and 3.8% from the year-ago quarter, respectively.The divestitures of Petro Media and the Taxi businesses are anticipated to hurt top-line growth in the near term.Moreover, newly-launched product like Carbon will take some time to contribute to growth.Further, the company’s leveraged balance sheet may limit future expansion and worsen risk profile. Higher interest rate on debt is expected to negatively impact profits.Verifone Systems, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Verifone Systems, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Verifone Systems, Inc.

612,IPGP,"Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) recently announced changes in video policies which include distribution of videos on the platform, ad breaks and testing of pre roll ad format. The company expects this move to increase engagement and boost viewership.Facebook revealed that it has tweaked News Feed ranking which will “help surface videos people are proactively seeking out and coming back to on Facebook.”The company is also encouraging longer videos, having duration of minimum three minutes. Publishers will be able insert advertisements after a minute’s gap. Previously, ads were placed after a gap of 20 seconds in a video with a minimum duration of 90 seconds. Facebook has been resorting to such measures to uplift viewers’ satisfaction.Two new metrics that include Ad Break impressions and Ad Break CPMs at the video level have been introduced by Facebook to help advertisers gauge the performance.Facebook is also testing pre roll ad platform, wherein publishers will be able to put in ads for a duration of six seconds at the start of videos posted only on the platform’s Watch tab.We believe that these initiatives will help the company drive user engagement and improve the time spent on the platform.Notably, Facebook has gained 56.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 26.9% rally.Push To Digital AdvertisingFacebook intends to capture the opportunity presented by ever-increasing video viewing on social media platforms. Earlier, the company mentioned that video has been emerging as a “megatrend”. The company believes that over the next three years videos will be the key catalyst among all product lines.Facebook’s focus to develop new ad products and making them more relevant and effective is yielding positive results. The company is using machine learning and automation to help advertisers reach the target audience.We note that the company has witnessed significant traction in online and mobile advertising spending in a short span. In the third quarter of 2017, ad revenues grew 49% year over year to $10.1 billion while mobile ad revenues surged 57% to $8.9 billion.Notably, average price per ad increased 35% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, ad impressions improved 10%, due to increases in mobile impressions.Management also noted that 70% of ad breaks having duration of 15 seconds were viewed on Facebook and Audience Network, helping advertisers boost revenues.In the last conference call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated, “video can serve as a touchstone for building community and helping facilitate interaction, then that's the thing that we feel like we can uniquely do that.”Online video is the most lucrative component of digital advertising. As video ads generate more revenues than photo and text-based substitutes, Facebook is trying to incorporate more video-oriented content to gain revenues.Facebook, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Facebook, Inc.

615,IPGP,"IPG Photonics Corporation (IPGP  -  Free Report) delivered first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.93 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13 cents. The figure was better than the guided range of $1.62-$1.87.The strong year-over-year growth was driven by a 26% surge in sales from the year-ago quarter to $359.9 million. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $347 and also outperformed managements guided range of $330-$355 million.Materials processing jumped 28% year over year and accounted for approximately 94% of total sales driven by strength in 3D printing and cutting applications.IPG Photonics is benefiting from strong adoption of fiber lasers over conventional lasers as well as non-laser cutting and welding equipment. According to management, secular transition to high powered products and increased electric vehicle battery production were the primary drivers behind the increased adoption of the high powered lasers.The year-over-year sales growth was driven by robust performance in China, Europe and Japan with strong demand across a variety of applications and industries. Apart from strong order flow, robust integration of the company’s business model with vertically-integrated manufacturing operation, production & operations management, customer credit management and global administration aided growth.IPG Photonics’ stock has returned 5.7% in the past year, underperforming industry’s rally of 5.7%.Geographic Revenue DetailsChina reported year-over-year sales growth of 28.5% and represented 41.7% of total sales. The robust performance was driven by strong sales of high-power CW lasers for cutting and welding applications.However, welding sales were down year over year due to the anticipated reduction in demand pertaining to the smart-phone investment cycle. Electric vehicle battery welding, which are project driven, were also down in the region.Sales in Japan surged 39% from the year-ago quarter. In spite of the ongoing softness in sales in the region, growth was achieved on the back of increasing adoption of its cutting, engraving, and marking and welding applications.Further, Japan lags other regions regarding adoption of fiber laser technology. To address the issue, IPG Photonics is making investments in new sales personnel to enhance capabilities in the region.Sales in Europe increased 35% from the year-ago quarter. Europe benefited from strength in medium-power lasers for 3D printing applications, and high power lasers for cutting and welding applications. Moreover, pulsed laser sales for marking, solar cell manufacturing and engraving continued to drive growth in the region.Sales in the United States and other North America grew 3.4% year over year. Sales in America benefited from strength in welding and cutting applications which offset the softness in communications. Further, ILT acquisition contributed meaningfully to domestic sales.Product DetailsSales of high-power CW lasers (64.1% of total revenues) surged 37.3% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, management also noted that demand for 6 kilowatt ultra-high power CW lasers gained momentum.Medium-power CW laser sales (6.0% of total revenues) increased 8.8% as increased demand for fine welding and 3D printing mitigated softness in cutting. Management noted that within the lower-end cutting applications, many OEMs are moving away from medium-power to high-power lasers at 1 kilowatt and 1.5 kilowatt.Sales of low-power CW lasers (1.1% of total revenues) climbed 15.76% from the year-ago quarter.Pulsed lasers sales (10.6% of total revenues) grew 17.9% year over year. Sales of new green and high-power pulsed lasers across broad-based applications drove results. Sales of low-power pulsed lasers for marking and engraving applications also contributed significantly.An expected reduction in demand pertaining to the smart-phone investment cycle led to a 24.2% decline in the sales of QCW lasers (4.5% of total revenues) on a year-over-year basis. However, management anticipates IPG Photonics’s rich laser technology portfolio to enable it to capture market share, given the increasing complexity of new smart-phones, from non-laser processing.Other products revenues (13.7% of total revenues) advanced 20.8% year over year due to solid sales growth witnessed across systems and beam delivery accessories.Operational DetailsIPG Photonics reported gross margin of 56.5%, which expanded 150 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis and came ahead of management’s guided range of 50-55%. This can be attributed to improved cost reductions, manufacturing efficiency and favorable product mix that offset lower average selling price (ASP).As a percentage of revenue, sales & marketing expenses, R&D expenses remained flat year over year.

618,IPGP,"Twitter Inc. (TWTR  -  Free Report) introduced Threads to make posting of tweetstorms easier for people.The tweetstorm feature that the company confirmed testing on iOS and Android devices last month enables users to share several tweets in one thread. With the addition of the new feature, users can add tweets to an already posted thread.Per TechCrunch, currently a maximum of 25 can be made in a thread. But the company expects to change the count depending on how it is adopted.On the last conference call, talking about keeping up with the interests of people, CEO Jack Dorsey mentioned, “This is an area of experimentation. We're experimenting very, very quickly to figure out the right approach. And then as we learn more, bring that more into the timeline, and you'll see some of those experiments going forward.”We note that Twitter has been making a lot of changes to its platform to make it more user-friendly. The company is focusing on boosting user growth rate and engagement levels by taking various measures to make tweeting easier and more expressive.Last month, Twitter rolled out a 280-character limit for tweets, doubling it from the legacy 140 limit, after users from several corners of the world, such as Germany, complained of failure to express thoughts within the set limit.Notably, shares of Twitter have gained 32.9% year to date, slightly outperforming the industry’s 30.4% rally.What’s Worrying Investors?However, Twitter’s lackluster user growth remains the primary concern for investors. In the last reported quarter, Twitter’s adjusted monthly average users (MAUs) of 330 million increased a marginal 1.2% sequentially and 4% on a year-over-year basis. On the hand, Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) MAUs were up 16% year over year to a staggering 2.07 billion.Hard core Twitter users fear that change of features may result in loss of spontaneity and brevity that are unique to Twitter.The company, on the other hand, is striving to uphold its sense of brevity. Per TechCrunch, in response to user’s apprehensions regarding cluttering of the timeline with longer posts, the company mentioned that in case of more than three tweets the thread will be truncated. In such a scenario, users will have to click on “Show this thread” option for viewing the full thread.We believe that if the new features can translate to an increase in engagement levels, it will lead to higher ad revenues. This is very important for a company that is undergoing a slowdown in ad revenues, its primary growth driver. In the last reported quarter, advertising revenues were down 8% year over year.Twitter, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Twitter, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Twitter, Inc.

619,IPGP,"Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report), in a further push into the world of augmented reality (AR), announced the opening of AR Studio for all developers.The company also unveiled the “World Effects” feature that will allow users to add 3D objects onto the background of photos or videos shared using Facebook or Messenger camera.Per TechCrunch, the 3D objects launched include a floating heart, a pointer, unicorn and robot and word bubbles with messages like “love,” “bae,” “heart” and “miss you”.We believe that these initiatives will help the company increase user engagement and improve the time well spent on the platform.Notably, Facebook has gained 53.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 24.3% rally.Facebook in ARFacebook introduced AR Camera Effects platform and AR Studio tool at the F8 developers’ conference in April.Talking about its first AR platform, on the earnings call held in May, CEO Mark Zuckerberg was quoted saying, “We want to give developers the power to build all kinds of AR tools in the camera so more people can experience augmented reality on their phone. Creating the first open camera platform is a huge step forward, and we're excited to keep pushing augmented reality forward.”The camera platform as noted by the CEO is expected to offer “a much greater diversity of use cases”, providing users with “thousands of options instead of just 10 or 20 at a time” compared with other apps.Facebook’s focus on increasing investments to foster development of AR was reiterated on the last conference call as well. Facebook’s AR studio is expected to help developers compete with Apple and Google.The company strongly believes that technologies like AR will revolutionize the future and emerge as big business opportunities. According to a recent IDC report, revenues from the global AR/VR market will grow to a whopping $143.3 billion by 2020.Counter SnapchatWe note that the World Effects feature is again heavily inspired by Snap’s (SNAP  -  Free Report) World Lenses feature on its messaging app, Snapchat.Facebook has a history of mimicking the features of Snapchat on its platforms and making them more popular. Instagram Stories, a blatant copy of Snapchat’s feature of the same name, has more than 300 million DAUs compared with Snapchat’s total DAU of 178 million.However, Snapchat has been offering some serious competition in terms of attracting teenagers/young adults to its platform. We note that Snapchat is highly popular among the younger demography.With the addition of these tools, Facebook is expected to improve user engagement on the platform that will eventually lead to more ad dollars for the company. As we know, advertising forms the mainstay of Facebook’s revenues, the company’s attempt to lure users to its platforms is prudent in our view.Facebook, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Facebook, Inc.

620,IPGP,"Per a recent report by Reuters, Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) requests for deferment of tax on imported mobile phone parts in India are unlikely to be accepted. The government is supposedly against granting of any “special concessions” to the tech giant.We note that India imposes a 10% tax on imported components like batteries, chargers and headsets in order to foster domestic production. With Narendra Modi at the helm, the “Make in India” concept is fast catching up with global manufacturing majors.Apple is rumored to have demanded a 15-year tax holiday on the import of equipment and components in the country.  At the beginning of the year, the company met with the government in order to discuss its intentions of setting up manufacturing units in the country in exchange of tax breaks. It was estimated that the expansion would create 5-10K jobs in the country.Apple mentioned that it had ""constructive and open dialogue” with the government regarding the expansion of local production but declined to share additional details.However, both Apple and the concerned government are yet to make any comments regarding the current update.Why is Apple Eyeing India?Apple faces slowing iPhone demand in most of the regions, either because of competition or regulatory hurdles (as in the case of China) or market saturation (as in the United States). It is therefore taking a number of initiatives to strengthen its presence in growth regions like India, which can become a key long-term driver going ahead.Notably, shares of Apple have gained 49.1% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 45.3% rally.The country presents an attractive growth opportunity for the company over the long run given its younger population and increasing investment in 4G networks infrastructure. Apple has partnered with telecom company, Reliance, which will be providing its Jio (a unique all-IP network) service for free with the new iPhones along with Bharti Airtel.Furthermore, the company is also setting up a couple of development centers in India to boost app development and to accelerate the development of maps. Also, Apple has set up its first manufacturing unit in Bangalore, Karnataka and has teamed up with Wistron Corp. from Taiwan to take care of the assembly of the iPhones.In the last reported quarter, Apple sales in India doubled year over year. However, the company has failed to make it to the list of top five smartphone brands in the country.According to the International Data Corporation (IDC) report released in November, Xiaomi and Samsung are the two leading smartphone brands in India with 23.5% market share each in the third quarter.Therefore, the company’s increasing focus on India to claim a greater share of the vast smartphone market, of which it reportedly holds only 2% currently, is prudent in our view.However, the market is highly cost sensitive. The Chinese competitors are providing smartphones at very reasonable prices.Reportedly, the majority of the smartphones sold are priced around INR 10K. iPhone 8, on the other hand, costs almost six times more while iPhone 9 costs nine times more.The lion's share of Apple’s revenues in the country comes from devices that are a couple of generations old. Newer models have relatively low demand given their hefty price tag.The denial of tax benefits will translate into an increase in pricing of the products, which might be detrimental to Apple’s growth in the country.Apple Inc.

621,IPGP,"Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) recently launched two tools for video creators — Sound Collection and the 360 Community Page.Per a blog post by the company, the video editing tool Sound Collection offers users a number of free high-quality audio tracks and sound effects for creating videos and sharing them on Facebook and Instagram.Facebook intends to expand the collection by adding new tracks and sound effects. It is also set to launch discovery tools that will enable users to know about various artists, follow them and browse the best-suited sounds for their videos by genre, mood, length and vocals.Facebook also launched a new 360 community page by partnering with Blend Media that offers tools for making 360 degree videos. The page covers tutorials on everything related to 360 video productions. The company claims to have shared over a million 360 videos on the platform since the launch of the feature in 2015.Facebook also introduced its new Camera Loaner Program, by which users will be able to borrow cameras directly from Blend Media. The company will initially be lending the GoPro Fusion and ZCam S1 but eventually more cameras will be offered.A page for editing videos called 360 Director has also been launched for both Pages and profiles.We believe Facebook’s video efforts will continue to pay off big time.Notably, Facebook has gained 55.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 24.5% rally. Video – A Key Growth DriverFacebook intends to capture the opportunity presented by ever-increasing video viewing on social media platforms. Facebook had earlier noted video to be a “megatrend” on the same lines like mobile.Talking about its video efforts, on the last conference call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg mentioned, “video can serve as a touchstone for building community and helping facilitate interaction, then that's the thing that we feel like we can uniquely do that.”The company believes that over the next three years videos will be the key growth catalyst among all its product lines. Moreover, per the company, interactions and comments are 10 times more for live videos compared to other videos.In November, Facebook launched Creator App for creators to “manage their presence” on Facebook. In August this year, Facebook unveiled a new tab called “Watch” that will be exclusively dedicated to video viewing. The company is also increasing investment in producing more video content for the Watch tab.Facebook has also launched a website for creators, which will assist creators to “find resources and tips on how to create great videos, connect with fans, and grow on Facebook.”By bringing more video content, Facebook is trying to bring in more ad dollars, which remain the mainstay of the company’s revenues with over 95% contribution.Moreover, online video is the most lucrative component of digital advertising.As video ads generate more revenues than its photo and text based counterparts, Facebook is trying to incorporate more and more video-oriented content to bring in more ad dollars.Facebook, Inc.

622,IPGP,"Spooked by the data breach news, social media giant Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) was one of the worst-performing stocks on Wall Street in Monday’s trading session. This has sparked concerns over increased regulation for large tech companies, triggering a selloff in the hot and soaring technology corner of the broad stock market.Both the S&P technology index and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index witnessed the worst one-day fall since the selloff in early February, declining 2.1% and 2.5%, respectively.What Happened?The steep decline came following reports from New York Times and London's Observer, which revealed that data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, which had ties to the Trump campaign, gained inappropriate access to data on more than 50 million Facebook users. This has sparked broader concerns about data privacy and security, and will likely lead to increased scrutiny over data security and a relatively heavy regulatory pressure.As such, shares of Facebook tumbled 6.8% in Monday’s trading session, representing the worst one-day drop in nearly four years, and wiped out $36.4 billion from the company’s market value. With the slide, the stock is down 11.6% from the latest peak, signaling that it has entered correction territory.Facebook currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of B, suggesting that it is primed for growth in the coming months. It saw solid earnings estimate revision of 58 cents for this year over the past 60 days and has an estimated growth rate of 16.72%. Revenues are also expected to grow 36.3% for this year. However, the networking giant belongs to the bottom-ranked Zacks industry (bottom 30%), which signals some pain in the near term.Other stocks in the FAANG group, namely Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), also saw terrible trading, losing 1.7%, 1.5%, 1.6% and 3.0%, respectively. Social media companies including Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) and Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report) dipped 1.7% and 3.5%, respectively.Solid Sector OutlookDespite the slide, the outlook for the sector is promising. This is especially true as the tech sector appears fully emerged from the burst of the dot-com bubble. The emergence of cutting-edge technology such as cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence as well as strong corporate earnings are acting as the key catalysts.Additionally, the twin tailwinds of Trump’s tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario are pushing the stocks higher. Adding to the strength is a pickup in the economy and better job prospects that are giving a solid boost to economically sensitive growth sectors like technology, which typically perform well in a maturing economic cycle. With the global economy gathering momentum, technology companies are likely to outperform and less susceptible to interest rates or deregulation.Top PicksGiven this, we have highlighted five stocks that are unfazed by the latest tech rout and poised to outperform in the weeks ahead:Qualys Inc.

623,IPGP,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for IPG Photonics Corporation (IPGP  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 4.7% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is IPGP due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsIPG Photonics Corporation reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.86 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14 cents. The figure was better than the guided range of $1.55-$1.80. Earnings per share on a GAAP basis were 96 cents after taking into account the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which negatively impacted the EPS by 90 cents. The strong year-over-year growth was driven by a 29% surge in sales from the year-ago quarter to $361.1 million. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $347 and also outperformed managements guided range of $330-$355 million.Materials processing sales jumped 32% year over year and accounted for approximately 94% of total sales driven by strength in cutting and welding applications. Record laser sales for 3D printing applications also drove growth.IPG is benefiting from strong adoption of fiber lasers over conventional lasers and non-laser cutting and welding equipment. According to management, secular transition to high powered products and increased electric vehicle battery production were the primary drivers behind the increased adoption of the high powered lasers.The year-over-year sales growth was driven by robust performance in China, Europe, North America and Japan with strong demand across a variety of applications and industries. Apart from strong order flow, robust integration of the company’s business model with vertically-integrated manufacturing operation, production & operations management, customer credit management and global administration aided growth.China Continues to Drive GrowthChina reported strong year-over-year sales growth of 47% and represented almost 44% of total sales. The robust performance was driven by strong sales of high-power CW lasers for cutting and welding applications. The company also benefited from dramatic rise in QCW laser sales, primarily related to consumer electronics welding applications.Sales in Europe and the United States increased 18% and 16%, respectively, whereas it increased 2% in Japan from the year-ago quarter. In spite of the ongoing softness in sales in the region, growth was achieved on the back of increasing adoption of its products by Japan-based OEM’s.Europe benefited from strength in medium-power lasers for 3D printing applications, which increased as much as twice from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, pulsed laser sales for marking and engraving as well as high-power pulsed lasers for marking, engraving, and solar cell manufacturing continued to drive growth in the region.Sales in the United States benefited from robust systems, high-power pulsed lasers sales and government business, all of which offset the softness in communications. Further, ILT acquisition contributed meaningfully to domestic sales.Product DetailsSales of high-power CW lasers continued to rise during the quarter and contributed significantly to revenues. Management noted that increase in demand for electric vehicle battery production led to rapid expansion of the laser-based welding market of the company. Moreover, management also noted that demand for 1 to 2 kilowatt and lower-end cutting applications continued to gain momentum.Sales of QCW lasers increased 13% year over year driven by strong growth in fine welding for consumer electronics applications.Medium-power CW laser sales increased 5% as increased demand for fine welding and 3D printing offset softness in cutting. Management noted that within the lower-end cutting applications, many OEMs are moving away from medium-power to high-power lasers at 1 and 1.5 kilowatt.Pulsed lasers sales grew 20% year over year. Sales of new green and high-power pulsed lasers across a diverse set of applications drove results. Sales of low-power pulsed lasers for marking and engraving applications also contributed significantly.Other products sales increased 26% year over year due to strong sales growth in systems and beam delivery products.Operational DetailsIPG reported gross margin of 57.8%, which expanded 230 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis. This was primarily backed by improved manufacturing efficiency, cost reductions and favorable product mix that fully offset lower average selling price (ASP).As a percentage of sales, sales & marketing expenses, R&D expenses and G&A expenses increased double digits on a year-over-year basis.Operating income was $148 million, up 41% from the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowDuring the fourth quarter, IPG generated $108 million in cash from operations and spent $27 million in capital expenditures. In the previous quarter, the company generated $164 million in cash from operations and used $56 million to finance capital expenditures.IPG ended the quarter with $1.12 billion in cash & cash equivalents and short-term investments. Total debt outstanding was $49 million.During the quarter, IPG bought back 60K shares for $13 million.OutlookIPG expects sales in the range of $330-$355 million for the first quarter of 2018, reflecting 15-24% growth from the year-ago quarter. Management expects slowdown in spending related to consumer electronics investment cycle and typical seasonality in China to hurt revenues.Earnings are projected in the range of $1.62-$1.87 per share, which reflects an increase of 17-36% from the year-ago quarter.For 2018, management expects revenue growth in the range of 10.IPG anticipates capital expenditure for 2018 in the range of $170-$190 million, or approximately 8 of revenues.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted by 11.1% due to these changes.IPG Photonics Corporation Price and Consensus  IPG Photonics Corporation Price and Consensus | IPG Photonics Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, IPGP has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum is doing a bit better with a B.

625,IPGP,"Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) announced the addition of two new features, live streaming and video chat, to its Instant Games platform launched a year back on both Facebook and Messenger.Facebook will conduct a test run of the video chat feature, which will enable Messenger users to engage in video chats while playing games with one another, before rolling it out early next year. The company mentioned Zynga’s Words with Friends to be the first game to include this feature.The live streaming feature has however been rolled out already. It enables gamers to broadcast their games via Facebook Live and engage in conversations.Along with these, Facebook also announced a number of games to be launched on its platform by next year. The games include the highly popular Angry Birds, Sonic Jump from SEGA, LINE’s Disney Tsum Tsum and a new puzzle game by GungHo Online Entertainment Inc.The platform now offers 70 games globally from over 100 developers compared with the initial launch of 20 games in 30 markets.Notably, Facebook has gained 55.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 24.5% rally.Focus on Boosting User EngagementFacebook’s attempts to integrate more video content into the platform are expected to increase user engagement. The company focuses on “time well spent” rather than just increasing the time spent on its platform in order to build a better community.Talking about its video efforts, on the last conference call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg mentioned that “connecting with friends and family and having those meaningful interactions is more important than just consuming content.”The CEO believes videos to be more “engaging than a photo and a better representation of that than writing it out in text.”We believe the addition of live streaming and video chatting while playing games will increase social interaction and thereby make the games more interesting and engaging.We note that Facebook was once the hub for social gaming but all that changed with the arrival of mobile games. Mobile games quickly gained precedence in the social gaming space. Facebook took a hit on the revenue front as in-game purchases floundered. Per Tech Crunch, at its peak, Facebook made about $250 million from in-game purchases.In October, Facebook rolled out testing of monetization options to select developers. The company began testing of in-app purchases and advertisements on Instant Games platform. We believe monetizing Instant Games will help Facebook to boost its non-advertising revenues.In the last reported quarter, revenues from Payments and other fees decreased 5% year over year owing to reduction in payment revenues related to PC games against 49% growth in advertising revenues. Management warned that the segment will face further decline as PCs lose market share.The company’s attempts to boost its non-advertising revenues as well as attract users to spend more time on its platform are prudent in our view. Moreover, the launch of live streaming games will also help it counter growing competition from YouTube and Microsoft who are ramping up their efforts to tap the market.Facebook, Inc.

626,IPGP,"In a bid to strengthen foothold in the healthcare markets, Koninklijke Philips N.V. (PHG  -  Free Report) recently announced the acquisition of VitalHealth.VitalHealth is a leading supplier of cloud-based population health management solutions for the delivery of personalized care outside the hospitals. VitalHealth’s strong portfolio of telehealth applications and care coordination platform would complement Philips Wellcentive’s solution that includes health informatics and patient engagement programs.Together with the VitalHealth’s portfolio of solutions, the company’s Wellcentive solution will enable healthcare providers to better identify and deal with high-risk and high-cost patient populations. The buyout will strengthen the company’s population health management portfolio with advanced analytics, care coordination, patient engagement as well as outcome management solutions.This apart, the company also recently acquired Forcare, a leading innovator in open-standards-based interoperability software solutions as it seeks to fortify clinical informatics portfolio.Philips already enjoys a dominant position as a comprehensive clinical informatics solutions provider and believes this buyout will enable it to deliver more effective and seamlessly integrated informatics solutions. This will also facilitate the company to improve patient care, clinical workflow as well as optimize enterprise management. The terms of both the acquisitions were kept under wraps.Existing Business ScenarioThough Philips has successfully morphed from a lighting company into a healthcare technology provider, the company’s near-term profitability is likely to be hurt by sluggish growth prospects of the healthcare market on a global scale.In light of uncertainties like slowing government spending and events surrounding the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) legislation, the company expects the United States to witness low-single digit growth in the healthcare industry. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company has returned 7.7% in the last six months, underperforming the industry’s gain of 10.1%.Further, the company anticipates high restructuring and acquisition related costs in fourth-quarter 2017 of approximately €150 million. Additionally, escalating taxes and restructuring charges are proving to be a drag on the company’s financials. These costs will negatively impact margins in the quarters ahead. This apart, the company is exposed to a number of compliance risks that can weigh on its financials.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include IPG Photonics Corporation (IPGP  -  Free Report), Garmin Ltd.

628,IPGP,"IPG Photonics (IPGP  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 16. Notably, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 14.7%.In the last quarter, IPG reported earnings of $2.11 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 32 cents and advancing 64.1% year over year. The strong growth was driven by higher sales, which surged 47.6% from the year-ago quarter to $392.6 million.We believe strong adoption of fiber lasers over conventional lasers and non-laser cutting and welding equipment are driving IPG’s growth. Moreover, with a proper blend of improved manufacturing efficiency, cost reductions, favorable product mix coupled with customer credit management and global administration, IPG is poised to enjoy steady growth.Guidance & EstimatesIPG expects sales in the range of $330-$355 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting 18-27% growth from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $347.2 million.Earnings are projected in the range of $1.55-$1.80 per share, which reflects an increase of 12-30% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.74 per share.Notably, shares of IPG have gained 100.1% in the past year, substantially outperforming the 32.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsSales in Europe and the United States increased 50% and 13% year over year, respectively, in the last reported quarter whereas sales in China were up 70% and represented almost 45% of total sales. This portrays strong global adoption of IPG’s product portfolio. Management expects the trend to continue this quarter.Moreover, acquisitions have helped the company expand its product portfolio. During the quarter, the company acquired Laser Depth Dynamics (LDD) to optimize the usage of lasers in the manufacturing industry. We believe that integration of LDD with IPG’s own welding solutions portfolio will boost adoption of the solutions across multiple industries that require automated production facilities.IPG is gradually expanding into new end-markets like advanced applications (3D Printing, Cinema, and micro-materials processing), communications and medical based on robust product portfolio and strong intellectual property (IP). These have a total addressable market (TAM) of $2.4 billion, which presents significant growth opportunity.Further, we believe that IPG's vertically integrated business model is a key differentiator. This will not only help it to maintain technological lead but also keep costs of production lower. This will aid the company to continue investments in product development.However, intensifying competition from the likes of Coherent, Fanuc Corporation, Mitsubishi Cable Industries and seasonality in Chinese markets may prove to be headwinds.IPG Photonics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise IPG Photonics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | IPG Photonics Corporation QuoteZacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderIPG carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Facebook, Inc.

631,IPGP,"IPG Photonics Corp. (IPGP  -  Free Report), a manufacturer and developer of high performance fiber lasers, recently announced the acquisition of Laser Depth Dynamics (LDD)  to optimize the usage of lasers in the manufacturing industry.LDD primarily monitors and controls solutions related to laser-based welding processes. The company’s flagship inline coherent imaging (ICI) technology allows real-time direct measurement of the depth of weld penetration, thereby making the process accurate and cost effective compared to the indirect techniques.Management believes that this unique feature of LDD when integrated with IPG’s own welding solutions portfolio will boost the adoption rate of the solutions across multiple industries that require automated production facilities. The accelerated usage of these solutions will eventually boost IPG’s top line.Shares of IPG have gained 103.5% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the 79.7% increase of the industry it belongs to. Robust Sales GrowthNotably, IPG posted strong sales figures in third-quarter 2017 results, which surged 47.6% from the year-ago quarter to $392.6 million. The figure outperformed the guided range of $350-$370 million.Materials processing sales jumped 52.1% year over year and accounted for approximately 95.4% of total sales driven by strength in cutting and welding applications. Record laser sales for 3D printing applications also aided growth.Geographically, China, Europe, Turkey and Korea were the highest revenue contributors, driven by massive demand for high-power CW lasers for cutting and welding applications, medium-power lasers for 3D printing applications, pulsed laser sales for marking and engraving as well as high-power pulsed lasers for marking, engraving, and solar cell manufacturing.Will the Momentum Continue?We believe strong adoption of fiber lasers over conventional lasers and non-laser cutting and welding equipment is proving to be a key catalyst for IPG. According to management, higher productivity and lower operating cost of fiber lasers are accelerating the replacement of installed base of CO2 and YAG laser systems, hence driving the company’s top line.Moreover, with a proper blend of improved manufacturing efficiency, cost reductions, favorable product mix coupled with customer credit management and global administration, IPG is poised to enjoy steady growth going ahead.IPG Photonics Corporation Revenue (TTM) IPG Photonics Corporation Revenue (TTM) | IPG Photonics Corporation QuoteZacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderIPG sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

632,IPGP,"Brightcove Inc. (BCOV  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26 after the closing bell. Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 44.44%. Moreover, it has delivered negative earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average negative earnings surprise of 81.94%.Furthermore, we note that shares of Brightcove have fallen 31.1% in the last one year, substantially underperforming the industry‘s growth of 38.2%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderBrightcove is a well-known provider of cloud solutions for delivering and monetizing video across connected devices. The company exhibited strong year-over-year bookings performance in the last reported quarter, despite a significant decrease in its revenue retention rate, primarily among media customers. Back then, the company had stated that it expects this to be a headwind over the next few quarters.However, we are optimistic that its robust product portfolio and new product enhancements will drive bookings momentum, going forward.Notably in April, the company launched Brightcove Live – an API-driven scalable, cost-effective solution to deliver and monetize live broadcasts, events and 24/7 channels. In May, it unveiled a broad set of innovative technologies, including Context Aware Encoding and Dynamic Delivery. Management believes these newly introduced features will continue to garner more customer interest and value for media customers, while purpose-built solutions like Social, Audience and Gallery will cater to the needs of enterprises and digital marketers.We also note that last month, TV Tokyo, one of Japan’s leading broadcast networks, selected Brightcove Live for live stream of the Liebherr 2017 World Table Tennis Championships.For the second quarter, the company expects revenue of $37–$37.8 million, with non-GAAP loss from operations anticipated to be in the range of $4.2–$5 million. Non-GAAP net loss per share is expected to be in a range of $0.13–$0.15.Brightcove Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Brightcove Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Brightcove Inc.

633,IPGP,"Plexus Corp. (PLXS  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 19, after the closing bell. The company reported a positive earnings surprise of 10.53% in the last quarter. Further, it has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 2.52% over the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderFor third-quarter fiscal 2017, revenues are projected in the range of $595–$625 million. GAAP earnings are projected within 68–76 cents per share. GAAP operating margin is expected to be 4.8–5.2%.For Healthcare/Life sciences Sector, management expects growth to be in mid-single digits driven by increasing end-market demand and new wins, while for Industrial/Commercial sector, revenues are anticipated to be flat year over year.Communications sector is stated to be marred by softening end market demand as well as timing of new product launches, whereas Defense/Security/Aerospace, bolstered by increasing end-market demand and new program wins, is projected to see revenues up in mid-single digits sequentially.We note that on a year-to-date basis Plexus’ shares have decreased 2.4%, underperforming the Zacks categorized Electronics Manufacturing Services industry’s gain of 16.7% over the same period.This sluggish performance can be primarily attributed to the reduced end-market demand in the slowing Networking and Communications industry, which contributes significantly to the company’s top-line (approximately 23.4% of fiscal 2016 revenues).Nevertheless, we believe that a healthy number of program wins is a big positive for the company.  In the last reported quarter, Plexus won 26 programs worth approximately $202 million in its Manufacturing Solutions group and has added over $813 million in revenues in the trailing four quarters due to new wins. In addition, the company announced that qualified manufacturing opportunities reached $3 billion revenue run rate in the quarter.Moreover, as an engineering-focused EMS player, Plexus is well-positioned to benefit from the increasing outsourcing trend among healthcare, industrial and defense/aerospace OEMs; given its exposure to high-growth segments, streamlining of operations and strong cash flow generation abilities.Furthermore, the consolidation of the company’s production facilities in low-cost areas is expected to boost margins, going forward. Additionally, a robust shareholder return policy continues to drive the stock.Plexus Corp. Price and EPS Surprise  Plexus Corp. Price and EPS Surprise | Plexus Corp. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Plexus is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

634,IPGP,"Microsoft Corp (MSFT  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 20. Notably, the company has a positive record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 10.40%.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 5.80%. Earnings (adjusted for Windows 10 deferrals and currency effect) of 73 cents per share increased 15% year over year but declined 12% on a sequential basis.Revenues (adjusted for Windows 10 deferrals) of $23.56 billion decreased 9.6% sequentially but increased 6.3% from the year-ago quarter (up 7% in constant currency or CC). Further, it exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.55 billion.Notably, Azure revenues soared 94% at CC on a year-over-year basis. Microsoft noted that Azure premium revenues grew triple digits for the 11th consecutive quarter, with more than 80% of Azure customers using the premium services. Microsoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Microsoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Microsoft Corporation QuoteAzure’s strong performance has also helped the company to outperform the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. The stock returned 17.1%, while the index gained 10%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayWe believe that Azure’s performance will be the key catalyst in the to-be reported quarter. Microsoft anticipates commercial cloud services to continue to drive annuity growth, on the back of expanding installed base, growing consumption and higher number of renewals.Management forecasts commercial unearned revenues of $26.8–$27 billion, in line with historical seasonality. We note that acquisitions like Deis have aided in expanding Azure’s features that will continue to improve installed base going forward.However, Amazon Web Services (AWS) continues to dominate the cloud computing market trailed by Azure. We believe that increasing competition from the likes of Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), IBM, salesforce.com and Oracle toughens growth opportunities for Azure, which can hurt results.Apart from Azure, increasing adoption of Windows 10 and Office 365 are growth factors. Gartner in its latest report projects IT spending to increase 2.4% over 2016 to $3.48 trillion in 2017. The figure is much better than earlier projection of 1.4% growth. Improving spending on enterprise software is major positive for Windows, Office 365 and related applications.Meanwhile, declining PC shipments in the second quarter – as per data available from both Gartner and IDC – is a concern for the company. Both market research firms agreed that shortage of key components, including DRAM, SSD and LCD panels, is escalating PC prices, in turn thwarting the overall demand.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Microsoft will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

635,IPGP,"Netgear, Inc. (NTGR  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 5.77%. Additionally, it has an average positive earnings surprise of 12.72% in the trailing four quarters.However, we note that shares of networking equipment maker Netgear have decreased 9.7% in the last year, underperforming the industry‘s advance of 4.4%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderNetgear designs technologically advanced, branded networking products that address the specific needs of small businesses and home users. We expect the company’s strong product portfolio, comprising offerings like its Nighthawk WiFi routers and Arlo home security products, to boost the top line.In particular, we are positive about the company‘s launch of the Arlo Baby Smart HD Monitoring Camera (ABC1000), in Jan 2017. Netgear’s Arlo segment revenues jumped 150% year over year, driven by Arlo Pro in first-quarter 2017.We believe that Netgear’s strength of Arlo and Orbi sales in the retail channel will primarily drive results. Region-wise, North America continues to contribute the lion’s share (65% of 1Q17 net revenue).However, the service provider business continues to pose challenges with the company streamlining the segment. In the first quarter, the company reported a $28.3 million year-over-year decline in sales to service providers.For the second quarter, the company expects net revenue of $315–$330 million, with GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 5.3–6.3% and non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 8–9%.NETGEAR, Inc.

636,IPGP,"Corning Inc (GLW  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on July 26. Notably, the Gorilla Glass (GG) maker has a positive record of earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 12.81%.In the last quarter, Corning delivered a positive earnings surprise of 13.64%. Earnings of 39 cents per share surged 39.3% on a year-over-year basis but declined 22% sequentially in the reported quarter.Adjusted revenues increased 14.5% year over year to $2.49 billion, which comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 billion. However, revenues declined 2.6% on a sequential basis.Corning’s second-quarter 2017 guidance is fairly good. Management expects year-over-year growth in revenues and earnings per share (EPS). Glass volume is expected to increase by mid-single digit percentage on a year-over-year basis and low-single digit percentage sequentially. The company expects sequential LCD glass price declines to be substantially less than first-quarter 2017. Corning Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Corning Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Corning Incorporated QuoteIn the quarter under review, Optical Communications sales are anticipated to increase 10% from the year-ago period. Further, Environmental Technologies sales are expected to be in line with the year-ago quarter, while Specialty Materials sales are anticipated to increase by a high-teen percentage range. The Life Sciences business will grow low-single digit percentage from the prior-year quarter.Factors at PlayCorning’s shares have outperformed the S&P 500 index on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 10.7%, the stock increased 31.3%. The outperformance reflects consistent execution and strong demand for the company’s optical communications as well as Gorilla Glass products.We believe that strength in the optical communications segment is a key catalyst. Segment sales are expected to grow more rapidly owing to strong demand for fiber products, both from the North American network providers and hyperscale data centers.The Verizon deal reflects the strength in fiber demand, as U.S.-based service providers overhaul networks to improve 4G coverage and accelerate 5G deployments.Moreover, the company remains focused on expanding its footprint in the automotive market driven by gas particulate filters (GPFs) and a Gorilla-sized automotive glass business. In fact, Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) decision to invest $200 million in Corning – to create better products – validates the company’s position as a prime manufacturer of glass products for smartphones.Further, aggressive share buyback in accordance with the strategy & capital allocation framework will also boost bottom-line growth.However, weakness in the Display segment remains a headwind, which can dent results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Corning will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

(PAYC  -  Free Report), a business and financial software company, have been performing well of late.If you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it is time you buy the stock as it looks promising and is likely to carry the momentum ahead.

Revenue (TTM) | Paycom Software, Inc. QuoteGrowth DriversThe company’s top-line is being positively impacted by higher recurring revenues and higher traction in cloud-based offerings. A surge in demand for advanced human capital management and payroll software solutions is an additional tailwind.We believe that the higher adoption of Paycom Software’s Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) dashboard application that tracks employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability will be a revenue booster in the long run.

638,IPGP,"On Dec 27, we issued an updated research report on Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report).The company recently reported impressive fiscal first-quarter 2018 results, wherein the top and bottom line figures increased year over year improvement and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company’s recent product additions in the analytics application space are anticipated to effectively address the increased demand for digital solutions. Additionally, its partnerships and acquisitions will broaden its clientele and addressed market.Accenture stock has gained 26.4% year to date, outperforming the 23.8% rally of the industry it belongs to.Key FactorsAccenture, a provider of management consultancy, technology and outsourcing services,  continues to benefit from its outsourcing business. The company witnessed a 6% year-over-year increase in new bookings, which touched $37.4 billion in fiscal 2017.Notably, the exponential growth in data generation and the need for scalable storage techniques have increased the requirements of cloud computing vendors. In such a scenario, Accenture’s investments to enhance its cloud capabilities will be beneficial. Additionally, the enhancement of its digital marketing capabilities with significant acquisitions like Karmarama, Reactive Media and Acquity Group has been a key catalyst as well.Moreover, the company’s inorganic additions (37 acquisition deals) worth $1.7 billion in fiscal 2017 are notable revenue boosters. The company’s partnerships with Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce and SAP significantly contribute to its revenue stream.Accenture PLC Revenue (TTM) Accenture PLC Revenue (TTM) | Accenture PLC QuoteAdditionally, the company’s strong balance sheet has enabled it to invest in growth initiatives.

639,IPGP,"On Dec 27, we issued an updated research report on FactSet Research Systems Inc. (FDS  -  Free Report).FactSet recently reported mixed results for fiscal first-quarter 2018. While earnings came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues missed the same. However, on a year-over-year basis, it registered growth on both the counts.FactSet is bringing in new products across segments with an emphasis on financial services to expand its customer base. This approach is helping the company overcome macroeconomic challenges.However, decreasing client retention ratio is a major concern for the company as a solid base of existing clients indicates stable revenues.Notably, FactSet stock has gained 22.3% year to date, underperforming the 28.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Factors Influencing the StockFactSet, a provider of global online integrated data-related products and services for the investment community added 65 new clients in fiscal first-quarter 2018, which boosted its Annual Subscription Value (ASV). The company’s competitive pricing strategy has also been a key catalyst for ASV.Notably, the Global Business Information market, which FactSet caters to, is expected to witness CAGR of 5.2% from 2017 to 2021, per technavio. We believe, the company’s core product suite, enriched by its acquired entities like BISAM, IDMS, Portware LLC, Code Red, Revere Data LLC, StreetAccount and others, will enable it to grab the growth opportunity.However, the industry being a highly competitive one with players such as Bloomberg L.P., Thomson Reuters Inc. and S&P Global Market Intelligence, FactSet continues to face strong headwinds. Though it has a technological advantage, some of these competitors have greater financial, technical and marketing resources and we expect competition to intensify in the future.Additionally, declining client retention ratio is a negative for the company’s near-term performance. The company’s client retention ratio in the first quarter was 90%, tanking 300 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter and 100 bps from the previous quarter. This might drag down the company’s top line going ahead.FactSet Research Systems Inc. Revenue (TTM) FactSet Research Systems Inc. Revenue (TTM) | FactSet Research Systems Inc.

640,IPGP,"NCR Corporation (NCR  -  Free Report) recently announced the sale of the remaining assets of its Interactive Printer Solutions (IPS) division — located in the Middle East and Africa (MEA) region — to Interactive Printer Solutions FZCO (IPS FZCO), a part of the Turbon Group of Companies.The deal included the IPS manufacturing facilities of Jebel Ali Free Zone in Dubai, IPS distribution centers and its employees. Per the latest contract, the acquirer will maintain a commercial relationship with NCR post the transaction. This sale marks the last phase of the divestment that was announced in 2016. The first phase of the sale of the IPS division to Atlas Holdings was completed in May 2016.Notably, NCR’s technological solutions (both products and services) — having the likes of automated teller machines (ATMs), self-service kiosks and point of sale (POS) devices as well as software applications that help in customer interaction — are a part of the core infrastructure in today’s connected economy.We believe the completion of the transaction is a testament to the fact that NCR is focusing on its growth in the software and services sector, which will help it rebound going ahead. NCR stock has lost 22.9% year to date, compared to the industry's decline of 13.1%.Factors Influencing the StockPer the company, “ATM orders continue to be negatively impacted by large customer delays in spending in North America, weakness in India, the Middle East and Africa, and the upcoming Windows 10 conversion.”Consequently, this is affecting NCR’s top-line performance. For third-quarter 2017, the company’s hardware revenues decreased 6% year over year on a reported basis to $578 million. The segment revenues from ATM and SCO also declined 16% and 24%, respectively.NCR Corporation Revenue (TTM) NCR Corporation Revenue (TTM) | NCR Corporation QuoteNevertheless, the company is gaining in Software and Services revenues which increased 2% and 3%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter. This represented increase in Cloud, Professional Services and Software maintenance revenues as well as hardware maintenance growth.However, the weakness in the ATM market has been a potent threat for the company, which in turn negatively impacted the margins and the guidance for full-year 2017.Going forward, we believe the company’s focus on its core competencies and streamlined cost structure to be beneficial.Zacks Rank and Key PicksNCR carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some of the better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Intel Corp.

641,IPGP,"New highs have become commonplace in today’s bull market. Time and time again, investors have profited by jumping on a stock as it hits a peak, only to ride that stock even higher. And with an upbeat global economy and strong earnings growth throughout many sectors, this brand of momentum investing looks to continue its winning ways as we approach the New Year.Of course, there are several global and domestic political risks that threaten Wall Street’s current overall strength, and buying individual stocks as they hit new highs is inherently slightly risky. But momentum investors believe that that once a trend is established, it is more likely to continue in that direction than to reverse the trend—and that could still be a winning strategy right now.With all of this said, today marked another busy morning for new-high stocks. In fact, according to Barchart.com, at least 62 companies touched a new all-time high during Tuesday morning trading. Of these, several are also sporting strong Zacks Ranks, making them the perfect candidates for investors looking to find breakout stocks.Check out these buy-ranked stocks that just hit all-time highs today:1.       Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET  -  Free Report)Arista Networks is a provider of cloud networking solutions for datacenter and cloud computing environments. The stock surged as much as 1.63% in morning trading, touching a new all-time high of $228.84 per share in the process. After crushing our consensus estimate for earnings by nearly 34% in its most recent quarter, Arista has been on fire. ANET is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). 2.       DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report)Detroit-based utility giant DTE Energy has emerged as one of the strongest stocks in its industry. Shares have been consistently rising for two years, and the stock has been near its all-time peak for most of the last month. On Tuesday morning, DTE touched a new high of $115.18 per share, which was about 0.81% higher than Monday’s closing price. The stock remains a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). 3.       Cognex Corporation (CGNX  -  Free Report)Cognex is a world leader in the machine vision industry. CGNX has been red-hot in 2017, and heading into the day, shares were up more than 116% on the year. That strong momentum continued in morning trading, with Cognex shares touching a new all-time high of $140.94 in morning trading. That intraday peak marked a 2.50% climb from Monday’s close. Cognex is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). 4.       TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report)The massive data breach suffered by rival Equifax has shifted more attention to TransUnion, at a time when the company was already performing well.

642,IPGP,"IPG Photonics Corporation (IPGP  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of $2.11 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 32 cents and advancing 64.1% year over year. The figure was better than management’s guidance of $1.70-$1.90.Foreign exchange transaction losses negatively impacted earnings by a nickel, which was fully offset by 6 cents of tax benefits. The strong growth was driven by higher sales, which surged 47.6% from the year-ago quarter to $392.6 million. The figure outperformed management’s range of $350-$370 million.Materials processing sales jumped 52.1% year over year and accounted for approximately 95.4% of total sales driven by strength in cutting and welding applications. Record lasers sales for 3D printing applications also drove growth. IPG Photonics Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  IPG Photonics Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | IPG Photonics Corporation Quote IPG is benefiting from strong adoption of fiber lasers over conventional lasers and non-laser cutting and welding equipment. According to management, higher productivity and lower operating cost of fiber lasers are accelerating the replacement of the installed base of CO2 and YAG laser systems.The year-over-year sales growth was driven by robust performance in China, Europe, Turkey and Korea with strong demand across a variety of applications and industries. Apart from strong order flow, the growth benefited from strong execution in capacity planning, production & operations management, customer credit management and global administration.IPG’s stock has returned 115.7% year to date, substantially outperforming the 76.2% rally of the industry.  China Continues to Drive GrowthChina reported strong sales, which were up 70% year over year and represented almost 45% of total sales. The robust performance was driven by strong sales of high-power CW lasers for cutting and welding applications. The company also benefited from strength in QCW laser sales primarily related to consumer electronics welding applications. IPG Photonics Corporation Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth)  IPG Photonics Corporation Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) | IPG Photonics Corporation Quote Sales in Europe and the United States increased 50% and 13%, respectively, whereas it declined 10% in Japan from the year-ago quarter. Sales in Japan were hurt by softness at the company’s largest customer.Europe benefited from strength in high-power lasers for cutting and welding applications, medium-power lasers for 3D printing applications, pulsed laser sales for marking and engraving as well as high-power pulsed lasers for marking, engraving, and solar cell manufacturing.Sales in the United States benefited from robust systems and high-power pulsed lasers sales partially offset by lower sales of high-power lasers into automotive welding applications. ILT acquisition contributed meaningfully to domestic sales.However, sales hit record level in Turkey on rapid growth in high-power lasers for cutting applications and accessories sales. Korea also reported robust sales on the back of solid performance from automotive and battery welding, marking and engraving and applications related to semiconductor, electronics and display manufacturing.Product DetailsSales of high-power CW lasers soared 59.6% year over year to $244.2 million driven by rapid growth in cutting and welding applications. Management noted that demand for 6 kilowatt and above lasers for cutting applications continued to gain significant momentum.Sales of QCW lasers surged 103.8% year over year to $29.5 million driven by strong growth in fine welding for consumer electronics applications.Medium-power CW laser sales increased 21.6% as increased demand for fine welding and 3D printing offset softness in cutting. Management noted that within the lower-end cutting applications, many OEMs are moving away from medium-power to high-power lasers at 1 and 1.5 kilowatt.Pulsed lasers sales grew 15.8% year over year. Sales of new green and high-power pulsed lasers across a diverse set of applications drove results. Sales of low-power pulsed lasers for marking and engraving applications were up by a low single-digit percentage.Other products sales increased 31.5% year over year due to strong sales growth in systems and accessories.Operational DetailsIPG posted gross margin of 57.2%, which expanded 280 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis and surpassed the management’s range of 50-55%. This was primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiency, cost reductions and favorable product mix that fully offset lower average selling price (ASP).As a percentage of sales, sales & marketing expenses decreased 50 bps, R&D expenses decreased 120 bps and G&A expenses decreased 80 bps.As a result, operating income expanded 540 bps from the year-ago quarter to 40.8%.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowDuring the third quarter, IPG generated $164 million in cash from operations and used $56 million to finance capital expenditures.

643,IPGP,"VeriSign Inc. (VRSN  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results, which also improved year over year.On a non-GAAP basis, the company posted earnings of $1 per share, up 7.5% from the year-ago quarter. Earnings beat the Zack Consensus Estimate of 98 cents.Revenues increased 1.7% year over year to $292.4 million and came slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $291.8 million. The year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by an increase in domain name registrations in the United States as well as in international markets.Shares of VeriSign have gained 43.5% year to date, significantly outperforming the 25.5% rally of the industry it belongs to.Quarter DetailsIn the quarter, domain name registrations for .com and .net together grew 1.2% year over year to 145.8 million. In absolute terms, domain name registrations grew 1.47 million year over year. VeriSign processed 8.9 million new domain name registrations for .com and .net, an increase from 8.63 million processed in the year-ago quarter.Per management, during the quarter, 59% of the revenues came from U.S. customers while international customers contributed the rest.For the reported quarter, the exact renewal rate figures will be available after 45 days from Sep 30, 2017. The company estimates it to be 74.3% compared with 73% in the year-ago quarter. It provided renewal rate for the second quarter of 2017, which came in at 74% compared with 73.8% in the year-ago quarter.MarginsVeriSign reported non-GAAP operating income of $195.2 million compared with $187.6 million in the prior-year quarter. The company’s non-GAAP operating margin was 66.7% in the quarter, up 140 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter.Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $214.1 million, up 4.6% from the year-ago quarter.Other Financial DetailsExiting the quarter, the company’s cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) were approximately $2.4 billion compared with $1.81 billion as of Jun 30, 2017.Operating cash flow in the quarter was approximately $175 million while free cash flow came in at $153 million. Moreover, in the first nine months of 2017, the company generated $503.6 million of cash flow from operational activities.VeriSign repurchased 1.5 million shares for $147 million in the quarter. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had $622 million available under its current share repurchase program.GuidanceVeriSign raised its full-year guidance. The company now expects revenues in the range of $1.161-$1.166 billion, up from the prior guidance of $1.155-$1.165 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 revenues is $1.16 billion.The company increased its non-GAAP operating margin guidance range to 65%-65.5% from the earlier guidance of 64.5%-65.25%.Capital expenditure is now anticipated to increase in the range of $45-$55 million compared with the previous guidance of $40-$50 million.Management expects an increase in operating expenses related to sales and marketing in the fourth quarter.VeriSign also raised its domain name base growth rate guidance for 2017. The company now anticipates the same to grow between 2.8% and 3.1%, up from its earlier forecast of 2% to 2.75%.Going ahead, for the fourth quarter, VeriSign projects domain name base registration to increase in the range of 0.4 million to 0.9 million.Our TakeVeriSign holds a prime position in the highly regulated .com and .net domain industry. The company continues to benefit from strong demand for domain name registrations in the United States as well as in international markets.Rise in bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading is also contributing to an increase in domain name registrations, which is a tailwind for the company. Furthermore, the agreement with ICANN, under which the annual fee for a .net domain name registration will be increased from $8.20 to $9.02, effective Feb. 1, 2018, will drive the company’s top-line going ahead.Moreover, VeriSign’s focus to utilize its robust cash flows to return value to investors through share buybacks is a positive.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to sales and marketing remain primary headwinds.Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider VeriSign carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

644,IPGP,"Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) recently signed “an unprecedented global, multi-year” deal with Universal Music Group (UMG) that will allow users to post videos with music from the record label on its platform as well as on Instagram and Oculus.Facebook has been in talks with content providers like record companies for licensing for a long time before sealing the deal with UMG, which became the first major label to license recorded music to the company.The collaboration is expected to increase user engagement. Reportedly, “the agreement is intended to serve as a foundation for a strategic partnership roadmap that will deliver new music-based experiences online.”Going forward, the company also plans to bring more “music-based products” to platforms including Messenger in order to make the conversations more engaging for users.Earlier this month, Facebook launched a video editing tool called Sound Collection that offers users a number of free high-quality audio tracks and sound effects for creating videos and sharing them on Facebook and Instagram.We believe these initiatives will significantly drive Facebook’s user base and sustain its share price momentum. Notably, Facebook has gained 54% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 23.2% rally.Rising Online and Mobile Video ConsumptionFacebook has been extending its presence in the online video market with its growing user base and rising engagement levels. We note that social networking platforms are widely used for consuming music. Record labels therefore do not leave an opportunity to promote their albums on such platforms.The U.S. music industry witnessed 15% growth in the first half of 2017, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, while global sales grew 5.9%, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.Furthermore, the online video market (especially music) is expected to grow exponentially going ahead. Per research firm ZenithOptimedia, online video viewing will increase 20% this year, driven by 35% increase in mobile video viewing. The report also states that by 2019, mobile videos will represent 72% of total online video viewing compared with 61% in 2017.Growth in video consumption has translated to rising video advertisements as advertisers find this to be the most lucrative medium to attract the audience. Notably, online video is likely to represent 31% of worldwide ad spending by 2019, per ZenithOptimedia.The firm also states that in a lot of markets, after Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube, Facebook is the second largest provider of video content.Facebook has been improving its scope of monetization through video views on its platform. We expect music videos to form a major chunk of views, generating a significant portion of ad revenues.Facebook, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Facebook, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Facebook, Inc. QuoteThere have also been speculations regarding Facebook’s entry into the music streaming market like its peer Apple Inc. and Spotify. However, nothing has been confirmed yet.Meanwhile, it seems that YouTube, which also signed a deal with UMG recently, is up for more challenging times ahead as Facebook gears up to strengthen its relationship with record labels.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderFacebook carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are IPG Photonics Corporation (IPGP  -  Free Report) and NetApp Inc.

645,IPGP,"Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) announced on Thursday that Eric Schmidt will be stepping down from the post of executive chairman in January, after his 17-year long tenure with the company.However, Schmidt will continue to be part of Alphabet’s board of directors and will also serve as an advisor on technical and science issues to the company. The company expects its board to appoint a new non-executive chairman at its next meeting in January.Schmidt played an instrumental role in the transformation of the search engine startup to the company that it is today. Schmidt led from the front when the company was taken public in 2004. He managed several product initiatives including Android, and also played a crucial role in the massive 2015 corporate restructuring, following which Google became a business unit of the holding company, Alphabet. His role as an executive chairman was to often put the company's accomplishments in front of the world and negotiate with governments on regulatory matters.In his statement Schmidt said, ""The time is right in Alphabet’s evolution for this transition.”Notably, shares of Alphabet have gained 35.2% year to date, outperforming the 26.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.Lawsuits Against AlphabetAlphabet also faced some turbulence during Schmidt’s tenure. Major tech companies were hit by a class action lawsuit in 2011 in which executives of these companies, including Schmidt and the then CEO of Apple, Steve Jobs, were accused of conspiring to keep wages down by not recruiting one anothers’ employees. A settlement of $415 million was reached to resolve the lawsuit.Recently, Alphabet faced lawsuits alleging pay discrimination against women. The company is also facing some antitrust actions in Europe.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAlphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), IPG Photonics Corporation (IPGP  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) are some of the better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector.

646,IPGP,"The technology sector has been one of the best performing sectors this year so far. However, not all the companies have fared that well. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report) is one of them.IBM has been witnessing a year-over-year decline in its top-line over the last several quarters. The inconsistent revenue growth trajectory, slow transition to cloud, increasing competition and sluggish IT spending have been the major reasons behind the company’s dismal performance.So far this year, IBM has lost 8.5% against Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK  -  Free Report) gain of 32.3%.What’s Hurting the Company?IBM is under tremendous pressure due to its time consuming business model transition, which is negatively impacting results. Despite significant investments, the company is yet to gain a dominant position in the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Hosted private cloud market. Intensifying competition in most of the markets is a major concern for the company.Contrary to expectations IBM’s focus on becoming a major force in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) market with Watson has failed – at least in the near term.Moreover, IBM’s continuing investments and pricing pressure related to its legacy hardware business is a concern. We believe the underperforming legacy business segments will remain an overhang on the company’s bottom line till the business model transition, which is heavily time-consuming, is completed.IBM Corporation Revenue (TTM) International Business Machines Corporation Revenue (TTM) | International Business Machines Corporation QuoteIs Any Turnaround Possible in the Near Term?Although the company is undertaking a number of initiatives to counter the aforementioned challenges, its impact on quarterly results has not been significant.We believe that IBM’s significant investments in “Strategic Imperatives” – cloud computing, mobile, cognitive technologies and AI – will take some more time to deliver credible top-line growth.   IBM has also undertaken a number of blockchain initiatives to grab the growth opportunity in the industry. However, all the efforts are at a very nascent stage and will take time to contribute meaningfully to top-line growth. This is a significant headwind in our view.Moreover, Warren Buffett led conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s, the company’s largest shareholder, lowering of shares in IBM by 32% to 37 million in May raised concerns among investors and impacted the share price movement.(Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.)We know that Buffett is a value investor as he mostly considers the intrinsic value (fair value of a stock calculated by its future earnings power) of a stock for making investment. His investment apart from value also includes understanding of the business, competitive advantages and capable management. Thus, the loss of Buffett’s confidence doesn’t bode well for the company.We believe that the company’s turnaround efforts will yield results in the long run though its impact on near-term results will likely remain muted.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderIBM carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include IPG Photonics Corp.

647,IPGP,"LitePoint, a subsidiary of Teradyne, Inc. (TER  -  Free Report), recently launched the industry's first fully-integrated 5G millimeter wave test solution, IQgig-5G. The test solution simplifies design validation for 5G product developers and speeds up product development.The system works with both 28 GHz and 39 GHz 5G millimeter wave bands and its multiple RF ports streamline measuring signals with both horizontal and vertical polarizations. The test solution also makes RF measurements easier for both conducted and over-the-air.As the world advances toward 5G millimeter wave spectrum, there is a need to develop and understand the performance of 5G millimeter wave products, spanning from semiconductors to end systems. The test solution presently supports only pre-5G modulation standard but can be upgraded to support 3GPP NR standards. The initial 3GPP ‘5G’ is not expected to be available until 2019 and its widespread commercial usage is not expected before 2020s.Notably, shares of Teradyne have gained 69.3% year to date, outperforming the 48.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.5G Millimeter Wave Spectrum5G millimeter wave spectrum is expected to enhance mobile broadband speeds and support extensive mobile data usage. The spectrum is considered by many organizations and researchers and can be used for high-speed wireless communications to deliver faster, higher-quality video, and multimedia content and services.The need for high frequency spectrums is on the rise as the new generation of computers and smartphones demand higher data usage. Ted Rappaport, founding director of NYU Wireless, expects mobile data traffic to rise 53% every year in the near future. As more devices support 5G, the need for LitePoint’s test solutions will grow thereby boosting Teradyne’s  top line growth.Teradyne, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Teradyne, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Teradyne, Inc.

648,IPGP,"Flex Ltd. (FLEX  -  Free Report) reported fiscal second-quarter 2018 non-GAAP earnings of 27 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents but declined 3.6% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues increased 4.4% from the year-ago quarter to $6.27 billion and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.1 billion. The impressive results can be attributed to the company’s focus on Industrial & Emerging Industries (IEI) and High Reliability Solutions (HRS) segments which improved diversification.Shares of Flex have gained 20.7% year to date, significantly outperforming the 15.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Quarter DetailsCommunications & Enterprise Compute (CEC) revenues declined 10% from the year-ago quarter to $1.9 billion. This segment generated $43 million in adjusted operating profit and recorded 2.2% adjusted operating margin. Lower profitability was due to 10% lower revenue levels. Growth in cloud data center business was overshadowed by a decline in legacy businesses.However, management noted the CEC segment to be a strong contributor to free cash flow. The segment also provides support to the company to venture into new markets such as digital health and autonomous vehicles.Consumer Technologies Group (CTG) revenues improved 5% from the year-ago quarter to $1.8 billion. This division produced $31 million in adjusted operating profit, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 1.8%, missing the guided range of 2% to 4%. In spite of incurring operating losses due to its strategic partnership with Nike, the segment saw a sequential 60 basis points (bps) improvement in margins driven by higher revenues and benefits from end-of-life programs.Management noted that apart from increased operating expenses due to the Nike partnership, the company’s launch of several big programs this quarter resulted in higher startup costs, which hurt its bottom line. Moreover, continuing investments in designing and innovation related to the “Sketch-to-Scale” portfolio transition kept margins under pressure.However, management is hopeful that once the integration is completed and challenges of the partnership addressed, profits will increase.Revenues from the IEI segment were $1.5 billion, up a robust 17% year over year. This division reported $51 million in adjusted operating profit and 3.5% adjusted operating margin. Although various new customer programs in the home and lifestyle and energy businesses drove results, initial startup costs weighed on margins.HRS revenues rose 16% from the year-ago quarter to $1.2 billion. The segment reported $92 million in adjusted operating profit, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 8%.Flex reported non-GAAP operating income of $188.3 million compared with $196.9 million in the prior-year quarter. The company’s non-GAAP operating margin was 3% in the quarter compared with 3.3% in the prior-year quarter.The company’s investment deconsolidation in Elementum resulted in a gain of $144 million in the quarter.Selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 12.4% from the prior-year quarter to $274 million, reflecting higher design and engineering costs. Management stated expansion in innovation and design centers and cost incurred for investments and acquisitions as the major reasons for an increase in expenses.Other Financial DetailsIn the quarter ended Sep 30, 2017, cash & cash equivalents were $1.37 billion, while total debt was $3.00 billion.Flex generated net cash from operations of $280.8 million and free cash flow of $34 million.The company bought back 4.4 million shares worth $71 million in the second quarter.GuidanceFor third-quarter fiscal 2018, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $6.3–$6.7 billion.Adjusted operating income is anticipated in the range of $205–$235 million. Management expects adjusted earnings in the range of 28–32 cents per share.Management expects IEI and HRS segments to continue with the robust double-digit growth in the December quarter.

649,IPGP,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and IPG Photonics Corporation (IPGP  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because IPG Photonics is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for IPGP in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.80 cents per share for IPGP, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.79 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for IPGP, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.40% heading into earnings season.Why is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that IPGP has a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for IPG Photonics and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

651,IPGP,"Shares of Paychex, Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) touched a 52-week high of $67.88, eventually closing at $67.31 on Nov 30, 2017. The stock has gained 10.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the 6.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.The outperformance can be accredited to the company’s expanding customer base and its solid domain expertise in human capital management solutions for payroll, HR, retirement, and insurance services.Paychex’s sustained focus on investing in product development and enhancing sales force capabilities is helping it to add customers, thereby supporting revenue growth. Notably, revenues witnessed 5-year (2012-2017) CAGR of 7.2%. Higher revenues are likely to expand margins and increase profitability in the long run.Investors seems to be impressed with Paychex’s latest acquisition of HR Outsourcing Holdings, Inc. (HROI), which has provided it an opportunity to grab market share in the fast growing professional employer organization (PEO) industry. In our opinion, the acquisition is a strategic fit for Paychex as more and more companies are willing to use PEO services rather than creating their in-house HR management departments.The company’s initiatives to boost revenue growth through acquisitions are encouraging. Since its inception, the company has completed 14 acquisitions. These buyouts have helped  Paychex to expand its services as well as global reach, thereby boosting its revenues.Additionally, the industry in which Paychex operates has huge growth potential. The company mainly focuses on small- and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions. Paychex has nearly 605,000 payroll clients but the market is still highly untapped. Per the company, there are about 12 million businesses in the United States under its total addressable market, half of which are still untapped.Nonetheless, the company has been witnessing lower client retention in the last few quarters, which remains a concern for the near term. Also, current political uncertainty may adversely impact outsourcing decision making in the mid-market, thereby affecting Paychex’s overall growth prospect.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderPaychex currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), IPG Photonics Corporation (IPGP  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) are three better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector.

652,IPGP,"Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) announced a number of tools and initiatives to promote social good at its second Social Good Forum held in New York.Facebook’s continuous attempts to provide social security goes on to prove its new mission, which is to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.""Facebook’s VP of Social Good Naomi Gleit was quoted saying, “We are constantly inspired by all the good that people do on Facebook and are committed to continuing to build tools that help communities do more good together.”We believe these initiatives will help the company to improve its brand image and in turn draw more advertisers to its platform. Notably, Facebook has gained 52.3% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 26.5% rally.New InitiativesFacebook declared that it is forgoing the 5% transaction fee that it used to charge on donations made to non-profitable organizations via its platform. Facebook will however continue to levy 6.9% payment processing fees in addition to charging 30 cents per donation on individual-established fund raisers in the United States.Facebook also expanded its charitable tools to Canada, Australia, New Zealand and in European countries. Donations made to charitable organizations and individuals in Australia, New Zealand and Europe are free from any transaction fees per Facebook’s donation guidelines.A Facebook Donations Fund of annual $50 million is also being set up to provide financial assistance during times of natural disasters or other important fundraisers.The company also announced the launch of new Fundraisers API and Community Help API. The Fundraisers API will enable people to expand the reach of their Facebook fundraisers beyond the platform, thereby helping them to garner more support. Community Help API will provide disaster response organizations access to information related to the needs of crisis-affected people posted in Community Help section.Facebook is also expanding its blood donation campaign. It plans to roll out the service in Bangladesh early next year.The social networking giant also unveiled a new “Mentorship and Support” program that will connect users who require help from experts at non-profit organizations. For achieving this, the company is collaborating with iMentor for education related support and The International Rescue Committee for support on crisis recovery.Facebook is considered to have pioneered the concept of social networking, which is why it enjoys a first mover’s advantage in this market. We believe that with the launch of more such initiatives, the company will witness an uptick in user base and engagements that will enable it to draw more advertising dollars.Facebook, Inc.

653,IPGP,"It has been two decades since academics zeroed in on what we today call the “momentum effect” in stock markets. Momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks (i.e. stocks that have outperformed the market in recent times) to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing.It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift. Unlike the hugely followed Value or Growth styles, this strategy has barely anything to do with the fundamentals of a company, and instead works with the human penchant to extrapolate current trends into the future.At the core, momentum investing calls for investors to “Buy High, Sell Higher.”Why Does Momentum Strategy Work?There is a simple reason behind this. It works because we are humans!There’s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit, and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works. For instance, we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses, and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hoping that they will spring back to their original prices. On the other hand, investors sell their winners way too early.Furthermore, investors initially tend to under-react to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they tend to go with the flow and overreact, causing dramatic price reactions.These behavioral problems extend trends and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players. So basically, it’s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future.Momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs, i.e. before prices become rational again.Momentum versus Other StylesIt is worth reflecting over how the momentum strategy compares with other styles of investing over time. Recent research indicates that the size premium for small-cap stocks has shrunk dramatically since the 1980s and value premium has declined radically since the 1990s. Academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums (like size and value) becomes known to public, the investment world catches on and the premium gradually erodes.However, unlike other investment styles, momentum premium has stood the test of time, remaining remarkably robust ever since it was identified by financial academics in the 1990s.Chase the AlphaMomentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over long periods of time and across markets. So obviously, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play.Here, we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers and make handsome gains. Our screen will help you take advantage of both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price, which will reflect some profit-taking in the stock.Screening ParametersPercentage Change Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This item selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get stocks that have appreciated the maximum over the past one year.Percentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10: From the 50 stocks, we choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a short one-week period.Zacks Rank #1: No matter what the market conditions are, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Momentum Score of B or better: A top Momentum Score cuts short the screening process as it takes into account several factors including volume change and performance relative to its peers. It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Stocks with a Momentum Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) handily outperform other stocks.Current Price greater than 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.Market Capitalization = Top #3000: We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000 in terms of market value to ensure strong liquidity.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000:A substantial trading volume shows that these stocks are easily tradable.Here are five of the nine stocks that made it through this screen:Kronos Worldwide, Inc.

654,IPGP,"Automatic Data Processing Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings on Jul 27. Notably, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 7.15%.In the last quarter, ADP delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.50%. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $1.31 per share increased 12% on a year-over-year basis. However, revenues of $3.41 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.43 billion but grew 5% on a year-over-year basis.Management now expects new business bookings to decline year over year in fiscal 2017. Earlier, the company anticipated new business bookings to remain flat on a year-over-year basis. The decline in management’s expectation primarily reflects growing competition from the likes of Paychex (PAYX  -  Free Report), Equifax and The Ultimate Software Group.We note that ADP has underperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 10.7%, the stock has returned 1.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderApart from stiff competition, we expect ADP’s investments in new initiatives to weigh on near-term earnings. Moreover, the divestiture of Consumer Health Spending Account (CHSA) and Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act (COBRA) businesses will impact top-line growth. Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Automatic Data Processing, Inc. QuoteNevertheless, we note that ADP holds a dominant position in the payroll processing and human capital management (HCM) market, primarily owing to its robust product portfolio. This is also evident from the recent recognitions which the company’s solutions have received.ADP’s GlobalView HCM was named to the Constellation ShortList for Global Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for the second consecutive quarter in April.In May, Frost & Sullivan honored ADP as the “2016 North American HR Management Solutions Company of the Year”.ADP’s Accountant Connect solution also received “2017 CPA Practice Advisor Tax and Accounting Technology Innovation Award” in Jun.We believe that the company’s product strength will continue to drive higher revenue per client and customer retention ratio in the going-to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that ADP is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: ADP’s Earnings ESP is +2.99%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 69 cents is couple of cents higher that the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

655,IPGP,"Intel Corp (INTC  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27. Notably, the company has a positive record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 6.95%.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.54%. Non-GAAP earnings of 66 cents per share surged 22% from the year-ago quarter but declined 16.5% sequentially.Strong year-over-year earnings growth was driven by 7.2% increase in revenues, which totaled $14.80 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.81 billion. Revenues decreased 9.6% sequentially.Intel guided second-quarter 2017 revenues of around $14.4 billion (+/-$500 million), almost flat sequentially and up 6% year over year. Excluding Intel Security Group business, revenues are projected to grow 11% on a year-on-year basis.The non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be around 63% (+/-2%), flat sequentially. R&D and MG&A expenses are anticipated to amount at around $5.2 billion. Intel Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Intel Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Intel Corporation QuoteOperating income is projected to be approximately $3.9 billion, while EPS is anticipated to be 68 cents (+/- 5 cents), up 15% on a year-over-year basis.Despite the positive guidance, Intel’s shares have underperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis primarily due to rising competition in most of the markets. While the index gained 10.7%, the stock has returned a negative 4.2%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayWe note that Intel’s growing focus into areas with better growth prospects, such as the artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous car and Internet of Things (IoT) businesses are key catalysts. In this regard, the acquisition of Mobileye is a significant development that will boost its presence in the autonomous vehicle market.However, increasing competition in the data center market is a headwind. Reportedly, Microsoft is collaborating with ARM chip-makers, Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Cavium, to design ARM-based servers. The server will run a major part of the company cloud services going ahead. Additionally, increasing competition from AMD's recently launched EPYC server chip is also a threat.  Market research firm, Gartner, stated that worldwide server shipments decreased 4.2% year over year to 2.60 million units in the first quarter of 2017. Moreover, worldwide server revenues declined 4.5%. Data from another market research firm, IDC, showed that although server shipments increased 1.4% year over year to 2.21 million units, worldwide server revenues declined 4.6%.Sluggish high-end server sales affected results. IDC noted that, “server market growth continues to slow down with most hyperscale service providers waiting until the second half of the year for deployment of Intel's new Skylake processors.”The data center business now comprises a major part of Intel’s overall business (29% of 2016 revenues). Hence, a decline in the server shipment and revenues amid intense competition is a major concern for the company.Notably, Intel recently launched its Xeon (formerly Skylake) scalable ‘Purley’, a next-generation server processor platform. However, it is unlikely to have much positive impact on top-line growth in the going-to-be-reported quarter.We also note that the top-PC makers like HP, Lenovo, and Asus are set to launch PCs based on Qualcomm’s ARM-based Snapdragon processor, which intensifies competition for Intel. Moreover, declining PC shipment is a major concern for the company.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Intel will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Intel’s Earnings ESP is currently -1.47%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 67 cents is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Intel carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

660,IPGP,"Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) announced recently that it is expanding its artificial intelligence (AI) efforts to identify users with suicidal motives by recognizing patterns in their posts and live videos. The company is set to roll out this feature globally except the European Union where data protection rules are different.In March this year, the company started an experiment to determine suicidal intent in text-based posts in the United States by using AI-based suicide prevention tools. The success of the test led the company to announce this global rollout.Regarding this latest initiative, although not much of technical details were shared, the company mentioned in a blog post that comments such as “Are you ok?” and “Can I help?” will act as signals.The company is also increasing the number of reviewers for such posts. AI will help the reviewers from the Community Operations team to prioritize the most serious ones. Reviewers can also escalate such issues to local authorities apart from directing users to connect to support organizations or friends.Facebook has been working on suicide prevention for a really long time. The company collaborated with suicide prevention groups like Forefront, Now Matters Now, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Save.org to provide users with suitable help.We believe these initiatives will significantly drive user dependence and reliability on Facebook, draw more users to the platform and thereby sustain its share price momentum. Notably, Facebook has gained 59.1% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 27.3% rally.Building a Better Community With AIFacebook’s attempts to protect the community indicate its new mission, which is to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.""The company continues to invest heavily on developing AI technology as CEO Mark Zuckerberg considers AI to have “different strengths than people do.”Facebook set up an AI research center in Montreal, Canada in September. The company already has a research facility in Paris. In addition to these, Facebook operates two more AI focused labs in Menlo Park, CA and in New York City.The company strongly believes that technologies like AI will revolutionize the future and emerge as big business opportunities. Research firm IDC estimates that AI will be worth close to $46 billion by 2020.A few months back, Facebook deployed AI technology to contain terrorist activities on its platform. Facebook said that it will deploy advanced algorithms that can detect images, text, pages or groups that seem to promote extremism and take it down.The company also used AI to look at satellite images to locate survivors and victims in Hurricane Maria affected areas so as to provide them with connectivity and other resources.On the last conference call, management said that after being criticized for its Live feature where suicide-related activities were also streamed, the company made investment in AI tools, increased the number of reviewers working on it and brought down the time taken to review those Live videos to less than 10 minutes. The company expects to reduce the time further.The CEO was quoted saying, “Our community continues to grow and our business is doing well. But none of that matters if our services are used in ways that don't bring people closer together. We're serious about preventing abuse on our platforms. We're investing so much in security that it will impact our profitability. Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits.”We therefore believe, Facebook’s efforts in AI technologies bode well for long-term growth but the high investments remain an overhang on margins.Facebook, Inc.

661,IPGP,"VeriSign Inc. (VRSN  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27. Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 86 cents that were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, the company has a mixed earnings surprise track record for the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3.80%.Revenues increased 2.4% year over year to $288.6 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $286.6 million.We believe increasing domain name registrations and strong demand for VeriSign’s cyber security products, following ransomware attacks such as WannaCry and Petya, are key growth drivers.Cyber security companies like VeriSign are doing well because of increasing instances of cybercrimes. Its shares have massively outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 10.7%, the stock returned 30.1%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayVeriSign holds a prime position in the highly regulated .com and .net domain industry. The renewal of the .com contract and price hikes for the .com and .net domain names are likely to drive VeriSign’s top line.According to the company’s latest “The Domain Name Industry Brief”, domain name registrations across all top-level domains (TLDs) have signaled a positive trend, with 1.3 million domain name registrations being added in the first quarter, an increase of 0.4% sequentially and 3.7% year over year. Thus, an increase in domain name registrations coupled with price hikes for the .com and .net domain names will drive revenues in our view.The company is also benefiting from strong gTLD prospects, international expansion through IDNs, investments in intellectual properties as well as growth opportunities in the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) security market. It has significant growth opportunities in the network security products space as well.Moreover, the divestiture of iDefense Security Intelligence Services has helped the company to focus on core operations, which will have a positive impact on results.Going by the sequential decline trend in marketing expenses over the last few quarters, we expect it to remain muted in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Notably, management plans to defer marketing spend to the latter half of the year.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization is a concern.VeriSign, Inc.

662,IPGP,"Scientific Games Corporation (SGMS  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 24 before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 24.32%. It has delivered negative earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average negative earnings surprise of 2.99%.However, we note that Scientific Games’ shares impressive gain of 161.2% in the last one year, vastly outperformed the industry's advance of 19.7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWe believe that Scientific Games’ premium position in the gaming equipment space, along with the instant ticket and online lottery markets are significant catalysts. Further, the company’s innovative product lines and acquisition strategies also augur well. In Jun 2017, Scientific Games launched its first skill-based slot machine – Space Invaders – based on the popular classic arcade video game, and featured on the Blade s32 cabinet.Moreover, the company continues to win significant contracts in both the instant ticket and online lottery markets from both domestic and international authorities. Notably last month, it won a new, eight-year systems technology and services contract from the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency (MLGCA).Furthermore, the company continues to make strategic acquisitions that would accelerate top-line growth. In Apr 2017, Scientific Games acquired Spicerack Media, Inc. – creator of the successful Bingo Showdown social bingo mobile game app. Spicerack has complemented its stable of social casino games and mobile offerings.However, increasing investments for product development and strong competition is anticipated to hurt profitability. Moreover, the acquisitions are putting Scientific Games’ balance sheet under pressure.Scientific Games Corp Price and EPS Surprise  Scientific Games Corp Price and EPS Surprise | Scientific Games Corp QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Scientific Games is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

This represents a strong one-year return of approximately 89.9%, better than the Zacks categorized Lasers-Systems and Components industry’s 83.4% over the same period.The stock price momentum reflects IPG’s consistent execution driven by dominant position in the fiber lasers technology market, expanding product portfolio and accretive acquisitions. We note that the company has beaten estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 6.12%.Moreover, the company’s revenues have also beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the trailing 12 months.We also note that earnings estimates for fiscal 2017 have increased 4 cents to $5.95 over the last 30 days.

The company has a market capital of $8.35 billion and a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 19.67%.What’s Backing the Rally?Rising demand for laser technology from different sectors of the economy have expanded the scope of core material processing industries. IPG’s vertically integrated business model has helped it emerge as the strongest player in this field. Owing to the comparative advantages that it enjoys like power advantages, global scale, low cost and high quality, it has been instrumental in creating a strong barrier to entry.The company has shown rapid growth across core products, applications and geographies. Increased demand for its products from China and Eastern Europe was witnessed in the first quarter. Laser-cutter manufacturing and fiber-optic communications categories have also demonstrated strong gains.IPG expects revenues in the range of $320–$340 million for the second quarter of 2017. Earnings are projected in the range of $1.50–$1.70 per share.

This comes a day before its third-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings release which is scheduled to be announced after the market close.Notably, the stock has added 32.9% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the industry’s gain of 21.7%.The recent momentum in share price reflects investor confidence that the company may once again report splendid results for the third quarter. We note that the stock has an excellent track record of exceeding the quarterly earnings expectations. With respect to the earnings surprise history, Synopsys has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average surprise of 21.9%.Apart from this, the company’s impressive third-quarter outlook and upbeat fiscal 2017 guidance have also aided the year-to-date upward movement in share price. For the third quarter, the company expects revenues in the range of $685-$700 million and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 91-94 cents.For fiscal 2017, Synopsys raised its revenues and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range to $2.650-$2.670 billion and $3.24-$3.29, respectively, from $2.58-$2.61 billion and $3.21-$3.26.Other Factors Driving the StockWe believe that the company’s sustained focus on introducing new products, acquisitions and deal wins will continue to boost results, going ahead. Moreover, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company are likely to drive forthcoming results.We are also positive about Synopsys’ time-based license revenue model, under which, customers effectively rent the software, rather than paying a one-time upfront license fee. Hence this is a much more predictable revenue model, providing better visibility through a steady and recurring revenue stream.Additionally, the acquisition of Cigital and Codiscope will enable Synopsys to offer a comprehensive software security signoff solution to its customers.We are also encouraged by Synopsys’s endeavor to return shareholder value through continued share buybacks and dividends.

The figure was better than management’s guided range of $1.50–$1.70 per share.

The figure outperformed management’s guided range of $320–$340 million.IPG is benefiting from strong adoption of fiber lasers over conventional lasers and non-laser cutting and welding equipment. According to management, higher productivity and lower operating cost of fiber lasers are accelerating the replacement of the installed base of CO2 and YAG laser systems.The year-over-year sales growth was driven by robust performance in China and Europe, with robust demand across a variety of applications and industries. Apart from strong order flow, the growth benefited from strong execution in capacity planning, production & operations management, customer credit management and global administration.IPG stock has gained 68.5% year to date, substantially outperforming the 44.8% rally of the industry it belongs to.Segment DetailsMaterials processing sales increased 47.7% year over year and accounted for approximately 95.6% of total sales driven by strength in cutting and welding applications.

Management noted that demand for 6, 10 and 15 kilowatt lasers for cutting applications continues to gain significant momentum.Sales of QCW lasers increased 81.7% year over year to $29.5 million driven by growth in consumer electronics production and percussion hole drilling.Medium-power CW laser sales increased 10.6% as increased demand for fine welding, wafer inspection and 3D printing offset softness in cutting. Management noted that within the lower-end cutting applications, many OEMs are moving away from medium-power to high-power lasers at 1 kilowatt and above.Pulsed lasers sales grew 12% year over year. Sales of high-power pulsed lasers used in marking and engraving as well as ablative, cleaning and stripping applications increased more than 50%, partially offset by a decline in low-power pulsed laser sales.Other products sales increased 53% year over year due to strong sales growth in systems and accessories.Operational DetailsIPG posted gross margin of 55.9%, which expanded 140 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis but was in line with management’s guided range of 50–55%. This was primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiency, cost reductions and favorable product mix that fully offset lower average selling price (ASP).As a percentage of sales, sales & marketing expenses decreased 50 bps, R&D expenses decreased 30 bps and G&A expenses decreased 100 bps.As a result, operating income expanded 60 bps from the year-ago quarter to 38.2%.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowDuring the second quarter, IPG generated $82.3 million in cash from operations and used $21.8 million to finance capital expenditures.

Quarterly earnings also increased 13.8% from 87 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.On a non-GAAP basis, the company posted earnings of $1.05 per share, up 15.4% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 91 cents. The increase was primarily driven by a benefit of 6 cents per share owing to a pre-tax gain from the divestiture of its iDefense business and lower share count.Revenues marginally increased year over year to $288.6 million from $286.5 million and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $286.9 million as well. The year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by increase in domain name registrations in the U.S. as well as in international markets.Shares of VeriSign have gained 34% year to date, slightly underperforming the 39.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Quarter DetailsIn the quarter, domain name registrations for .com and .net together grew 0.8% year over year to 144.3 million. In absolute terms, domain name registrations grew 0.68 million year over year. VeriSign processed 9.2 million new domain name registrations for .com and .net, an increase from 8.6 million processed in the year-ago quarter.For the reported quarter, the exact renewal rate figures will be available after 45 days from Jun 30, 2017. The company estimates it to be 73.9% compared with 73.8% in the year-ago quarter.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise VeriSign, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | VeriSign, Inc. QuoteOther Financial DetailsExiting the quarter, the company’s cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) were approximately $1.81 billion compared with $1.79 billion as of Mar 31, 2016.Operating cash flow in the quarter was approximately $181 million while free cash flow came in at $171 million. Moreover, during the first half of 2017, the company generated $328.9 million of cash flow from operational activities.VeriSign repurchased 1.7 million shares for $150.5 million in the quarter and 3.5 million shares for $300.5 million during the first half of 2017. As of Jun 30, 2017, the company had $770 million available under its current share repurchase program.GuidanceBuoyed by the encouraging second-quarter results, VeriSign raised its full-year revenue and capital expenditure guidance. The company now expects revenues in the range of $1.155-$1.165 billion (mid-point $1.16 billion), up from the prior guidance of $1.145-$1.160 billion (mid-point $1.153 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 revenues is $1.16 billion.Capital expenditure is now anticipated to increase in the range of $40-$50 million compared with the previous guidance of $35-$45 million.The company reaffirmed its earlier non-GAAP operating margin guidance range of 64.5% to 65.25%.VeriSign also raised its domain name base growth rate guidance for 2017. The company now anticipates the same to grow between 2% and 2.75%, up from its earlier forecast of 1% to 2.5%.Going ahead, for the third quarter, VeriSign projects domain name base registration to increase in the range of 0.8 million to 1.3 million.Furthermore, the company announced a new agreement with ICANN under which the annual fee for a .net domain name registration will be increased from $8.20 to $9.02, effective Feb. 1, 2018. However, the other terms of the agreement remained unchanged.Our TakeVeriSign holds a prime position in the highly regulated .com and .net domain industry. The renewal of the .com contract and price hikes for the .com and .net domain names will continue to drive VeriSign’s top line. Also, we believe that gTLD prospects, international expansion through IDNs and investments in intellectual properties will boost results. The company continues to benefit from strong demand in the U.S. as well as in the international markets.Additionally, VeriSign has significant growth opportunities in the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) security market. VeriSign also has significant growth opportunities in the network security products space. Strong demand for VeriSign’s cyber security products, following ransomware attacks such as WannaCry and Petya is also a key growth driver. Also an increase in annual fee for a .net domain name registration will drive the company’s top-line results from next year onward.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to sales and marketing remain primary headwinds.Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider VeriSign carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The growth was driven by increases in the gaming and interactive segment revenues. However, unfavorable foreign currency exchange hurt revenues by $8 million.We note that Scientific Games has massively outperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. While the stock returned 143.9%, the industry gained 13.9%.Higher Replacements, Interactive Drove Revenues Gaming Segment (59.7% of total revenue) revenues increased 3.5% year over year to $457.2 million. The increase can primarily be attributed to growth in Gaming Machine sales, Gaming Systems and Table Products by 5.8%, 12.8% and 15.2%, respectively. This was partly offset by lower revenues in gaming operations that decreased 4.1%. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange also impacted revenues by $4.9 million.During the quarter, the company shipped 4,367 gaming machines to the U.S. and Canada. Replacement shipment increased 24% on a year-over-year basis to 3,773 units. International shipments increased 14% to 3,411 units including 54 units for new casino openings. Average Selling Price (ASP) increased from $16,859 to $17,550 in the reported quarter, reflecting favorable mix.The year-over-year growth in Gaming Systems revenues was driven by an increase in software and hardware sales, including shipment of new iVIEW4 player-interface display units. Moreover, Table Products benefited from growth in leased shufflers, proprietary table games, and progressives.Gaming Operations revenues fell due to decline in installed base of WAP, premium, and daily-fee participation gaming machines.Lottery Segment (26.4% of total revenue) revenues were down 0.8% year over year to $202.3 million. Instant Games and Services revenues declined 1% and 6.6% from the year-ago quarter, respectively. This was partially mitigated by 31.5% surge in Product Sales, which reflected higher U.S. and international hardware sales. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange impacted revenues by $2.2 million.Lower international revenues and unfavorable foreign currency exchange ($1.8 million) hurt Instant Games revenue growth in the reported quarter. Further, the decline in Services reflected lower year-over-year retail sales of multi-state games as well declining international revenues primarily attributable to an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $0.4 million.Interactive Group (13.9% of total revenue) revenues surged 28.1% year over year to $106.8 million, on the back of robust performance from Social Gaming–B2C and Other Interactive–B2B, which grew 31.8% and 9.8%, respectively.Social gaming B2C revenue growth exhibited robust performance from Jackpot Party Social Casino, as well as the success of more recent apps like the 88 Fortunes app (introdcuced in first-quarter 2017). The acquisition of Spicerack Media (completed in Apr 7) the provider of the Bingo Showdown app also contributed handsomely.Most recently, the company acquired Red7Mobile, a U.K.-based firm that expands talent base and technology for real-money gaming portion of the company’s Interactive business.Scientific Games Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Scientific Games Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Scientific Games Corp QuoteOperational DetailsAttributable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (AEBITDA) increased 12.5% to $314.8 million driven by higher revenues and increasing operating efficiency.

In the latest report ""Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Mobility Management Suites"", market research firm Gartner put MobileIron in the “Leader” quadrant for the seventh consecutive year, which shows strong growth potential for the company in this segment.We note that demand for the company’s cloud security solutions is quite strong among U.S. wireless carriers like Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report) and T-Mobile, which is likely to boost top-line growth. Management stated that MobileIron is the preferred internal vendor for the three largest wireless carriers in the U.S.The company’s products like MobileIron Access and MobileIron Cloud enjoy steady demand from governments and other high-end customers like National Institute of Standards and Technology, U.S. Department of Agriculture, United States Mint and Swedish tax authority.We also note that the company’s MobileAccess platform has been integrated into Concur, Tableau, Workday, Facebook and DropBox. The growing customer base and frequent contract wins remain tailwinds.Moreover, increasing demand from emerging markets (Middle East, Russia, Latin America) is also evident from the fact that the company has added more than 1,000 customers over the last few quarters.Notably, partnership with Lenovo in the first quarter is also helping MobileIron to expand its footprint in the desktop security market.MobileIron, Inc.
