I’m Kevin Cook, your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of behavioral economics.In part 1 of this “chautauqua,” I attempted to connect several ideas about technology and science in the light of what we have learned in the past 30 years or so about human nature and human behavior.Note the distinction between human nature and human behavior. Behavior varies widely across cultures where cooking, language, clothing, music, religion, technology, war and dozens of other customs have incredible diversity. But when we talk about human nature we mean the root causes and drivers of behavior that tend to be common among all humans as a species -- disease aside.These would include brain structure and function, genetic predispositions or “programs” (i.e., our software), and various theories and puzzles about evolutionary psychology that inspire scientists to work backwards and attempt to solve for X.In other words, cognitive, behavioral and social researchers ask questions like “Why do humans across cultures experience rage, jealousy, sorrow, joy, apathy, shame and laughter and what forces in our brains, our evolutionary past and our genetic make-up create these natural responses in social encounters?”And what about language -- why is that a universal human trait with many similarities of syntax across cultures that have never had contact? We could also add music to this list. Think about the work of Mickey Hart, long-time drummer for the Grateful Dead who has spent a lifetime sharing and preserving the indigenous rhythms of cultures around the world.If we have time, we’ll come back to Mickey and his brain on music, as he now seeks to find rhythm-based cures for Alzheimer’s.This propensity to ask questions about fundamental human nature, and our challenges to understand and agree on it, are why in Part 1 I thought it was important to begin a discussion about brains and weather with a biological understanding of human nature.I used an essay by Steven Pinker to help get us started. That essay was actually excerpts from his 2002 book The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature. You can find those excerpts and an interview with Pinker which condenses these ideas on the excellent thinking person’s website Edge.org at this link...A Biological Understanding of Human NatureAmen for Brain Scans!Now, why would the last 30 years of scientific research be more important than the previous 30 or 3,000 years in our quest to understand what we are, where we came from, and why we act the way we do? Because our knowledge of human nature and behavior has been vaulted exponentially since the explosion of research involving not only paleoanthropology and genetics, but almost as much by brain imaging. You need only listen to Dr. Daniel Amen on his own metamorphosis and life’s work to understand this.After the Army, Amen finished medical school and became a psychiatrist, the only medical field where doctors don't actually look at the organ they are treating. But he was also trained as an X-ray technician in the Army and developed a love for medical imaging. In 1991, he was able to marry to two fields and spent the next two decades building the world’s largest database of brain scans.His TEDx Talk from 2013 is called The most important lesson from 83,000 brain scans.I highly recommend you watch it. Make it your most important 15-minutes on YouTube this week.Professor Feynman Would Give Me an A+ in FailureThe physicist Richard Feynman used to say that the best way to learn something was to simply dive in and try to teach it to others. This has been a favorite strategy of mine most of my adult life and it has worked amazingly well for me in science, technology, history, and investing – especially after I fail at something.It's part of my Chaos Theory of Learning. Or as Bill Nye might call it, ""everything all at once.""So what was my failing? Part 1 of “Dopamine and the Weather” ran a little over-time at 51 minutes. As usual, sometimes I try to accomplish too much, try to connect too many ideas in a single podcast. As a result, I also did not do justice to dopamine in my explanation of it. I will repair that failing today in a moment.But first, in my defense for trying to string together too many ideas in a single episode, let me say that the threads of the fabric I was trying to connect were already there. They had just been ripped apart by modern technology and society, where we don't learn some of the most important connections in the physical and social sciences because every subject is taught as a separate course, with great detail, at the expense of deep and wide connections.This is our modern education system that seeks to create specialists first and foremost. That’s where the jobs are, after all. And most kids are too busy being distracted by TV -- or maybe now it’s social media and video games -- to get a real and full education in the sciences, even in college.And so, given this challenge, it takes me a while once I get started weaving and re-weaving the fabric of a full education.The ancients, from Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle to the Buddha, Lao Tse, and Confucius saw more connections and wholeness in knowledge and values than the average college graduate of the 20th century.I am holding out hope for the college grads of the 21st C as it truly is the century of biology and the life sciences. I know, I know… the computer geeks think it’s the century of artificial intelligence, but AI will just be a tool of genetic engineering.And even if I’ve got that wrong and the future looks much different than I imagine, it will be a wild and fun ride for those who are educated in the sciences -- and for those who learn to invest in the companies creating the future that uses AI, brain science, and genetic technologies.For these reasons, I am in investor in bleeding-edge companies like NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report), bluebird bio (BLUE  -  Free Report), and CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP  -  Free Report).So my work as a technology investor, stock market trail-blazer, philosophy teacher and science preacher is to keep putting the strings back together into a fabric that makes sense, has integrity (i.e., it’s truthful), and can be used to make your life incredibly rich.And hopefully we make some money along the way too!Three Cheers for Dopamine!In Part 1, we talked about how the anticipation of most types of rewards increases the level of dopamine in the brain and how many addictive drugs increase dopamine release or block its reabsorption into neurons following release, thereby creating addiction by interfering with normal dopamine transmission.What I didn’t do a good job with in explaining dopamine is how it is often activated simply by the anticipation of reward, and not merely the arrival of the reward and its corresponding pleasure. This gets more to heart of why dopamine makes us feel good and what role feeling good has beyond merely compelling us to eat or seek out a mate.And this is massively important because this puts dopamine at the center of attention, memory, motivation and, as we will see, learning. At the end of today’s episode I am going to give you a 5-part strategy to learn more, better, and faster than you ever thought you could.Some scientists call this whirlwind of neurobiology that dopamine is central to “incentive salience,” which is a fancy, theoretical description for a multidimensional process that concerns the regulating of desire, attention and its corresponding motivation. Once our desire is aroused and alerted, dopamine keeps the anticipation going.It’s all about the physiological excitement, the wanting of something rewarding and pleasurable that is nearby or available in the near future. This is what sustains our attention and drives our behavior when dopamine kicks in and tells our brains how important something is to us, how good we will feel once we have attained it because we feel good even before we have it.Before incentive salience became the textbook terminology, I simply learned about dopamine as “the attention drug” from the Harvard Medical School psychiatrist and brain expert (the two are not the same) Dr. John Ratey. I should be clear that Ratey didn’t call dopamine “the attention drug.” That’s just what I’m calling it now after doing more homework on it with his help.And now I've expanded that to call dopamine the ""attention, memory, learning"" drug.You can hear my whole discussion of this, including the emotional connections in our midbrain structures that add intensity to the attention-memory-learning loop, in the podcast.Plus, I share my 5-part strategy for learning more, better, and faster to achieve any goal of knowledge or skill. Or simply to be more productive and achieve your biggest goals.The Spark of Dr. RateyIn the podcast, I consult the excellent work of Dr. Ratey to help us get to a better understanding of our brain's own natural wonder drug. I shared some of the wonderful professor’s excellent 2001 book A User’s Guide to the Brain in an episode from August of 2017 titled What You See, and What You Get: The Neurology of Perception.Dr. Ratey is an expert on ADD and ADHD and so he knows as much about the attention and reward systems of the brain as anyone. Here's an example of his gift to communicate complex neuroscience in easy to grasp terms as he explains the Arouse, Orient, Detect, Execute loop of human consciousness...Once we are aroused and oriented, the reward and novelty system kicks in, governed by the mesolimbic pathway (a group of dopamine-containing neurons), which is a key driver of the limbic system. This system is integral not only to attention but to many other brain functions, notably the emotional and social brain.Detecting novelty and seeking reward are the two primary forces that direct the selection of where to focus our attention. The novelty system takes note of new stimuli. The reward system produces sensations of pleasure, assigning an emotional value to stimulus, which also marks it for memory. If, later, the same stimulus reappears, the memory of these visceral emotions provides a response, from joy to disgust, which then directs the individual to seek out a plan of action.Ratey also explains the interplay of dopamine with disorders like Parkinson's where ""no dopamine means no muscular coordination."" It also means a variety of non-motor neurological symptoms including cognitive problems with attention, planning, language, memory, and hallucinations, delusions, or even dementia.Followers of my portfolios at Zacks know that I have been a frequent investor in Acadia Pharmaceuticals (ACAD  -  Free Report), maker of NUPLAZID (pimavanserin), the first and only medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease psychosis.Run, Jump, Learn!Dr. Ratey's latest work has focused on exercise as the key ingredient of a healthy brain. In 2008 he published the book Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain.And in 2012, he gave a must-watch TED Talk titled Run, Jump, Learn! How Exercise can Transform our Schools.Earlier, I mentioned another creative teacher named Mickey Hart and his effort to help brains suffering from Alzheimer's. It appears that what Ratey is teaching with exercise, Hart has been doing with music at concerts where his cerebral lobes are connected to imaging equipment and displayed on massive screens overhead so that fans can see his “brain on music.”I have also been an investor in Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report), maker of two different drugs in clinical trials to treat Alzheimer's. Unfortunately, I sold my position recently as the stock fell below $300. The stock vaulted to $350 last week on positive data for the company's amyloid plaque-targeting drug.What threw me off was that almost every clinical trial in dementia-related R&D (about 99.6%, to be exact) has failed in the past decade or so. Even Pfizer ""threw in the towel"" recently in the search for new compounds.And neuroscientist dementia experts have always questioned the narrow focus from Biotech companies on amyloid proteins as the cause-and-cure battleground.Even now, this is a lot of excitement for a Phase 2 trial. The data was “statistically significant” evidence that BAN-2401, an antibody targeting the beta amyloid protein, can slow progression of the deadly disease in terms of both cognition and amyloid reduction. But most analysts are still predicting the final drug has only a 50 percent chance of getting approved after Phase 3 trials.Aducanumab is Biogen's other Alzheimer's drug currently in Phase 3 trials that we won't see data from until 2020. When Biogen had to expand the study size (number of patients) in trials of both drugs, that's when sentiment turned so sour on BIIB shares. So this was a review of BAN-2401 at 18 months after it was originally deemed unsuccessful after 12 months. This time, the 856 patients in the trial “demonstrated a statistically significant slowing of disease progression” compared to those taking a placebo.One company with a better than 50% chance of success with two drugs for Alzheimer's is probably an investment being reconsidered by many who sold the stock along with me below $300. As the manager of a model portfolio at Zacks called Healthcare Innovators, I posed this question to my subscribers last week...Should We Have Exposure to Alzheimer's?I think the answer is undoubtedly ""YES."" The most common form of dementia, it is believed by some experts that Alzheimer's could single-handedly bankrupt Medicare in a matter of decades. The degeneration of neural function is so rapid and debilitating that researchers will not give up the fight -- or the heavy R&D investment -- to find cures or even stabilizing treatments.But until a cure is found, make sure you and yours know about exercise, music, and my 5-part strategy for learning more, better, and faster as the prevention for Alzheimer's. I've nicknamed my strategy ""AMYL"" which is also the first 4 letters of amyloid, the protein plaque that is believed to drown neurons in Alzheimer’s.Be sure to check out the podcast to hear what AMYL stands for!Disclosure: I own share of NVDA for Zacks TAZR Trader and shares of BLUE and CRSP for Zacks Healthcare Innovators.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the Healthcare Innovators and TAZR Trader services.

1,BIIB,"AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced that a combination regimen of its blockbuster cancer drug, Imbruvica (ibrutinib), failed in a phase III study – DBL3001 – evaluating it as first-line treatment for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”). The drug failed to improve event-free survival (“EFS”) compared to current standard of care.DLBCL is an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”), a type of blood cancer, for which no new therapy has been approved for over a decade for treatment-naive patients. The R-CHOP (combination of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy is the standard of care for these patients.Shares of AbbVie slid 3.9% on Jul 11 following the news. The company’s shares have decreased 1.8% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 2.5%.The phase III study, which was conducted in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), evaluated Imbruvica in combination with R-CHOP versus R-CHOP and placebo together. The primary endpoint of the study was superiority in EFS. The combination regimen was investigated for the treatment of DLBCL patients who have non-germinal center B cell (“GCB”) or activated B-cell (“ABC”) subtypes. Patients with these two subtypes commonly have poorer treatment outcomes with greater unmet medical need.However, data from the study demonstrated improvement in a certain patient sub-population, which was clinically meaningful and may be analyzed further.The company will present detailed analysis of the study at a future scientific conference and publish it in a peer-reviewed medical journal.In a separate press release, AbbVie and its partner Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced the submission of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for label expansion of leukemia drug, Venclexta (venetoclax). The sNDA is seeking approval of Venclexta in combination with a hypomethylating agent (“HMA”) or with low-dose cytarabine (“LDAC”) for treating newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.The sNDA was filed based on data from two separate early stage studies evaluating Venclexta in combination with MHA and with LDAC.Venclexta’s label was expanded last month as monotherapy or in combination with Roche/Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) Rituxan for the treatment of relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma in second or later line settings.AbbVie Inc.

2,BIIB,"Positive data released by bigwig Biogen, Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) from a mid-stage study for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease created a stir in the biotech sector last week. Among other news, Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) reported positive data on a key pipeline candidate from a late-stage study while Axovant (AXON  -  Free Report) gained on yet another licensing deal.Recap of Important Stories:Biogen Soars on Positive Alzheimer’s Study Results: Shares of Biogen soared after the company reported encouraging top-line results from a mid-stage study on pipeline candidate BAN2401 for the treatment of early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). BAN2401, an anti-amyloid beta protofibril antibody, was being evaluated in a phase II study for AD. Biogen is developing BAN2401, a humanized beta amyloid antibody, in collaboration with Japan’s Eisai Co., Ltd. The candidate is being investigated to see whether it can slow the progression of memory problems associated with amyloid. Top-line results of the final analysis of the phase II study (n=856) demonstrated statistically significant slowing of disease progression on the key clinical endpoint (ADCOMS) after 18 months of treatment in patients receiving the highest treatment dose (10 mg/kg biweekly) of BAN2401 as compared to placebo. Meanwhile, treatment with this high dose for 18 months also led to reduction of amyloid beta accumulated in the brain. (Read more: Biogen's Alzheimer Disease Candidate Succeeds in Phase II).The positive results gave investors much reason to cheer as AD has always been a challenging market given the spate of study failures in recent times. So, the abovementioned results are deemed as important breakthrough by Biogen and Eisai in the AD market, raising hopes for a possible cure. Biogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Celgene Reports Positive Data on Thalassemia Drug From Late-Stage Study: Celgene Corporation and partner Acceleron Pharma Inc. (XLRN  -  Free Report) reported positive results from a second randomized, double-blind, multi-center clinical phase III study, BELIEVE, on pipeline candidate, luspatercept. The results show that luspatercept achieved a highly statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of erythroid response, which was defined as at least a 33% reduction from baseline in red blood cell (RBC) transfusion burden with a reduction of at least 2 units during the protocol-defined period of 12 consecutive weeks (from week 13 to week 24) compared to placebo. Moreover, luspatercept also met all key secondary endpoints of demonstrating statistically significant improvements in RBC transfusion burden from baseline of at least a 33% reduction during the period from week 37 to week 48.  Notably, this is the second positive phase III study for the candidate. Last month, both companies announced positive results from another phase III study, MEDALIST, wherein luspatercept met the primary and key secondary endpoints compared to placebo in patients with IPSS-R very low, low or intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with chronic anaemia. A third study, BEYOND, is also ongoing and evaluating luspatercept in non-transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia. (Read more: Celgene, Acceleron Report Positive Data on Thalassemia Drug).Meanwhile, Celgene also announced positive results from a phase III study, IMpassion130, wherein the experimental combination of Roche’s immuno-oncology drug Tecentriq plus Abraxane by the former compared with Abraxane monotherapy, significantly reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (PFS) in patients with metastatic or unresectable locally advanced triple negative breast cancer. Axovant Gains on Yet Another Gene Therapy Deal: Axovant Sciences’ shares gained after it announced a licensing agreement with Benitec Biopharma. Per the agreement, Axovant licensed exclusive global rights to an experimental Silence-and-Replace gene therapy program from Benitec Biopharma for the treatment of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). Axovant will obtain rights to AXO-AAV-OPMD, which will utilize proprietary Silence-and-Replace technology. AXO-AAV-OPMD is an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector gene therapy delivered via a one-time intramuscular administration, which both silences the mutant PABPN1 gene and replaces it with a functional copy. It is currently in preclinical development stage. Axovant plans to initiate a placebo-controlled clinical study in 2019. The candidate enjoys orphan drug status in both the United States and Europe for the treatment of OPMD.  Both companies have also entered into a research collaboration for the development of five additional gene therapy products in neurological disorders.  The agreement with Benitec will bolster Axovant’s pipeline of innovative gene therapies for serious neurological diseases. (Read more: Axovant, Benitec Gain on Licensing Deal for Gene Therapy)Idera Announces Termination of Merger Agreement With BioCryst: Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IDRA  -  Free Report) announced that the merger agreement with BioCryst Pharmaceuticals has been terminated as the stockholders of the latter voted against the same in a special meeting. Consequently, BioCryst will reimburse Idera $6 million in connection with the termination. Both companies had entered into a merger agreement in January 2018. While BioCryst gained on the news, shares of Idera slumped as the majority of Idera’s stockholders voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return   Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 4.09% over the last four trading sessions.

3,BIIB,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) was a star performer in Friday’s trading session, as the stock rallied as much as 23.1% but closed a little lower, rising 19.6% in the day’s trade. The massive gain for the biotech firm came from encouraging Phase 2 clinical study data for Alzheimer’s treatment.The final analysis at 18 months of the 856-patient Phase 2 clinical study of BAN2401 in early Alzheimer’s disease demonstrated statistically significant slowing in cognitive decline and reduction of amyloid beta accumulated in the brain, per the company press release. Amyloid beta or protein fragments are found in the brains of patients suffering from the disease and that some believe cause it.Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia and affects about 50 million people worldwide, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. Currently, there is no treatment for the disease or way to stop its progression. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved some medications to treat symptoms related to memory loss, language and other thought processes (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).As such, the result marks an important milestone in the companies' quest to tackle Alzheimer's disease. In fact, analysts welcomed the news as the first trial study for the drug was disappointing. This resulted in a risk-on environment, with many investors pulling in capital to this high growth and high beta sector.Other large-cap biotech stocks also gained with Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) up 3.3%, Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) up 2.5% and Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) up 1.9%. This suggests that investors are pinning their hopes on these fast growing companies, which could see smooth trading in the coming days.ETF ImpactThe smooth trading in the stock world also sent biotech ETFs space into green on the day. In particular, iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB  -  Free Report) stole the show climbing 3.8% o, followed by more than 3% gains each for First Trust Amex Biotechnology Index (FBT  -  Free Report), Invesco Dynamic Biotechnology & Genome ETF (PBE  -  Free Report) and VanEck Vectors Biotech ETF (BBH  -  Free Report).IBBThis fund provides exposure to 192 firms by tracking the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index, with Biogen taking the top spot at 9.1%. IBB is the most popular fund is the biotech space with AUM of $9.3 billion. Expense ratio comes in at 0.47%. IBB has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a High risk outlook (read: Why These Small Cap Biotech ETFs are Soaring).FBTThis fund follows the NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index, which measures the performance of companies in the biotechnology industry that are primarily involved in the use of biological processes to develop products or provide services. It holds about 30 securities in its basket with Biogen occupying the fifth position at 4.1% share and charges 56 bps in annual fees. It has accumulated $1.7 billion in its asset base and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a High risk outlook (read: 4 Sector ETFs That Crushed S&P 500 in 9-Year Bull Run).PBEThis fund provides exposure to 31 firms by tracking the Dynamic Biotech & Genome Intellidex Index. Biogen takes the top spot at 5.4% of assets. The ETF has managed $273 million in its asset base while charging 0.58% in expense ratio. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a High risk outlook (read: Pharma & Biotech ETFs Soar on Trump's Drug Plan).BBHThis fund offers exposure to 26 large biotechnology corporations by tracking the MVIS US Listed Biotech 25 Index. Here, Biogen is the fifth firm accounting for 5.8% share. BBH has amassed $427.6 million in its asset base and charges 35 bps in fees per year. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a High risk outlook.What Lies Ahead?The uptrend in the sector is likely to continue this year on tax reform, rising M&A and positive regulatory backdrop (read: Top-Ranked Sector ETFs to Buy for Q3).The new tax legislation has enticed large pharmaceutical companies to bring offshore cash back home at reduced tax rates of 8-15.5% instead of the prior 35%. The repatriated money led to an increase in mergers and acquisitions activity, share buybacks and dividends. Additionally, the slower growth in mature drugs has also compelled prominent biotechs to acquire smaller ones, even at hefty premiums, with promising pipelines.Further, Trump’s most-awaited plan to lower drug prices has added to the strength. If these were not enough, the sector’s non-cyclical nature is an advantage in the current market, which is ruffled by trade war fears between China and United States as well as geopolitical tension.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

4,BIIB,"Wall Street continues its winning streak for the second straight session with all three major stock indexes closing in positive territory on Friday. Investors’ ignored trade conflict between the United States and China as strong job additions for June indicated that fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain robust. This reduces concerns that United States is in the late stage of economic expansion offering little sweetness for market participants. Healthcare stocks gain the most as a record-breaking performance by Biogen lifted the entire sector.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 24,456.48, up 0.4%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.9% to close at 2,759.82. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,688.39, gaining 1.3% or 101.96 points. A total of 5.3 billion shares were traded on Friday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.98 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2.99-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, advancers had an edge over decliners by 2.32-to-1 ratio. The CBOE VIX decreased 10.7% to close at 13.37.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow rose 0.4% with 23 of the 30-stock index closed in the green while 7 traded in the red. During the trading, the blue-chip index rallied up to 164 points before closing at 99.74 points higher.The S&P 500 gained 0.9% led by 1.4% rise in Health care Select Sector (XLV) and 1.2% increase of Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK). Notably, all 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in positive territory. Within the healthcare sector, the share price of Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) increased 19.6% - its biggest gain since February 2004 – following announcement of positive results from a phase 2 trial of its Alzheimer's drug BAN2401.Likewise, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 1.3% or 101.96 points due to strong showing by the large tech stocks such as Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report). Facebook carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Robust Labor Market DataOn Jul 6, the Department of Labor reported that the U.S. economy added 213,000 non-farm jobs in June outpacing the consensus estimate of 196,000. Moreover, the Bureau of Labor Statistics revised April's job additions from 159,000 to 175,000 and May's from 223,000 to 244,000. Together, these two months added 37,000 more jobs than initially stated.Unemployment rate has increased from 3.8% in May to 4% in June. However, the rise in unemployment rate is primarily due to 0.2% increase in the labor force participation rate. In June, 601,000 Americans re-entered in the job market. Professional and business services sector added highest number (50,000) jobs followed by manufacturing (36,000), Health care (25,000) and construction (13,000).Notably, average wage rate rose marginally by 0.2% to 2.7% on a year over year basis. This was lower than the consensus estimate of 2.8%. However, low-wage hike indicates that hyper inflationary expectations are overblown which may enable the Fed to follow a steady state rate hike policy.Economic Data The Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit of the United States declined 6.6% in May. This figure is the lowest in 19 months. Trade deficit in May reduced to $43.1 billion from a revised $46.1 billion in April. May reading was also lower than the consensus estimate of $44.4 billion. Exports were up 1.9% to a record $215.3 billion while imports rose marginally by 0.4% to $258.4 billion.Weekly RoundupDespite trade-induced volatility, Wall Street ended up in appositive note in the first week of July.  All three major stock indexes closed in green reversing two straight weekly losses. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gained 0.8%, 1.5% and 2.4%, respectively. Markets closed slightly higher on Monday. The initial decline owing to uncertainty revolving around President Trump’s trade policy was reversed by a rally in tech stocks. This saw all the three indexes ending the day in positive territory after surviving a choppy trading session.Markets closed lower on Tuesday as a selloff in tech stocks pared earlier gains made by energy stocks. Trade war fears continued to haunt investors who felt jittery leading to huge selloffs. This saw all three major indexes ending in negative territory. However, on Thursday, markets closed higher lead by a rally in tech stocks. All three major indexes ended in the green.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

5,BIIB,"Several major biotech stocks rallied on Friday after Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) reported positive results from a Phase 2 study of its Ban2401 therapy, which seeks to reduce toxic amyloid proteins associated with cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease.Shares of Biogen were up more than 17% through afternoon trading hours Thursday. Japan’s Eisai Co. (ESALY  -  Free Report), a partner in the Ban2401 development, saw gains of nearly 20%. This momentum was enough to lift the rest of the biotech space, evidenced by the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index Fund (IBB  -  Free Report) adding about 3.2%.Biotech giants like Biogen, Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report), Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), and Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) have all underperformed the broader Nasdaq index over the past year, and the industry likely needed positive news to spark some optimistic trading.Speaking to The Street’s “Real Money” column, Atlantic Equities analyst Steve Chesney said that investors might finally be noticing the value of R&D efforts from these companies.“This is all about believing innovation and when a company like Biogen comes and reports positive clinical results for a disease like Alzehimer's the implied probability for success for the rest of the industry's pipeline moves a little bit higher,” Chesney told The Street.Celgene shares added about 2.3% to touch an intraday and one-month high of $82.34. Meanwhile, Amgen moved about 2% higher, and Gilead gained more than 3.3%.Biogen’s latest test included 856 patients with early Alzheimer’s disease. The company shared positive results from this group over a period of 18 months. Nevertheless, the trial is still only in Phase 2, and the challenges of Phase 3 and its additional regulatory hurdles are still looming.Still, Biogen will hope that it can commercialize Ban2401 in a timely manner. A new product would likely inspire positive analyst sentiment and lift growth prospects for the coming years.Within the past two months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Biogen’s 2018 earnings has dropped from $23.90 per share to $23.85 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 9.4%.Early estimates for 2019 have the company’s earnings pegged at $26.19 per share, which would represent a 9.8% increase from this year’s projected totals.BIIB is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Its “Medical – Biomedical and Genetics” industry is sitting in the bottom 38% of the Zacks Industry Rank.Want more market analysis from this author?

6,BIIB,"Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) has issued a positive opinion recommending approval of Cablivi (caplacizumab). A marketing authorization application (“MAA”) is seeking approval of the candidate for the treatment of patients experiencing an episode of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP), a rare blood-clotting disorder.This is the first drug to receive CHMP recommendation for the treatment of aTTP. A potential approval by the European Medical Agency, expected in the coming months, will help the drug gain market share with first-mover advantage in this indication.Sanofi added the candidate to its pipeline with the acquisition of Ablynx earlier in January.The stock has lost 7% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s decrease of 5.1%. The MAA was backed by positive data from phase II TITAN study and phase III HERCULES study evaluating Cablivi in combination with standard-of-care. Data showed that the combination achieved a significantly shorter time to platelet count response and significant reductions in aTTP-related death, recurrence of aTTP, or at least one major thromboembolic event.A follow-up study is evaluating Cablivi in patients who have completed the HERCULES study for long-term safety and efficacy of the candidate.A biologics license application is expected to be filed for Cablivi in the United States this year.We note that Genentech, a subsidiary of Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) and Biogen, Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) are developing Rituxan in partnership which is currently being evaluated in a phase II study for the treatment of aTTP.Sanofi is focused on strengthening its leadership in rare diseases and has made a few acquisitions this year so far in this regard. Albynx acquisition has also added an anti-Respiratory Syncytial Virus nanobody to Sanofi’s pipeline. Apart from Albynx, Sanofi acquired Bioverativ, adding a hemophilia candidate. The company also obtained global rights for fitusiran from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALNY  -  Free Report), which is being developed for the treatment of hemophilia A and B.Sanofi Price  Sanofi Price | Sanofi QuoteSanofi currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

7,BIIB,"Biogen Inc.’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) shares were up around 7% in after-market trading on Thursday on positive top-line data from a mid-stage study evaluating its pipeline candidate, BAN2401 for the treatment of early Alzheimer’s disease (AD).Biogen is developing BAN2401, a humanized beta amyloid antibody, in collaboration with Japan’s Eisai Co., Ltd. Amyloid is a protein that forms plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s. The candidate is being investigated to see whether it can slow the progression of memory problems associated with amyloid.Top-line results of the final analysis of the phase II study (n=856) demonstrated statistically significant slowing of disease progression on the key clinical endpoint (ADCOMS) after 18 months of treatment in patients receiving the highest treatment dose (10 mg/kg biweekly) of BAN2401 as compared to placebo. Meanwhile, treatment with this high dose for 18 months also led to reduction of amyloid beta accumulated in the brain. The study included five dose regimens.This data marked an important breakthrough by Biogen and Eisai in the challenging AD market which led to the share price increase. However, so far this year, Biogen’s shares have declined 6.2%, almost inline with the industry’s decline of 6.5% in the same time frame.   In late 2017, data announced from the same study failed to show early positive results, which raised investors’ concerns about the candidate’s chances of success. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee said that BAN2401 did not meet the criteria for success based on a Bayesian analysis at 12 months as the primary endpoint. With the study failing to show an early positive result, the company said that the blinded study, which is being conducted in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD or mild Alzheimer's dementia (collectively known as early Alzheimer’s disease) will continue with a comprehensive final analysis to be conducted at 18 months.Detailed data from the study is expected to be presented at future conferences.Alzheimer’s, a fatal illness that causes progressive decline in memory, has always been a highly challenging area with not much progress being made in spite of significant investments (both funds and resources).Several companies have failed to develop safe and effective treatment options for this deadly brain disease.Last month, Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and its Swiss partner AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) discontinued two late-stage studies on their Alzheimer’s disease candidate, lanabecestat, on recommendation of the IDMC. The IDMC said that the two studies were unlikely to meet their primary goals upon completion. Back in November 2016, Lilly said that it would not seek approval for its investigational AD treatment, solanezumab, following disappointing results from a late-stage study.In May this year, J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) halted development of atabecestat, its investigational BACE inhibitor, which was being developed for preclinical stage AD due to safety concerns.In February this year, Merck discontinued the second late-stage study evaluating its BACE inhibitor verubecestat for the treatment of prodromal AD as its success was unlikely. In February last year, Merck discontinued a late-stage study evaluating verubecestat for mild-to-moderate AD due to lack of efficacy.In January, Pfizer said it will end R&D efforts in the Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease areas. Long back, Pfizer had shelved its late-stage AD candidate, bapineuzumab IV after it failed two phase III studies.Despite the setbacks, several companies continue to invest heavily in developing Alzheimer’s disease treatments, given the high commercial potential in this market. Success in this area means huge returns, considering that more than five million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease with the numbers expected to triple by 2050 (Data: Alzheimer's Association). It is considered to be one of the biggest burdens of society and is the sixth leading cause of death across all ages in the United States. The market has immense commercial potential and companies coming out with new treatments could rake in billions of dollars in sales.Biogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

8,BIIB,"Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. (SRPT  -  Free Report) was a star performer in Tuesday’s trading session, as the stock skyrocketed as much as 57.7% to a new high of $176.50 but closed a little lower, rising 36.8% (read: 4 Sector ETFs That Crushed S&P 500 in 9-Year Bull Run).The surge propelled the company’s market cap from $6.9 billion to more than $9 billion, making it the fifth most valuable drugmaker headquartered in Massachusetts, behind Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN  -  Free Report) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY  -  Free Report).The massive gain for the mid-cap biotech firm came from encouraging early trial results for a gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The study was conducted on three patients and revealed an average reduction of more than 87% in their creatine kinase, an enzyme found within muscle cells that can leak into the bloodstream when damage has occurred in the muscle, on day 60.This indicates that Sarepta’s muscular dystrophy drug could successfully treat and produce robust levels of dystrophin, a protein that protects muscle cells.DMD is a rare genetic disease marked by progressive muscle degeneration, which can cause physical disability along with life-threatening problems in the heart and respiratory system. The disease mostly affects boys between the ages of 3 and 5, and typically kills patients before the age of 30.The positive clinical trial also sent shares of fellow DMD gene therapy developer Solid Biosciences (SLDB  -  Free Report) up by more than 46% yesterday (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).ETF ImpactThe news led to a surge in biotech ETFs, especially Virtus LifeSci Biotech Products ETF (BBP  -  Free Report), iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB  -  Free Report) andSPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI  -  Free Report). The trio has risen 2.3%, 1.5% and 1.4%, respectively. In fact, BBP and XBI touched a new 52-week high each.BBP in FoucsThe ETF follows the LifeSci Biotechnology Products Index, which measures the performance of biotechnology companies with a primary product offering or product candidate that has received the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval. Holding 40 stocks, Sarepta Therapeutics takes the fourth position in the basket with a 4.1% share. The product has accumulated AUM of about $33.2 million and charges 79 bps in fees per year. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a High risk outlook.IBB in FocusThis fund provides exposure to 192 firms by tracking the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index, with Sarepta accounting for 0.9% of assets. IBB is the most popular fund is the biotech space with AUM of $8.9 billion. Expense ratio comes in at 0.47%. IBB has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a High risk outlook (read: Why These Small Cap Biotech ETFs are Soaring).XBI in FocusWith AUM of $5.3 billion, XBI provides equal-weight exposure across 120 stocks by tracking the S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index. Sarepta is the seventh firm in the fund’s portfolio, making up for 1.4% share. XBI has 0.35% in expense ratio and a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a High risk outlook.Bottom LineIn fact, these three ETFs clearly outpaced the other products in the biotech space in the last trading session. ALPS Medical Breakthroughs ETF (SBIO  -  Free Report) and Virtus LifeSci Biotech Clinical Trials ETF (BBC  -  Free Report) added just 0.5% each on the day as these products have no exposure to Sarepta Therapeutics.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

9,BIIB," (0:15) - Drug Stocks: Value Traps or Opportunity? (1:30) - Tracey’s Top Stock Picks(11:45) - Health Service Industry(14:20) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comWelcome to Episode #96 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.Recently, investors on Stocktwits and Twitter have been asking about some of the drug stocks.If you look at the valuations, you can see why.Many are dirt cheap, with some trading with single digit P/Es.Problem is, the Street hates them (which makes them perfect for value investors.)Retail and energy stocks were hated over the last several years too but have staged big turnarounds in 2018.Will the drug stocks be the next big turnaround success story?Definition of a Value TrapRemember, a value trap is a stock that looks cheap based on basic value fundamentals like the P/E ratio.Who doesn’t like a company trading at 5x earnings?But sometimes there’s a reason for the cheapness. Investors have to look beyond the value fundamentals at earnings.Are they rising or falling?Rising earnings with a low P/E tells you that something right is going on at a company. But an earnings decline can be a sign that the company has lost its way.Value Stock or a Trap?1.       Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) has a forward P/E of just 11.8. Shares are down 13.3% over the last 2 years while the S&P 500 has gained 34.5% in that time. What are the earnings expected to do in 2018?2.       Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) is trading with a forward P/E of 12.9. Year-to-date, the shares are down 8.4% but they’ve gained 28.5% over the prior 2 years. Estimates for 2018 have been cut in the last 60 days, but is there earnings growth?3.       Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) has taken a beating this year with shares falling 27% year-to-date. It’s now trading with a forward P/E of just 9.2. That’s cheap. But is it a trap?4.       Lannett (LCI  -  Free Report) is the cheapest among this group. It has a forward P/E of only 5.3. Should you take a chance? Shares are down 31% year-to-date and have fallen 35% the prior 2 years.5.       Valeant (VRX  -  Free Report) has had its problems the last few years but the shares have rebounded in 2018 and are up 22% compared to the S&P’s return of 3.4%. It’s also cheap, with a forward P/E of just 8. Is this the bottom of the earnings decline?There are lots of categories in the healthcare sector including the insurers, hospitals, device manufacturers, staffing and others.But the drug companies have been hit especially hard.Just because they’re cheap, however, doesn’t mean they’re a good buy. Investors need to do their homework.Value stock or a trap?Find out on this week’s podcast.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

10,BIIB,"Alzheimer’s, a fatal illness that causes progressive decline in memory, has always been a highly challenging area with not much progress being made in spite of significant investments (both funds and resources).On Tuesday, Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and its Swiss partner AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) said they are discontinuing two late-stage studies on their Alzheimer’s disease candidate, lanabecestat, on recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC). The IDMC said that the two studies were unlikely to meet their primary goals upon completion. This prompted the decision of stalling the studies on the oral beta secretase cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibitor.Several companies have failed to develop safe and effective treatment options for this deadly brain disease.In May this year, J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) halted development of atabecestat, its investigational BACE inhibitor, which was being developed for preclinical stage AD due to safety concerns.In February this year, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) discontinued the second late-stage study evaluating its BACE inhibitor verubecestat for the treatment of prodromal AD as its success was unlikely. In February last year, Merck discontinued a late-stage study evaluating verubecestat for mild-to-moderate AD due to lack of efficacy.In January, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) said it will end R&D efforts in the Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease areas. Long back, Pfizer had shelved its late-stage AD candidate, bapineuzumab IV after it failed two phase III studies.In late 2017, Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) AD study on BAN2401 failed to show early positive results, which raised investors’ concerns about the candidate’s chances of success.Clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Axovant Sciences suffered a major setback in September 2017 when its investigational AD candidate failed to meet the co-primary efficacy endpoints in a late-stage study. The company decided to discontinue development of the 35 mg dose for the treatment of AD.Lilly decided in November 2016 that it would not seek approval for its investigational AD treatment, solanezumab, following disappointing results from a late-stage study. The candidate was being evaluated to see whether it can slow the progression of memory problems associated with amyloid, a protein that forms plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s.According to the Alzheimer's Association, in the 10 years from 2002-2012, 244 drugs were tested for Alzheimer’s in studies registered with clinicaltrials.gov out of which only one succeeded and went on to gain FDA approval.This may be somewhat because the underlying causes of severe neurological ailments like Alzheimer’s may not be as clear as diseases like cancer. Also, Alzheimer’s progress may go unnoticed for years.  By the time, the symptoms of the ailment become evident, significant functions may be already lost, which makes developing drugs to treat this disease difficult.Interest Still Alive in the AreaDespite the setbacks, several companies continue to invest heavily in developing Alzheimer’s disease treatments, given the high commercial potential in this market. Success in this area means huge returns considering more than five million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease with the numbers expected to triple by 2050 (Data: Alzheimer's Association). It is considered to be one of the biggest burdens of society and is the sixth leading cause of death across all ages in the United States. The market has immense commercial potential and companies coming out with new treatments could rake in billions of dollars in sales.Biogen, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), Eisai, AstraZeneca and Amgen are presently working on Alzheimer’s disease treatments.Biogen’s AD pipeline comprises mid as well as late-stage candidates with different mechanisms of action including anti-tau candidate (BIIB092), anti-amyloid (aducanumab) candidates as well as a BACE inhibitor (elenbecestat) program. These candidates are being developed in collaboration with Eisai.  Meanwhile, Novartis and Amgen are collaborating for BACE 1 inhibitor, CNP520, which has fast track status in the United Status. Roche is collaborating with AC Immune for the development of Alzheimer’s disease treatments.Lilly and AstraZeneca are also developing another treatment for Alzheimer's disease, an antibody targeting beta amyloid in early-stage studies.Earlier this year, the FDA proposed new guidelines, which are aimed at lowering the clinical study goals of Alzheimer’s disease drugs aimed to treat earlier-stage patients who have not yet displayed functional disability or clinical abnormality. This strategy is part of FDA’s ongoing efforts to expand access to safe and effective treatment options for many serious conditions. These efforts by the FDA may also reinvigorate research efforts for Alzheimer’s drugs after repeated failures.Lilly and Merck carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

11,BIIB,"Roche Holdings (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved Rituxan (rituximab) for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris (PV).Per the company, Rituxan is the first biologic therapy approved by the FDA for PV. We remind investors that the FDA had granted Priority Review, Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Orphan Drug Designation to Rituxan for the treatment of PV.Being an autoimmune blistering disease affecting the skin and mucous membranes, PF affects 30,000 to 40,000 people in the United States. As a result of this approval, Rituxan is now approved to treat four autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and PV.The approval was based on data from the Ritux 3 trial, which compared the Ritux 3 regimen (EU-approved rituximab product plus short-term corticosteroids [CS]) to CS alone as a first-line treatment in patients with newly diagnosed moderate to severe pemphigus. The results from the study showed that 90% of PV patients treated with the Ritux 3 regimen met the endpoint compared to 28% of PV patients treated with CS alone.We note that Roche’s subsidiary, Genentech and Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report), have a collaboration agreement for Rituxan in the United States while Roche markets MabThera (brand name of Rituxan outside the United States) in the rest of the world, except Japan, where Rituxan is co-marketed by Chugai and Zenyaku Kogyo Co. Ltd.Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche, as its legacy drugs like Herceptin and MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars. Sales of MabThera/Rituxan were down 8% in the first quarter of 2018 as sales in Europe (down 44%) were adversely impacted by the market entry of biosimilars.Roche’s stock has lost 9.3% in the last six months compared with industry’s decline of 2.2%. Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan/MabThera in Europe. Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) has also obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer.Zacks RankRoche currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

12,BIIB,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 6.7% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is BIIB due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Biogen Tops Earnings in Q1, Misses SalesFirst-quarter 2018 earnings per share were $6.05, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.93 by 2%. Earnings rose 16% year over year backed by lower-than-expected costs and lower tax rates.Sales came in at $3.13 billion, up 11% from the year-ago period. However, sales marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.15 billion.Revenue growth was principally driven by Spinraza growth in international markets, biosimilars and Other Revenues of $164 million. The performance of the MS franchise and Spinraza in the United States was soft in the quarter.The top line, excluding hemophilia revenues, grew 15% year over year.Quarter in DetailBiogen’s multiple sclerosis (MS) revenues were $2.1 billion in the reporter quarter including approximately $77 million in royalties on the sales of Roche’s MS drug Ocrevus. MS revenues declined 4% year over year and 8% sequentially.As expected, competition from Ocrevus, seasonality and a larger-than-expected inventory drawdown in the United States, hurt the performance of Biogen’s MS franchise in first quarter.However, on the call, the company said that demand for its MS products in the United States improved in the quarter and discontinuations remained relatively stable. In International markets it saw strong progress in the emerging markets.Tecfidera’s sales increased 3% year over year to $987 million. However, Tecfidera sales declined 8% sequentially. This included U.S. sales of $728.9 million (down 3% year over year) and ex-U.S. sales of $258 million (up 24.6%).In the United States, Tecfidera sales were affected by about $80 million in inventory drawdown compared with a drawdown of approximately $60 million in the first quarter of last year. Excluding this impact, U.S. Tecfidera revenues would have been flat year over year with Tecfidera price increases offsetting the impact of Ocrevus. Meanwhile, patient growth across major European markets and strong emerging market growth drove international Tecfidera sales. Positive impact of currency also benefited international growth.Tysabri’s sales declined 15% year over year but were flat sequentially at $462 million.Tysabri U.S. sales declined 18.3% to $249.7 million in the quarter hurt by Ocrevus launch and seasonality and inventory dynamics. International revenues declined 11.3% to $212.4 million in the quarter due to recognition of $45 million of previously deferred revenues in the prior-year period, which was absent in the first quarter of 2018.Combined interferon revenues (Avonex and Plegridy) in the first quarter were $550 million, down 15% both year over year and sequentially. Avonex revenues declined 16% from the year-ago period to $451 million. Plegridy contributed $100 million to revenues, which decreased 11% year over year and 20%, sequentially.U.S. Interferon revenues are experiencing declining trends due to patients transitioning to other oral or high efficacy MS therapies as well as due to higher discounts and allowance.Zinbryta, launched in collaboration with AbbVie, contributed $1 million to revenues in the first quarter compared with $12 million in fourth-quarter 2017.Spinraza registered revenues of $364 million in the first quarter, almost in line with the previous quarter as strong international growth was offset by a moderating performance in the United States.As expected, Spinraza sales in the quarter were mainly driven by ex-U.S. markets.Spinraza U.S. sales were $188 million in the first quarter, decreasing 13.8% sequentially due to lower- than-expected uptake in the adult segment. However, in the ex-U.S. markets, Spinraza recorded sales of $176 million, up 22% sequentially. The company said that Spinraza international revenues were mainly grossed from Germany, Turkey and Japan.However, Biogen highlighted on the call that overall patient numbers grew in the quarter. The number of patients on Spinraza grew approximately 16% in the United States and 56% outside the United States in the quarter.Biogen said that 40% of U.S. sales in the first quarter were from patients who receive less intensive maintenance doses (dosing only once/4 months) versus 25% in the previous quarter.On the call, management said that growth in Spinraza U.S sales will be flat for at least the next two quarters, given the continued transition of patients from the loading phase to the less intensive maintenance phase.Management is optimistic that patient starts will grow in the U.S. markets as it captures the under-penetrated adult segment while the ex-U.S. expansion will continue.In the first quarter of 2018, Biogen recorded biosimilar revenues of $128 million compared with $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, driven primarily by Benepali, which recorded revenues of $120.9 million, up 2.8% sequentially on increase in market share. Flixabi recorded revenues of $6.6 million compared with $4.3 million in the previous quarter.Revenues from Anti-CD20 therapeutic programs, which include Biogen’s shares of Rituxan and Gazyva operating profits, climbed 30.1% from the year-ago period to $443.2 million, primarily driven by Ocrevus royalties as well as a strong performance of Rituxan.R&D spend increased 18% year over year but decreased 15% sequentially to $497 million due to higher pipeline related costs. On the other hand, while SG&A spend was up 3% year over year, it decreased 10% sequentially to $498 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter compared to 23 lower.Biogen Inc. Price and Consensus  Biogen Inc. Price and Consensus | Biogen Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, BIIB has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for value and growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, BIIB has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

14,BIIB,"The Biotech space remained a key area of investors focus as several bigwigs announced quarterly results. While Alexion (ALXN  -  Free Report) reported solid results, Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) reported dismal numbers. Among other developments over the week, Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report) and Sanofi announced plans to lower the price of Praluent, while Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) received a positive opinion for Prolia.Recap of Important Stories:Q1 Progress Report: Companies like Alexion, Gilead and Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report), among others reported first-quarter results over the last five trading sessions. While Alexion and Vertex delivered solid results for the quarter, Gilead’s both earnings and sales missed estimates on wider-than-expected decline in HCV franchise.Following the Q1 results, Alexion raised guidance and also reported positive data on its long-acting C5 complement inhibitor — ALXN1210 which showed that patients with PNH can be effectively and safely switched from treatment with Soliris every two weeks to treatment with ALXN1210 every eight weeks.A tentative approval will bode well for Alexion (read more: Alexion's Earnings Beat Estimates in Q1, Guidance Up).Vertex’s first-quarter results were driven by the stellar performance of CF products (read more: Vertex Q1 Earnings Beat on Strong CF Products Sales).Gilead is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

Meanwhile, the company’s supplemental Biologics License Application for Prolia for this expanded indication is also under review in the United States with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date of May 28, 2018.We note that the drug is already approved in the United States for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture.In addition, the CHMP has adopted a positive opinion recommending a label variation for Kyprolis (carfilzomib) to include the final overall survival data from the phase III trial, ASPIRE which demonstrated that the addition of Kyprolis to lenalidomide and dexamethasone (KRd) reduced the risk of death by 21% versus lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone (Rd) and extended OS by 7.9 months in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.Regeneron and partner Sanofi to Cut Praluent Price: Regeneron and partner Sanofi announced that both companies will lower the net price of PCSK9 inhibitor Praluent (alirocumab) injection for more affordable patient access from Express Scripts.Consequently, Praluent will become the exclusive PCSK9 inhibitor therapy on the Express Scripts national formulary.  The agreement (effective Jul 1) provides Praluent at lower net price and enables streamlined patient access based on physician attestation.  Meanwhile, the FDA has accepted for priority review the companies’ Biologics License Application for cemiplimab for the treatment of patients with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“CSCC”) or patients with locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for surgery. The candidate was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation status by the FDA in September 2017. The target action date is Oct 28, 2018.Biogen Negotiates Agreement With Neurimmune: Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) and Neurimmune announced that the former has exercised its option to further reduce the previously negotiated royalty rates payable on potential future sales of its Alzheimer’s disease candidate, aducanumab.The candidate is currently in phase III. As a result, Biogen will make a one-time $50 million payment to Neurimmune in exchange for a 5% reduction in the original royalty rates on potential commercial sales of aducanumab. Both companies had earlier announced a 15% reduction in royalty rates. The reduced royalty rates on potential commercial sales of aducanumab will be in the high single digits to low-teens.

15,BIIB,"CTI BioPharma Corp. (CTIC  -  Free Report) and its privately-held partner Servier announced the failure of their pivotal phase III study evaluating cancer drug, Pixuvri, in combination with Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) and Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) Rituxan (rituximab) for the treatment of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”).CTI BioPharma’s shares fell almost 13.8% on Jul 9 following the disappointing news. However, shares of the company have rallied 67.2% so far this year, against the industry’s gain of 2.9%.The pivotal PIX306 study compared Pixuvri and Rituxan combination regimen with the combination of chemo drug, gemcitabine, and Rituxan for the treatment of aggressive B-cell NHL, a form of blood cancer, in patients whose disease relapsed following CHOP-R chemotherapy. Data from the study showed that patients treated with Pixuvri regimen failed to achieve improvement in progression free survival compared to patients treated with gemcitabine regimen.However, the company has plans to conduct a thorough review of the data from the study. CTI BioPharma expects to submit data from PIX306 study to the European Medicines Agency for review by the end of 2018.Pixuvri has conditional approval in Europe as monotherapy for the treatment of multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell NHL. However, it is yet to receive approval in the United States.There are approximately 168,000 newly diagnosed NHL patients every year in the United States and Europe. Several companies are developing drugs for the treatment for the disease. A few of them are developing the most advanced form of cancer treatment, CAR-T therapy, for treating NHL, which includes Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) lisocabtagene.The disappointing data from the PIX306 study negatively impacts Pixuvri’s prospects in an already competitive market.CTI BioPharma Corp.

16,BIIB,"The biotech sector witnessed a series of events over the past week. Quite a few companies reported quarterly results over the week alongside announcing pipeline updates. Over the past week while Amgen revised its annual guidance, Biogen reported quarterly numbers wherein sales missed estimates.Recap of Important Stories:Prothena Plunges on Discontinuation of Study: Shares of Prothena Corp. (PRTA  -  Free Report) plunged as the company decided to discontinue the development of its lead pipeline candidate, NEOD001. The candidate, an antibody, was being evaluated for the treatment of AL amyloidosis. A phase IIb study, PRONTO, did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints. Hence, the company asked the independent data monitoring committee (“DMC”) of the phase III VITAL study to review a futility analysis of the ongoing VITAL study. Thereafter, the DMC recommended discontinuation of the VITAL study for futility.Hence, the company decided to discontinue all studies for the development of NEOD001, including the VITAL study as well as the open label extension studies. The decision came as a major blow to the investors as the company has a very limited number of candidates in its pipeline and NEOD001 was a lead candidate.Prothena carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Incyte/Lilly’s Drug Gets FDA Advisory Committee Nod: Incyte Corp. (INCY  -  Free Report) and Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee has recommended an approval of the 2-mg dose of baricitinib, a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis for adult patients who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate.However, the advisory committee did not recommend approval of the 4-mg dose of baricitinib for the proposed indication based on the adequacy of the safety and benefit-risk profiles.While the FDA is generally not required to follow the Advisory Committee's recommendation, but it will consider the same during its review of the NDA for baricitinib. The FDA had earlier issued a Complete Response Letter for the same. The drug is approved as Olumiant in Europe.Amgen Revises Annual Guidance: Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) revised 2018 guidance concurrent with its first-quarter results. The company beat on sales and earnings in the first quarter driven by strong performance of newly and recently launched drugs.The company now expects revenues in 2018 to be between $21.9 billion and $22.8 billion, compared to the earlier estimate of $21.8-$22.8 billion. Earnings per share is now projected to come between $12.80 and $13.70, compared to the earlier estimate of $12.60 and $13.70.Biogen Misses on Sales:  Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) missed revenue estimates in the first quarter as Spinraza sales were drab.The company’s leading multiple sclerosis franchise also saw sales declining. This biotech has been struggling in 2018. Nevertheless, earnings beat estimates and shares recovered and ended on a positive note at the end of the session. Earlier, the company also extended its collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS  -  Free Report) through a new 10-year agreement to develop novel antisense drug candidates for a broad range of neurological diseases.

17,BIIB,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) announced encouraging data from the phase III study, EXPAND, on oral, once-daily siponimod (BAF312) in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (“SPMS”).Siponimod is an investigational, selective modulator of specific subtypes of the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor.The results will be presented at the 70th American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting, in Los Angeles which is scheduled to be held from Apr 21 to 27.The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, EXPAND study is comparing the efficacy and safety of siponimod versus placebo in SPMS patients.Data from the study showed that siponimod reduced the risk of disability progression largely disassociated from relapses in patients with SPMS.New post-hoc analysis also demonstrated that the risk reduction with siponimod is largely disassociated from relapses. The data from the study showed that siponimod resulted in significant benefit on cognitive processing speed, the key cognitive function impacted by MS which impacted the affected patients.Meanwhile, Novartis has initiated the submission of siponimod in the United States for the approval in SPMS. Filing for EU approval is planned to follow later in 2018.A potential approval will strengthen Novartis’ MS portfolio which includes Gilenya (fingolimod, an S1P modulator) approved for relapsing forms of MS and is also in development for pediatric MS. Extavia (interferon beta-1b for subcutaneous injection) is approved in the United States for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS.Novartis also has another MS candidate in its pipeline apart from siponimod- ofatumumab (OMB157), a fully human monoclonal antibody being evaluated in two phase III studies for relapsing MS. The generic division, Sandoz, markets Glatopa (glatiramer acetate injection) 20 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL, generic versions of Teva's (TEVA  -  Free Report) Copaxone.Given the complexity of the market, MS drugs have a long history of serious side effects, making it a risky therapeutic area.  An autoimmune inflammatory disease of the centrol nervous system, MS disrupts the normal functioning of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord through inflammation and tissue loss. There are three types of MS widely known to affect adults — relapsing-remitting MS, SPMS and primary progressive MS.However, the competition is stiff in the market. Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) is a dominant player in the MS market with drugs like Avonex, Tysabri, Tecfidera, Plegridy and Zinbryta.  The FDA recently issued Refusal to File letter to Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) New Drug Application for ozanimod, which is in development for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.   Novartis’ stock has lost 4.5% in the last six months compared with the industry’s 6.0% decline.Shares have declined further following first-quarter results which were reported yesterday. While revenues and earnings beat estimates, sales of psoriasis drug Cosentyx fell short of expectations while Sandoz revenues declined due to pricing pressure.Zacks RankNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

18,BIIB,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report), a well-known name in the multiple sclerosis (MS) market, will report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 3.31%.Biogen’s shares have declined 16.5% this year, underperforming the industry’s decline of 8.4% in the same time frame.Biogen’s earnings performance has been decent so far, having delivered a positive surprise in three of the last four quarters. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 6.91%.Biogen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Biogen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Biogen Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcementFactors to ConsiderIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Biogen witnessed higher sales of its multiple sclerosis drugs. Patient growth across major European markets and strong emerging market growth drove international Tecfidera sales while a $20 million inventory build in the quarter benefited U.S. sales. However, on the call, Biogen mentioned that seasonality and absence of inventory build (that benefitted fourth quarter 2017 results) will hurt the performance of its MS franchise in the first quarter.Continued competitive pressure, especially from Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) newly launched MS drug, Ocrevus will hurt the performance of Biogen’s MS franchise, particularly sales of Tysabri. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Tecfidera for the first quarter is pegged at $1.02 billion while that for Tysabri (Global In-Market sales) is $462 million.On the fourth-quarter conference call, Biogen said that since Ocrevus launch, it has witnessed a decrease in the number of patient starts and an increase in discontinuation of Tysabri in the United States. The negative trend may continue this quarter.The combined number of patients using Avonex and Plegridy are expected to decline with patients transitioning to other oral MS therapies as well as due to higher discounts and allowance.Zinbryta is unlikely to have made any significant contribution to revenues in the quarter. In March, Biogen and partner AbbVie announced their decision to withdraw Zinbryta from the markets, less than two years of its approval, due to growing safety concerns and limited commercial adoption of the drug due to its restrictive label. Both companies decided to discontinue marketing of the drug on grounds of the complex and evolving benefit/risk profile of Zinbryta.  An update is expected on the first-quarter conference call.Biogen’s newly launched drug Spinraza approved for spinal muscular atrophy is likely to see strong demand trends, particularly in international markets. On the fourth-quarter conference call, Biogen management had said that in 2018, a significant portion of Spinraza’s revenue growth is expected to come from outside the United States.Biogen’s biosimilar products - Flixabi (a biosimilar referencing Remicade) and Benepali (a biosimilar referencing Enbrel) are also generating significant revenues. The trend should continue this quarter as well.On the fourth-quarter call, the company had also said that operating expenses are expected to be sequentially lower in the first quarter. However, earnings growth is expected to be higher in the second and fourth quarters of the yearEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Biogen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -0.51% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at $5.90 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $5.93. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Biogen’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderBiotech stocks that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include:Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report), scheduled to release results on Apr 26, has an Earnings ESP of +2.09% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Amgen, Inc.

19,BIIB,"The Q1 earnings season has started to gather steam. Per the latest Earnings Preview, 87 S&P 500 members — accounting for 17.4% of the index — have already released financial figures as of Apr 20, 2018.Total earnings for the 87 S&P 500 members that have reported results already are up 25% from the same period last year on 10.7% higher revenues, with 82.8% beating EPS estimates and 67.8% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 62.1%.The ongoing earnings phase seems to have also begun encouragingly for the Drug/Biotech sector. Among the major large cap players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) kicked off the season on a strong note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings as well as sales. Another large cap player that reported earnings last week was Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), which also surpassed both earnings and revenue expectations this quarter. Also Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) which released its results this week surpassed earnings but missed sales expectations.Higher demand is expected to boost new product sales. Also, innovation and successful product line expansion along with positive clinical study results, FDA approvals, and consistent performance of key products, growing demand for drugs, especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an ageing population as well as an increased healthcare expenditure are some of the factors that should keep the sector on a growth trajectory.Also, according to the Earnings Preview, the broader Medical sector (inclusive of drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is likely to record 6.8% year-over-year growth in revenues and a 9.4% rise in earnings in the quarter under review.Four pharma/biotech giants are scheduled to report Q1 earnings results on Apr 26. Let's see, how things are shaping up for the companies in the upcoming releases.AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) is slated to releaseresults before the market opens. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.78% in the last reported quarter. Moreover, the company’s performance has been impressive in the recent past with its earnings surpassing expectations in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 1.81%.Our proven model shows that AbbVie is likely to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP of 0.06% and a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.80 per share.The company’s key drug, Humira, is likely to remain a key growth driver in the first quarter, backed by strong demand trends for the drug. AbbVie expects Humira sales to reflect a rise in the low-teens band in the imminent earnings release while internationally, the growth rate is projected in a mid-single-digit range, operationally. Other drugs, namely Duopa and Creon are also likely to maintain an encouraging performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.

The combination of Bristol-Myers’ Zacks Rank of 3 and a positive Earnings ESP of 0.82% makes us confident about an earnings beat in the upcoming report. The consensus mark for the quarter to be reported is pegged at 84 cents per share.Bristol-Myers’ blockbuster immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo is expected to remain the main sales driver in the first quarter, following several line extensions in 2017. In the soon-to-be reported quarter, the company announced encouraging results from a phase III study evaluating Opdivo in first-line non-small cell lung cancer. Label expansion of leukemia drug, Sprycel, approved in November 2017, should bring in more sales for the drug.

The stock has declined 19.3% this year so far, underperforming the industry’s 9% decrease.Quarter in DetailBiogen’s multiple sclerosis (MS) revenues were $2.1 billion (down 4% year over year) in the reporter quarter including approximately $77 million in royalties on the sales of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) MS drug, Ocrevus. Per a deal with Roche, Biogen is entitled to receive royalties on U.S. sales of Ocrevus.Oral MS drug Tecfidera’s sales increased 3% year over year but decreased 8% sequentiallyto $987 million. The other MS drug Tysabri’s sales declined 15% year over year but was flat sequentially with $462 million.Combined interferon revenues (Avonex and Plegridy) in the first quarter were $550 million, down 15% both year over year and sequentially. Avonex revenues declined 16% from the year-ago period to $451 million. Plegridy contributed $100 million to revenues, which decreased 11% year over year and 20%, sequentially.U.S. Interferon revenues are experiencing declining trends due to patients transitioning to other oral MS therapies as well as due to higher discounts and allowance.Zinbryta, launched in collaboration with AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report), contributed $1 million to revenues in the first quarter compared with $12 million in fourth-quarter 2017.Notably, in March 2018, Biogen announced the decision to withdraw Zinbryta from the markets, within less than two years of its FDA approval, due to growing safety concerns and limited commercial adoption of the drug because of its restrictive label. Both companies decided to discontinue the drug’s marketing on grounds of its complex and evolving benefit/risk profile.Biogen’s newest drug Spinraza (spinal muscular atrophy) logged revenues of $364 million in the first quarter, almost in line with the previous one.Spinraza U.S. sales were $188 million in the first quarter, decreasing 13.8% sequentially. However, in the ex-U.S. markets, Spinraza recorded sales of $176 million, up 22% sequentially. Significantly, the number of patients receiving Spinraza grew 16% in the United States and 56% outside the United States in the quarter under review compared with the preceding period.The company said that Spinraza international revenues were mainly grossed from Germany, Turkey and Japan.In the first quarter of 2018, Biogen recorded biosimilar revenues of $128 million compared with $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.Revenues from Anti-CD20 therapeutic programs, which include Biogen’s shares of Rituxan and Gazyva operating profits, climbed 30.1% from the year-ago period to $443.2 million.The R&D spend increased 18% year over year but decreased 15% sequentially to $497 million.

21,BIIB,"Shares of PTC Therapeutics, Inc. (PTCT  -  Free Report) gained 27.5% on Jun 18, following the presentation of encouraging preliminary data from part I of the pivotal FIREFISH study. The study is evaluating its pipeline candidate, risdiplam (RG7916), in babies with type 1 spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”). The early-stage data has shown promising motor function improvements and milestones achievement in babies. Data was presented over the last weekend at the Annual SMA Researcher Meeting.Data from the study showed that risdiplam achieved a four-point increase from baseline in CHOP-INTEND score in more than 90% babies below two years at day 182. CHOP-INTEND is a test to determine motor milestone development of patients with SMA Type 1.The FIREFISH study is a two-part program in collaboration with Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) and SMA foundation. The part I was a dose escalation and safety assessment study. Part II will evaluate the selected dose from part I in babies with type I SMA for 24 months. Enrollment in part II of the FIREFISH study is underway.Following this presentation, shares of rival company, Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) fell more than 5% on Monday. We remind investors that Biogen’s Spinraza is available for the treatment of SMA in pediatric and adult patients. A successful development of risdiplam will likely have an unfavorable impact on Spinraza sales, which generated 14.4% of Biogen’s total product sales in the first quarter of 2018.We note that following the completion of acquisition of AveXis, Novartis will also add a SMA candidates to its pipeline, creating a potential large-cap competitor for Biogen and PTC Therapeutics.So far this year, PTC Therapeutics’ shares have skyrocketed 187.1% compared with a 4.6% increase registered by the industry.PTC Therapeutics is evaluating risdiplam in several clinical studies apart from FIREFISH. The candidate is being evaluated in another two-part pivotal study, SUNFISH, for the treatment of patients with type II or III SMA. An exploratory study is currently evaluating risdiplam in patients who have received treatment with another therapy targeting SMN2 splicing in clinical studies.SMA is a rare neuromuscular disorder, which causes muscle atrophy due to the loss of motor neurons within the spinal cord leading to impaired movement in patients. Per the press release, one in 11,000 new-born babies has this debilitating disease.PTC Therapeutics, Inc. Price  PTC Therapeutics, Inc. Price | PTC Therapeutics, Inc.

22,BIIB,"Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced encouraging data from the final analysis of the CLL11 study, evaluating Gazyva-based treatment in previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).The phase III, multicenter, open-label, randomized three-arm study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy profile of Gazyva in combination with chlorambucil compared to MabThera in combination with chlorambucil or chlorambucil alone, in nearly 800 patients with previously untreated CLL and comorbidities.The final results, after a follow-up of almost five years, showed clinically meaningful improvements with Gazyva plus chlorambucil across multiple endpoints, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), when compared head-to-head with Rituxan plus chlorambucil.These long-term data confirm Gazyva’s efficacy to extend the lives of patients suffering from CLL, compared to that of MabThera/Rituxan.Gazyva-based treatment reduced the risk of death by 24% compared to MabThera/Rituxan-based treatment. Gazyva is approved in combination with chlorambucil, for patients with previously untreated CLL.Roche is a leader in the oncology market with a wide portfolio of drugs for breast cancer and CLL among others.Additionally, Roche announced new data on multiple sclerosis (MS) drug, Ocrevus, which will be presented at the 4th Congress of the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) from Jun 16-19 in Lisbon, Portugal.The data from a new exploratory analysis, from the extended control period of the phase III study, ORATORIO, in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) patients, showed that Ocrevus may significantly delay the time to need a wheelchair by seven years, as measured by the length of time until a person reaches Expanded Disability Status Scale seven or greater (EDSS≥7), using 24-week confirmed disability progression (CDP).Patients, treated with Ocrevus, showed a 46% reduction in the risk of progressing to a wheelchair compared to the placebo-treated group. The analysis also showed that the placebo-treated patient population studied in Oratorio had similar disability progression rates to an untreated real-world PPMS population. The extrapolated median time to wheelchair (EDSS≥7) for placebo-treated people in the Oratorio study was 12.1 years.The longer-term efficacy and safety data are consistent with the drug’s favourable benefit-risk profile, for both PPMS and relapsing MS (RMS).In addition, a new global study, FLOODLIGHT Open, is now enrolling patients in the United States. The study uses proprietary FLOODLIGHT mobile technology to collect and monitor anonymized patient data to help gain a better understanding of MS disease progression. The study is an observational, open access study aimed to enroll 10,000 people globally, including people with relapsing and progressive forms of MS, within five years.Roche will be initiating two new phase IIIb studies of Ocrevus in 2018.While the MS market holds immense potential, competition is stiff with the likes of Biogen, Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report).Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche, as its legacy drugs like Herceptin and MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars.Roche’s stock has lost 12.7% in the last six months compared with industry’s’ decline of 3.1%.  Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan in Europe.

24,BIIB,"Biogen Inc (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced that it has signed an option agreement with private biotech, TMS Co., Ltd. to acquire the latter’s phase II acute stroke candidate TMS-007 and backup compounds.Biogen is expected to pay $4 million upfront and an additional $18 million if it exercises the option with up to $335 million payable as potential milestone payments.TMS-007 designed to restore blood flow following acute stroke is being evaluated in a phase II study. In August 2015, the candidate completed the phase l study.With this acquisition, Biogen aims to boost its acute neurology portfolio, a strategic move for the company’s growth. To pursue innovative approaches in therapeutic area, Biogen already has a phase III ready pipeline candidate, BIIB093, under development for the prevention and treatment of edema in large hemispheric infarction, a severe type of stroke.However, in February 2018, Biogen’s multiple sclerosis (MS) drug, Tysabri (natalizumab), failed to meet the primary and secondary endpoints in a phase IIb program, evaluating it for another indication, acute ischemic stroke (AIS).Some investors believe that natalizumab’s failure in the AIS study could be a reason behind this buyout from TMS.Biogen’s core business area is multiple sclerosis (MS), a disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord. Key multiple sclerosis drugs in its portfolio are Tecfidera, Avonex and Tysabri. However, it is looking to diversify its business and aims at being a leader in neuroscience and adjacent therapeutic space.In 2017, Biogen added seven new clinical stage programs to its neuroscience pipeline through advancing internal pipeline candidates as well as via external deals.This year in March, Biogen agreed to acquire a phase IIb ready candidate, PF-04958242, for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS) from Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report). In January, Biogen acquired the rights to Karyopharm’s phase I ready investigational oral compound, KPT-350, for certain neurological and neurodegenerative conditions, primarily focused on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS. Biogen plans to start a phase I trial by the end of 2018.Shares of Biogen have lost 4.2% year to date, outperforming the industry’s decline of 6.7%. Biogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

25,BIIB,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) said it plans to invest $600 million in Pfizer Ventures, its venture capital arm. This funding will be invested in small biotechs and other emerging growth companies. About 25% — $150 million — of the newly available fund will be earmarked for companies involved in promising early-stage neuroscience research. Pfizer Ventures will first invest in companies focussed on neuro-degeneration, neuro-inflammation and neuro-metabolic disorders.Pfizer Ventures already has investments in six neuroscience companies including Aquinnah, Autifony, Cortexyme, MindImmune, MISSION, and Neuronetics. In 2015, Pfizer became part of the Dementia Discovery Fund (DDF), which was formed to speed up the development of new treatments for neurological diseases by bringing together major pharma companies, the U.K. government and Alzheimer’s Research UK. The fund is involved in the financing of new, early stage drug development projects. Since its launch in October 2015, DDF has raised more than $190 million, which has been invested in dementia drug discovery companies and projects. Other investors in DDF include Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report), Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report), among others.Other than neuroscience, the venture capital arm’s area of interest will include oncology, inflammation and immunology, rare disease, internal medicine and vaccines. Pfizer Ventures, which manages more than 40 companies currently, will have five new members.  Pfizer has already invested $500 million in the venture capital arm. With the latest funding, the total assets under management add up to more than $1 billion. This year so far, Pfizer’s shares have increased 0.4% against a decrease of 4.6% for the industry.Ironically, the news comes in less than six months after Pfizer said that it will drop its plans to develop treatments for neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.

The study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group 18-month study among patients (n=70) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s disease, or mild-to-moderate dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease with confirmed amyloid pathology by PET ((positron emission tomography) screening. All the patients were randomized to four treatment arms receiving elenbecestat (5, 15, or 50 mg) or placebo daily. More than half the patients in the elenbecestat 5 mg and 15 mg arms were switched to the 50 mg arm for three months or more. The data showed elenbecestat was generally safe and well tolerated. Results demonstrated a statistically significant difference in amyloid beta(Aβ) levels in the brain measured by amyloid-PET and suggested a delay of clinical symptom decline in exploratory endpoints. Eisai and Biogen are jointly developing elenbecestat since March 2014. Both companies are currently conducting two global phase III studies (MISSION AD1/2) on early Alzheimer’s disease.Biogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

28,BIIB,"Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) is partnering with Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics Co., Ltd. to commercialize a biosimilar to AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) blockbuster arthritis drug Humira (adalimumab). Adalimumab is developed by Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics.Mylan intends to seek approval and commercialize the product in Europe. The European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) accepted a marketing authorization application for review for the proposed biosimilar to Humira in May 2017, and the companies expect to receive the EMA’s decision during the second half of 2018. Under the agreement, Mylan will have an exclusive license to commercialize the biosimilar in Europe and will receive an upfront fee from Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin. The company will also be responsible for the sales activity of the product in European countries. On the other hand, Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics will be eligible to receive a subsequent commercialization milestone payment and sales royalties. Over a year, shares of Mylan increased 6.2% compared with the industry’s fall of 27.9%.Humira is a TNF-inhibitor aimed at treating multiple chronic inflammatory conditions. It is approved in Europe for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, plaque psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa and uveitis.We note that few days ago, Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) and partner Samsung Bioepis announced resolution of an ongoing patent dispute with AbbVie regarding Biogen’s biosimilar version (Imraldi) of AbbVie’s Humira, in the EU. Per the settlement agreement, Biogen/Samsung Bioepis plans to launch Imraldi in Europe on Oct 16, 2018.Also in the United States, Samsung Bioepis entered into a settlement agreement with AbbVie, which would allow the former to bring Humira biosimilar into the U.S. market by Jan 31, 2023.Notably, Imraldi is the second biosimilar version of Humira to be launched in the EU. Another biotechnology company, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), is also expected to launch its biosimilar version of Humira, in the EU come October this year as Amjevita, per a settlement with AbbVie.Notably, Amjevita was approved in the EU last March and approved in the United States in September 2016.In the United States, per settlement with AbbVie, Amjevita is likely to be launched on Jan 31, 2023.Mylan N.V.

29,BIIB,"The biotech sector was on a bumpy ride over the week as shares of Spectrum surged on positive data from a phase II study, while that of Incyte plunged on the failure of melanoma study. In an effort to bolster its presence in the gene therapy space Swiss giant Novartis announced the acquisition of AveXis Inc.Spectrum Surges on Lung Cancer Data: Shares of Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (SPPI  -  Free Report) surged after the company reported encouraging results from a phase II study on poziotinib in EGFR Exon 20 Mutant non-small cell lung cancer patients. The results show that the confirmed objective response rate was 64% in the first 11 patients, better than the expectations of 20% and 30%. These early data suggest that poziotinib may have a meaningful impact on outcomes for patients who have limited treatment options. The median progression-free survival rate has still not been reached after a median follow up period of 6.5 months. Meanwhile, the original cohort of 30 EGFR patients is fully enrolled and the expanded cohort of 20 patients is nearing the completion of enrollment.AveXis Skyrockets on Novartis Deal: AveXis, Inc.’s  shares skyrocketed on the news of a merger with Swiss pharma giant Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report).  Per the agreement, Novartis will pay $8.7 billion for this clinical stage gene therapy company. AveXis lead product candidate, AVXS-101, is being evaluated as one-time gene replacement therapy for spinal muscular atrophy, a disease which results in early death or life-long disability with considerable healthcare costs. The acquisition will poise Novartis in the promising gene therapy space. The acquisition will be completed in mid-2018. The candidate enjoys a breakthrough therapy designation in the United States and Prime designation in Europe. The FDA also granted AVXS-101, a fast track status for the treatment of SMA Type 1.  A regulatory filing in the United States is expected in the second half of this year with a launch anticipated in 2019.

Moreover, the second primary endpoint of overall survival is not expected to reach statistical significance either. Hence, the study will be stopped.The failure of the late-stage candidate disappointed investors as Incyte had pinned hopes on the success given the improved response rates in mid-stage studies.

The candidate did not achieve primary endpoint in the study, which evaluated patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis undergoing liver transplant.  Data from the POLT-HCV-SVR study showed that emricasan did not achieve a better overall response rate compared to placebo in the overall patient population.However, in patient subset with advanced fibrosis or early cirrhosis, emricasan provided evidence of an anti-fibrotic treatment effect in 95% of the patients compared to 58.3% for placebo.

30,BIIB,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) has announced that its pipeline candidate, upadacitinib, met the primary endpoints in the 4th phase III study from its SELECT program, which evaluated the candidate for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Upadacitinib is an investigational oral JAK1-selective inhibitor, which is being studied as a once-a-day oral therapy.The phase III SELECT-COMPARE study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib (15 mg) compared with placebo and AbbVie’s marketed drug, Humira (adalimumab), over 12 weeks on patients with moderate-to-severe RA, who are on a stable background of methotrexate and had an inadequate response. In the study, upadacitinib met both the primary as well as secondary endpoints compared with placebo while showing superiority as compared to Humira.The primary endpoints of the study registered ACR20 responses and clinical remission. Data from the trial demonstrated that 71% of patients receiving the 15 m oral once-daily dose of upadacitinib 15 mg achieved an ACR20 response compared with 36% of patients receiving placebo at week 12. Moreover, 29% of subjects treated with upadacitinib achieved complete remission in comparison to 6% with placebo.Additionally, data from the study also showed that 45% of patients experienced low disease activity (secondary endpoint) when treated with upadacitinib compared with 29% receiving Humira and 14%, receiving placebo at week 12.Notably, SELECT-COMPARE is the fourth of the six ongoing phase III studies under the SELECT RA clinical trial program conducted on upadacitinib.We remind investors that last December, AbbVie announced that upadacitinib met the primary endpoints in the 3rd phase III study from its SELECT trial.Other researches are also underway on upadacitinib for treating Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and atopic dermatitis.Shares of AbbVie have rallied 42.7% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s 6.4% rise.Notably, AbbVie already has a strong presence in the RA market with its blockbuster drug, Humira. However, several companies are working on developing biosimilar versions of Humira which could induce competition in the market for the company. Also, the RA market is extremely crowded including drugs like Johnson & Johnson’s Simponi and UCB’s Cimzia among others.Significantly, Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) JAK inhibitor, Olumiant, was approved in the EU for RA last February and Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xeljanz is marketed in the United States for the same indication, which might pose a strong competition for upadacitinib on approval.Also, of late, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) has announced resolution of the ongoing patent dispute with AbbVie regarding Biogen’s biosimilar version of Humira, in the EU. Per the settlement agreement, Biogen plans to launch Humira biosimilar in Europe by October, 2018.However, if upadacitinib is approved, it might reduce the potential negative impact of Humira generics on AbbVie’s top line.AbbVie Inc.

31,BIIB,"Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) announced that it has inked a deal to acquire the U.S. based clinical stage gene therapy company, AveXis, Inc .AveXis is focused on developing novel treatments for patients suffering from rare and life-threatening neurological genetic diseases.Pursuant to the agreement, Novartis will execute the acquisition through its subsidiary for a cash-tender offer of $218 per share ($8.7 billion) of AveXis’ common stock, representing a premium of 88.1%. The culmination of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. Novartis anticipates completion of this buyout in the second half of 2018. Boards of both companies have approved the acquisition deal.Shares of Novartis, a Swiss drug maker, inched up 1.58% in pre-market trading on Apr 9, following the news release. The AveXis stock also soared 83.8% in pre-market trading session. The Novartis stock has outperformed the industry year to date, having lost 3.7% comapred with the industry’s decline of 4.8%. The impending buyout will add AveXis’ lead candidate, AVXS-101, to the acquirer’s portfolio, strengthening the latter’s presence in gene therapy and neuroscience space. AVXS-101 is being developed or the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a neurodegenerative disease, accounting for the highest genetic cause of death in infants.Notably, both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have granted AVXS-101 an orphan drug designation for the treatment of SMA and the FDA has granted AVXS-101, a fast track status for the treatment of SMA Type 1. The regulatory agency has also granted a breakthrough therapy designation to AVXS-101 for addressing SMA Type 1 in pediatric patients.A regulatory filing in the United States is expected in the second half of this year with a launch anticipated in 2019. The company also secured PRIME and Sakigake designations for the candidate in Europe and Japan, respectively.Significantly, an approved product for the cure of SMA in the United States is Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report), Spinraza (nusinersen), the first and the only treatment to get an FDA nod in the country for the indication.However, if approved, AVXS-101 would be the first-ever one-time gene replacement therapy for SMA in the United States.Apart from AVXS-101, the deal will also expand Novartis pipeline into other genetic disorders including Rett Syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Initially, though the acquisition is anticipated to negatively impact Novartis’ operating income due to increased research & development expenses, it is later on expected to substantially contribute to the company’s bottom line from 2020 onward.We remind investors that in January 2018, Novartis entered into a licensing agreement with Spark Therapeutics to develop and commercialize the latter’s gene therapy, Luxturna (voretigene neparvovec), in the markets outside the United States.We note that Luxturna was approved in the United States last December as a one-time gene therapy to restore functional vision in children and adult patients with biallelic mutations of the RPE65 (retinal pigment epithelial 65 kDa protein) gene.Novartis AG Price Novartis AG Price | Novartis AG Quote Zacks Rank & Key PickNovartis carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

32,BIIB,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) and partner Samsung Bioepis have announced resolution of an ongoing patent dispute with AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) regarding Biogen’s biosimilar version (Imraldi) of AbbVie’s blockbuster arthritis drug, Humira, in the EU. Per the settlement agreement, Biogen/Samsung Bioepis plans to launch Imraldi in Europe on Oct 16, 2018.Also in the United States, Samsung Bioepis entered into a settlement agreement with AbbVie, which would allow the former to bring Humira biosimilar into the U.S. market by Jan 31, 2023.Imraldi (or SB5) will be used for a whole range of indications including rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, active enthesitis-related arthritis, hidradenitis suppurativa and non-infectious uveitis.Notably, Imraldi is the second biosimilar version of Humira to be launched in the EU. Another biotechnology company, Amgen (AMGN), is also expected to launch its biosimilar version of Humira, in the EU come October this year as Amjevita, per a settlement with AbbVie.Notably, Amjevita was approved in the EU last March and approved in the United States in September 2016.In the United States, per settlement with AbbVie, Amjevita is likely to be launched on Jan 31, 2023.Shares of Biogen have underperformed its industry this year so far. The stock has lost 16.6% compared with the industry’s decrease of 6.3%.   We remind investors that Biogen has a joint venture with Samsung BioLogics for biosimilars called Samsung Bioepis, which already markets a couple of biosimilars in the EU, namely Flixabi, a biosimilar referencing J&J/Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Remicade and Benepali, a biosimilar referencing Amgen/Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Enbrel. This development in turn makes Imraldi the third anti-TNF biosimilar from Biogen to receive a marketing authorization in the EU.Biogen is also working with Samsung BioLogics to introduce new biosimilars to the market.Importantly, Biogen grossed biosimilar revenues of $380 million for a 12-month period ending December 2017 compared with $101 million, logged in 2016. This upside was primarily driven by Benepali, which recorded revenues of $370.8 million compared with the year-ago figure of $100.6 million on increased market share.Biogen Inc. Price Biogen Inc.

33,BIIB,"The Multiple Sclerosis (MS) space hit the headlines once again following biotech bigwig, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) and partner AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) decision to withdraw their jointly owned MS drug, Zinbryta voluntarily on a worldwide basis due to risk of liver injury. Both companies decided to withdraw the drug on grounds of the complex and evolving benefit/risk profile of Zinbryta, given the limited number of patients treated.In November 2017, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) concluded its review of Zinbryta. The review found that unpredictable and potentially fatal immune-mediated liver injury can occur during treatment with Zinbryta and for up to 6 months after stopping treatment. In clinical trials, 1.7% of patients receiving Zinbryta had a serious liver reaction.Given the complexity of the market, MS drugs have a long history of serious side effects, making it a risky therapeutic area.  An autoimmune inflammatory disease of the centrol nervous system, MS disrupts the normal functioning of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord through inflammation and tissue loss. There are three types of MS widely known to affect adults — relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS).The market for MS changed drastically with the introduction of oral formulations which are mostly preferred than injections. While there a variety of drugs available for MS, they come with their own set of risks mostly.Biogen is a dominant player in the MS market with drugs like Avonex, Tysabri, Tecfidera, Plegridy and Zinbryta.  However, the company has been under the scrutiny for pricing of MS drugs in 2017. Earlier, the emergence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) cases, a type of brain infection, associated with the use of Tysabri and Tecfidera had marred the prospects of MS drugs. The FDA thereafter updated the label of Tecfidera. Nevertheless, the company is a name to reckon with in the MS market.Earlier, the FDA also issued a warning against Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Gilenya for PML. The drug was recently granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Gilenya for the treatment of children and adolescents 10 years of age or older with relapsing MS. The drug is already approved for the same among adults. Novartis has another MS drug in its portfolio, Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg.  Sandoz, the company’s generic arm, recently won FDA approval for a generic version of Copaxone 40mg.Israel-based Teva Pharmceuticals (TEVA  -  Free Report) has long been in the MS market through its widely used drug Copaxone which is facing stiff competition for the last few years.Meanwhile, in the past, seizures were known side-effects of another MS drug, Ampyra. Seizure risk was seen to increase with higher blood levels of the drug.  As a result, the FDA had to update Ampyra’s label to clarify recommendations that kidney function should be checked in patients before starting Ampyra and monitored at least annually while Ampyra treatment continues.Nevertheless, the risks associated with the drugs have not deterred newer entrants which claim better formulations with lesser side effects. Consequently, the market has become too crowded.In March 2017, the FDA approved Roche’s (RHHBY) Ocrevus to treat adults with relapsing forms of MS and primary progressive multiple sclerosis. However, there were questions if Ocrevus was a new innovation or a reformulation of Roche’s older drug Rituxan. The drug sales aren’t that impressive yet either.The FDA recently issued Refusal to File letter to Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) New Drug Application (NDA) for ozanimod, which is in development for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The FDA determined that the nonclinical and clinical pharmacology sections in the NDA were insufficient to permit a complete review. Hence, the company is now gearing up to meet the FDA and determine the future course of action. While there haven’t been any safety issues reports, the delay will definitely open up avenues for competition.Given that so much is happening in this space, we expect investors to remain glued for further updates.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

34,BIIB,"Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. (ACOR  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings of 61 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2017, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.09. However, the bottom line significantly increased from the year-ago figure of 5 cents.Acorda’s shares decreased almost 2% following its earnings release. In fact the stock has dipped 0.8% in a year’s time, comparing favorably with the industry’s 1.6% decline. Total revenues came in at $188.4 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.5%. Moreover, the top line improved 34% year over year owing to higher net product as well as royalty revenues.Quarter in DetailMajority of Acorda’s net product revenues were generated by the company’s key drug Ampyra, which raked in sales of $167.2 million in the quarter. Revenues grew around 26% both year over year and sequentially.Ampyra is marketed in the ex-U.S. markets by Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) under the trade name, Fampyra. Biogen pays royalties to Acorda on the outside U.S. sales of Fampyra. Fampyra royalties were $3.1 million, up 14.8% year over year.Notably, in the fourth quarter, royalty revenues massively surged to $16 million from the year-ago figure of $4.4 million.Acorda’s research and development (R&D) expenses declined 35.2% year over year to $32.9 million. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses also lowered 35.7% to $34.1 million.Pipeline UpdatesIn December 2017, Acorda resubmitted the new drug application (NDA) to the FDA for its pipeline candidate, Inbrija, as a treatment option to address the OFF period symptoms in Parkinson’s affected people udergoing a carbidopa / levodopa regimen. The company expects a response from the regulatory agency this month.We remind investors that last August, the company had received a refusal-to-file letter from the FDA in connection with the NDA for Inbrija. The regulatory body deemed the application incomplete after a preliminary review and wanted some additional supporting information to reassess the filing. Subsequently, after discussing with the FDA to resolve the issue, the company resubmitted the same in the aforementioned period.Notably, Acorda has deferred its plan to submit regulatory applications for Inbrija in the EU to the first quarter of 2018, earlier expected to be filed by 2017-end.In November 2017, the company announced to have discontinued the phase III study on one of its lead Parkinson’s disease candidates, tozadenant. This decision was prompted by a serious safety issue detected in the study. Acorda expects to report the efficacy and safety data from the phase III trial in the first quarter of 2018.2017 ResultsFull-year sales increased 13.2% year over year to $588.3 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $578.6 million. The top line also surpassed the preliminary results of $542 million.The full-year earnings of $1.75 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.81. However, the bottom line is significantly higher than the year-ago figure of 25 cents.2018 GuidanceThe company maintained its Ampyra net sales guidance for 2018 in the range of $330-$350 million. This is lower than the Ampyra full year 2017 revenue of $543.3 million due to the expected generic entry of the drug in the United States in July, 2018.The company continues to project its R&D and SG&A expenses for 2018 in the band of $100-$110 million and $170-$180 million, respectively.Acorda awaits a positive cash balance in excess of $300 million by the end of 2018.Acorda Therapeutics, Inc.

35,BIIB,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that it is discontinuing another study evaluating verubecestat for the treatment of prodromal Alzheimer’s disease as its success was unlikely.APECS was a phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of verubecestat, an oral β-amyloid precursor protein site-cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibitor, versus placebo.The study was stopped on the recommendation of an external data monitoring committee, which assessed the study’s overall benefit/risk during a recent interim safety analysis. The committee said that the chances of observing positive risk/benefit profile in the study, if it continued, were slim.Shares of Merck declined almost 1% on Tuesday. In the past year, Merck’s shares have underperformed the industry. Merck’s shares have declined 15.8% in the period against a 10% increase for the industry.In February last year, Merck had discontinued another study, EPOCH (phase II/III), on verubecestat, which was evaluating it for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease due to lack of efficacy. At that time, the committee had recommended that the APECS study continue unchanged. The Alzheimer’s disease market has attracted a lot of attention from several companies. However, the successful development of therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease is challenging and we note that several companies have failed in this regard.Last month, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) reportedly said in a statement that it will end R&D efforts in the Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease areas, which will result in about 300 layoffs.Long back, Pfizer shelved its late-stage Alzheimer’s candidate, bapineuzumab IV after it failed two phase III studies.In December 2017, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced that an Alzheimer’s disease study on BAN2401 failed to show early positive results, which raised investor concern about the candidate’s chances of success.In November 2016, Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) anti-amyloid candidate solanezumab failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage AD study. Lilly decided to drop the development of solanezumab. Lilly also suffered a major setback in August 2010, when it had to halt the development of another phase III Alzheimer’s candidate, semagacestat.The Alzheimer’s disease market represents huge commercial potential and a successfully developed product could generate billions of dollars in sales once launched.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

36,BIIB,"Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 4, before market open.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 125%. The company has a mixed track record. It missed estimates twice in the four trailing quarters while beating the same on two occasions, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 26.25%.Notably, Ionis’ share price has decreased 14.4% so far this year, compared with the industry’s decline of 3.4%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Ionis is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (loss of 15 cents) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (loss of 11 cents), is -39.54%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Ionis’ Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to ConsiderIonis earns revenues in the form of upfront, milestone and other payments under its partnerships with leading health care companies like Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report).Ionis and Biogen have collaborated to develop and commercialize Spinraza. Ionis earns royalties on Spinraza sales from Biogen. Last week, Biogen released its first-quarter 2018 results and announced that Spinraza witnessed strong demand in the international markets.Ionis earned $30 million in the first quarter in license fees from AstraZeneca related to out-licensing of its fatty liver candidate, AZD2693.In December 2017, Ionis initiated a phase I study to evaluate antisense drug candidate, IONIS-JBI1-2.5Rx, in patients with gastrointestinal immune disorder. This will likely increase R&D cost in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Apart from Spinraza, Ionis is focused on two late-stage candidates, inotersen and volanesorsen. Regulatory applications for both the candidates are under review in the United States as well as Europe. These candidates are expected to receive approval in the second half 2018. Ionis is also gearing up for their launch.Ionis also granted an exclusive, worldwide license for inotersen to Akcea Therapeutics to leverage the latter’s commercial infrastructure and capabilities for a successful launch of the drug.We expect investor focus to be on launch plans for inotersen and volanesorsen on the first-quarter conference call.Subsequent to the quarter, Ionis announced top-line data from a phase I/II study on its antisense drug candidate, IONIS-HTTRx, which demonstrated that the candidate significantly reduced disease-causing protein and also improved clinical measures of Huntington's disease.Ionis has several mid-stage pipeline candidates for various indications. We expect the company to provide updates on different studies, including the path forward for inotersen and volanesorsen, on the first-quarter earnings call.Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

37,BIIB,"Alkermes plc (ALKS  -  Free Report) reported adjusted loss of 9 cents per share in the first quarter of 2018, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 8 cents. The bottom line was, however, narrower than the adjusted loss of 18 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter.The company’s revenues of $225.2 million in the quarter were up 17% year over year. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $222 million.The results were driven by strong growth of the company’s proprietary products, Vivitrol and Aristada.So far this year, Alkermes’ shares have lost 16.2%, compared with the  industry’s decline of 8%.Revenues RiseManufacturing and royalty revenues from Risperdal Consta, Invega Sustenna/ Xeplion and Invega Trinza/Trevicta were $68.8 million, up 14.7% year over year. The same from Ampyra/Fampyra were down 3.1% year over year to $28.3 million.Vivitrol sales improved 7.2% year over year to $62.7 million.Aristada sales came in at $29.2 million up 62.2% year over year.Costs RiseResearch and Development (R&D) expenses were $108.3 million, up 3.4% year over year.Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses were $118.1 million, up 15.7% year over year.2018 OutlookThe company expects total revenues in the range of $975-$1.025 billion, driven by continuous growth of Vivitrol and Aristada. Vivitrol sales are expected in the range of $300-$330 million while Aristada sales are anticipated to range $140-$160 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is $3.92 billion which is above the guidance range provided by the company.The company expects R&D expenses to range $415-$445 million.  The company now expects SG&A expenses to range from $515 million to $545 million, reduced from a previous expectation of $555-$585 million. This reduction is driven by the shift into 2019 of certain launch-related expenditures including the hiring of the ALKS 5461 sales force, and share-based compensation expense related to certain company-wide performance-based restricted stock unit awards, which vest upon FDA approval of ALKS 5461.For 2018, the company expects loss per share to be in the range of 6 cents per share to earnings in the range of 12 cents per share compared with the previous expectation of loss per share in the range of 3-23 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is $6.90 which is within the guidance range provided by the company.Pipeline UpdateThe FDA accepted the company’snew drug application (NDA) for ALKS 5461 for adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder and set an action date of Jan 31, 2019.The company completed enrollment for ENLIGHTEN-2, a six-month weight study for ALKS 3831 compared to olanzapine in patients with stable schizophrenia.

38,BIIB,"Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced encouraging data on multiple sclerosis (“MS”) drug Ocrevus at the 70th American Academy of Neurology (“AAN”) Annual Meeting, held from Apr 21-27 in Los Angeles, CA. The data revealed the efficacy of Ocrevus in relapsing multiple sclerosis (“RMS”) through several measures of underlying disease activity and disability progression, including magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”), cognitive function, and spinal fluid biomarkers of inflammation and neurodegeneration.The data showed that four years of continuous treatment with Ocrevus showed a sustained reduction in underlying disease activity in RMS from the open-label extension period.Patients who continued with Ocrevus maintained low numbers of T1 gadolinium-enhancing (T1Gd+) lesions (0.017 pre-OLE to 0.17 T1Gd+ lesions per scan at year four [year two of the OLE phase]) and new/enlarging T2 (N/ET2) lesions [0.052 pre-OLE to 0.080 N/ET2 lesions per scan] through year two of the OLE phase.The safety data was consistent with the drug’s favorable benefit-risk profile in both relapsing and primary progressive multiple sclerosis.Additonally, a second four-year analysis presented in a poster at AAN also revealed that patients who stayed on Ocrevus through year two of the OLE period sustained low annualized relapse rates  and 24-week confirmed disability progression.Those who switched from interferon beta-1a to Ocrevus experienced a significant decline in ARR by year one that was maintained through year two. Further, Ocrevus reduced the risk of 12- and 24-week confirmed cognitive decline (as defined by confirmed worsening on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test of at least four points) by 38 and 39% (p≤0.001 and p=0.002, respectively) during the 96-week period in people with RMS, compared to interferon beta-1a.Pooled data from phase III studies, OPERA I and OPERA II data, showed that patients with RMS at increased risk of progressive disease (as determined by baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale and pyramidal Kurtzke Functional Systems scores of at least four and two points, respectively) and treated with Ocrevus experienced a significant improvement in cognitive function compared with those taking interferon beta-1a through 96 weeks.In March 2017, the FDA approved Ocrevus to treat adults with relapsing forms of MS and primary progressive multiple sclerosis. However, there were uncertainties over Ocrevus being a new innovation or a reformulation of Roche’s older drug Rituxan. The drug sales aren’t that impressive yet either.  Roche’s stock has lost 10.6% over a year, as against the industry's gain of 8.7%.Last week, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) also announced encouraging data from the phase III study, EXPAND, on oral, once-daily siponimod (BAF312) in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (“SPMS”).Given the complexity of the market, MS drugs have a long history of serious side effects, making it a risky therapeutic area.  An autoimmune inflammatory disease of the centrol nervous system, MS disrupts the normal functioning of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord through inflammation and tissue loss. There are three types of MS widely known to affect adults — relapsing-remitting MS, SPMS and primary progressive MS.Competition is also stiff in the market. Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) is a dominant player in the MS market with drugs like Avonex, Tysabri, Tecfidera, Plegridy and Zinbryta.  The FDA recently issued Refusal to File letter to Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) New Drug Application for ozanimod, which is in development for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.Zacks RankRoche currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

39,BIIB,"Key highlights of the week include FDA’s acceptance of Regeneron/Sanofi's Dupixent sBLA for asthma, Biogen/AbbVie’s decision to withdraw multiple sclerosis drug, Zinbryta, due to risk of liver failure and Celgene’s completion of Juno acquisition.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesRegeneron/Sanofi's Dupixent sBLA for Asthma Accepted by FDA: Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has accepted for review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) of Dupixent (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults and adolescents (12 years of age or older) with moderate-to-severe asthma. The FDA has set a target action date of Oct 20, 2018 per the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. The sBLA was supported by results from the three pivotal trials from the LIBERTY ASTHMA clinical development program. Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of clinical development programs for diseases driven by Type 2 inflammation, including pediatric atopic dermatitis (phase III), nasal polyps (phase III) and eosinophilic esophagitis (phase III).(Read more: FDA Accepts Regeneron/Sanofi's Dupixent sBLA for Asthma)Regeneron is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.

Both companies decided to withdraw the drug on grounds of the complex and evolving benefit/risk profile of Zinbryta, given the limited number of patients being treated.  The drug is currently available in Europe and United States, Switzerland, Canada and Australia. While AbbVie distributes Zinbryta in the United States, Biogen distributes the drug in ex-U.S. markets.  The European regulatory authorities provisionally restricted the use of Zinbryta in adult patients with highly active relapsing disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one DMT or with rapidly evolving severe relapsing MS who are unsuitable for treatment with other DMTs following the report of a case of fatal fulminant liver failure, as well as four cases of serious liver injury.Gilead Reports New Data on Biktarvy: Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) announced encouraging results at 48 weeks from a phase III study (Study 1961) among 470 virologically suppressed adult women with HIV infection at the International Workshop on HIV and Women and at the 2018 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (“CROI”) in Boston (Poster 2539). Biktarvy was found to be statistically non-inferior to regimens containing a bPI or boosted elvitegravir and demonstrated no treatment-emergent resistance at 48 weeks in the ongoing study. Biktarvy, Gilead’s latest triple therapy, was approved by the FDA in February 2018 as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults who have no antiretroviral treatment history.(Read more: Gilead Announces Positive Data on New HIV Therapy Biktarvy)Celgene Completes Juno Acquisition: Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) announced that it has completed the previously-announced acquisition of Juno Therapeutics, Inc for $9 billion Juno focuses on the development of CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T and TCR (T cell receptor) therapeutics with a promising pipeline evaluating multiple targets and cancer indications. The acquisition will add JCAR017 (lisocabtagene maraleucel; liso-cel) to Celgene’s lymphoma pipeline. JCAR017 is a best-in-class CD19-directed CAR-T currently in a pivotal program for relapsed and/or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

40,BIIB,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 17.2% in the past month, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is BIIB due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Biogen Tops Sales in Q4, Misses EarningsFourth-quarter 2017 earnings per share were $5.26, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.44 by 3.3%. Earnings however rose 4% year over year as higher revenues made up for higher operating costs.Sales came in at $3.31 billion, up 15% from the year-ago period. Sales also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.07 billion by 7.6%.Higher MS sales and Spinraza outperformance led to the strong top-line performance in the quarter. Sales in the quarter also benefited from $40 million in inventory build and increased contract manufacturing (other revenues).The top line, excluding hemophilia revenues, grew 26% year over year.Quarter in DetailBiogen’s MS revenues were $2.3 billion (up 5%) in the quarter including approximately $77 million in royalties on the sales of Roche’s MS drug Ocrevus.Tecfidera’s sales increased 7% year over year and 1% sequentially to $1.08 billion. This included the U.S. sales of $831.6 million (up 4% year over year) and ex-U.S. sales of $244 million (up 20.6%).Patient growth across major European markets and strong emerging market growth drove international Tecfidera sales while a $20 million inventory build in the quarter benefited U.S. sales.Fourth-quarter Tysabri revenues were $463 million which decreased 2% year over year and 1% sequentially.Tysabri U.S. sales declined 13% to $252.1 million in the quarter. Biogen said that since Ocrevus launch, it has witnessed a decrease in the number of patient starts and an increase in discontinuation of Tysabri in the United States. International revenues rose 14% to $210.6 million in the quarter helped by a large order in Russia and patient growth in all major European countries following the label update in 2017.Combined interferon revenues (Avonex and Plegridy) in the fourth quarter were $645 million, down 6% from the year-ago period. Avonex revenues declined 8% from the year-ago period to $520 million. Plegridy contributed $125 million to fourth-quarter 2017 revenues, flat year over year as well as sequentially.U.S. Interferon revenues are experiencing declining trends due to patients transitioning to other oral or high efficacy MS therapies as well as due to higher discounts and allowance.Zinbryta, launched in collaboration with AbbVie, contributed $12 million to revenues in the fourth quarter compared with $14 million in third-quarter 2017.Newly launched Spinraza brought in revenues of $363 million in the fourth quarter, registering growth of 34% sequentially. As expected, Spinraza sales in the fourth quarter were mainly driven by ex-U.S. markets.Spinraza U.S. sales were $218 million in the fourth quarter, slightly better than $198 million in the third quarter. Biogen said that 25% of U.S. sales in the fourth quarter were from patients who receive less intensive maintenance doses (dosing only once/4 months), versus 10% in the third quarter.According to Biogen, 50% of Spinraza revenues will be derived from maintenance dosing by the end of 2018, which will help stabilize the growth trajectory.However, Biogen said the number of patients on therapy in the United States rose 33%  from the third quarter.In ex-U.S. markets, Spinraza recorded sales of $144 million, significantly higher than $73.3 million in the third quarter as it almost doubled the number of commercial patients on therapy. The company said that Germany, Turkey, and Japan accounted for over two-thirds of ex-U.S. revenues.In the quarter, Biogen recorded biosimilar revenues of $122 million compared with $101 million in the third quarter, driven primarily by Benepali, which recorded revenues of $117.6 million, up 18.5% sequentially  on increase in market share. Flixabi recorded revenues of $4.3 million compared with $2.2 million in the third quarter.Revenues from Anti-CD20 therapeutic programs, which include Biogen’s shares of Rituxan and Gazyva operating profits, climbed 6% from the year-ago period to $338 million.As expected, operating expenses were higher in the fourth quarter as the company continues to invest in its strategic priorities. R&D spend rose 11% year over year and 32% sequentially to $588 million, while SG&A spend rose 15% year over year and 28% sequentially to $554 million.2017 ResultsFull-year 2017 sales of $12.27 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.04 billion. Sales rose 7% year over year. The top line, excluding hemophilia revenues, grew 15% year over year.Adjusted earnings for 2017 were $21.81 per share, falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.98. Earnings rose 8% year over year.2018 OutlookBiogen guided earnings in the range of $24.20 and $25.20 per share, representing growth of 11% to 16%. Revenues are expected in the range of $12.7-$13.0 billion in 2018, representing year-over-year growth of 3.5% to 6%.In 2018, Biogen said its MS franchise’s sales growth, including Ocrevus royalties, will be roughly flat from 2017 levels. Excluding Ocrevus royalties, MS sales are expected to decline in a low single-digit range. As far as Spinraza is concerned, in 2018, a significant portion of the revenue growth is expected to come from outside the United States.While R&D expenses are expected to be approximately 16% to 17% of total revenues in 2018, SG&A is expected in the range of 15% to 16%, both lower than 2017 levels.First Quarter 2018 OutlookOn the call, the company said that seasonality and absence of inventory build (that benefitted fourth quarter 2017 results) will hurt the performance of its MS franchise in first quarter.Meanwhile, operating expenses are expected to be lower in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. However, earnings growth is expected to be higher in the second and fourth quarters of the year.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to one lower. While looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more upward momentum. There have been ten moves higher compared to five lower two months ago.Biogen Inc. Price and Consensus  Biogen Inc. Price and Consensus | Biogen Inc.

42,BIIB,"The fourth-quarter 2017 earnings season is in full swing with financial figures from 133 S&P 500 members or 26% of the index already out as of Jan 26, 2018 per the latest Earnings Preview.Total earnings for these index members jumped 12.3% from the year-ago quarter, driven by 8.8% improvement in revenues. The beat ratio was 81.2% for the bottom line and 78.9% for the top line.On a positive note, the ongoing earnings phase seems to have begun well for the Drug/Biotech sector. Among major large cap players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) kicked off the season with earnings beating estimates while sales slightly missing the same. A few other large pharma companies released their earnings results last week and the picture looks quite encouraging.The pharma bigwigs having reported last week are Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report), which surpassed both earnings and sales estimates in the quarter under review. While Novartis raised its sales guidance for 2018, AbbVie increased its previously issued earnings expectations for the year.Of the major players in the biotech sector, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced a mixed performance in the reported period with earnings lagging estimates while sales exceeding the same. However, Celgene Corp. (CELG  -  Free Report) outpaced both the metrics’ expectations during the fourth quarter.Drug/biotech stocks remained on a growth trajectory in 2017, courtesy of a slew of FDA approvals, rise in demand for new product sales, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical reports as well as a continued robust performance of legacy products. Moreover, these impressive factors, along with regular acquisitions, are expected to drive the sector’s growth in 2018 as well.Also, per the Earnings Preview, the broader Medical sector (inclusive of drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is likely to record 4.9% year-over-year growth in revenues and a 4.2% rise in earnings in the period under discussion.Two pharma/biotech giants are scheduled to report earnings numbers on Jan 31. Let's see how things are shaping up for the companies in the upcoming releases.Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report)Lilly is scheduled to release fourth-quarter earnings before the market opens. The company delivered a positive surprise of 1.94% last quarter. Lilly’s earnings performance has been modest with earnings missing expectations in three of the last four quarters while beating the same in the remaining one, thus bringing the average beat to 1.68%.Our proven model shows that Lilly is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. The combination of Lilly’s Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP as a solid Zacks Rank, and a positive Earnings ESP of +0.47% makes us confident about an earnings beat in the impending report. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is pegged at $1.08 per share.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.We expect a sturdy uptake of new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo. This upside is likely to make up for the decline in sales of established products like Zyprexa, Alimta, Cialis, Strattera and Effient in the fourth quarter. (Read More: Lilly to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Cards?).Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report)Vertex is slated to release fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes. The company’s track record has also been impressive so far. It delivered a positive surprise in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 32.67%. In third-quarter 2017, Vertex came up with a positive surprise of 43.24%.However, our proven model does not conclusively show that Vertex is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. Though the company’s favorable Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP, its Earnings ESP of -4.00% leaves surprise prediction inconclusive. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 58 cents per share. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Vertex’s cystic fibrosis (CF) drugs, Kalydeco & Orkambi, performed consistently in the first three quarters of 2017. We expect this uptrend to be reflected in the results of the soon-to-be reported quarter.

43,BIIB,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report), a well-known name in the multiple sclerosis (MS) market, will report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 25, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.70%.Biogen’s shares have risen 24% this year, better than the industry’s growth of 5.8% in the same time frame.  Biogen’s earnings performance has been pretty impressive so far, having delivered a positive surprise in each of the last four quarters. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 8.09%.Biogen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Biogen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Biogen Inc. Quote Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderOn the third-quarter call, the company had warned that seasonality and continued competitive pressure from Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) newly launched MS drug, Ocrevus will hurt the performance of its MS franchise in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, the combined number of patients using Avonex and Plegridy will continue to decline with patients transitioning to other oral MS therapies as well as due to higher discounts and allowance.Spinraza, approved for spinal muscular atrophy in December 2016, witnessed faster-than-anticipated adoption in the United States in the first half of 2017 backed by robust underlying demand. However Spinraza U.S. sales were slow in the third quarter due to unfavorable timing of induction doses as patients transitioned from intensive Spinraza treatment to a less intensive maintenance schedule. On the third-quarter call, the company had said that due to the impact of the dosing scheduling, Spinraza sales in the fourth quarter will mainly be driven by ex-U.S. markets.Biogen’s biosimilar products - Flixabi (a biosimilar referencing Remicade) and Benepali (a biosimilar referencing Enbrel) are also generating higher revenues. The trend should continue this quarter as well.On the third-quarter call, the company had also said that operating expenses will be higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third with the company investing in its strategic priorities.Investor focus on the fourth quarter call will remain on management’s comments on the impact of Ocrevus competition on Tecfidera’s sales/prescription trends, performance of Spinraza, pipeline progress and acquisition plans.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Biogen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -0.64% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at $5.42 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $5.45. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Biogen’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderBiotech stocks that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include:Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report), scheduled to release results on Feb 8, has an Earnings ESP of +5.93% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Emergent BioSolutions Inc. (EBS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +22.65% and a Zacks Rank #3.

By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

44,BIIB,"Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report), in a bid to strengthen its blood disorder portfolio, is acquiring Bioverativ Inc. , which is focused on developing therapies for hemophilia and other rare blood disorders.Sanofi has offered $105 per share, a premium of almost 64% to the closing price of Bioverativ as on Jan 19, to acquire all outstanding shares in an all-cash deal amounting to $11.6 billion. The transaction is approved by both boards.We remind investors that Bioverativ was part of Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) before the latter spun it off in February 2017.Bioverativ began trading on Nasdaq from Feb 2.Shares of Sanofi were down almost 3% in pre-market trading on Jan 22, presumably due to the high cost of acquisition while shares of Bioverative were up 62.6%. Meanwhile, the company’s shares have increased 11% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 24% in the same time frame.    The acquisition should be beneficial for Sanofi as it can leverage the expertise of Bioverativ in rare blood disorder therapies, especially haemophilia. Moreover, the deal is line with Sanofi’s long-term outlook to strengthen its presence in specialty care and leadership in rare diseases.Bioverativ’s Eloctate and Alprolix are the standard of care for the treatment of hemophilia A and B, respectively. The company generated sales of $847 million in 2016.The deal also strengthens Sanofi’s pipeline by adding a phase III candidate for cold agglutinin disease and other early stage candidates in hemophilia and other rare blood disorders, including sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia.Sanofi is currently developing its RNA-based therapy, fitusiran, for treating haemophilia. The company can now use Bioverativ’s clinical expertise and existing commercial platform to advance the candidate’s development. We note that Sanofi, earlier this month, gained global development and commercialization rights to fitusiran after it restructured its rare disease alliance with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALNY  -  Free Report).Per the press release, the current haemophilia market stands at $10 billion, which is expected to grow 7% annually until 2022. Adding two standard of care products to its portfolio will certainly boost Sanofi’s prospect in this lucrative market.Sanofi expects the acquisition to be accretive to earnings per share in 2018 and an addition of add another 5% to it in 2019.Sanofi Price  Sanofi Price | Sanofi Quote Zacks RankSanofi carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

45,BIIB,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings per share of $5.26, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.44 by 3.3%. Earnings however rose 4% year over year as higher revenues made up for higher operating costs.Sales came in at $3.31 billion, up 15% from the year-ago period. Sales also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.07 billion by 7.6%.We remind investors that last year Biogen spun off its hemophilia business into a new company called Bioverativ . Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report), earlier this week, announced that it has offered to buy Bioverativ for $11.6 billion.Quarter in DetailBiogen’s multiple sclerosis (MS) revenues were $2.3 billion (up 5%) in the quarter including approximately $77 million in royalties on the sales of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) MS drug, Ocrevus. Per a deal with Roche, Biogen is entitled to receive royalties on U.S. sales of Ocrevus.In the quarter, MS sales in the United States included inventory buildup of $40 million, which benefited revenues.Oral MS drug, Tecfidera’s sales increased 7% year over year and 1% sequentially to $1.08 billion. The other MS drug, Tysabri’s sales decreased 2% year over year and 1% sequentially to $463 million.Combined interferon revenues (Avonex and Plegridy) in the fourth quarter were $645 million, down 6% from the year-ago period. Avonex revenues declined 8% from the year-ago period to $520 million. Plegridy contributed $125 million to fourth-quarter 2017 revenues, flat year over year as well as sequentially.U.S. Interferon revenues are experiencing declining trends due to patients transitioning to other oral MS therapies as well as due to higher discounts and allowance.Zinbryta, launched in collaboration with AbbVie, contributed $12 million to revenues in the fourth quarter compared with $14 million in third-quarter 2017.Newly launched Spinraza brought in revenues of $363 million in the fourth quarter, registering growth of 34% sequentially.Spinraza U.S. sales were $218 million in the fourth quarter, much better than $198 million in the third quarter. Inventory levels were flat in the fourth quarter. In ex-U.S. markets, Spinraza recorded sales of $144 million, significantly higher than $73.3 million in the third quarter. The company said that Spinraza international revenues were mainly from Germany, Turkey, and Japan.In the quarter, Biogen recorded biosimilar revenues of $122 million compared with $101 million in the third quarter.Revenues from Anti-CD20 therapeutic programs, which include Biogen’s shares of Rituxan and Gazyva operating profits, climbed 6% from the year-ago period to $338 million.As expected, operating expenses were higher in the fourth quarter as the company continues to invest in its strategic priorities. R&D spend rose 11% year over year and 32% sequentially to $588 million, while SG&A spend rose 15% year over year and 28% sequentially to $554 million.2017 ResultsFull-year 2017 sales of $12.27 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.04 billion. Sales rose 7% year over year. The top line, excluding hemophilia revenues, grew 15% year over year.Adjusted earnings for 2017 were $21.81 per share, falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.98. Earnings rose 8% year over year.2018 OutlookBiogen guided earnings in the range of $24.20 and $25.20 per share, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.18 per share. Revenues are expected in the range of $12.7-$13.0 billion in 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $12.72 billion.While R&D expenses are expected to be approximately 16% to 17% of total revenues in 2018, SG&A is expected in the range of 15% to 16%.Our TakeBiogen had a mixed fourth quarter as it beat estimates for earnings but missed the same for sales. Higher MS sales and strong Spinraza performance led to the strong top-line performance in the quarter. The revenue beat and the upbeat outlook for 2018 led shares to rise more than 3% in pre-market trading.Biogen’s shares have risen 19.6% in the past year, better than the industry’s growth of 9.6% in the same time frame.Biogen has a strong portfolio of MS products. However, the overall growth trends in the multiple sclerosis market are gradually slowing down. Tecfidera’s U.S. patient demand has been declining due to increasing competition from oral medicines and a slowdown in the overall MS market. As competition in the MS market intensifies, Biogen is diversifying beyond MS to other areas like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and stroke, among others. The company said it has made seven additions to its neuroscience pipeline in 2017 and expects several important data readouts in 2018.Biogen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

46,BIIB,"We have completed just three weeks in 2018 and the biotech sector is already seeing a significant pickup in merger and acquisition (M&A) deals. The year started off with Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) announcing its intention to acquire Impact Biomedicines.Soon thereafter, Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report) confirmed that it is looking to acquire Belgium-based biopharma company Ablynx. Novo Nordisk had initially proposed to acquire Ablynx for €26.75 per share in cash. However, the company came back with a revised offer when Ablynx rejected the first proposal. Novo Nordisk’s latest offer includes an upfront cash payment of €28 per share plus a contingent value right (“CVR”) worth up to €2.50 per share (total equity valuation of approximately €2.6 billion). This offer, too, has been rejected by Ablynx with the company’s Board announcing that the proposal fundamentally undervalues Ablynx and its growth prospects.Last week, Celgene was once again in the news on rumors that it is looking to acquire immuno-oncology focused Juno Therapeutics . Yesterday, the rumors were confirmed with the company saying that it will be acquiring Juno for approximately $9 billion. Another acquisition announcement was made yesterday – French pharma giant Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) said that it will be buying biopharma company Bioverativ for $11.6 billion. While Celgene is looking to strengthen its presence in the cancer space with the Impact and Juno acquisitions, Sanofi is looking to expand its presence in specialty care and strengthen its leadership in rare diseases through the Bioverativ acquisition.More M&A Deals to Follow?With these announcements being made, expectations are pretty high for more such deals in 2018. In fact, last week Acorda Therapeutics’s shares were up on rumors that Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) is interested in acquiring the company.Factors like growing biosimilar competition, slowdown in growth of legacy products, major pipeline setbacks, looming patent expiries, pricing challenges and growing competition have forced big players to seek deals and acquisitions to grow their pipelines and boost their revenue stream.With tax reform expected to lead to an increase in cash repatriation, 2018 seems set for more M&A announcements. Companies like Pfizer, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Biogen, Merck, Johnson & Johnson and Gilead are expected to be on the lookout for suitable deals this year. At the end of the third quarter of 2017, Gilead (which had acquired Kite for approximately $11.9 billion in 2017) had a cash and equivalents balance of $41.4 billion including $32.4 billion of overseas cash. Amgen’s cash balance was also $41.4 billion as of Sep 30, 2017 with about $38.9 billion being held overseas. Meanwhile, Merck exited the third quarter of 2017 with cash and equivalents worth $23.4 billion of which about 80%-90% is held overseas. Bristol-Myers Squibb’s overseas cash holdings were approximately $9.4 billion at the end of the third quarter. Biogen’s overseas cash balance was approximately $4.4 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2017. While some of this cash is likely to be used for share buybacks and dividend payments, these companies are also expected to use the funds for acquisition deals.  Most of these companies are on the lookout for assets and technologies that are potentially transformational and/or address unmet needs. Immuno-oncology is currently very much in demand though companies are also focusing on rare disease and orphan disease areas. While valuations look high for cancer-focused companies especially ones involved in immuno-oncology, valuations appear to be more reasonable for specialty pharma companies and companies that are focused on central nervous system diseases and other such areas.Although many of the large-cap players have expressed an interest in pursuing M&A deals, they have also pointed out that the deals should make sense from a financial perspective. High valuations and bidding wars could keep some of the key players on the sidelines.Companies like AveXis, bluebird, BioMarin, Puma Biotechnology, Incyte, and Exelixis (EXEL  -  Free Report) are often considered acquisition targets. Exelixis is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

47,BIIB,"2017 turned out to be a pretty good year for pharma and biotech stocks with the Nasdaq Biotechnology index and the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical index gaining 18.7% and 11.8%, respectively. Although the industry continued to face headwinds in the form of drug pricing scrutiny, pricing pressure, increasing competition, concerns regarding Amazon’s interest in entering the healthcare arena, fewer-than-expected acquisition deals and major pipeline setbacks, there were some positive developments as well. There was a significant surge in FDA approvals, investors appeared more comfortable with the drug pricing controversy and innovation won the day with the FDA granting approval to gene therapies for cancer as well as a rare form of blindness. Tax reforms are also expected to work in the sector’s favor with mergers and acquisitions (M&As) expected to pick up in the coming quarters.New product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, continued strong performance from key products, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep the momentum in 2018.As we start the New Year, here is a look at three drug stocks that look well-positioned for 2018 and are witnessing upward estimate revisions and have a favorable Zacks Rank - Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).Alkermes plc (ALKS  -  Free Report): Alkermes is focused on the development and marketing of treatments for central nervous system (""CNS"") diseases. Key disease areas include schizophrenia, depression, addiction and multiple sclerosis. Earlier this year, the company said that its current commercial business has the potential to generate revenues in excess of $2 billion into the 2020s.Alkermes also a strong late-stage pipeline representing transformative catalysts in 2018. The company could gain FDA approval by June 30 for a NanoCrystal dispersion of Aristada (schizophrenia). Meanwhile, Alkermes expects to complete filing a rolling submission for ALKS 5461 (major depressive disorder) in January with a potential advisory committee meeting and FDA decision in the second half of the year. The company also expects to submit a new drug application (“NDA”) for ALKS 8700 (multiple sclerosis) in the second half of the year. Data on ALKS 3831 (schizophrenia) is also due this year (metabolic study data in the first half and ENLIGHTEN-2 data in Fall 2018) – the NDA submission for this candidate is scheduled for the first half of 2019. Alkermes has a global license and collaboration agreement with Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) for ALKS 8700 for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.Alkermes has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being revised 50% upward over the last 30 days. The company also beat expectations in two of the last three quarters with an average surprise of 75% and has an Earnings ESP of +46.48% for the fourth quarter of 2017. Alkermes, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, has seen its shares gain 5.9% over the last one year compared to the 1.5% rally of the industry it belongs to.XOMA Corporation (XOMA  -  Free Report): XOMA is focused on the discovery, development and licensing of therapeutic antibodies. The company has several licensing agreements with other biotech and pharma companies which provide it with funds in the form of upfront and milestone payments and potential royalty payments. XOMA’s shares have been on an upward trajectory from August following the signing of licensing agreements with Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) for gevokizumab and intellectual property covering the use of IL-1 beta targeting antibodies in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. This deal resulted in XOMA receiving upfront payments including an equity investment. The agreement terms also resulted in a 50% reduction in XOMA's outstanding debt through the repayment of its €12 million obligation to Les Laboratoires Servier and the extension of the company’s maturity date for its debt to Novartis by a couple of years. XOMA also stands to earn significant milestone payments and tiered royalties on sales of gevokizumab. Additional such licensing deals for the rest of the pipeline would be a major boost for the stock, which has seen its shares soar 587.9% over the past year.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 loss has been lowered 57.6% over the last 30 days. XOMA is a Zacks Rank #1 stock – you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. XOMA has an Earnings ESP of +10.68% for the fourth quarter of 2017.Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. (EIGR  -  Free Report): Clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, Eiger, is focused on the development and commercialization of therapies for rare diseases. Some of the diseases being addressed by the company's pipeline include hepatitis delta virus (lonafarnib and lambda), pulmonary arterial hypertension (ubenimex), post-bariatric hypoglycemia (exendin 9-39) and lymphedema (ubenimex). Regulatory and clinical announcements for all these programs are expected in 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 loss for the Zacks Rank #2 stock has been lowered 6.7% over the last 30 days. Eiger’s shares are up 32.3% over the last one year.While Eiger has surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters, the Earnings ESP for the fourth quarter of 2017 is +0.73%.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

48,BIIB,"Quite a few pharmaceutical industry mergers – including some large deals - may be in the cards in 2018 now that the tax reforms are in place. The tax bill was signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump in December last yearThe tax rate for corporates will now go down from 35% to 21%, which can boost profits of large drug/biotech companies. Meanwhile, the change in tax code will also allow companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%. Also the tax cuts are expected to prevent inversions, which were rampant in the drug industry.These changes should definitely leave more cash in the hands of drug/biotech companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been few in 2017 compared to 2016.Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) nearly $12 billion acquisition of Kite Pharma and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) $30 billion acquisition of Swiss biotech Actelion were the only two noteworthy deals of 2017.This week, senior executives from some of the largest pharmaceutical/biotech companies discussed the impact of tax reform on mergers and acquisition and their plans to use the excess cash at the JP Morgan HealthCare conference.What the CEOs Said?Brent Saunders, chief executive officer (CEO) of Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) said that the first half of the year is likely to see smaller deals such as the one by Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) while the bigger high profile mergers of large pharmaceuticals/biotech companies would probably happen in the latter half of the year or next year.Last week, Celgene announced that it has offered to buy a small cancer drug developer, Impact Biomedicines. (Read More: Celgene to Acquire Impact Biomedicines to Boost Pipeline).Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) CEO Dave Ricks and J&J’s Chief Financial Officer, Dominic Caruso said that with the tax cuts, American companies can compete better with their foreign counterparts, which operate in better tax environments. Caruso said the new tax law provides “more flexibility and ease of analysis in terms of getting a transaction done”.Along the same lines, Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) CEO, Meg Tirrell, said that having access to overseas cash will give it more financial flexibility to “think about different ways to go about the M&A transactions”. Tirrell, however, confidently said that even before the new tax law was implemented, the company had “enough power in their balance sheet” to make the bolt-on acquisitions it wanted to do.Michel Vounatsos, Biogen's (BIIB  -  Free Report) CEO, smartly argued that though the tax overhaul may spur some M&A activity, the rationale behind any M&A activity should not be the cash available. He went on to say that they are looking at “all sets of potential targets”.Gilead CEO, John Milligan, said that the tax reform is good for the company as it “allows to plan for the long term” since the FDA approval process is quite lengthy. Meanwhile, it maintained its goal of investing in M&A to replenish the pipeline. He also said that the excess cash will allow it to clean up its balance sheet by repaying debt.Conclusion Overall, it is quite clear that the drug industry is optimistic that the tax reform will fuel greater M&A activity in 2018.As it is, major drug/biotech players struggling with organic growth need an infusion of new growth drivers in their pipeline/product portfolios — either from internal development or from buyouts. Strategic M&A and licensing deals are therefore inevitable for innovation starved drug/biotech companies looking for growth in a highly competitive and global marketplace.Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies sitting on huge piles of cash may prefer to buy innovative small/mid cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines. What matters for companies looking to buy a drug/biotech stock is the current sales performance of the latter’s drugs/products, prospects of sales growth, and the quality of the pipeline.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

49,BIIB,"Key highlights of the week include Regeneron announcing positive data on Praluent, Sarepta seeking rapid approval of second DMD drug, while Orexigen filing for bankruptcy.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesRegeneron/Sanofi Announce Positive Data on Praluent, Cuts Price: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) announced positive results from the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial on Praluent during a late-breaker session at the American College of Cardiology's 67th Annual Scientific Session in Orlando, FL. The trial met the primary endpoint as results showed that Praluent significantly reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (“MACE”) in patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome (“ACS”) event such as a heart attack. In June 2017, Regeneron and Sanofi announced that two phase IIIb/IV ODYSSEY-DM trials in patients with diabetes met their primary endpoints. Though the uptake of the drug hasn’t been encouraging, the cholesterol management market holds huge commercial potential.

50,BIIB,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) has agreed to acquire a phase IIb ready candidate, PF-04958242, which is being developed for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS) from pharma giant Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report).For the deal, Biogen will make an upfront payment of $75 million to Pfizer along with which the latter will also be entitled to up to $515 million in development/commercialization milestone payments and potential royalties.In the latter half of the year, Biogen will initiate a phase IIb study on PF-04958242 to determine if the AMPA receptor potentiator is safe and effective in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia patients.Schizophrenia patients often experience significant deficits in cognitive function – the ability to make sense. The majority of more than 20 million people living with schizophrenia worldwide witness some degree of cognitive dysfunction, according to Biogen’s press release. However, this negative symptom of schizophrenia has been particularly difficult to treat.Biogen’s shares have declined 12.1% this year so far, underperforming the industry’s rise of 3.1% in the same time frame.The deal, which marks Biogen’s entry into the emerging market for neuropsychiatry, is in sync with its strategy to diversify its pipeline beyond its core therapeutic area - multiple sclerosis - to neurodegenerative disorders. Last year, Biogen added seven new clinical stage programs to its neuroscience pipeline through advancing internal pipeline candidates as well as through external deals.Biogen’s Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pipeline comprises candidates with different mechanisms of action including anti-tau candidate (BIIB092 - with potential in AD as well as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)), anti-amyloid (aducanumab) candidates as well as a BACE inhibitor (elenbecestat) program.Meanwhile, Biogen’s spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) treatment, Spinraza (nusinersen), approved in late 2016, has consolidated its position in the neurological disease market with the drug being the first and only treatment to be approvedin the United States for SMA. The market potential of the disease is huge. The drug has performed beyond expectations so far, witnessing strong patient uptake in the United States and internationally.In December last year, Biogen formed a new collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IONS  -  Free Report) to identify antisense oligonucleotide drug candidates for the treatment of SMA. Biogen will have the option to license therapies arising out of this collaboration. Also, Biogen plans to start phase I study on a gene therapy asset for SMA by mid-2018.Biogen is also building a portfolio of best-in-class treatments for stroke and acute neurology. In Maylast year, Biogen purchased a phase III candidate, BIIB093/Cirara from Remedy Pharmaceuticals, which is being studied for the treatment of large hemispheric stroke (LHI), a severe form of stroke with no available therapy.Biogen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the biotech sector is Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report) which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank  stocks here.Ligand’s earnings per share estimates have moved up by 9.8% for 2018 and 21% for 2019 in the last 30 days.

51,BIIB,"The Q4 earnings season for the pharma/biotech sector was scattered with a few small biotech companies yet to report. The releases so far provide us with a clear picture of the sector’s performance.Overall, the sector performed reasonably well. Among the biotech/pharma bigwigs, Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report), Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) and Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) beat earnings and revenue estimates. Meanwhile, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced mixed results with earnings beating estimates and sales lagging the same. However, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) had a rather weak quarter as it missed expectations for earnings and sales and also issued a lower-than-expected sales guidance for 2018.Drug/biotech stocks remained on a growth trajectory in 2017. Ramp up in new product sales, successful innovation and product line expansion, favorable clinical study results, frequent FDA approvals, strong performance by key products, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep driving the sector. A faster drug approval process, the proposed removal of outdated regulations that push up costs and a slowdown in innovation should also prove beneficial.The year started off on expectations of a pick-up in M&A activity. The new tax law, which cuts corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and encourages companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%, is expected to spur merger activity this year.Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report), earlier this year, announced deals to buy Belgian biotech company, Ablynx, and haemophilia-focused biotech firm — Bioverativ.Banking on the positive trend and impressive Q4 performance, it might be the perfect time to cash in on the bountiful prospects in this growing market. Here we have picked three biotech stocks which saw positive estimate revisions post Q4 earnings release and also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Earnings estimate revisions have the greatest impact on stock prices. Stocks with rising estimates have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 index year after year. Hence, investors can safely bet on stocks that have been seeing an upward movement in earnings estimates. All the three companies have also seen a steady rally in the share price post Q4 results.Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report)The San Diego, CA-based biotechnology company, Ligand, carries a Zacks Rank #2. The stock witnessed positive estimate revision over the last 30 days. The company released fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 21. It has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings rise 9.8% for 2018 and 21.1% for 2019. The company surpassed earnings and revenue estimates in fourth-quarter 2017 mainly on higher royalty revenues. Additionally, shares of the company have rallied 16.8% post its Q4 earnings release.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report)The Tarrytown, NY-based biopharmaceutical company, Regeneron, witnessed positive estimate revision over the last 60 days. The company released fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 8. The Zacks Rank #1 stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings rise 9.7% and 6.4% for 2018 and 2019, respectively. Regeneron’s fourth-quarter results were impressive as both earnings and sales beat estimates on strong sales of the company’s key marketed drug, Eylea. Shares of the company have rallied 7.1% after it released Q4 earnings release.Horizon Pharma plc (HZNP  -  Free Report)Based in Dublin, Ireland, Horizon Pharma carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings move 10% up in the last 30 days for 2018 and 14.9% for 2019. The company released fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 26. Shares of the company have gained 5% post Q4 earnings announcement. Horizon Pharma also beat earnings and sales estimates in fourth-quarter 2017 backed by strong performance by its Orphan unit. The company’s sales guidance for 2018 is encouraging as well.OutlookWhile 2017 was strong, this year is expected to be a vital one for the biotech sector as these companies continue to invest in pipeline, build global business and drive new product growth.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

52,BIIB,"PDL BioPharma, Inc. (PDLI  -  Free Report) has reported earnings of 17 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2017, substantially surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 cents. However, the company reported a loss of 5 cents in the year-ago quarter.The company generated total revenues of $68 million in the quarter, up 2.3% from $66.5 million, registered a year earlier. This upside is mainly attributable to rise in royalty rights primarily on the back of an increase in fair value of the Depomed royalty asset in the reported period.Notably, the company received cash payments of $32.8 million from the royalty rights acquired from Depomed, primarily related to Glumetza, a product marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (VRX  -  Free Report). An authorized generic version of Glumetza was also launched by a Valeant subsidiary in February 2017 for which, PDL BioPharma got royalties per the same terms as the branded Glumetza agreement.PDL BioPharma’s shares rallied 19% in after-hours trading on Mar 8 owing to higher earnings. Moreover, the company has outperformed the industry in a year’s time. The stock has jumped 23.2% against the industry’s decrease of 3.5%. Quarter in DetailRevenues included royalties of $4.5 million from licenses to the Queen et al. patents, interest revenues of $0.8 million and product revenues of $32.6 million (sales of Noden products — Tekturna and Tekturna HCT in the United States and leasing of the LENSAR Laser System).Revenues of $4.5 million from the Queen et al. licenses were lower than the prior-year figure of $15.5 million. This downside was mainly due to expiration of a patent license agreement of PDL BioPharma with Roche's (RHHBY  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Genentech, for its humanized antibody products. The Queen et al. licenses royalty including royalties from the sale of Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) multiple sclerosis drug, Tysabri, also declined in the quarter under review on lower sales of the product.Research and development (R&D) expenses for the fourth quarter came in at $0.7 million, down 63.2% from the level, recorded a year ago.General and administrative expenses also decreased 22.2% to nearly $9.8 million from the figure in comparable quarter last year.2017 ResultsWhile full-year sales surged 31% year over year to $320 million, full-year earnings of 64 cents per share were lower than the year-ago tally of 66 cents.PDL BioPharma, Inc.

53,BIIB,"In spite of the increasing incidence of Alzheimer's, there is no recognized drug that can cure or slow the progress of the disease. The Alzheimer's Association claims that in every 66 seconds, an American develops Alzheimer's. People living with Alzheimer's find it extremely difficult to carry out daily functions and hence need to be under supervision round the clock.Coming to other life-threatening conditions, CNBC reports that deaths related to Alzheimer’s have skyrocketed 89% while those following heart diseases have dropped 14% since the turn of the century.Detection Years Before Onset of Alzheimer'sA blood test has been introduced to detect Alzheimer's almost two decades before a patient shows any noticeable symptoms. Last year, Dr. Randall Bateman of Washington University announced that the test will be able to detect the accumulation of amyloid beta in the brain. The buildup of the toxic protein is among the first signs of the deadly disease.Also, in January, a team of researchers from Japan and Australia introduced a blood test with accuracy as high as 90% for the detection of the disease. Dr. Bateman employed the mass spectrometry testing for identifying the protein. According to the email of Bateman to CNBC, scientists from Japan had developed an identical mass-spectrometry investigative procedure for protein detection which came up with similar results.  Blood Tests to Speed Up Drug ResearchClinical trials for drugs that could delay the start of the disease failed a number of times, thanks to the unavailability of a decent number of qualified patients, revealed Dr. Jeff Cummings of the Cleveland Clinic. Hence, the wider the patient base, higher will be the possibility of meaningful clinical trials.With the new blood tests, doctors will be able to detect patients early and include them in clinical trials for the development of effective preventive treatments. Also, there would be proper utilization of millions of dollars of federal government funding for the preventive treatment.Importantly, the blood tests will be the most efficient way to detect Alzheimer's as other alternatives are quite expensive. Lumbar puncture for the early diagnosis is among the alternatives that collect cerebrospinal fluid. For the process, a needle is inserted in the lower back of patients, giving rise to the need for local anesthetic. Positron emission tomography is another process that could cost at least $7000. Also, the accuracy of the PET scans is significantly lower than the blood tests.Dr. Robert Vassar of Northwestern University has also backed the efficiency of blood tests over other methods for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's. Meanwhile, Dr. Bateman added that the blood tests will be more in demand once proper preventive measures have been established.Stocks to GainPeople all over the world will likely gain access to the tests in the coming few years, per Dr. Bateman.However, the question that looms large is what is the next course of action for those who find out that they are at a risk of developing Alzheimer’s? Meanwhile, the launch of the blood tests paves the way for advanced clinical trials.More than 5 million people are estimated to be living with the disease in the United States, per The Alzheimer's Association. Notably, the health organization expects this number to rise more than three times by 2050.As Alzheimer's is a pressing concern, there is massive business potential in this space. Hence, the launch of the blood tests will help companies focused on developing preventive treatments make billions.Based in Cambridge, MA, Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) has been paying particular attention on stepping up research work on Alzheimer’s. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 6.9%. Also, we expect the company to witness earnings growth of 13.7% and 4.7% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.It has been almost 30 years that Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) — headquartered in Indianapolis, IN — is fighting Alzheimer’s. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the last four quarters. We also expect the company to post earnings growth of 13.1% and 8.8% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.In fact, for treating patients with early Alzheimer’s symptoms, AstraZeneca PLC (AZN  -  Free Report) and Eli Lilly are jointly developing Lanabecestat — a small molecule therapy candidate.Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), headquartered in Kenilworth, NJ, has been focusing on research for treating Alzheimer's. The company is expected to post earnings growth of 4.8% and 2.9% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Merck also managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters.Biogen, Eli Lilly and Merck carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

54,BIIB,"Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 27, before market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 100%. The company has a disappointing track record and missed estimates twice in the four trailing quarters while beating the same on two occasions, delivering an average negative earnings surprise of 6.67%.Notably, Ionis’ share price has increased 12.4% in the past year, compared with the Zacks classified industry’s decline of 0.3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Ionis is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 8 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Although Ionis’ Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, its 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to ConsiderIonis earns revenues in the form of upfront, milestone and other payments under its partnerships with leading health care companies like Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report).Ionis and Biogen received FDA approval for Spinraza in December 2016 for treating spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”). The drug was approved in Europe in June 2017 as the first treatment for SMA. Ionis and Biogen have collaborated to develop and commercialize Spinraza and Ionis earns royalties on Spinraza sales from Biogen.Last week, Biogen released its fourth-quarter 2017 results and announced that Spinraza has witnessed strong demand globally driving sales. The company is evaluating the drug in two clinical studies to reinforce the favorable efficacy and safety profile.Ionis earned $70 million during the quarter in milestone and license fees from several drug companies related to initiation of clinical studies or license transfer of pipeline candidates.In December 2017, Ionis and Biogen entered into a collaboration agreement to identify new antisense oligonucleotide drug candidates for treating SMA.Apart from Spinraza, we expect investor focus to be on pipeline updates on the fourth-quarter conference call.During the quarter, Ionis and Akcea submitted regulatory applications to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) and the FDA for Inotersen for the treatment of patients with hereditary TTR amyloidosis (hATTR). The regulatory application in Europe will be reviewed under Accelerated Assessment program and the FDA has also granted priority review in January 2018. These suggest faster review of the applications.Marketing application for another pipeline candidate, Volanesorsen, for the treatment of patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (“FCS”) is under review in the United States, Europe and Canada.Ionis has several mid-stage pipeline candidates for various indications. We expect the company to provide updates on different studies, including the path forward for Inotersen and Volanesorsen, on the fourth-quarter earnings call.Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

55,BIIB,"The FDA has proposed new guidelines, which are aimed at lowering the clinical study goals of Alzheimer’s disease drugs for treating earlier-stage patients who have not yet displayed functional disability or clinical abnormality. This strategy, part of FDA’s ongoing efforts to expand access to safe and effective treatment options for many serious conditions, suggests that the agency may be open to an accelerated approval process for such drugs.FDA’s proposed guidelines came in a week when major disappointments in the field were announced by companies developing drugs to treat this deadly brain disease.Earlier this week, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that it is discontinuing another study evaluating verubecestat for the treatment of prodromal Alzheimer’s disease as its success was unlikely.Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) also announced that it has decided to increase the number of patients (enrolment) in studies being conducted on its crucial Alzheimer’s disease candidate, aducanumab, which raised concerns regarding the chances of success of the treatment. In December 2017, Biogen’s Alzheimer’s disease study on another candidate, BAN2401 failed to show early positive results, which raised investor concern about the candidate’s chances of success.The Alzheimer’s disease market has attracted a lot of attention from several companies. However, the successful development of therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease is challenging.This may be somewhat because the underlying causes of severe neurological ailments like Alzheimer’s may not be as clear as diseases like cancer. Also, Alzheimer’s  progress may go unnoticed for years. By the time, the symptoms of the ailment become evident, significant function may already be lost, which makes developing drugs to treat this disease difficult.We note that several companies have failed in this regard.Last month, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) reportedly announced the termination of its R&D efforts in the Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease areas, which will result in about 300 layoffs. Long back, Pfizer shelved its late-stage Alzheimer’s candidate, bapineuzumab IV after it failed two phase III studies.In November 2016, Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) anti-amyloid candidate solanezumab failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage AD study. Lilly decided to drop the development of solanezumab. Lilly also suffered a major setback in August 2010, when it had to halt the development of another phase III Alzheimer’s candidate, semagacestat.The Alzheimer’s disease market represents huge commercial potential and a successfully developed product could generate billions of dollars in sales once launched.FDA’s latest effort may reinvigorate research efforts for Alzheimer’s drugs after repeated failures.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

56,BIIB,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced that its multiple sclerosis (MS) product, Tysabri (natalizumab) failed to meet the primary and secondary endpoints in a phase IIb study, evaluating the medicine for another indication - acute ischemic stroke (AIS).Tysabri is presently approved to treat multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease. The drug recorded sales of $1.97 billion in 2017.Top-line results from the phase IIb dose-ranging ACTION 2 study showed that treatment with natalizumab did not lead to improvement in clinical outcomes – patients’ independence and ability to perform daily tasks - compared to placebo in patients with AIS. Ischemic stroke is a condition in which sudden loss of blood circulation in the brain leads to loss of neurologic function. Biogen has decided not to pursue development of natalizumab in AIS.Shares declined slightly on Wednesday in response to the news. Biogen’s shares have risen 21.6% in the past year, better than the industry’s rise of 1.1% in the same time frame. However, Biogen believes that this failure will not affect its pipeline efforts for acute neurological conditions including stroke. Biogen is developing BIIB093 for the treatment of large hemispheric stroke (LHI), a severe form of stroke with no available therapy. It had acquired BIIB093 from Remedy Pharmaceuticals in May last year. A phase III study on the candidate is expected to be initiated in mid-2018.On the fourth-quarter conference call held last month, Biogen said that since the launch of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) MS drug, Ocrevus, it has witnessed a decrease in the number of patient starts and an increase in discontinuation of Tysabri in the United States. Moreover, treatments like Novartis’ Gilenya and Sanofi’s (SNY  -  Free Report) Aubagio pose competitive threat to Tysabri.Had Tysabri been successfully developed for the stroke indication, it would have improved the drug’s prospects in a competitive market.As competition in the MS market intensifies, Biogen is looking to diversify to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders area. In 2017, Biogen added seven new clinical stage programs to its neuroscience pipeline through advancing internal pipeline candidates as well as through external deals.Biogen’s AD pipeline comprises candidates with different mechanisms of action including anti-tau candidate (BIIB092)), anti-amyloid (aducanumab) candidates as well as a BACE inhibitor (elenbecestat) program.Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (IONS  -  Free Report) spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) treatment, Spinraza (nusinersen) is the first and only treatment to be approved in the United States for SMA.

58,BIIB,"Although there are still a few days left for the year to end, 2017 has turned out to be pretty good for the pharma and biotech sector where FDA approvals are concerned. Till date, the regulatory agency has given its nod to 43 novel drugs, well above the 22 drugs approved last year. Immuno-oncology was a key focus area in 2017, whether it was to do with scientific conferences, clinical trial collaborations, acquisitions or FDA approvals.The approval of Novartis’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah, a gene cell therapy, and Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta, a CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptor T cells) cell treatment, ensured that the highly lucrative immuno-oncology market remained in the limelight.The $11.9 billion acquisition of immuno-oncology focused Kite by Gilead also increased interest in this category with investors expecting more acquisition announcements in this area.While we see 2017 as a year focused on immuno-oncology, here is a look at three therapeutic areas that we think will garner a lot of interest in 2018.Immuno-OncologyImmuno-oncology will remain a key focus area in 2018 as well. The basic concept of cancer immunotherapy or immuno-oncology is to utilize certain parts of the immune system to fight the disease. This can be done by stimulating the immune system to attack cancer cells or by introducing immune system components into the body. While some immuno-oncology treatments have the potential to be effective as monotherapies, others may be more effective when combined with other treatments.Different types of immunotherapies include monoclonal antibodies/mAbs (man-made versions of immune system proteins which can be designed to attack a very specific part of a cancer cell), immune checkpoint inhibitors (recognize and attack cancer cells), vaccines (help prevent or treat cancer) and others that boost the overall immune system.Encouraging results generated by some companies demonstrating partial and complete responses in late-stage cancer patients and the recent FDA approval of Kymriah and Yescarta has raised hopes for cancer patients and increased interest in this segment of the cancer market. With immuno-oncology set to change the treatment paradigm for cancer, this area represents huge commercial potential.Companies that have progressed quite a bit in this area include Juno Therapeutics , Incyte and bluebird bio (BLUE  -  Free Report) with these companies often considered to be acquisition targets.Alzheimer’s DiseaseAlzheimer’s disease is an area where many companies have tried their luck though not with much success. Over the last several years, big players like Merck, Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report), Pfizer and J&J have all faced setbacks in their quest to find a treatment for Alzheimer’s.Companies that are currently working on Alzheimer’s disease treatments include players like Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report), Novartis, AstraZeneca, Eisai and Amgen.Biogen’s aducanumab is one of the most important candidates in the company’s pipeline with the candidate currently in a couple of late-stage studies. Biogen is also working on elenbecestat (E2609), a BACE inhibitor in a phase III program and BAN2401, a humanized beta amyloid antibody in phase II development with top-line results expected by the end of January 2018. All three candidates are being developed in collaboration with Eisai.  Lilly also has quite a few Alzheimer’s disease candidates in its pipeline including lanabecestat, which is being developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca with data readout expected in 2019. Meanwhile, Novartis and Amgen are collaborating for BACE1 inhibitor CNP520 which has fast track status in the United Status. Roche is also collaborating with AC Immune for the development of Alzheimer’s disease treatments.Although Alzheimer’s has historically been a very challenging therapeutic area with quite a few stocks stumbling in their efforts to find a treatment, the market is highly lucrative. As a result, several companies continue to invest heavily in developing Alzheimer’s disease treatments. According to the Alzheimer's Association, in the 10 years from 2002-2012, 244 drugs were tested for Alzheimer’s in studies registered with clinicaltrials.gov out of which only one succeeded and went on to gain FDA approval.While these numbers are far from encouraging, success in this area means huge returns considering more than five million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease with the numbers expected to increase to as much as 16 million by 2050 (Data: Alzheimer's Association). It is considered to be one of the biggest burdens of society and is the sixth leading cause of death across all ages in the United States. The market has immense commercial potential and companies coming out with new treatments could rake in billions of dollars in sales.Medical MarijuanaAnother segment of the pharma and biotech industry that will remain in the limelight next year is the medical marijuana industry. The industry got its first exchange traded fund (“ETF”) earlier this year and has been attracting interest from investors over the last few quarters. The industry is expected to grow rapidly with legislators allowing or looking to allow more legal uses of marijuana and marijuana-related products, especially in the medical and life sciences industry.Some of the key players in this area include GW Pharmaceuticals plc (GWPH  -  Free Report), INSYS Therapeutics, Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings and Zynerba Pharmaceuticals.GW Pharma commercialized the world's first plant-derived cannabinoid prescription drug, Sativex, which is approved for the treatment of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis. However, the company has been in the news for its lead cannabinoid pipeline candidate, Epidiolex (cannabidiol or CBD), which is in development for a number of rare childhood-onset epilepsy disorders. The company is currently seeking FDA approval for Epidiolex for Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome – approval could come as early as mid-2018 if priority review is granted. Epidiolex represents blockbuster potential especially if it is approved across all possible indications. GW Pharma has several new formulations of CBD in development including improved liquid formulations, a solid dose form and an intravenous formulation.Specialty pharma company, INSYS, uses its proprietary spray technology and capabilities for the development of pharmaceutical cannabinoids for a wide range of indication including treating addiction to opioids, opioid overdose, epilepsy, and other disease areas with significant unmet need.

59,BIIB,"Key highlights this week include the FDA approval of Luxturna, the first gene therapy for a genetic disease, the first and only pharmacologic treatment for an inherited retinal disease (“IRD”) and the first adeno-associated virus (“AAV”) vector gene therapy and the earlier-than-expected label expansion of Exelixis’s (EXEL  -  Free Report) Cabometyx.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesEarlier-than-Expected Label Expansion for Exelixis’s Cabometyx: Exelixis received a boost with the earlier-than-expected FDA approval of Cabometyx for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”) patients. Cabometyx was previously approved for use in advanced RCC patients who have received anti-angiogenic therapy. Approval for the first-line indication will expand the patient population significantly.The approval is based on results which showed that Cabometyx demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction (52%) in the rate of disease progression or death with median progression free survival (“PFS”) for Cabometyx being 8.6 months compared to 5.3 months for sunitinib.According to information provided by the company in its press release, about 14,000 patients in the country need first-line treatment for advanced kidney cancer every year, almost as many patients as the second and third lines taken together. This represents significant opportunity for the company to grow Cabometyx sales.Exelixis’s shares are up 78.9% year to date, compared to the 3% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Spark’s Gene Therapy Gets FDA Nod: Spark Therapeutics (ONCE  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval for its one-time gene therapy, Luxturna for patients with confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy. This makes Luxturna the first gene therapy for a genetic disease, the first and only pharmacologic treatment for an IRD and the first AAV vector gene therapy to be approved in the United States. According to the FDA, biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy affects approximately 1,000 to 2,000 patients in the United States. Although approval was expected considering a favorable FDA advisory panel vote in October, the decision came ahead of the Jan 12, 2018 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) date.Spark is yet to provide information about pricing which will be a key factor in influencing the treatment’s uptake. The company said that Luxturna will be available for administration at treatment centers late in the first quarter of 2018 while pricing and other details will be provided early in January.Spark will also get a rare disease priority review voucher which can be used to gain priority review for any subsequent drug application that is not eligible for priority review. The company can also sell the voucher for millions of dollars to any other company that wants to fasten the review process for its candidate. BioMarin, United Therapeutics and Knight Therapeutics are some of the companies that sold their priority review vouchers for millions of dollars.New SMA Collaboration between Biogen & Ionis: Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) has entered into a new collaboration agreement with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IONS  -  Free Report) under which new antisense oligonucleotide drug candidates will be identified for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”).

If Regeneron decides to exercise its option, it will be liable to make milestone as well as royalty payments to ISA. Regeneron is developing cemiplimab with Sanofi (Read more: Regeneron in Strategic Immuno-Oncology Collaboration with ISA).Clinical Hold Lifted on Alnylam/Sanofi’s Fitusiran: The FDA has lifted the clinical hold that was placed on studies being conducted with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY  -  Free Report) and Sanofi’s fitusiran. The companies expect to resume dosing around year end in the studies including the phase II open-label extension (“OLE”) study and the ATLAS phase III program. Dosing had been suspended following the observation of a fatal thrombotic serious adverse event (“SAE”) in a patient with hemophilia A without inhibitors who was receiving fitusiran in the OLE study (Read more: Sanofi/Alnylam Say FDA Lifts Clinical Hold on Fitusiran).Alnylam and Sanofi also announced that they have submitted a regulatory application for the EU approval of patisiran for the treatment of adults with hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (Read more: Alnylam/Sanofi Submit MAA in Europe for RNAi Candidate).PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 0.3% over the last five trading sessions.

60,BIIB,"Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IONS  -  Free Report) announced that it has out-licensed IONIS-AZ5-2.5Rx, a Generation 2.5 antisense drug, to AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report). The candidate will be developed to treat a genetically associated form of kidney disease.AstraZeneca will be responsible for the development and commercialization of the candidate, going forward. Ionis entered a strategic collaboration with AstraZeneca in 2012 to develop treatment for cardiovascular, metabolic and renal diseases. This is the second drug to enter development under this agreement.Per the terms of the deal, Ionis will receive an upfront payment of $30 million from AstraZeneca and is eligible to receive up to $300 million in the form of milestone payments and royalty payments on potential sales.Ionis’s shares have risen 9.5% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 1.8% in that period.Ionis has collaboration agreements with several pharma companies to whom it licenses and sells its technology on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis for fees and payments.Ionis earns the majority of its revenues in the form of royalty from Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) on sales of spinal muscular atrophy drug, Spinraza. The drug was developed using Ionis’ antisense technology. Several other candidates are under development in collaboration with Biogen.We note that in August 2017, Ionis retained all rights to its lead pipeline candidate, Inotersen, as Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) declined its option to develop the drug. Investors cheered the news as Ionis will record full sales instead of royalties upon successful commercialization, which is expected in 2018.Ionis is scheduled to report its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results on Feb 27. We expect to get updates on its various pipeline candidates.Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price  Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price | Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

62,BIIB,"The fourth-quarter earnings season has crossed the halfway mark. So far, the results reflect a favorable trend, with an above average proportion of companies beating both top- and bottom-line expectations.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the 251 S&P members that have released results, are up 16% from the year-ago quarter on a 10.5% rise in revenues. The beat ratio for the bottom line is 80.5%, while that for the top line is 78.1%. The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 64.9%.Biotech companies Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) are expected to report their Q4 numbers on Feb 8. Let's take a look at which of these biotech companies has an edge over the other ahead of their release.However, before we look at the numbers, let us have a look at the biotech industry.A Glance at the IndustryThe biotech industry is seeing significant pickup in merger and acquisition (M&A) deals of late. The year started off with Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) announcing plans to acquire Impact Biomedicines. The company revealed plans of acquiring Juno Therapeutics  for approximately $9 billion.The French pharma giant Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) also announced of buying biopharma company Bioverativ for $11.6 billion in January 2018. The same month Sanofi also announced plans to acquire the Belgian biotech company, Ablynx for €3.9 billion ($4.8 billion).In the fourth quarter, the biotech sector is well poised. Of the major players in the biotech sector, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) put a mixed show in the reported period with earnings lagging estimates while sales exceeding the same. However, Celgene and Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) outpaced both the metrics’ expectations.Alexion New Haven, CT-based Alexion’s blockbuster drug, Soliris, continues to perform well. Alexion continues to identify and treat high number of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) with Soliris, across its 50-country operating platform. Alexion is working on expanding Soliris’ label into additional indications. The FDA recently approved the drug for the treatment of refractory gMG in patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive. The drug was approved in Europe for this indication. Label expansion into additional indications will give Soliris access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.The company also announced some restructuring initiatives. In this context, Alexion plans to focus on rare diseases businesses in core areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders to enhance productivity.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $878 million, marking an increase of 5.5% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.28 per share, marking an increase of 1.59% year over year.Alexion’s track record is excellent as it has topped estimates in the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 11.91%.Alexion has an Earnings ESP of +8.92% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.40 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.28.

Price and EPS Surprise | Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteRegeneron Regeneron’s key growth driver, Eylea, is likely to continue to contribute to the company’s top-line growth. Regeneron is working on expanding Eylea label into additional indications. While a phase III study (PANORAMA) is evaluating Eylea for the treatment of moderately severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy in patients without DME, another phase III study (in Japan) is evaluating it for neovascular glaucoma. Label expansion into additional indications will give Eylea access to higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug. Apart from Eylea, investors will remain focused on the uptake of new drugs — Kevzara and Dupixent. The FDA also approved Dupixent (dupilumab) Injection for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.  The initial uptake of the drug is encouraging. The drug was approved in Europe also. The company is also evaluating the drug for treating asthma in adults (LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study). Hence, focus will be on the company’s performance, particularly Eylea and Dupixient uptake during the fourth-quarter earnings call. Investors are also expected to await updates on the company’s pipeline.The Earnings ESP, for Regeneron is -1.04%. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.50 billion, marking an increase of 22.1% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $4.68 per share, marking an increase of 53.95% year over year.The company’s performance has been mixed so far. In the last four quarters, it surpassed earnings estimates on two occasions and missed in two, with an average positive surprise of 5.96%. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteOur TakeDuring fourth-quarter 2017, Alexion’s price declined 14.8% compared with Regeneron’s fall of 15.9%. However, Alexion’s Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.For Regeneron, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) before going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Therefore, per our proprietary model, we believe that Alexion is poised for better performance in the upcoming quarter.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018 In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

64,BIIB,"Markets finished mostly higher on Monday even as safe haven stocks such as utilities and real estate gained traction. Further, the optimism from a strong market rally that began with 2018 continued to push the benchmarks higher. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq posted record closes. However, the Dow declined due to a fall in bank shares and snapped its winning run.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased almost 0.1% to close at 25,283. The S&P 500 rose 0.2% to close at 2,747.71. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,157.39, gaining 0.3%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased almost 2% to close at 9.40. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.46 -to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.S&P 500 and Nasdaq Post Record ClosesThe S&P 500 gained almost 5 points to finish at a record. The broader index also hit an intraday record of 2,748.51. Majority of the gains came from industrial and energy stocks. Of the 11 major segments of the S&P 500, nine ended in the positive territory, with utilities and real estate leading the gainers. The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) and Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU) gained 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively.Meanwhile, Nasdaq gathered 20.8 points to also finish at record level. Gains for the tech-laden index were buoyed by a surge in the shares of some major tech stocks. Shares of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) gained 0.8%, 1.4%, 0.4% and 1%, respectively. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Nasdaq also hit an intraday record of 7,161.35 but a decline in biotech shares pared some gains for the index. The NASDAQ Biotechnology (^NBI) declined 1.4% on Monday, nearly its biggest decline since the mid of December. Such losses were led by a decline in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) and Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report), shares of which tanked 3.3% and 3.8%, respectively.Dow Declines to End an Impressive RunDow defied the trend of the day to lose almost 13 points and ended in the red. This marked an end to its four-day winning streak of gains. However, the blue-chip index hit an intraday record of 25,311.99 earlier in the session but suffered broad based losses to finish in the negative territory.Further, shares of major banks such as Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) declined 1.5% and about 0.4%, respectively and weighed on the Dow. Bank shares declined after analysts estimated that there would be one-time charges to the fourth quarter earnings that the banks would suffer due to the implementation of tax reforms.Fed Presidents Speak on Rate HikesAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic commented on Monday that the Fed should continue raising the interest rates albeit at a slower pace compared to the last year.Further, the San Francisco Fed President John Williams commented that the central bank should consider holding the rates lower for a longer period as that would allow the inflation to grow over the coming years.Stocks That Made HeadlinesKohl's Rallies on Solid Holiday Sales: More Upside in Store?In a landscape where many retailers are still struggling with consumers’ changing shopping patterns and soft traffic, Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) surprised investors with impressive holiday sales data.  (Read More)Lululemon Lifts Q4 Outlook on Successful Holiday FeatLululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report) was among the retailers that emerged strong this holiday season, which has lifted the overall outlook for the retail sector.

65,BIIB,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) reportedly said in a statement that it will end R&D efforts in the Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease areas, which will result in about 300 layoffs.The decision to end the neuroscience-discovery program will mainly affect employees at facilities in Andover and Cambridge,  MA, and Groton,  CT. Pfizer, however, intends to continue development of pain candidate, tanezumab, which it is developing in late-stage studies in partnership with Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report), label expansion efforts for pain drug Lyrica and its rare disease program.Shares of Pfizer have risen 10.2% in the past year, comparing unfavorably with a 16.5% increase for the industry.The successful development of therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease is challenging and we note that several companies have failed in this regard.In fact Pfizer itself shelved its late-stage Alzheimer’s candidate, bapineuzumab IV after it failed two phase III studies. Pfizer was developing the candidate in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Elan Corporation.In November 2016, Lilly’s anti-amyloid candidate solanezumab failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage AD study. Lilly decided to drop the development of solanezumab. Lillyalso suffered a major setback in August 2010, when it had to halt the development of another phase III Alzheimer’s candidate, semagacestat.Last month, Biogen, Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced that an Alzheimer’s disease study on BAN2401 failed to show early positive which raised investor concern about the candidate’s chances of success.Pfizer plans to use savings from the terminated programs to re-allocate spend on potentially more fruitful pipeline projects.Pfizer expects approximately 25 to 30 drug approvals over the next five years, of which around 15 products have blockbuster potential. These include line-extensions for cancer drugs, Xtandi and Ibrance as well as rheumatoid arthritis drug, Xeljanz. Half of these potential blockbusters are expected to receive approval by 2020.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

66,BIIB,"This week, companies like Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Revance Therapeutics, Inc. (RVNC  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) were in the news. While Amgen got FDA approval for the inclusion of cardiovascular outcomes data for its PCSK9 inhibitor, AbbVie and Revance provided data on their pipeline candidates.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesRevance Soars on RT002 Data: Revance’s shares shot up 33.7% on positive top-line data from late-stage studies evaluating the company’s next-generation neuromodulator RT002. RT002 met the primary as well as all secondary endpoints in the studies that were conducted for the reduction of moderate-to-severe glabellar lines (the frown lines or wrinkles between the brows).A long-term safety study is currently ongoing with the study scheduled to complete in the second half of 2018. The successful completion of this study would allow Revance to file for FDA approval in the first half of 2019 and potentially launch the product in 2020. The company believes that FDA approval would make RT002 the first neuromodulator with a long-acting duration of six months as currently marketed neuromodulators have shown duration of three to four months in treating glabellar lines. RT002’s approval could well change the neuromodulator treatment landscape as it would be needed only twice a year.According to information provided by the company, the treatment of glabellar lines is the most popular aesthetic procedure for an injectable neuromodulator with almost a third of the $3.6 billion in global neuromodulator sales in 2016 coming from this area. Currently approved treatments include Botox and Dysport.Amgen’s PCSK9 Inhibitor Label Approved for Cardiovascular Outcomes Data: Amgen’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, got a bit of a boost with the FDA granting approval to the company’s request to add cardiovascular outcomes data to the drug’s label. This makes Repatha the first PCSK9 inhibitor to prevent heart attacks, strokes and coronary revascularizations in adults with established cardiovascular disease. Repatha was also approved for use as an adjunct to diet, alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies like statins, for the treatment of adults with primary hyperlipidemia to reduce low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).The updated label will provide physicians with a new treatment option to prevent cardiovascular events by dramatically lowering LDL cholesterol with Repatha, especially in the case of patients who are already on maximally-tolerated statin therapy and need to lower their LDL cholesterol level further.The cardiovascular outcomes data should help drive Repatha sales which are yet to take off as expected with factors like strict utilization management criteria and processes employed by insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) impacting sales. However, Amgen has been working with payers to improve access for appropriate patients and Repatha remains a growth brand for the company (Read more: Amgen's PCSK9 Inhibitor Gets FDA Nod for Stroke Prevention). Amgen is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Positive Data on AbbVie’s Risankizumab and Imbruvica: AbbVie’s risankizumab met the primary endpoint in the fourth pivotal phase III study conducted for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. After 16 weeks of treatment, almost half (47%) of risankizumab patients achieved complete skin clearance (PASI 100) compared to 1% of patients on placebo. Risankizumab is being developed in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim (Read more: AbbVie Psoriasis Candidate Succeeds in 4th Phase III Study).AbbVie also presented data on a combination of its BTK inhibitor, Imbruvica, and Rituxan for the treatment of both newly and previously-treated patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (“WM”). The primary endpoint of progression-free survival (“PFS”) was achieved in the late-stage study. Imbruvica is approved for different indications including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, previously treated mantle cell lymphoma and WM as well as chronic graft-versus-host-disease. AbbVie expects Imbruvica revenues of $5 billion in 2020.Priority Review for Clovis sNDA: Clovis Oncology’s (CLVS  -  Free Report) supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for the use of its PARP inhibitor, Rubraca (rucaparib), has been granted priority review status by the FDA. The company is looking to get Rubraca approved for use as maintenance treatment for women with recurrent ovarian cancer who are platinum sensitive, and in complete or partial response to platinum chemotherapy, with no requirement for diagnostic testing. With the FDA granting priority review, a response should be out on Apr 6, 2018.Clovis’s shares are up 29.9% year to date, compared to the 1.3% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Galectin Down on NASH Data: Galectin Therapeutics Inc.’s shares fell 30.7% on data from a phase IIb study on GR-MD-02. Although the candidate showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful results in a sub-group of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) cirrhosis patients, it failed to achieve statistical significance in the total group of patients.  Positive 48-Week Data on Ultragenyx Drug: Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (RARE  -  Free Report) and partner Kyowa Kirin announced positive 48-week data from a late-stage study of burosumab (KRN23) in adults with X-linked hypophosphatemia (“XLH”). The companies said that further improvement in disease symptoms and fracture healing were observed through 48 weeks of treatment with burosumab. Burosumab is currently under priority review for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with XLH with a response from the FDA expected on Apr 17, 2018.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declined slightly (0.5%) over the last five trading sessions. Among major biotech stocks, Amgen was up 4.9% while Vertex declined 6.1%.

67,BIIB,"2017 was a good year for pharma and biotech stocks with the sector witnessing some positive developments that led to a much-awaited recovery.A key reason for the sector’s improved performance was the willingness of investors to look beyond the drug pricing controversy and focus more on fundamentals instead. Although the drug pricing controversy, which was a major overhang in 2016, will remain a headline risk, investors seem more comfortable with the issue. Moreover, a significantly higher number of FDA approvals in 2017 has restored investor confidence in the sector. The approval of the first gene cell therapy last year was a major breakthrough for the sector.Hopes of more mergers and acquisitions (M&As) have also gone up with tax reform in place and big players on the lookout for companies with innovative pipelines/technology. There has already been quite a bit of M&A buzz this year about potential deals with Celgene rumored to be interested in buying Juno , Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) in Acorda and Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) in Bioverativ. Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk recently confirmed that it is looking to acquire Belgium-based biopharma company Ablynx though Ablynx rejected Novo Nordisk’s offer.Looking forward, new product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, continued strong performance from key products, more M&A activity, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep the momentum in 2018.Headwinds include drug pricing scrutiny, pricing pressure, increasing competition, the growing presence of biosimilars, generic competition, a slowdown in the growth of legacy products, concerns regarding Amazon’s interest in entering the healthcare arena and major pipeline setbacks.4 Biotech & Pharma Stocks to Keep an Eye on This Earnings SeasonAccording to the Zacks Earnings Trends article, the medical sector, which has been among the better performing sectors over the last several quarters, is expected to record earnings growth of 3% on revenue growth of 4.7% in the fourth quarter.Given this scenario and with medical sector earnings round the corner, it would make sense to look at some pharma and biotech stocks that are expected to report a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.Investing in such stocks could prove beneficial for investors as an earnings beat usually leads to significant share price appreciation.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed-in on four pharma and biotech stocks that sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) and have a positive Earnings ESP. Earnings ESP is a very valuable tool for investors looking for stocks that are most likely to beat earnings estimates. Moreover, adding a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 has produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. While you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here, you can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report): Alexion has a strong presence in the rare diseases market.

Core areas of focus include hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders. Alexion has consistently surpassed earnings expectations in each of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 11.9%. The Zacks Rank #3 stock, which will report fourth quarter results on February 8, has an Earnings ESP of +5.93% for the quarter.

Merck is also a Zacks Rank #3 stock.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

68,BIIB,"Roche Holdings (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted marketing authorization for multiple sclerosis (MS) drug Ocrevus.The drug is approved for patients suffering from active relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis defined by clinical or imaging features and for patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis in terms of disease duration and level of disability, and with imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity.The approval was based on data from three pivotal phase III studies from the ORCHESTRA trial program which met the primary and nearly all the key secondary endpoints.  The drug also demonstrated a favorable benefit-risk profile demonstrated in three large Phase III studies with a diverse patient population, including those early in the disease.We remind investors that the drug was also approved in the United States in March 2017 for both relapsing and primary progressive forms of multiple sclerosis.The approval boosts Roche’s neuroscience portfolio. Roche has more than a dozen pipeline candidates in the neuroscience portfolio for diseases that include multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, spinal muscular atrophy, Parkinson’s disease and autism.  Roche’s stock has rallied 10.2% in the past one year compared with industry's gain of 22.8%.MS market has immense potential in Europe. The disease affects approximately 700,000 people in Europe, of which around 96,000 have the highly disabling primary progressive form.However, the competition is stiff in MS space.In August 2017, the European Commission Merck approved KGaA ‘s  Mavenclad for the treatment of MS.

(BIIB  -  Free Report) has a strong position in the MS market backed by a wide range of products including Avonex, Tysabri, Tecfidera & Plegridy.Meanwhile, Roche has a strong presence in the oncology market. The company dominates the breast cancer space with strong demand for its HER2 franchise drugs like Herceptin, Perjeta and Kadcyla. We are also impressed by the company's efforts to develop its portfolio beyond oncology into immunology. New drug launches, such as Tecentriq, Cotellic and Alecensa boosted sales and is expected to continue to do so in the upcoming quarters.Zacks Rank & Key Pick    Roche carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Exelixis, Inc.

Meanwhile, Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND  -  Free Report) raised its guidance for 2017 and GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH  -  Free Report) got priority review in the United States for Epidiolex.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesGW’s Epidiolex Submitted for EU Approval: GW Pharmaceuticals, which has been in the news for its lead cannabinoid pipeline candidate, Epidiolex (cannabidiol or CBD), said that it has submitted a regulatory application to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for Epidiolex as adjunctive treatment for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (“LGS”) and Dravet syndrome. Both are highly treatment-resistant forms of childhood-onset epilepsy. The company has Orphan Designations in the EU for Epidiolex for these two indications as well as West syndrome and tuberous sclerosis complex.The company is also seeking approval in the United States for the LGS and Dravet syndrome indications. With the regulatory agency granting priority review, a response is expected by Jun 27, 2018. Epidiolex represents blockbuster potential especially if it is approved across all possible indications.Ligand Ups 2017 View on Payment from OmniAb Partner: Ligand raised its guidance for 2017 with the company earning $6 million from partner, HanAll Biopharma. HanAll said that it has out-licensed antibody projects that were discovered by the company using Ligand’s OmniAb antibody discovery platform.Ligand said that it now expects to earn $3.13 - $3.16 per share on total revenue of approximately $140 million in 2017. The company was previously expecting earnings of $2.95 - $3.00 per share on revenues of $134 - $136 million.Priority Review for Label Expansion of Seattle Genetics’ Adcetris: Seattle Genetics (SGEN  -  Free Report) got priority review for its supplemental Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for Adcetris plus chemotherapy for the front-line treatment of patients with advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Given the priority review status, a response should be out by May 1, 2018. Expansion into the front-line setting should boost product sales. For the first nine months of 2017, Adcetris sales (as recorded by Seattle Genetics) were $223.8 million.Sangamo-Pfizer Sign Another Collaboration Agreement: Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO  -  Free Report) and Pfizer are collaborating for the development of a potential gene therapy using zinc finger protein transcription factors (ZFP-TFs) for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (“FTLD”) linked to mutations of the C9ORF72 gene. The agreement will see Sangamo receiving an upfront payment of $12 million from Pfizer as well as milestone payments worth up to $150 million plus tiered royalties on net sales.While Sangamo will be responsible for the development of ZFP-TF candidates, Pfizer will be operationally and financially responsible for subsequent research, development, manufacturing and commercialization for the C9ORF72 ZFP-TF program and other resulting products.Sangamo and Pfizer already have a collaboration agreement that was announced last year for the development and commercialization of gene therapy products for hemophilia A, including SB-525.Sangamo’s shares are up 404.3% over the last one year compared to the 3.8% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.UTHR in Licensing Agreement with Corsair Pharma: United Therapeutics (UTHR  -  Free Report), a key player in the pulmonary arterial hypertension (“PAH”) market, announced an exclusive license agreement with Corsair Pharma for the latter’s portfolio of patents covering treprostinil prodrugs.In addition to getting an upfront payment, Corsair will receive royalty payments on the commercialization of treprostinil prodrug products by United Therapeutics that are covered by Corsair's patents. The agreement terms also include an equity investment by United Therapeutics in Corsair.Spark Provides Update on Luxturna: Spark Therapeutics (ONCE  -  Free Report) has priced its one-time gene therapy treatment, Luxturna, at $850,000. However, the company also announced three new payer programs that are expected to lower the financial burden for patients as well as treatment centers. The company has been working with health insurers to ensure access to Luxturna (Read more: Spark Therapeutics Hopes to Cure a Rare Blindness for $850,000 a Pop).Luxturna was approved in December 2017 for patients with confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy. According to the FDA, biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy affects approximately 1,000 to 2,000 patients in the United States.Spark is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 3.1% over the last four trading sessions.

70,BIIB,"Key highlights this week include the announcement of a couple of acquisition agreements as well as pipeline news from Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) and Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report). The M&A announcements relate to the acquisition of Ignyta  by Roche and Sucampo Pharmaceuticals  by Mallinckrodt.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesCelgene Down on Revlimid Combo Data: Celgene’s shares were down on disappointing data on a combination evaluating the company’s blockbuster cancer drug, Revlimid, in treatment-naïve follicular lymphoma patients. The late-stage RELEVANCE study evaluated Revlimid plus Rituxan (R2) followed by R2 maintenance compared to the standard of care with Rituxan plus chemotherapy (R-CHOP, R-bendamustine or R-CVP) followed by Rituxan maintenance. The R2 treatment arm failed to achieve superiority in the co-primary endpoints of complete response or unconfirmed complete response (CR/CRu) at 120 weeks and progression-free survival (Read more: Celgene Down on Discouraging Data on Revlimid).Celgene’s shares are down 7.6% year to date compared to the 3% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Acquisition Agreements Announced: A couple of acquisition deals were announced this week. The first agreement will see Ignyta being acquired by Swiss pharma giant Roche in an all-cash deal valued at $1.7 billion ($27 per share). Ignyta is focused on developing precisely targeted therapeutics guided by diagnostics for patients with rare cancers. With this acquisition, slated to close in the first half of 2018, Roche will add entrectinib to its portfolio – entrectinib is currently in mid-stage development.The second agreement will see Sucampo being acquired by Mallinckrodt for $18 per share or approximately $1.2 billion. With this acquisition, Mallinckrodt will get a source of near-term net sales and earnings accretion through Amitiza and will boost its rare diseases pipeline with VTS-270 and CPP-1X/sulindac. This deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018. Sucampo is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Biogen’s Shares Down on Alzheimer’s Data: Biogen’s shares declined 3.3% on data from an ongoing Alzheimer’s disease study on BAN2401, which is being developed in collaboration with Eisai. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee said that BAN2401 did not meet the criteria for success based on a Bayesian analysis at 12 months as the primary endpoint in the phase II study. With the study failing to show an early positive result, the companies said that the blinded study, which is being conducted in patients with prodromal or mild Alzheimer’s disease (collectively known as early Alzheimer’s disease) will continue with a comprehensive final analysis to be conducted at 18 months. These results are expected to be obtained during the second half of 2018. The study data comes as a disappointment as positive data would have been a major boost. Moreover, the results have raised concerns about the candidate’s chances of success given the high rate of failure experienced by other companies in bringing Alzheimer’s disease treatments to market (Read more: Biogen's Alzheimer's Drug Misses Goal in Interim Analysis).BioMarin PDUFA Date Extended: The FDA has extended the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) Goal Date for BioMarin Pharmaceutical’s (BMRN  -  Free Report) pegvaliase by three months to May 28, 2018. BioMarin is looking to get the investigational therapy approved for the reduction of blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in adult patients with phenylketonuria (“PKU”) who have uncontrolled blood Phe levels on existing management. The extension was expected as the agency had asked the company to submit additional Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (""CMC"") information. The company said that due to the Memorial Day weekend, the Action Goal Date will be May 25, 2018 (Read more: Biogen's Alzheimer's Drug Misses Goal in Interim Analysis).Agios Submits Ivosidenib NDA: Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO  -  Free Report) has submitted a New Drug Application (“NDA”) seeking FDA approval for ivosidenib (AG-120), an investigational oral treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML) and an isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutation. The company has asked for priority review which would cut down the review period to six months.Agios also announced that it has received permission from the FDA to move another pipeline candidate, AG-270, into clinical studies. The company intends to commence a phase I study in the first quarter of 2018.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 1.3% over the last four trading sessions.

71,BIIB,"Shares of Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) declined by almost 3.3% after the company’s Alzheimer's candidate, BAN2401, failed to meet the criteria for success based on a 12-months interim analysis as the primary endpoint in a mid-stage trial. The company is developing the candidate in collaboration with Eisai Co., Ltd.So far this year, shares of Biogen have gained 13.7% compared with the industry’s growth of 3%.The phase II study (Study 201) involves 856 patients with prodromal or mild Alzheimer's disease and positive biomarkers for brain amyloid pathology. The study uses Bayesian Adaptive Randomization Design which allows automatic changes to the design during the study. For early success, Study 201 will explore efficacy and the dose response of BAN2401 with 16 interim analyses, a 12-month evaluation based on Eisai's in-house developed Alzheimer’s disease Composite Score (ADCOMS) and an 18-month comprehensive assessment of treatment with placebo or 5 active arms. The Bayesian analysis at 12 months indicated that ""success was judged as an 80% or higher probability of achieving"" at least a 25% reduction in the rate of decline of ADCOMS versus placebo.The 16 interim analyses assessed potential for futility or stopping for safety. Neither of these conditions was met and the study continues to a full analysis at 18 months.Biogen stated that the 18-month blinded study will continue further analysis, following the predefined study protocol.  A comprehensive final analysis will be conducted at 18 months looking to demonstrate clinically significant results.  Data from the study are expected in the second half of 2018.Biogen is looking to strengthen its AD and other neurodegenerative disorders pipeline. Notably, the company’s Alzheimer's disease (AD) pipeline comprises candidates with different mechanisms of action including anti-tau candidate (BIIB092/BMS-986168-with potential in AD as well as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)), anti-amyloid (aducanumab) candidates as well as a BACE inhibitor (elenbecestat) program.However, the successful development of therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease is challenging and we note that several companies have failed in developing treatments for the same. In November 2016, Eli Lilly & Company's (LLY  -  Free Report) anti-amyloid candidate — solanezumab failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage AD study. Consequently, Lilly decided to drop the development of the candidate.Meanwhile, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) shelved its late-stage Alzheimer’s candidate, bapineuzumab IV, after it failed two phase III studies. Pfizer was developing the candidate in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Elan Corporation.The Alzheimer’s disease market represents a huge commercial potential and a successfully developed product could generate billions of dollars in sales once launched.Biogen Inc.

72,BIIB,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) has expanded its collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IONS  -  Free Report) to enhance its portfolio of medicines to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a devastating neuromuscular disease.Per the latest deal, the companies have collaborated to identify new antisense oligonucleotide drug candidates for the treatment of SMA. Biogen has the option to in-license any new therapies emerging from the deal and will thereafter develop and commercialize the product. For the collaboration, Biogen will make an upfront payment of $25 million to Ionis while the latter will also be entitled to development, regulatory as well as royalty payments if new therapies are approved.Biogen and Ionis launched their first SMA treatment, Spinraza, in December last year. It consolidated Biogen’s position in the neurological disease market with the drug being the first and only treatment to be approved in the United States for SMA. The drug is off to a promising start, witnessing strong patient uptake in the United States and internationally.SMA is a hereditary neuromuscular disease that progressively destroys lower motor neurons leading to severe and progressive muscular atrophy and weakness. The most severe type of SMA could result in paralysis and difficulty in performing basic functions like breathing and swallowing. The market potential of SMA disease is huge.According to the SMA Foundation, the disease is believed to affect 10,000 - 25,000 children and adults in the United States, making it one of the most common rare diseases. About 1 in 10,000 children are born with the disease while 1 in 50 people (approximately 6 million Americans) carry the gene mutation that causes SMA. It is divided into sub-categories Type 1 - 4, with Type 1 being the most severe.Biogen’s shares have risen 15.3% this year, better than the industry’s growth of 3% in the same time frame.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderBiogen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the pharma/biotech sector include H.

73,BIIB,"Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) and Alkermes plc (ALKS  -  Free Report) announced a global license and collaboration agreement to develop and commercialize Alkermes’ phase III multiple sclerosis (""MS"") candidate, ALKS 8700. Per the deal, Biogen was granted worldwide commercialization rights to Alkermes’ ALKS 8700 for an upfront payment of $28 million. In return, Biogen will pay Alkermes royalties at amid-teens percentage rate on global sales of ALKS 8700.The deal will be beneficial for both companies as it will reduce costs and bring in a strong partner for Alkermes. Meanwhile,a potential approval will give Biogen a drug bioequivalent to its key oral MS drug, Tecfidera. We remind investors that Tecfidera’s U.S. patient demand is declining slightly due to increasing competition from medicines like Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Ocrevus and a slowdown in the overall MS market.Tecfidera is also expected to face generic competition as early as 2021. A potential launch of ALKS 8700 before this will help Biogen offset Tecfidera’s sales erosion to a certain extent.Following the announcement Biogen’s shares were up 0.9% on Nov 27. Alkermes also opened up more than 1.5% on Monday, however, it closed down 1.35%. Biogen’s shares are up 9.9% while Alkermes’ shares are down 9.4% so far this year while the industry has gained 1.1% in that period.Per the terms of the deal, Biogen will bear 50% of the development cost of ALKS8700 for 2017. Beginning next year, Biogen will start bearing full development cost of the candidate and will also pay milestone payment of up to $200 million for various clinical and regulatory achievements.Currently, Alkermes is responsible for seeking a regulatory approval in the United States.ALKS8700’s development expense more than doubled year over year and was 12% of total research & development cost of Alkermes in the first nine months of 2017. With Biogen bearing all costs and also responsible for commercialization of ALKS8700 upon potential approval, it will reduce Alkermes’ expenses next year which is expected to boost bottom-line.A phase III study is currently evaluating ALKS8700 in patients with relapsing form of MS along with pharmacokinetic bridging studies to prove bioequivalence of the candidate to Tecfidera. ALKS8700 has shown lower gastrointestinal side effects as compared to Tecfidera. Alkermes plans to file a new drug application under 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway in the second half of 2018.Biogen Inc. Price Biogen Inc. Price | Biogen Inc.

74,BIIB,"Pipeline and regulatory updates were the focus this week with Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical (RARE  -  Free Report) gaining FDA approval for its first drug while companies like Cytokinetics (CYTK  -  Free Report) and Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR  -  Free Report) were hit by pipeline setbacks.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesUltragenyx Gets FDA Approval for Rare Genetic Disease Drug: Ultragenyx gained FDA approval for its first drug, Mepsevii (vestronidase alfa), for the treatment of children and adults with mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPS 7), also known as Sly syndrome. Mepsevii is also the first medicine to be approved for this rare genetic disease, which is estimated to affect about 200 patients in the developed world. Mepsevii will be launched later this month and the FDA has asked for a post-marketing study to evaluate the long-term safety of the product. With MPS 7 being an extraordinarily rare disease, sales should build up gradually as patients are identified and placed on therapy.   Meanwhile, Mepsevii is currently under review in the EU where an opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) should be available in the first half of 2018.In addition to gaining FDA approval for Mepsevii, Ultragenyx also got a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher, which can be used to gain priority review for any subsequent drug application that is not eligible for priority review. The company can also sell the voucher for millions of dollars to any other company that wants to fasten the review process for its candidate. BioMarin, United Therapeutics and Knight Therapeutics are some of the companies that sold their priority review vouchers for millions of dollars (Read more: Ultragenyx's rhGUS Gets FDA Nod for Rare Genetic Disease).Cytokinetics Down on Phase III Setback: Cytokinetics’s shares plunged 25.7% on negative data from the company’s late-stage study on tirasemtiv in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”). The company said that the study failed to meet the primary endpoint as well as the secondary endpoints. Cytokinetics has decided to suspend the development of tirasemtiv with the focus now shifting to Cytokinetics’s next-generation fast skeletal muscle activator, CK-2127107, which the company believes will be better tolerated and potentially more effective than tirasemtiv. Phase II results on CK-2127107 are expected in 2018. CK-2127107 is also being evaluated for spinal muscular atrophy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease, afflicts about 30,000 people in the United States with approximately 6,000 new cases being diagnosed every year in the country. There is high unmet need for new therapies with the average life expectancy of an ALS patient being about three to five years after diagnosis while only 10% of patients survive for more than 10 years. Cytokinetics had previously said that tirasemtiv could generate sales of more than $600 million - $1.1 billion in the United States alone.Cytokinetics’s shares are down 32.1% year to date, compared to the 0.6% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Acorda Scraps Tozadenant Program: Just a few days after announcing safety issues associated with a late-stage study on its investigational treatment for Parkinson’s disease, Acorda said that it is discontinuing its clinical development program for tozadenant (Read more: Acorda Stock Up Despite Phase III Trial on Tozadenant Stops). The company said that it will immediately discontinue dosing of all participants currently enrolled in its tozadenant studies. The decision to discontinue development was based on new information obtained from the phase III program related to previously disclosed agranulocytosis (the absence of white blood cells, which fight infection) and associated serious adverse events. The company said that it could not be confident that weekly white blood cell count screening would be enough to ensure patient safety.Last week, Acorda had announced that it had identified cases of agranulocytosis, possibly drug-related, in some cases associated with sepsis and death. At that time, the company had said that there would be a higher frequency of blood cell count monitoring in the phase III program for tozadenant (Read more: Acorda Reports Death in Parkinson's Trials, Stock Down 40%).Tozadenant, an oral adenosine A2a receptor antagonist, became a part of Acorda’s pipeline following its 2016 acquisition of Biotie (for approximately $376 million). Last year, Acorda had said that three of its pipeline candidates – Inbrija (CVT-301) and tozadenant for Parkinson’s and Plumiaz in epilepsy - represent potential U.S. peak net sales of more than $1 billion. However, in addition to the tozadenant setback, Acorda ran into trouble with Plumiaz and discontinued that program in 2016.It has also not been smooth sailing for Inbrija. The company had filed a new drug application (“NDA”) for Inbrija in June 2017 but the FDA issued a Refusal to File (“RTF”) letter. Acorda intends to resubmit the NDA by year end.These pipeline setbacks will weigh on Acorda, which could start facing generic competition for its flagship drug, Ampyra, from August 2018.Six Months Additional Exclusivity for UTHR’s Adcirca: United Therapeutics (UTHR  -  Free Report) announced that it has gained pediatric exclusivity in the United States for its pulmonary arterial hypertension (“PAH”) treatment, Adcirca. This means the drug will now enjoy exclusivity through May 21, 2018 before the FDA can grant approval to a generic version (Read more: United Therapeutics PAH Drug's Exclusivity Period Extended).Alnylam Starts Rolling NDA for Patisiran: Alnylam has started submitting a rolling NDA in the United States for patisiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting transthyretin (“TTR”) for the treatment of hereditary ATTR (hATTR) amyloidosis. The company expects to finish the submission by year end. Alnylam is seeking priority review for the NDA – if granted, the review process would be cut down to six months. Meanwhile, a regulatory application in the EU will also be submitted around the end of this year. Alnylam has a collaboration agreement with Sanofi for patisiran – once approved, the drug will be marketed by Alnylam in the United States, Canada and Western Europe, while Sanofi will sell the product in the rest of the world (Read more: Alnylam Starts Rolling NDA Submission for RNAi Candidate).TESARO Ovarian Cancer Drug Gets EU Nod: TESARO’s (TSRO  -  Free Report) ovarian cancer drug, Zejula, gained approval from the European Commission (“EC”) for use as a monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in complete response (“CR”) or partial response (“PR”) to platinum-based chemotherapy. This makes Zejula the first PARP inhibitor to be approved in Europe regardless of BRCA mutation or biomarker status. The treatment will initially be launched in Germany and the UK this December. EU approval was largely expected considering the CHMP had issued a positive opinion about Zejula in September. Zejula is already available in the United States where it gained approval earlier this year in March (Read more: TESARO Ovarian Cancer Drug Zejula Gets Approval in EU).   TESARO is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

75,BIIB,"The biotech industry turned around this year after the drug pricing issue crippled its performance last year.It had a number of things going in its favor. Strong quarterly results, new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products played a pivotal role in bringing the sector on track this year.However, after rising 15.4% in the first nine months of the year (January-September), the Medical-Biotech /Genetics industry has declined 13.4% so far in the fourth quarter (Oct 1 - to date). Both macro and industry specific factors resulted in the sudden downfall.Uncertain Macro PictureA big component of this sell-off is the confusion over the passing of the tax reform. The reform aims to bring down corporate tax to stimulate economic as well as employment growth.The proposed tax reforms, if approved, will leave more cash in the hands of biotech companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been relatively fewer this year compared with the last. It goes without saying that significant uncertainty regarding the timely passing of the U.S. tax reform has cast a shadow over the future of the biotech sector.In October, President Trump once again criticized high drug prices. This came at a time when investors had started to expect that Trump's action on drug prices may not be as onerous as previously feared, sending health-care stocks lower.Tepid Q3 ResultsComing to some industry specific factors, most big biotechs beat estimates for earnings and sales in Q3. However, shares of most of these companies declined post earnings release for various reasons.Although Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) topped both earnings and revenue estimates in the third quarter, it witnessed continued decline in sales of its HCV drugs — Harvoni and Sovaldi — as a result of competitive and pricing pressure.Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) also beat expectations for both earnings and sales in Q3 and raised its earnings guidance for 2017. However sales declined year over year, which resulted in share price decline post the earnings call. Sales of its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, were also disappointing.Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) shares plunged following the release of third-quarter results. Although Celgene’s earnings topped estimates, revenues fell short. Moreover, the company lowered its 2017 outlook for Otezla sales as well as its total revenue and earnings outlook for 2020.Although Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) third-quarter results were better than expected, shares were down 3.9% on concerns regarding the company’s multiple sclerosis franchise sales as well as U.S. sales of its recently launched spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”) treatment, Spinraza.Alexion (ALXN  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates but missed on revenues in the third quarter.Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) were the only two outperformers in Q3.ConclusionWe believe that the biotech space should be back on track if there is more certainty regarding the timing of the tax reforms. This is because the fundamentals of the sector remain strong. Meanwhile, with the Q3 earnings season now behind us, stocks should start picking up. Positive data from key clinical studies can drive the sector up as share price of biotechs is correlated to success in key studies. The major biotech players need an infusion of new growth drivers in their pipeline/product portfolios — either from internal development or from buying assets from outside. Strategic deals signed by these biotechs can also push the stocks higher.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

76,BIIB,"PDL BioPharma, Inc. (PDLI  -  Free Report) reported earnings of 14 cents per share in the third quarter of 2017, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 13 cents. The bottom line was also higher than the year-ago figure of 8 cents.The company generated total revenues of $63 million in the quarter, up 17% when compared with the year-earlier figure of $53.6 million. This upside is mainly driven by rise in royalty rights — change in fair value — primarily on the back of the current period’s increase in fair value of the Depomed royalty asset. Also, increase in net product revenues contributed to a stronger top line this quarter.Notably, the company received cash payments of $26.3 million from the royalty rights acquired from Depomed, primarily related to Glumetza, a product marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (VRX  -  Free Report). An authorized generic version of Glumetza was also launched by a Valeant subsidiary in February for which, PDL BioPharma receives 50% of the gross margin.Shares of the company have outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has surged 38.7% compared with the industry’s increase of 2.3%.Quarter in DetailRevenues included royalties of $1.4 million from licenses to the Queen et al. patents, which consisted of royalties earned on sales of Tysabri, net royalty payments from the acquired royalty rights and a change in fair value of the royalty rights assets of 35.4 million, interest revenues of $6.1 million and product revenues of $20.1 million (sales of Noden products — Tekturna and Tekturna HCT in the United States and leasing of the LENSAR Laser System).Revenues of $1.4 million from the Queen et al. licenses were lower than the year-ago figure of $15 million due to recognition of a refund liability of $13.5 million for the potential overpayment amount received from Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report). This is related to royalties on Tysabri sales in the United States, Spain, Italy and South Africa.Research and development (R&D) expenses for the quarter came in at $0.6 million, down 68.7% from the year-ago quarter.General and administrative expenses escalated 61.4% to nearly $12 million from the year-ago figure.PDL BioPharma, Inc.

77,BIIB,"We expect Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report), a well-known name in the multiple sclerosis (MS) market, to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 15.60%.Biogen’s shares have risen 21.4% this year, better than the industry’s growth of 12.4% in the same time frame.Biogen’s earnings performance has been pretty impressive so far, having delivered a positive surprise in each of the last four quarters. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 6.41%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderGlobal patient growth is driving prescription trends and sales of Biogen’s MS drugs. We expect the trend to continue in the third quarter. However, rising competition from Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) newly launched MS drug Ocrevus may hurt sales of Tysabri modestly as in the second quarter. The Zacks Consensus estimate for key MS drugs, Tysabri and Tecfidera are $479 million and $1.08 billion, respectively.Meanwhile, the combined number of patients using Avonex and Plegridy will continue to decline with patients transitioning to other oral MS therapies as well as due to higher discounts and allowance.Spinraza, approved for spinal muscular atrophy in December 2016, witnessed faster-than-anticipated adoption in the United States in the first half backed by robust underlying demand. In June/July, Spinraza was approved in the EU, Canada and Japan, which should boost sales in Q3. However, at the Q2 call, management had mentioned that Spinraza U.S. sales may slow in the second half, as more difficult-to-treat patients are coming on and patient transition from intensive Spinraza treatment during induction to a less intensive maintenance schedule.Biogen’s biosimilar products — Flixabi (a biosimilar referencing Remicade) and Benepali (a biosimilar referencing Enbrel) — are also generating higher revenues. The trend should continue this quarter as well.Headcount reduction and restructuring initiatives are expected to continue to lower operating expenses. Meanwhile, R&D expenses are expected to increase due to increased business development payments.Investor focus will remain on Tecfidera’s scrip trends, sales rampup of Spinraza, pipeline progress and acquisition plans.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Biogen is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for a likely positive surprise and Biogen has the right mix.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($5.72 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($5.68 per share), is +0.71%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Biogen has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Biogen’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Biogen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Biogen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Biogen Inc. QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks in the biotech/pharmaceuticals sector that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank includeBristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report), scheduled to release results on Oct 26, with an Earnings ESP of +2.35% and a Zacks Rank #3.

The above indications are the most common subtypes of dementia. The study will observe the patients over 12 weeks for dose stabilization followed by another 26 weeks for relapse of psychosis.The phase III study is designed based on clinically meaningful and statistically significant outcomes in Phase II -019 study of the drug evaluated in patients with Alzheimer’s disease psychosis. The study administered 34mg of the drug over a period of 6 weeks.Moreover, the Breakthrough Therapy designation was granted based on phase II -019 study as well as phase II -020 study investigating the drug in Parkinson’s disease psychosis.Dementia-related psychosis is a serious medical condition with no approved therapy available currently. Per the press release, there are almost 8 million people suffering from dementia with 30% among them having psychosis.The sale of Nuplazid generated $45.8 million in the first half of 2017.

79,BIIB,"It was a relatively slow week given the Thanksgiving break. Key developments this week include Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) deal with Alkermes (ALKS  -  Free Report) and Regeneron’s (REGN  -  Free Report) disappointing data on Eylea.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesBiogen Inks Deal with Alkermes for MS Drug: Biogen, a key player in the multiple sclerosis (“MS”) market, has signed up with Alkermes for the worldwide development and commercialization of ALKS 8700. ALKS 8700, a novel, oral, monomethyl fumarate (“MMF”) small drug molecule, is currently in late-stage development for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS.Under the terms of the deal, Alkermes will receive 50% of the costs it incurred in 2017 related to the development of ALKS8700 (an upfront payment of $28 million) as well as royalties in the mid-teens rate on worldwide net sales. Alkermes could also receive up to $200 million on the achievement of certain milestones with the first payment of $50 million to be recorded in 2017.With this collaboration, Biogen is basically looking to protect the sales of its blockbuster oral MS drug, Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate). A new drug application (“NDA”) for ALKS8700 will be filed in 2018 under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway referencing Tecfidera. ALKS8700, which has been associated with a differentiated gastrointestinal (“GI”) tolerability profile, is also in a head-to-head study with Tecfidera evaluating the GI profile (Read more: Biogen Acquires Worldwide License for Alkermes' MS Candidate). Alkermes’s shares were up 1.6% on the agreement while Biogen was up 1.7%.Biogen’s shares are up 11.8% year to date, compared to the 1.1% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Eylea Combination Falls Short in Mid-Stage Studies: Regeneron provided a disappointing update related to its plans for expanding the label of its flagship eye drug, Eylea. The company said that a combination of Eylea and nesvacumab, an Ang2 antibody, evaluated in a couple of mid-stage studies, did not show sufficient differentiation compared to Eylea alone to justify advancement into late-stage development.While one study was in patients with diabetic macular edema (“DME”), the other was in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). This is not the first time that Regeneron has faced a setback in its efforts to co-formulate the blockbuster drug. Last year, the company had announced that a mid-stage study evaluating Eylea in combination with rinucumab, an anti-PDGFR-beta antibody, failed to show improvement over Eylea alone in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD).Next up is data from a late-stage study evaluating Eylea in diabetic retinopathy, a growing patient population with significant need – these results should be out in the first half of 2018 (Read more: Regeneron's Stock Falls as Mid-Stage Eye Disease Studies Fail).Catalyst Drug Positive in Second Phase III Study: Catalyst Pharmaceuticals’s (CPRX  -  Free Report) shares were up 10.3% on positive top-line results from a second late-stage study on Firdapse for the symptomatic treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (“LEMS”), a rare autoimmune disorder. The company said that it remains on track to file for FDA approval in the first quarter of 2018. Firdapse has breakthrough designation in the United States (Read more: Catalyst Reports Positive Phase III Data on Firdapse).Catalyst is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

Bristol-Myers has the option to select up to ten oncology targets and two non-oncology targets. Including CTLA-4, Bristol-Myers has selected five oncology targets until now.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index was up 0.2% over the last four trading sessions. Among major biotech stocks, Biogen was up 2.6% while Regeneron declined 4.8% reflecting investor disappointment about the Eylea pipeline setback.

80,BIIB,"Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) and Alkermes plc (ALKS  -  Free Report) announced a global license and collaboration agreement to develop and commercialize Alkermes’ phase III multiple sclerosis (""MS"") candidate, ALKS 8700. Per the deal, Biogen was granted worldwide commercialization rights to Alkermes’ ALKS 8700 for an upfront payment of $28 million. In return, Biogen will pay Alkermes royalties at amid-teens percentage rate on global sales of ALKS 8700.The deal will be beneficial for both companies as it will reduce costs and bring in a strong partner for Alkermes. Meanwhile,a potential approval will give Biogen a drug bioequivalent to its key oral MS drug, Tecfidera. We remind investors that Tecfidera’s U.S. patient demand is declining slightly due to increasing competition from medicines like Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Ocrevus and a slowdown in the overall MS market.Tecfidera is also expected to face generic competition as early as 2021. A potential launch of ALKS 8700 before this will help Biogen offset Tecfidera’s sales erosion to a certain extent.Following the announcement Biogen’s shares were up 0.9% on Nov 27. Alkermes also opened up more than 1.5% on Monday, however, it closed down 1.35%. Biogen’s shares are up 9.9% while Alkermes’ shares are down 9.4% so far this year while the industry has gained 1.1% in that period.Per the terms of the deal, Biogen will bear 50% of the development cost of ALKS8700 for 2017. Beginning next year, Biogen will start bearing full development cost of the candidate and will also pay milestone payment of up to $200 million for various clinical and regulatory achievements.Currently, Alkermes is responsible for seeking a regulatory approval in the United States.ALKS8700’s development expense more than doubled year over year and was 12% of total research & development cost of Alkermes in the first nine months of 2017. With Biogen bearing all costs and also responsible for commercialization of ALKS8700 upon potential approval, it will reduce Alkermes’ expenses next year which is expected to boost bottom-line.A phase III study is currently evaluating ALKS8700 in patients with relapsing form of MS along with pharmacokinetic bridging studies to prove bioequivalence of the candidate to Tecfidera. ALKS8700 has shown lower gastrointestinal side effects as compared to Tecfidera. Alkermes plans to file a new drug application under 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway in the second half of 2018.Biogen Inc. Price Biogen Inc. Price | Biogen Inc.

Does a sell-off in the shares automatically make it a value?Value Stocks Are More Than the ChartTracey has done podcasts on value stocks that were breaking out, so the chart isn’t the end all, be all, of value investing.Value investors buy stocks trading at a discount to their earnings. Therefore, earnings are the key. Are they rising or falling? Investors need to know avoid the “value trap” scenario where a stock appears cheap, but that’s because the earnings are on the decline.Tracey took a look at five blue chip stocks that have been in the news recently, mostly for their weak stocks.Are These 5 Blue Chip Stocks Value Stocks?1.      General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) has plunged to 5-year lows. Surely, with all the bad news that’s there, including a dividend cut, there must be some value, right? However, it’s forward P/E is 17.2, which still isn’t that cheap. What does the earnings forecast reveal?2.     Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) is dirt cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of just 5.9. Shares are down 43% this year, however, on worries that the department stores are doomed. But are the earnings estimates really signaling the end is near?3.     Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) was weak through May and has since rallied. Shares, however, are still well under the 2015 highs. It trades with an attractive forward P/E of 14.3 but does it have the earnings growth to get the thumbs up?4.     Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report) is still down over 20% year-to-date and near 5-year lows. But are the shares cheap enough, and the earnings growing fast enough, to qualify it for the coveted value stock designation?5.     Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report) shares are weak compared to the S&P 500. Exxon is down 11% year-to-date, but are off their 2017 lows. With crude hanging out above $50 pretty consistently, are the oil stock earnings finally showing a rebound?Remember, the Price-to-Earnings ratio is predicated on both price AND earnings. Value investors need to check those earnings before deciding that a stock is “cheap.”What else should you know about beaten down blue-chip stocks?Listen to this week’s podcast to find out.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

82,BIIB,"We expect Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IONS  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 7.Last quarter, the company reported a wider-than-expected loss, resulting in a negative surprise of 50%. The company has missed estimates twice in the four trailing quarters while beating the same on two occasions, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 21.90%.Notably, Ionis’ share price has increased 19.4% year to date, compared with the Zacks classified industry’s decline of 0.2%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Ionis is likely to beat estimates this quarter as it has the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – which have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +150%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 5 cents per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 2 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Ionis’ currently carries a Zacks Rank #1, which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to ConsiderIonis earns revenues in the form of upfront, milestone and other payments under its partnerships with leading health care companies like Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) and Glaxo. These agreements also validate the company’s technology platform.Ionis and Biogen received FDA approval for Spinraza in December 2016 for treating spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”). The drug was approved in Europe in June 2017 as the first treatment for SMA. Ionis had entered into a collaboration agreement with Biogen to develop and commercialize Spinraza in 2012. Moreover, as part of the licensing agreement with Biogen, Ionis earns royalties on Spinraza sales from Biogen.Last week, Biogen released its third-quarter 2017 results and announced that Spinraza has witnessed strong demand in the United States, which drove sales. The company is working on expanding access to all patients.In June 2017, Spinraza received approval in Japan, which earned Ionis $40 million in milestone payments in August. Moreover, Ionis received another $10 million from Biogen associated with the validation of an undisclosed neurological disease target.Apart from Spinraza, we expect investor focus to be on pipeline updates at the third-quarter conference call.During the quarter, Ionis and Akcea submitted regulatory applications to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), the FDA and Health Canada for volanesorsen for the treatment of patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (“FCS”). We note that in March, the companies had announced positive results from the Phase III APPROACH study of volanesorsen in patients with FCS. In fact, the companies believe that volanesorsen has the potential to be the first treatment option for patients suffering from the daily burden as well as the life-threatening risks of FCS.Notably in August, Ionis announced that Glaxo has declined its option to develop Inotersen and IONIS-FB-L Rx. Ionis now retains all rights to the candidates and will develop them independently. Ionis announced data from a completed phase III study in May, which demonstrated significant improvement in neurological disease progression and quality of life in patients with hereditary TTR amyloidosis.Ionis has several early to mid-stage pipeline candidates for various indications. We expect the company to provide updates on different studies, including the path forward for Inotersen, in the third-quarter earnings call.Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

83,BIIB,"Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. (ACOR  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings of 43 cents per share in the third quarter of 2017, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 66 cents. The company had incurred a loss of 4 cents per share a year ago.Acorda’s shares have rallied 41.4% so far this year compared with the industry’s 3.3% increase. Including the impact of stock-based compensation expenses as well as other non-recurring items, the company incurred a loss of 55 cents per share in the reported quarter compared with the year-ago loss figure of 28 cents.Total revenue came in at $141.1 million, up 4% year over year, mainly owing to increase in net product revenues. However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $151 million by 6.6%.Quarter in DetailThe majority of Acorda’s net product revenue was generated by the company’s key drug Ampyra, which raked in sales of $132.6 million in the reported quarter. Revenues grew 3% year over year and inched up marginally by 0.8% sequentially.Ampyra is marketed in the ex-U.S. markets by Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) under the trade name, Fampyra. Biogen pays royalties to Acorda on the outside U.S. sales. Fampyra royalties were $3.1 million, up 19.2% year over year.Acorda’s research and development (R&D) expenses decreased 39.7% year over year to $31.3 million. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses also declined 23.7% to $36.1 million.Pipeline UpdatesThe company, along with the third-quarter earning release, announced that it expects to resubmit the new drug application (“NDA”) for its Parkinson’s disease (“PD”) candidate, Inbrija in the fourth quarter of 2017. Note that, in August, the company received a refusal-to-file (“RTF”) letter from the FDA in connection with the NDA for Inbrija.The FDA deemed the application incomplete after a preliminary review and as a result, the regulatory body wanted additional supporting information to review the application. Subsequently, after having a discussion with the FDA to resolve the issue, the company decided to resubmit the same in the aforementioned period.Notably, Acorda has deferred its plan to submit regulatory applications for Inbrija in the EU to the first quarter of 2018, which was earlier expected to be submitted by the year-end.The company also has another late-stage pipeline candidate, tozadenant, in its PD portfolio. The company expects to present top-line data from an ongoing phase III study on the candidate in the first quarter of 2018.2017 GuidanceThe company maintained its Ampyra net sales guidance in the range of $535-$545 million.The company continues to expect its R&D expenses for 2017 in the range of $160-$170 millionThe company lowered its SG&A expenditure to a band of $160-$170 million from $170-$180 million expected previously.Acorda awaits a positive cash balance in excess of $200 million by the end of 2017.Acorda Therapeutics, Inc.

84,BIIB,"Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) third quarter results surpassed both top-and bottom-line expectations. Meanwhile, Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) CAR T therapy gained earlier-than-expected FDA approval. Alexion (ALXN  -  Free Report) also got a regulatory boost with the FDA expanding the label of the company’s flagship product, Soliris.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesBiogen Beats on All Fronts: Although Biogen’s third quarter results were better than expected with the company surpassing both earnings and revenue expectations, shares were down 3.9% on concerns regarding the company’s multiple sclerosis franchise sales as well as U.S. sales of its recently launched spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”) treatment, Spinraza. Spinraza U.S. sales were $198 million in the third quarter, more or less flat from second quarter sales of $195 million though the company reported a 75% increase in the number of patients on therapy in the United States compared to the end of the second quarter. However, second quarter sales included inventory buildup of $30 million (Read more: Biogen Tops Q3 Earnings & Sales, Spinraza Sales Up).Biogen has gained 11.3% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 8.2% rally.Gilead CAR T Therapy Yescarta Approved: Gilead’s Yescarta, which became a part of the company’s portfolio following the $11.9 billion Kite Pharma acquisition, gained FDA approval for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. This makes Yescarta the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapy to gain approval for use in this patient population.Yescarta is the second gene therapy to gain approval in the United States, the first being Novartis’s Kymriah. Both treatments come with a Boxed Warning regarding the risks of cytokine release syndrome (“CRS”) and neurologic toxicities.Yescarta’s approval is a major boost for Gilead which is currently facing declining sales from its hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) franchise. According to information provided by the company, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”) - about 7,500 patients with refractory DLBCL are eligible for CAR T therapy every year. Yescarta represents a new treatment option for these patients who have run out of treatment options and face a poor prognosis. Yescarta will be launched with a list price of $373,000 in the United States and is currently under review in the EU where a response is expected in the first half of 2018 (Read more: Gilead CAR-T Therapy Yescarta Clinches FDA Approval).Gilead also announced phase II results on its investigational treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (""NASH""). The company said that the higher dose (20 mg) of GS-0976, an oral ACC inhibitor, achieved significant reductions in buildup of fat in the liver and a noninvasive marker of fibrosis (TIMP-1) compared to placebo. However, statistical significance was not achieved for other parameters like liver stiffness (by FibroScan and MRE), serum ALT and PIII-NP, a serum marker of fibrogenesis. Meanwhile, differences between the lower dose (5 mg) of GS-0976 and placebo were not statistically significant.Celgene Hit by Crohn’s Disease Study Discontinuation: Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) shares were down 10.8% on news that the company will be discontinuing studies (phase III REVOLVE study and the extension study (SUSTAIN)) being conducted with its investigational Crohn’s disease drug, GED-0301 (mongersen). The decision was based on a recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee in October following an interim futility analysis. No meaningful safety imbalances were observed in the analysis.Celgene also said that it will wait to review the full dataset from the phase II ulcerative colitis study on GED-0301 before deciding the path forward. The company will not be initiating the phase III DEFINE study for Crohn’s disease (Read more: Celgene Down on Discontinued Crohn's Disease Drug Study).AbbVie Announces Immuno-Therapy Focused Deals: AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced a couple of deals this week. While one deal is focused on immuno-neurology, the other is focused on immuno-oncology.The immuno-neurology deal will see AbbVie collaborating with Alector for the use of the latter’s immuno-neurology discovery platform for innovative new therapies for Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders.Immuno-neurology, a rapidly evolving scientific area, is focused on harnessing the power of the immune system to attack neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease.While development and commercialization costs as well as profits will be shared equally by the companies, Alector will get an upfront payment of $205 million and a potential, future equity investment of up to $20 million.Meanwhile, the immuno-oncology deal will see AbbVie teaming up with Harpoon Therapeutics for the use of Harpoon's tri-specific T-cell activating construct (TriTAC) platform with AbbVie's research-stage immuno-oncology targets to develop cancer therapeutics (Read more: AbbVie Inks Immuno-Oncology Deal with Harpoon Therapeutics).Label Expansion for Alexion’s Soliris: The FDA granted approval to Alexion for the use of its flagship product, Soliris (eculizumab) in adult patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are AchR antibody-positive. Soliris, already approved in the United States for serious ultra-rare disorders like paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), brought in sales of $1.6 billion in the first half of the year. The gMG indication represents incremental growth opportunity for Soliris.Alexion is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

85,BIIB,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report), a well-known name in the multiple sclerosis (MS) market, surpassed expectations both for earnings and sales in the third quarter of 2017. The company’s revenue was driven by continued a strong performance of its newest drug Spinraza, for spinal muscular atrophy.Despite better-than-expected results, Biogen’s shares were down almost 3% in pre-market trading. This was probably due to the fact that the sales of its multiple sclerosis franchise were below expectations amid an increasingly competitive market. However, we note that Biogen’s shares have gained 15.8% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s increase of 9%.Third-quarter 2017 earnings per share were $6.31, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.70 by 10.7%. Earnings also rallied 22% year over year.Sales came in at $3.08 billion, up 4% from the year-ago period. Sales also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.04 billion by 1.6%. The top line, excluding hemophilia revenues, grew 13% year over year. The company spun off its hemophilia business in February this year.Quarter in Detail                           Biogen’s MS revenues were $2.3 billion in the quarter including approximately $65 million in royalties on the sales of Roche’s MS drug Ocrevus.Tecfidera sales increased 3% from the year-ago period to $1.07 billion. However, the drug recorded a 4% sequential drop in revenues. This included the U.S. sales of $836.3 million and ex-U.S. sales of $233.3 million. In the United States, Tecfidera Inventory levels in the third quarter were relatively flat compared with the year-ago levels, which hurt sales in the reported quarter.Third-quarter Tysabri revenues were $469 million (U.S. $266.8 million, ex-U.S. $202.6 million), which decreased 9% year over year and 5% sequentially. We believe Ocrevus’ launch has put pressure on Tysabri’s U.S. sales in the quarter.Combined interferon revenues (Avonex and Plegridy) in the third quarter were $662 million (U.S. $473.3 million, ex-U.S. $188.7 million), down 7% from the year-ago period. Avonex revenues declined 7% from the year-ago period to $538 million. Plegridy contributed $124 million to third-quarter 2017 revenues, down 3% year over year and 7% sequentially.U.S. Interferon revenues are experiencing declining trends due to patients transitioning to other oral MS therapies as well as higher discounts and allowance.Zinbryta, launched in collaboration with AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) in August last year, contributed $14 million to revenues in the third quarter, down 11% sequentially.Newly launched Spinraza brought revenues of $271 million (U.S. revenues $197.6 million) in the third quarter, registering growth of 33.5% sequentially as the drug witnesses a strong demand in the United States. The company is working on expanding access to all patients.This quarter, Biogen recorded biosimilar revenues of $101 million compared with $91 million in second-quarter 2017. The company markets Benepali, a biosimilar referencing Amgen Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel in Europe. Benepali recorded revenues of $99.2 million, registering a growth rate of 11.8% sequentially. Biogen also markets Flixabi, a biosimilar referencing Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug, Remicade, which recorded revenues of $2.2 million in the reported quarter compared with $1.9 million in the second quarter.Revenues from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs, which include Biogen’s shares of Rituxan and Gazyva operating profits, climbed 28% from the year-ago period to $406 million in the third quarter.R&D spend decreased 15.6% in the reported quarter to $446.4 million, while SG&A spend declined 6.2% year over year to $433.8 million. Collaboration AgreementThis month, Biogen announced restructuring of collaboration arrangements with Eisai and Neurimmune to improve long-term value of Alzheimer candidate aducanumab, which is presently in a phase III study.Concurrent with the earnings release, Biogen announced a renegotiation of its agreement with Neurimmune by making a one-time payment of $150 million in exchange of a reduction in Neurimmune’s 15% royalty rate on the potential sales of aducanumab. The re-negotiated deal thus increases aducanumab’s profit potential.On Oct 23, Biogen and partner Eisai refined their existing Alzheimer collaboration. Biogen already has an agreement with Eisai to develop the phase III BACE inhibitor, E2609 and the phase II amyloid-beta antibody, BAN240 for Alzheimer’s disease. However, Biogen has announced that Eisai has exercised the option to jointly develop and commercialize aducanumab. The company will now receive 55% of aducanumab’s potential profits in the United States, 68.5% in Europe and 20% in Japan.Biogen Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Biogen Inc.

86,BIIB,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.05, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.03 per share by 1.9%. Earnings rose 19% from the year-ago quarter backed by volume driven pharma sales growth and higher operating profits.Revenues BeatQuarterly revenues of $5.66 billion also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.52 billion by 2.5%. Sales grew 9% year over year backed by strong performance of the new drugs as well as Lilly’s diabetes products. Lilly’s diabetes products recorded revenue growth of 39% worldwide.Volumes rose 7% as a strong performance of new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance and Lartruvo offset decline in sales of established products like Zyprexa, Alimta, Cialis, Strattera and Effient. Higher realized prices for several drugs also contributed 2% to sales growth in the quarter.Revenue in DetailPharmaceutical revenues rose 10% in the quarter backed by 14% volume growth of the new products.While U.S. revenues grew 9% to $3.1 billion, ex-U.S. revenues rose 8% to $2.55 billion.Established products that recorded growth during the quarter include Forteo (up 13% to $441.7 million) and Humalog (up 9% to $696.2 million). Sales of all other established products declined in the quarter.Alimta sales declined 10% to $514.5 million, reflecting lower demand in the United States due to competitive pressure, mainly from immuno-oncology agents. Outside the United States., sales of Alimta were hurt by loss of exclusivity in several countries, increased competition and lower realized prices.Zyprexa sales declined 6% to $140.6 million due to loss of exclusivity.Humulin sales decreased 7% in the quarter to $300.5 million due to lower realized prices and unfavorable buying patterns in China.Cialis sales declined 4% to $564.9 million hurt by lower demand in the United States as well as increased competition from generic sildenafilErbitux sales declined 11% to $163.5 million in the quarter. Strattera sales declined 31% to $137.1 million. Cymbalta sales declined 42% to $183.2 million. Effient sales declined 56% to $55.9 million in the quarter.Among the new products, Trulicity generated revenues of $527.7 million, up 117% year over year, with U.S. revenues benefiting from growth in the GLP-1 market and market share gains.Cyramza revenues were $196.0 million, up 23% year over year, backed by continued strong outside U.S. revenues and improved U.S. revenues. Cyramza’s ex-U.S. revenues benefited from strong volumes in Japan. U.S. revenues increased 4% driven by increased volume.Jardiance sales (up 168% to $127.2 million) were driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class.Basaglar recorded revenues of $145.7 million compared with $86.6 million in the previous quarter backed by strong launch uptake. Basaglar - Lilly and partner Boehringer Ingelheim’s follow-on insulin to Sanofi’s (SNY  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug, Lantus - was launched in the United States in mid-December 2016 where it generated revenues of $115.2 million in the quarter.Taltz brought in sales of $151.3 million compared with $138.7 million in the previous quarter, reflecting strong launch uptake.Lartruvo (olaratumab) generated revenues of $54.5 million in the third quarter of 2017 compared with $47.4 million in the previous quarter. Lartruvo was launched in the United States and the EU for soft tissue sarcoma in the fourth quarter of 2016.Lilly and partner Incyte Corporation’s (INCY  -  Free Report) rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug Olumiant (baricitinib) has been launched in select European countries and in Japan. The drug generated sales of $16.2 million in the third quarter of 2017 compared with $4.8 million in the previous quarter backed by strong launch uptake in Germany.However, in the United States, Lilly received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA for baricitinib in April for want of additional data. In August, Lilly and Incyte announced that they will re-submit the NDA for baricitinib much faster than previously expected. The NDA is expected to be re-submitted before the end of January next year.Lilly's Elanco Animal Health segment sales rose 5% to $740.6 million due to inclusion of revenues from the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica's U.S. feline, canine and rabies (acquired in January 2017). However, worldwide competitive pressure continued to hurt sales in the segment.Concurrent with the earnings release, Lilly said that it is exploring strategic alternatives for the Elanco Animal Health business including a sale, merger or creating a separate company through an initial public offer. A decision regarding the same is expected to be made no later than the middle of next year and Lilly may ultimately opt to retain the business.Gross Margin Down but Operating Income RisesAdjusted gross margin of 75.1% in the quarter decreased 130 basis points as manufacturing efficiencies were offset by negative product mix and the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold.Operating income increased 18% to $1.38 billion. Total operating expenses, as a percent of revenues, declined 310 basis points in the quarter to 50.8%.2017 Outlook UppedLilly raised its previously issued 2017 adjusted earnings and sales outlook for the second time this year. Adjusted earnings per share are now expected in the range of $4.15 to $4.25 compared with $4.10 to $4.20 expected previously. Revenues are expected in the range of $22.4 billion and $22.7 billion, up from $22.0–$22.5 billion expected previously.Gross margin is expected to be approximately 76%, same as previously expected. Adjusted tax rate is still expected to be approximately 21% (previously approximately 22%).Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are still expected in the range of $6.4–$6.6 billion, while research and development expenses are projected to be $5.1-$5.2 billion compared with $5.0-$5.2 billion expected previously.Our TakeLilly’s third-quarter 2017 results were strong with the company beating estimates on both counts. The pharma giant also raised its sales and earnings outlook for the year. The increase in revenue guidance was supported by strong uptake trends of the new products and also, to some extent, due to the positive impact of Euro.Shares were up 2.6% in pre-market trading. So far this year, Lilly’s share price has risen 18.5% compared with an increase of 20.2% for the industry.Going forward, new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo are expected to see higher revenues. Lilly also expects some established products like Trajenta, Forteo and Humalog to continue doing well. Lilly is also progressing well with its pipeline. Earlier this month, Lilly gained FDA approval for Verzenio (abemaciclib), a CDK 4/6 inhibitor for metastatic breast cancer. Since 2014, Lilly has launched nine medicines, including Verzenio and plans to launch eleven more by 2023.However, Alimta will continue to be impacted by competition. Other headwinds include competition from immuno-oncology agents as well as loss of exclusivity for many drugs in emerging markets.Lilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

It holds about 30 healthcare and medical stocks for the long term.Tracey has been getting questions from listeners wondering if there is any value in healthcare stocks right now. Are any of them cheap?Biotechs on FireThe biotechs are hot again. The S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) has soared 47% this year while the iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology ETF (IBB) has gained 27%.But can some value still be found in the biotechs? And what about all the other healthcare industries?Zacks’ Medical Sector has over 800 companies, including drug companies, hospitals, managed care insurers, medical device companies, dental companies and others. They’re not all created equal.Tracey and Kevin ran a screen to quickly find basic value stocks within the sector. They looked only in the Medical sector and chose a current year forward P/E less than 20 and a next year forward P/E of under 15.They didn’t screen for Zacks Rank.It returned 61 stocks.Tracey and Kevin discuss about a dozen of them on this week’s podcast including these 5 big names.5 Cheap Healthcare Stocks1.      Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) has been cheap for years. It trades with a forward P/E of just 9.1. But earnings are on the decline. The company made $11.57 last year and expects to just make $8.74 this year. It recently bought KITE but will that be enough to give earnings a boost? Or is it a value trap?2.      Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) is another big biotech that is cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of just 15.6. Two analysts just raised their price targets to over $400 on the stock. Unlike Gilead, it’s expected to see earnings growth this year and next year.3.      Teva (TEVA  -  Free Report) is the cheapest in the group. It trades with a forward P/E of 3.4 but investors have to be concerned about those falling earnings estimates. It made $5.14 in 2016 and is expected to make just $3.82 in 2018. Is it a value trap?4.      AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) has the rare combination of an attractive P/E at just 16.4 and rising earnings estimates. Earnings are expected to jump 14% in 2017 and another 19% in 2018. Should ABBV be on your short list?5.      Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) is in the managed care group, which, is one of the most difficult areas to be in right now due to Obamacare uncertainty. But Aetna has been reducing its exposure to the exchanges and it trades with a forward P/E of just 15.9.There are other industries that are also in the cone of uncertainty due to the unknowns surrounding Obamacare, including the hospitals.Tracey and Kevin discuss the hospital group, especially Tenet Healthcare (THC).Additionally, Valeant (VRX) appears to be cheap, but Tracey fears it’s a value trap.And what about medical device companies? They’ve been hot this year but are they just too expensive to make the list?Find out the answer to all of these questions and more on this week’s podcast.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.See the pot trades we're targeting>>

90,BIIB,"Companies like Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report) were in the news with Amgen providing pipeline and regulatory updates while Regeneron and partner Sanofi got some good news with an appeals court ruling in their favor in the PCSK9 inhibitor lawsuit against Amgen.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesPhase II Combination Data on Amgen’s Imlygic Published: Positive data on Amgen’s oncolytic viral therapy, Imlygic, when used in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Yervoy were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Results from the mid-stage study showed that the objective response rate (""ORR"") more than doubled when Imlygic was used in combination with Yervoy compared to Yervoy alone in patients with unresectable stage IIIB-IV melanoma (39% versus 18%). Moreover, the complete response rate was almost double in the combination arm compared to Yervoy alone (13% versus 7%). Responses were observed in both injected and uninjected lesions, including visceral lesions.Advanced melanoma is highly aggressive and one of the most dangerous types of skin cancer with there being need for multiple treatment approaches over the course of the disease. The data is encouraging and could open up new avenues of revenues for Imlygic if it eventually gains approval for use in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor. Sales of Imlygic, approved in October 2015, are yet to pick up.Meanwhile, Amgen said that the FDA has accepted its regulatory application seeking label expansion for the use of Prolia in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, the most common form of secondary osteoporosis. A response from the agency should be out on May 28, 2018. Prolia, which brought in sales of $505 million in the second quarter of 2017, is an important growth driver for Amgen with the company working on improving diagnosis, treatment rates and duration in order to drive access to a greater number of patients (Read more: Amgen Label Expansion Application for Prolia Accepted by FDA).Amgen is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. Shares of Amgen have gained 27.1% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 13.9% rally. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Breather for Amgen with Neulasta Biosimilar Approval Delay: Amgen got a bit of a breather with the FDA issuing a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) for Mylan and Biocon’s biosimilar version of Amgen’s blockbuster drug, Neulasta (pegfilgrastim). While the agency did not raise any queries regarding biosimilarity, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, clinical data or immunogenicity of MYL-1401H, the CRL relates to the pending update of the regulatory application with certain CMC data from facility requalification activities post recent plant modifications.We note that Mylan and Biocon are not the only companies to get a CRL from the FDA for a biosimilar version of Neulasta. While Novartis’s Sandoz had received a CRL last year, Coherus was issued a CRL this year in June.  Regeneron/Sanofi Score a Win in PCSK9 Inhibitor Litigation: Regeneron and partner Sanofi got a major boost with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ordering a new trial related to Amgen’s claims regarding patents for PCSK9 inhibitors. The court also vacated the permanent injunction in the lawsuit which means Sanofi and Regeneron can continue selling their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent, in the United States (Read more: Regeneron and Sanofi Get Favorable Ruling Against Amgen).AbbVie in Immuno-Oncology Deal: AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) has entered into a research, option and license agreement with clinical-stage immuno-oncology company Turnstone Biologics. The deal provides AbbVie with an exclusive option to license up to three of Turnstone's next-generation oncolytic viral immunotherapies.Turnstone’s Ad-MG1-MAGEA3 therapy is in a couple of phase I/II studies for different solid tumor indications alone as well as in combination with an approved anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor.Promising New Data on Biogen’s Spinraza: New phase III data presented by Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) on Spinraza showed that earlier initiation of treatment with the therapy may improve motor function outcomes in infants and children with spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”). Biogen and Ionis’s Spinraza is the first approved medicine for the treatment of SMA. Spinraza is off to a promising start in the United States bringing in sales of $203 million in the second quarter of 2017.Clovis Seeks Label Expansion for PARP Inhibitor: Clovis Oncology (CLVS  -  Free Report) has filed for label expansion of its PARP inhibitor, Rubraca, in the United States. The company is looking to get the drug approved for the maintenance treatment of patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. The company had presented impressive late-stage data earlier this year in June on Rubraca showing that the treatment significantly improved progression-free survival in all ovarian cancer patient populations evaluated in the ARIEL3 study.Rubraca had gained accelerated FDA approval in December 2016 for use in advanced ovarian cancer patients who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies and who have deleterious germline or somatic BRCA mutations. A broader label would boost Rubraca’s sales potential (Read more: Clovis Submits sNDA for Ovarian Cancer Drug Rubraca).PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index was up 0.6% over the last five trading sessions. Among major biotech stocks, Biogen gained 4.9% while Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) lost 4.4%.

91,BIIB,"The U.S. equity market maintained a steady momentum, rebuffing geopolitical threats related to North Korean missile tests and deadly terrorist attacks in the home soil in Las Vegas. As investors reposed their faith in riskier bets like equities, courtesy of strengthening dollar and sell-off in global bond markets, ‘cash cow’ stocks that offer higher returns have been sought after.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry – the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screen:Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Dallas, TX, Texas Instruments is an original equipment manufacturer of analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits.

93,BIIB,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN  -  Free Report) got a boost with the EU approving its key revenue driver Soliris for an additional indication. Meanwhile, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) was in the news with an investigation being launched into the rising prices of multiple sclerosis (""MS"") drugs. The investigation has been launched by Rep. Elijah E. Cummings and Rep. Peter Welch with letters being sent to seven companies including Biogen requesting information about their pricing strategies for their MS drugs.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesEU Label Expansion for Alexion’s Soliris: Alexion’s flagship  product, Soliris, gained EU approval for the treatment of patients with refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) making it the first and only complement-based therapy approved in the EU for an ultra-rare subset of gMG. Alexion will launch Soliris for this indication initially in Germany and is evaluating additional EU launches.The gMG indication represents incremental growth opportunity for Soliris and enables the company to enter the neurology therapeutic area. Soliris is currently under review in the U.S. and Japan (response expected early next year) for the gMG indication. With the EU granting approval, it looks like Soliris will gain approval in the U.S. as well where a decision is expected by Oct 23, 2017. According to information provided by the company, about 60,000 – 80,000 people in the U.S. suffer from myasthenia gravis (MG) – Alexion’s targeted population will be approximately 5%-10% of the total MG patient population. Results from a late-stage study (REGAIN) conducted by the company indicate that about 60% of these refractory gMG patients will respond to treatment with Soliris.Soliris is Alexion’s key growth driver with the drug bringing in sales of $1.6 billion in the first half of 2017. The company expects Soliris revenues of $3,075 - $3,125 million in 2017, assuming the identification of a steady number of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) across the globe (Also read: Alexion's Soliris' Label Expansion Approved in Europe).Alexion is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.

99,BIIB,"The second quarter earnings season is off to a strong start. As of July 25, approximately 128 S&P 500 companies or 36.1% of the index’s total membership have reported results.  A deep look into the results show that earnings for the companies reported so far are up 7% year over year on 4.2% higher revenues. Of these, 77.3% have topped earnings estimates while 70.3% have beat on revenue estimates. However, the pace of growth is below the first quarter but in line with the four-quarter average and has improved over the 12-quarter average. Going forward, estimates for the third quarter are going down. The estimate for Q3 growth is 4.8%, down from 6% at the start of the quarter.The Pharma sector has more or less combated the overall decline in the financial markets and maintained momentum.  Last week, industry bellwether Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) reported mixed second-quarter results, beating on earnings but missing on sales. Swiss major Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) reported encouraging second-quarter results. Meanwhile, biotech giant Biogen Inc.

Other key products – Pomalyst/Imnovid, Abraxane and Otezla continue to perform well. In the second-quarter call, investors are expected to remain focused on the company’s performance and label expansion efforts, along with updates on the pipeline front.

100,BIIB,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced data from a long-term study on its Alzheimer's disease (AD) candidate, aducanumab. Data from the study showed a continued benefit in the rate of amyloid decline over a two/three year period in patients with prodromal or mild Alzheimer’s disease when treated with aducanumab.Shares were up 2.5% on Monday, in response to the promise shown by the anti-amyloid candidate.The company said the results from a recently conducted analysis of the long-term extension (LTE) of its ongoing phase Ib study (PRIME) of aducanumab were consistent with the previously reported data from PRIME.PRIME is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose phase Ib study being conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of aducanumab in patients suffering from prodromal or mild AD.So far this year, Biogen’s shares have risen 3% while the industry recorded an increase of 7.2%.Biogen is conducting two other phase III studies (ENGAGE and EMERGE) on aducanumab for the treatment of early AD. The results from LTE study support the design of ENGAGE and EMERGE studies.Biogen is looking to strengthen its AD and other neurodegenerative disorders pipeline. Biogen’s AD pipeline comprises candidates with different mechanisms of action including anti-tau candidate (BIIB092/BMS-986168 - with potential in AD as well as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)), anti-amyloid (aducanumab) candidates as well as a BACE inhibitor (elenbecestat) program.However, the successful development of therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease is challenging and we note that several companies have failed in developing treatments for the same. In November last year, Eli Lilly & Company's (LLY  -  Free Report) anti-amyloid candidate solanezumab failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage AD study. Lilly decided to drop the development of solanezumab. Lilly suffered a major setback in Aug 2010, when it had to halt the development of another phase III Alzheimer’s candidate semagacestat.Meanwhile, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) shelved its late-stage Alzheimer’s candidate, bapineuzumab IV, after it failed two phase III studies. Pfizer was developing the candidate in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Elan Corporation.The Alzheimer’s disease market represents a huge commercial potential and a successfully developed product could generate billions of dollars in sales once launched.Biogen has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company is looking to get Cabometyx approved for use in treatment-naïve advanced renal cell cancer patients. With the FDA granting priority review, a response should be out on Feb 15, 2018.Cabometyx is currently approved for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy.

107,BIIB,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Biogen Inc.(BIIB  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Biogen has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.6, as you can see in the chart below: This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.3. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Biogen’s current PE level puts below its midpoint of 23.3 over the past five years. Moreover, the current level stands way below the highs for the stock, indicating that it could be a solid entry point. Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 38.8. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that Biogen has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 14.7, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Apple stock in the near term too.PEG RatioWhile earnings are certainly important, it is essential to know how much you are paying for the growth of earnings as well. One can easily do that with the PEG ratio (ratio of the P/E to the expected future earnings growth rate). The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture of the valuation of a stock than the P/E ratio.Biogen’s PEG ratio stands at just 1.9, compared with the industry average of 3.3. This suggests a decent undervalued trading relative to its earnings growth potential right now.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Biogen currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Biogen a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 13.5, which is far better than the industry average of 23.8. Clearly, BIIB is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?While Biogen might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of A. This gives BIIB a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)The current quarter has seen thirteen upward estimate revisions in the past sixty days compared to three downward, while the full year estimate has seen sixteen upward and three downward revisions in the same time frame.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has increased 0.2% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has risen by 0.1%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Biogen Inc. Price and Consensus Biogen Inc. Price and Consensus | Biogen Inc. QuoteThe stock holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates expectations of in-line performance from the company in the near term. However, Biogen is enjoying bullish analyst sentiment, as indicated by the positive estimate revisions, and this works in the company’s favor.Bottom LineBiogen is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Despite having a Zacks Rank #3, the stock belongs to an industry which is ranked among the Top 40%, which indicates that broader factors are favorable for the company.So, despite a Zacks Rank #3, we believe that bullish analyst sentiment and favorable industry factors make this value stock a compelling pick.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.  Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

108,BIIB,"The biosimilar space remains in the spotlight as a number of regulatory decisions are pending. While generic drugs are follow-on versions of chemically synthesized molecules, biosimilars contain a version of the active substance of an already approved original biological drug.Development of biosimilars is technically challenging than the development of generic drugs as the former requires clinical studies in patients and are engineered to match the reference drug in quality, safety and efficacy. Due to the complex nature of the product, the development and the regulatory pathway of biosimilars differ significantly from that of generics.A biosimilar is usually less expensive than the branded drug. Thus the market for the same remains highly lucrative. With the acceleration in approvals of biosimilars, the market has thus attracted a lot of players which is witnessing rapid growth. Here are a few latest developments from this space:Leading the biosimilar space is Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm Sandoz, which is a strong player in the biosimilar market with five marketed biosimilars (Omnitrope, a human growth hormone; Binocrit, an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent used to treat anemia; and filgrastim for neutropenia under the brand names Zarzio outside the United States and Zarxio in the United States.).The company plans to launch five major oncology and immunology biosimilars between 2017 and 2020. This includes a biosimilar version of Rituxan (rituximab), which was approved by the European Commission in June 2017 (marketed as Rixathon).Recently, the FDA accepted its Biologics License Application (BLA) for a proposed biosimilar version of Rituxan. In August 2016, Sandoz’s Erelzi, a biosimilar version of Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug Enbrel gained approval in the United States for five indications. Erelzi was also approved by the European Commission in 2017.In May 2017, the European Medicines Agency also accepted the company’s Marketing Authorization Applications for biosimilar versions of Humira (adalimumab) and Remicade (infliximab) for review. Novartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Generic leader Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) is also exploring the world of biosimilars, a market that has the potential to grow to $20 billion in 2020. The FDA recently notified Mylan and partner Biocon that the target action date for a biosimilar version of Herceptin (trastuzumab) has been extended to Dec 3, 2017.A decision from the FDA was expected by Sep 3 but the FDA extended the review period due to review of some of the clarificatory information submitted to the agency as part of the application review process. We note that the Biocon partnership includes six biosimilar programs such as biosimilar versions of Herceptin, Neulasta, Humira, Avastin, Enbrel and Neupogen and three insulin analogs (Lantus, Humalog and NovoLog).Mylan has a collaboration agreement with Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (MNTA  -  Free Report) to develop, manufacture and commercialize up to six of Momenta’s current biosimilar candidates, including Momenta’s biosimilar candidate, Orencia (abatacept). Mylan currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Meanwhile, Amgen and Allergan plc. (AGN  -  Free Report) have also submitted a BLA to the FDA for ABP 980, a biosimilar candidate to Herceptin in Jul 2017. We note that both the companies are collaborating on four oncology biosimilars, including ABP 980 which is the second to be submitted for FDA approval.Both companies have also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency for the candidate earlier in 2017. We note that Amgen has a total of 10 biosimilars in its pipeline, one of which has been approved by the FDA. In March 2017, the European Commission granted marketing authorization to Amgevita, a biosimilar version of Humira in all available indications. The companies have an important event lined up as the FDA is expected to give a decision on the approval of ABP 215, a biosimilar version of Avastin shortly. Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Last month, biotech major Biogen, Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission granted a marketing authorization for Imraldi, a biosimilar version of Humira. This is the third anti-TNF biosimilar from Biogen to receive a marketing authorization in the European Union following the approval of Benepali, a biosimilar of Enbrel and Flixabi (infliximab), a biosimilar version of Remicade. Biogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In July 2017, Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) launched Reneflexis, a biosimilar version of Remicade in the United States which was approved by the FDA in April. The FDA also granted tentative approval for Lusduna Nexvue, the biosimilar version of Lantus, basal insulin in a pre-filled dosing device.

109,BIIB,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) and partner Neurocrine Biosciences announced that the new drug application (NDA) for their pipeline candidate, elagolix, has been submitted to the FDA. AbbVie is looking to get elagolix approved as an oral medicine for the management of pain associated with endometriosis.The NDA filing is supported by positive results from two replicate pivotal phase III trials evaluating elagolix, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, in this indication. The detailed data from the study, presented in October last year, showed that treatment with elagolix resulted in statistically significant reductions in menstrual and non-menstrual pelvic pain associated with endometriosis compared to placebo. Data from the studies also demonstrated superiority compared to placebo in reducing painful intercourse associated with endometriosis.Endometriosis affects an estimated one in 10 women of reproductive age and is associated with pain symptoms. At present there is no cure for endometriosis. The pain associated with endometriosis is currently managed with oral contraceptives, progestins, danazol, NSAIDS, opioids, and GnRH agonists. Many of these medicines are not specifically indicated for the treatment of endometriosis.So far this year, AbbVie’s share price has increased 23%, comparing favorably with a gain of 11.8% recorded by the industry.Elagolix is also being evaluated in phase III studies for reducing heavy menstrual bleeding in premenopausal women with uterine fibroids. Data from the pivotal study is expected by end of 2017Apart from elagolix, AbbVie has several candidates in different stages of development across a wide range of therapeutic areas and has partnerships with companies like Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report), Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) and Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report).AbbVie carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

110,BIIB,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) announced positive top-line results from the phase III study, PARADIGMS. The study evaluated the safety and efficacy of oral once-daily Gilenya in children and adolescents (aged 10-17) with multiple sclerosis (MS).The flexible duration (up to two years), double-blind, randomized, multi-center study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral Gilenya compared to interferon beta-1a in children and adolescents with a confirmed diagnosis of MS which will be followed by a five-year open label extension phase. Patients enroled in the study were randomized to receive once-daily oral Gilenya (0.5 mg or 0.25 mg, dependent on patients' body weight) or intramuscular interferon beta-1a once weekly.The study met its primary endpoint, showing a significant reduction in relapses with Gilenya versus interferon beta-1a. The results of the study showed that oral Gilenya resulted in a significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the number of relapses (annualized relapse rate) in patients over a period of up to two years, compared to interferon beta-1a intramuscular injections.We note that Gilenya is already approved in the United States for the first-line treatment of relapsing forms of MS in adults and in Europe for adult patients with highly-active relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS).The drug generated sales of $837 million in the first half of 2017, up 5% from the year-ago period. The drug is not yet approved for treatment of pediatric MS. Novartis plans to complete a thorough analysis of these important data and discuss the same with health authorities to agree on next steps for submission.We note that Biogen, Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) holds a strong position in the MS market with a wide range of products including Avonex, Tysabri, Tecfidera and Plegridy.Apart from  Gilenya, Novartis' MS portfolio includes Extavia (interferon beta-1b for subcutaneous injection) which is approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS along with other pipeline candidates like BAF312 (siponimod) and OMB157 (ofatumumab), a fully human monoclonal antibody under investigation in relapsing MS. Novartis’ generic division, Sandoz, markets Glatopa (glatiramer acetate injection) 20mg/mL, the first generic version of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) Copaxone 20mg.Going forward, we expect that the approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing ones will bode well for Novartis even though stiff generic competition for key drugs like Gleevec continues to act as a major deterrent.Novartis stock has rallied 15.0% year to date compared with the industry’s 11.7% gain.Last week, Novartis got a boost when the FDA has approved its breakthrough gene transfer treatment, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) suspension for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The approval opens up new frontiers in the treatment of cancer by advancing immunocellular therapy for children and young adults with r/r B-cell ALL which comprises approximately 25% of cancer diagnoses among children under 15 years and is the most common cause of childhood cancer in the United States. Zacks Rank & Key PickNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Aduro Biotech, Inc.

112,BIIB,"Celsion Corporation (CLSN  -  Free Report) announced results from phase Ib study — OVATION — evidently showing biological activity of its immunotherapy candidate, GEN1, in advanced ovarian cancer patients. Celsion is developing the candidate for newly diagnosed patients, who will be administered in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Investors cheered the news as the stock skyrocketed over 300% on Tuesday. In fact, shares of the company have surged 42.4% so far this year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 15.2% during the period.The OVATION program was designed to identify a safe, tolerable and therapeutically active dose of GEN-1 for future studies. The trial also assessed how cytokine-based compounds namely, GEN-1, directly affects ovarian cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment in newly diagnosed patients with stage III and IV ovarian cancer, followed by an interval debulking surgery.Of the 14 patients treated to date, two have demonstrated a complete response (CR), 10, a partial response (PR) and another two, a stable response. This reflected a 100% disease control rate (DCR) and an 86% objective response rate (ORR). Of the five patients treated in the highest dose cohort, there was 100% objective response rate with one patient achieving complete response and four, affirming partial responses.The company also announced improvement in median progression free survival (PFS), which increased from 12 months to 18 months with longest PFS of 24 months. Plus, GEN1 brought favorable immunological changes that are likely to get translated into clinical benefit.The company met with advisory board last month and based on their recommendation is planning to file the phase II design with the FDA by this year-end.Celsion is also developing the candidate in combination with PEGylated doxorubicin for patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.Apart from GEN-1 immunotherapy, another cancer program in Celsion’s portfolio is ThermoDox, currently being investigated in a phase III evaluation for primary liver cancer.Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

113,BIIB,"Key biotech stocks, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) reported second quarter results yesterday -- both companies surpassed earnings and sales estimates. There were several other key updates as well from companies like Incyte (INCY  -  Free Report) and The Medicines Co. (MDCO  -  Free Report).  Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAmgen, Biogen Q2 Earnings: Biogen’s results were strong with the company’s most recent offering, Spinraza (spinal muscular atrophy - SMA), doing better than expected. Meanwhile, the company’s multiple sclerosis (MS) franchise continued to grow. MS is Biogen’s key area of expertise. Biogen expects the early 2020s to be an inflection point for the company with its key pipeline candidates expected to launch during that period (Read more: Biogen Tops Q2 Earnings & Sales, Spinraza Sales Up).  Amgen also topped estimates and updated its guidance. Recently launched products including Prolia (the second and fourth quarters are typically the strongest for this product), Repatha and Kyprolis recorded strong volume-driven growth. Amgen is working on improving Repatha patient access across the world. Meanwhile, mature products like Enbrel, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen declined with Neupogen being impacted by short-acting biosimilar competition that will continue affecting sales.While Amgen stock has gained 23.7% year to date (YTD), outperforming the 11.5% rally of the industry it belongs to, Biogen has lagged with shares declining 0.2% YTD.Incyte/Lilly RA Drug Faces At Least 18-Month Delay in Resubmission: Incyte and partner Lilly announced that there will be a delay of at least 18 months in the resubmission of the regulatory application for their investigational rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, baricitinib. This means the resubmission will not take place this year. Incyte and Lilly will discuss the path forward with the FDA and evaluate options for resubmission including the possibility of conducting an additional study as required by the FDA.The FDA had issued a complete response letter (CRL) for baricitinib earlier this year in April. At that time, the agency had told the companies that it is unable to approve baricitinib, a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of moderate-to-severe RA, in its current form. The FDA had asked for additional clinical data to determine the most appropriate doses as well as to further characterize safety concerns across treatment arms.We note that baricitinib was approved in the EU under the trade name Olumiant in Feb 2017. The European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recently agreed that the label should be updated to include a precaution for patients who have risk factors for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Incyte’s shares were down 3.4% on the baricitinib update.Nektar Up on Lilly Deal: Nektar (NKTR  -  Free Report) entered into a deal with big pharma company Lilly which will see Nektar receiving $150 million upfront as well as up to $250 million in the form of milestone payments. The deal covers the co-development of an early stage asset, NKTR-358, in Nektar’s pipeline. NKTR-358, which has the potential to treat a number of autoimmune and other chronic inflammatory conditions, works by targeting the IL-2 receptor complex in the body. By activating regulatory T cells, NKTR-358 has the potential to bring the immune system back into balance.Other deal terms include sharing of phase II development costs (Lilly: 75%; Nektar: 25%), an option for Nektar to participate in late-stage development on an indication-by-indication basis and double-digit royalties for Nektar. The deal is a major win for Nektar considering the early-stage nature of the candidate and the hefty upfront fee. Lilly will make a strong partner for the company. Nektar’s shares were up following the deal announcement.  Ironwood Down on Heartburn Drug Data: Ironwood’s (IRWD  -  Free Report) shares were down even though the company reported positive data on IW-3718 from a mid-stage study conducted in patients with uncontrolled gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The study met its primary endpoint but failed to impress investors with the efficacy results falling short of expectations. Ironwood intends to conduct end of phase II meetings with the FDA and move the candidate into phase III studies in the second half of 2018. According to the company, IW-3718 represents immense commercial potential with annual peak sales opportunity of more than $2 billion (Read more: Ironwood Reports Positive Data on Reflux Candidate).CHMP Positive on Regeneron/Sanofi Eczema Drug: Regeneron and Sanofi are a step closer to gaining EU approval for their eczema treatment, Dupixent, with the CHMP adopting a positive opinion for the drug. The companies are seeking approval for use in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) who are candidates for systemic therapy. A final decision regarding approval should be out in the coming months. Dupixent gained FDA approval earlier this year in March. Dupixent has blockbuster potential and is being investigated for other indications as well.Detailed Data on Gilead HIV Regimen: Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) announced detailed 48-week results from a couple of late-stage studies on a fixed-dose combination of bictegravir (a novel investigational INSTI) and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF, a dual-NRTI backbone) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-naïve adults. The bictegravir-containing regimen was found to be non-inferior to dolutegravir-containing regimens. Gilead holds a strong position in the HIV market and is working on strengthening its franchise. There is significant demand for a simple, convenient dosing regimen that can sustain virologic suppression with a safety profile that is appropriate for most HIV patients.MDCO’s TANGO-2 Stopped Early on Superior Benefit-Risk: The Medicines Co. got some good news with an independent data safety and monitoring board stopping a late-stage study on its investigational antibiotic, Vabomere (previously referred to as Carbavance) based on an interim analysis. Interim results from the TANGO-2 study showed that Vabomere improved clinical cure rates across all infection types and reduced rate of renal adverse events compared to best available therapy.Vabomere is currently under priority FDA review with a response expected in the third quarter. A marketing application was filed in the EU as well. The Medicines Co. is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnEarnings season for the biotech sector is off to a strong start with big players like Amgen and Biogen reporting better than expected results.

I'm Kevin Cook, your field-guide and story-teller for the fascinating arena of behavioral economics. Today’s episode is all about your brain, from three different angles.First, I want to share with you a lesson I used to teach beginning and intermediate traders about their perception and their assumptions.Second, I’m going to talk about some of the exciting biotechnology companies doing breakthrough research in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's.And last, I am going to tell you a story about a young woman who led a torturous first third of her life with a neurological condition that went undiagnosed, and where no drugs would have helped anyway.That story comes from a terrific book I’m reading by Dr. John Ratey, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School...A User’s Guide to the Brain: Perception, Attention, and the Four Theaters of the BrainRatey’s Four Theaters is a description that really appeals to me based on my reading of other neuroscience books over ten years ago. Back then I concluded that behavior and identity are a complex dance created by several sometimes-competing forces-- what I call your ""multi-mind.""And this ties into something I realized in the early 2000’s when I was training traders. First, the reason short-term trading is so hard is because our brains evolved for very different challenges than those of watching our money fluctuate up and down wildly on a screen full of red and green arrows.So I say ""your brain wasn't made to trade"" because we are barely equipped to manage probability and risk in long-term planning, let alone minute by minute. We naturally do the wrong things like keep losing positions and take profits too quickly, the two-ingredient recipe for trading failure.This is why over 95% of those who try short-term trading in stocks, currencies, or commodities -- especially with leverage -- will fail and lose most, if not all, of their money. Even though the odds are better than Vegas, we stack them against ourselves with unconscious cognitive biases and bad habits of emotional decision making.To hear a powerful analogy I use to teach traders about their biases and their ""multi-mind,"" be sure to listen to my full podcast attached to this article.Meet Tony Coles of YumanityDoing some preliminary research for this podcast, I found a great article by Matthew Herper writing for Forbes in February of 2015. Matt says ""I cover science and medicine, and believe this is biology's century."" I couldn't agree more.That's why I love running a new portfolio here at Zacks called Healthcare Innovators where I get to focus on the megatrends of science and medicine.Matt's story ""The Coming Boom In Brain Medicines"" starts out with a great introduction to a scientist you should know...TONY COLES COULD have had any job he wanted in the drug industry. In five years at the helm of cancer drug developer Onyx Pharmaceuticals he increased its market cap eightfold by purchasing an experimental blood cancer drug for $800 million, developing it into a big seller and flipping the whole company to Amgen for $10.4 billion in October 2013. He personally made $60 million on the deal. Biotech watchers expected him to start another cancer company or even command a drug giant like Merck or Pfizer.Instead, Coles, 54, is using his own money to build a Cambridge, Mass.-based startup called Yumanity that is using yeast, the microbes that help make bread and beer, to study how misfolded proteins in the brain cause Alzheimer's, Lou Gehrig's disease and Parkinson's, and to create drugs based on that knowledge. There's already interest from Big Pharma. Coles says he chose to attack brain diseases, not tumors, because the need is so dire and the science is so fresh.""We've got 50 million people around the world who have these diseases, costing $650 billion a year, and lots of families like mine that have been affected,"" says Coles. ""I had a grandmother who died of the complications of Alzheimer's disease. I think about my own health as well.""(end of excerpt from Matthew Herper's Forbes article)The New Next-Frontier in BiotechnologyIn my Healthcare Innovators portfolio, I am very focused on the frontiers of cancer research. Especially exciting is the field of ""immuno-oncology"" where researchers are learning to harness a patient's own immune system to fight his or her cancer. The research and the treatments are costly, but the rewards could be enormous -- and life-saving.A second disease-fighting frontier I follow is that of ""gene editing"" where the science is allowing a person's genome to be altered and possibly cure inherited ailments.But the new frontier I have very limited experience with as a healthcare investor is the neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. One company I have favored and owned for its Parkinson's psychosis treatment was Acadia Pharmaceuticals (ACAD  -  Free Report).And I currently own Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT  -  Free Report) for the successful launch of their drug for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.Alfred Sandrock, the Chief Medical Officer of Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) has said that ""neurology is the new oncology."" And I find it thrilling that this $60 billion company with 12-month trailing sales of $11.7 billion, is so engaged in the new next-frontier in biotech.In the podcast, I describe other companies involved on this frontier like Alkermes (ALKS  -  Free Report) and Neurocrine Biosciences .I also own Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO  -  Free Report) primarily for their ""zinc finger"" gene-editing technology. But it doesn't hurt that they have early-stage programs in Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's in their R&D pipeline too.Appreciating Differences, Appreciating HealthI close the podcast with a 10-minute story that Ratey shares of a woman named Rickie, who was actually the subject of the 1990 book of the same name by Frederic Flach, a psychiatric researcher at Cornell University.It's an incredible story ofpersonal tragedy and eventual triumph that you must hear.My goal is not just to help you learn about the brain and perception but also to encourage you to recognize others who may seem very ""different"" than you and why that might be.And also to appreciate your own health, to the degree you have it. That's one I often take for granted myself.Disclosure: I own shares of SRPT and SGMO for the Zacks Healthcare Innovators portfolio.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the Healthcare Innovators portfolio.

115,BIIB,"PDL BioPharma, Inc. (PDLI  -  Free Report) reported earnings of 26 cents per share in the second quarter of 2017, surpassing both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the year-ago earnings of 9 cents per share.The company generated total revenue of $143.8 million in the quarter, significantly skyrocketing 583% compared with the year-earlier figure of $21 million. This increase in revenue is mainly driven by royalties from PDL BioPharma’s licensees to the Queen et al. patents. Also, a rise in royalty rights — change in fair value — contributed to higher revenues this quarter. This was primarily due to the current period’s increase in fair value of the Depomed royalty asset.Notably, the company received cash payments of $34.6 million from the royalty rights acquired from Depomed, primarily related to Glumetza, a product marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (VRX  -  Free Report). An authorized generic version of Glumetza was also launched by a Valeant subsidiary in February for which, PDL BioPharma receives 50% of the gross margin.The company’s shares rallied more than 10% at after-hours trading on Monday.

117,BIIB,"Drug pricing is back in the news with an investigation being launched by Rep. Elijah E. Cummings and Rep. Peter Welch into the skyrocketing prices of multiple sclerosis (“MS”) drugs. MS, an unpredictable and often disabling disease of the central nervous system (“CNS”), interrupts the flow of information within the brain and between the brain and body with symptoms ranging from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis.Letters have been sent to seven companies requesting information about their pricing strategies for their MS drugs. The letters have also raised the issue of “shadow pricing” – when an expensive new drug is launched or the price of an existing drug is raised, other companies follow suit and increase prices to match the higher prices. According to an American Academy of Neurology study, annual sales of MS drugs doubled from $4 billion to almost $9 billion from 2008 to 2012. Meanwhile, information provided by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society shows that the average wholesale price of MS disease modifying therapies shot up from $16,000 in 2004 to $61,000 in 2013 and $83,688 in 2017.The letters also mention the lack of strong competition from generics with only one generic (for Copaxone 20 mg) being on the market.There has been a lot of focus on drug pricing over the last couple of years with companies like Mylan, Valeant and Turing among others facing criticism for their pricing strategy. Following the announcement of the investigation, the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index lost 1.6% over the last two trading sessions while the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index was down 2%.Here is a look at the seven companies that have been issued letters requesting information about corporate profits and expenses and documents concerning pricing strategies, patient assistance programs, and drug distribution systems. The companies have been asked to provide the required information by Aug 31, 2017.Life-science company, Bayer AG (BAYRY  -  Free Report), is among the seven companies to receive a letter for its MS drug, Betaseron.

118,BIIB,"We expect Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IONS  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 130%. In fact, it has pulled off a positive surprise in three of the trailing four quarters, recording an average beat of  95.70%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Notably, Ionis’ share price has increased 9.7% year to date, compared with the Zacks classified industry’s gain of 3.7%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Ionis is likely to beat estimates this quarter as it has the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – which have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +157.14%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is of 8 cents per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 14 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Ionis’ currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution you against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to ConsiderIonis earns revenues in the form of upfront, milestone and other payments under its partnerships with leading health care companies like Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) and Glaxo. These agreements also validate the company’s technology platform.Spinraza, for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) was approved in the U.S. in Dec 2016 and launched subsequently. It was granted marketing authorization in the European Union in Jun 2017. Also, it is the first approved treatment in the EU for SMA. Ionis entered into a collaboration agreement with Biogen to develop and commercialize Spinraza in 2012. Further, Inonis licensed Spinraza to Biogen and began receiving commercial revenue from Spinraza royalties after the drug was approved in the U.S.Last week, Biogen released its second quarter 2017 results and announced that Spinraza was doing better-than-expected. Biogen raised its 2017 guidance for the drug. The company stated that Spinraza has witnessed faster-than-expected adoption in the U.S. and Biogen is ramping up launch efforts in outside U.S. markets.Apart from Spinraza, we expect investor focus to be on Ionis’ pipeline update at the second-quarter conference call.Last month, Ionis and Akcea submitted a marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for volanesorsen for the treatment of patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS).  In March, the companies also announced positive results from the Phase III APPROACH study of volanesorsen in patients with FCS. In fact, they believe that volanesorsen has the potential to be the first treatment option for patients suffering from the daily burden as well as the life-threatening risks of FCS.Notably, Ionis and partner Bayer are advancing pipeline candidates IONIS-FXI Rx and IONIS-FXI-L Rx. In the second half of 2017, Ionis plans to initiate a phase IIb study evaluating IONIS-FXIRx in patients with end-stage renal disease to optimize the design of the phase III program. Furthermore, it plans to initiate a phase I study of IONIS-FXI-LRx early next year.Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteStocks to ConsiderHere are some health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Tesaro, Inc. (TSRO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +16.40% and a Zacks Rank #3.  The company is expected to release results on Aug 8. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. (ESPR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +17.37% and a Zacks Rank #3.  The company is scheduled to release results on Aug 3.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think. See This Ticker Free >>

This benefit was missing in the second quarter, leading to the sequential decline.Combined interferon revenues (Avonex and Plegridy) in the second quarter were $691 million (U.S. $501.7 million, ex-U.S. $188.9 million), down 5% from the year-ago period.

Plegridy contributed $133 million to second-quarter 2017 revenues, up 8% year over year and 19% sequentially.U.S. Interferon revenues are experiencing declining trends due to patients transitioning to other oral MS therapies as well as higher discounts and allowance.Zinbryta, launched in collaboration with AbbVie Inc.

123,BIIB,"Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report) inked a deal to acquire Crystal Bioscience, Inc. for $25 million in cash. The company will also pay an additional $10.5 million to the shareholders of Crystal Bioscience on success-based milestones.Additionally, Crystal Bioscience will share revenues from existing licensees for a defined period. Crystal Bioscience's core technology, HuMab, is a chicken-based antibody platform used to generate human antibodies.Consequently, Ligands shares have outperformed the industry year to date.The stock has surged 36.4% compared with the industry’s gain of 14.6% in the same time frame.Pursuant to the acquisition, the HuMab technology will become a a part of Ligand’s OmniAb brand and will be called OmniChicken. Notably, OmniAb is a patent-protected transgenic animal platform used in the discovery of fully human mono- and bispecific therapeutic antibodies. The technology was added to Ligand’s portfolio in January 2016, when the company acquired OMT, Inc., (Open Monoclonal Technology) for about $178 million.OmniAb has three distinct transgenic rodent systems for generating antibodies, OmniRat, OmniMouse and OmniFlic. While OmniRat is the industry’s first human monoclonal antibody technology based on rats, OmniFlic is an engineered rat with a fixed light chain for development of bispecific, fully human antibodies. OmniMouse is a transgenic mouse.Hence, the addition of OmniChicken platform to Ligand’s OmniAb technology adds a third species for fully-humanized antibody discovery.Going forward, it is expected that OmniChicken technology will be utilized by some of Ligand’s existing OmniAb partners and potential new partners. The deal will add four fully-funded partnerships to Ligand’s business (Boehringer Ingelheim, Alexo Therapeutics, Achaogen and an undisclosed large pharmaceutical company).Ligand anticipates Crystal Bioscience’s acquisition to contribute up to $1 million of revenue during the fourth quarter of 2017. Also, it expects total revenues for 2017 to be at least $134 million compared with the previous guidance of $133 million.However, the company reiterated its guidance to receive additional contract revenues of approximately $9 millionfor 2017.

124,BIIB,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its Botox Cosmetic product for a third indication — temporary improvement of moderate to severe forehead lines in appearance, associated with frontalis muscle activity in adults.So far this year, Allergan’s share price has slipped 0.1% compared with the industry’s decline of 19.8%.Approved for therapeutic and aesthetic use, Botox is a key top-line driver for Allergan. Its cosmetic indications include improvement in appearance of glabellar lines (frown lines between the brows) and severe crow’s feet. This latest FDA approval makes Botox Cosmetic the only neurotoxin treatment approved for three facial aesthetic treatments — forehead lines, crow’s feet wrinkles at the outer corner of eyes and glabellar lines.Botox’s therapeutic diseases include overactive bladder, cervical dystonia, chronic migraine and strabismus among others.The drug generated $1.53 billion sales in the first half of 2017, an increase of 12.7% year over year, driven by strong demand trends. The latest label expansion approval for forehead line treatment, which enjoys a pent-up demand, should drive the sales further.We remind investors that Botox became a part of Allergan’s portfolio following the March 2015 $77 billion acquisition of Allergan Inc. Having previously commanded a strong presence in the generics market, Allergan with the merger has found place on the top 10 list of world-wide pharma companies based on sales.

126,BIIB,"Shares of Endocyte, Inc. (ECYT  -  Free Report) have soared more than 150% on Oct 2, after it acquired an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize ABX GmbH’s phase III-ready prostate cancer candidate 177Lu-PSMA-617.Also, the share price increased more than 50% in pre-market trading on Oct 3. The company made an upfront payment of $12 million to ABX.Consequently, Endocyte’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has rallied 142.4% compared with the industry’s gain of 3.5% in the same time frame.The deal provides Endocyte with the most advanced targeted radioligand therapeutic (RLT), which is being developed for the treatment of prostate cancer and represents a greater than $1 billion market opportunity.  In fact, 177Lu-PSMA-617 targets the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), present in about 80% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The candidate has also shown high response rates in late stage prostate cancer patients in the studies presented at recent European Society for Medical Oncology.177Lu-PSMA-617 has the potential to be the first-in-class RLT to address both bone and soft tissue disease and is a very important for patients suffering from mCRPC.Going forward, Endocyte intends to seek regulatory approval to commence a phase III study of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in early 2018. The company expects the study to complete by 2020. Also, it plans to utilize and focus our resources on the development of 177Lu-PSMA-617.In June 2017, Endocyte announced its plans to reduce its workforce by about 40% in order to better focus its resources on the more valuable opportunities. Interestingly, the company plans to shift its focus on its most promising programs, which include its CAR T-cell SMDC adaptor platform, the dual-targeted DNA crosslinker drug EC2629 and the cohort of taxane-exposed patients receiving EC1169.Moreover, the company narrowed the EC1169 development program to focus only on the cohort of taxane-exposed, mCRPC patients. Further the company stopped enrollment in the EC1456 trial, where the level of clinical activity necessary to support continued advancement of this candidate was not met.The deal seems to be lucrative for the company and should bode well for its future.Endocyte, Inc.

127,BIIB,"Mallinckrodt plc (MNK  -  Free Report) announced that it has entered into a licensing agreement with NeuroproteXeon. The agreement relates to the development and commercialization of NeuroproteXeon's investigational, pharmaceutical-grade xenon gas for inhalation therapy.The therapy is being evaluated to improve survival and functional outcomes for patients resuscitated after a cardiac arrest. Per the terms, Mallinckrodt will pay $10 million upfront with cash on hand to reimburse NeuroproteXeon for certain product development costs. This will give Mallinckrodt exclusive rights to commercialize the therapy. Mallinckrodt will make an additional milestone payment of up to $25 million.A tentative approval of xenon for inhalation will expand Mallinckrodt's portfolio of hospital drug-device combination products providing therapies for patients.The phase III registration trial will begin in early 2018. It is designed to confirm a potential clinical benefit associated with the positive biomarker outcome as demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of patients who were treated with hypothermia therapy plus xenon gas for inhalation that was seen in a phase IIb study.The trial is being conducted under Special Protocol Agreement with the FDA.  The trial will measure the clinical benefit of xenon for inhalation in terms of improved 30-day survival and improved functional outcomes. The Special Protocol Assessment that has been approved by the FDA entitles an interim analysis at 50% of trial completion of the primary endpoint follow up.Assuming the primary and secondary endpoints are positive, the trial will be halted. However, if the primary or secondary endpoints are not met the trial will be stopped. Mallinckrodt expects the regulatory submission to be a drug and delivery device combination upon a full completion of the trial (tentative approval expected in 2018).Mallinckrodt expects bottom-line dilution for the remainder of 2017 to be 10 to 15 cents, with slightly lower dilution in 2018.Mallinckrodt’s stock price has declined 22.6% year to date, compared with the industry’s fall of 19.0%.We note that Mallinckrodt is currently focused on reshaping its product portfolio through strategic acquisitions and non-core asset divestitures to transform the portfolio and become a high-performing specialty pharmaceutical company. The company recently acquired privately held InfaCare Pharmaceutical Corporation. This specialty pharmaceutical company focuses on the development and commercialization of proprietary pharmaceuticals for neo-natal and pediatric patients.The company’s generic segment continues to face weakness as various product categories are witnessing stiff competition, which is hurting both volumes and prices. The company expects double-digit declines in revenues from this segment. In addition, continued expected weakness in this segment will adversely impact gross profit margins also. The company sold its Nuclear Imaging business due to persistent challenging conditions.The company also sold its Intrathecal Therapy business to focus on key areas. While Acthar sales continue to be strong on the back of increased formulary positions and access for appropriate patients in both the commercial and public environments, sales of Therakos is expected to decline.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMallinckrodt carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in health care sector are Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

128,BIIB,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.11, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04 by 6.7%. Earnings rose 29% from the year-ago quarter backed by volume driven pharma sales growth and higher profits.Revenues BeatQuarterly revenues of $5.82 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.59 billion by 4.2%. Sales grew 8% year over year backed by higher volumes and realized prices. However, foreign exchange pulled down sales by 1%.Volumes rose 5% as higher volumes of new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance and Lartruvo offset lower volumes of established products like Zyprexa, Alimta, Cialis and Strattera.Pharmaceutical volumes rose 8% in the quarter. However, worldwide competitive pressure hurt sales in Lilly’s Animal Health segment.Revenue in DetailU.S. revenues grew 15% to $3.32 billion, reflecting higher volume of products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance and Lartruvo, which offset lower volumes of established drugs.Ex-U.S. revenues declined 1% to $2.5 billion mainly due to lower volumes, increased competition and lower realized prices. Higher volumes of newer products like Cyramza and Trulicity were offset by lower volumes of Zyprexa, Cymbalta and Alimta due to the loss of exclusivity. Cymbalta has lost exclusivity in Europe and Canada, Zyprexa in Japan and Alimta in several countries. Lower sales of food and companion animal products hurt outside U.S. sales as well.Established products that recorded growth during the quarter include Forteo (up 22% to $446.7 million), Humulin (up 8% to $357.8 million) and Effient (up 6% to $142.9 million).Alimta sales, however, declined 12% to $532.9 million, reflecting lower demand in the U.S. due to competitive pressure, mainly from immuno-oncology agents. Outside the U.S., sales of Alimta were hurt by loss of exclusivity in several countries, increased competition and lower realized prices.Zyprexa sales declined 33% to $140.8 million due to loss of exclusivity.Humalog sales decreased 3% in the quarter to $678.4 million due to lower realized prices and volumes in the U.S.Cialis sales were flat at $627.3 million hurt by lower demand in the U.S. as well as increased competition from generic sildenafilErbitux sales declined 12% to $159.1 million in the quarter. Strattera sales declined 17% to $186.6 million. Cymbalta sales declined 13% to $206.6 million.Among new products, Trulicity generated revenues of $480.2 million, up 139% year over year, with U.S. revenues benefiting from growth in the GLP-1 market and market share gains.Cyramza revenues were $186.3 million, up 27% year over year, backed mainly by higher outside U.S. revenues. Cyramza’s ex-U.S. revenues benefited from strong volumes in Japan. However, U.S. revenues increased only 1% as higher realized prices made up for lower demand due to competitive pressure.Jardiance sales (up 157% to $103.2 million) were driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class.Basaglar recorded revenues of $86.6 million compared with $46.0 million in the previous quarter. Basaglar - Lilly and partner Boehringer Ingelheim’s follow-on insulin to Sanofi’s (SNY  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug, Lantus - was launched in the U.S. in mid-Dec 2016 where it generated revenues of $59.5 million in the quarter.Taltz brought in sales of $138.7 million compared with $96.6 million in the previous quarter, reflecting strong launch uptake.Lartruvo (olaratumab) generated revenues of $47.4 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared with $42.1 million in the previous quarter. Lartruvo was launched in the U.S. and the EU for soft tissue sarcoma in the fourth quarter of 2016. U.S. revenues were $39.7 million compared with $36 million in the previous quarter.Meanwhile, Lilly and partner Incyte Corporation’s (INCY  -  Free Report) rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug Olumiant (baricitinib) was approved in EU in Feb 2017. The drug generated sales of $4.8 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared with $1.9 million in the previous quarter. The drug received marketing approval in Japan earlier this month.However, in the U.S., the companies received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA in April regarding the new drug application (NDA) for baricitinib. Concurrent with the earnings release, Lilly announced that the NDA resubmission for baricitinib will not occur this year and will be delayed by a minimum of 18 months. The company said that the FDA has indicated that an additional clinical study will be needed for a resubmission.Lilly's Animal Health segment sales declined 9% to $784.8 million despite inclusion of revenues from the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica's U.S. feline, canine and rabies (acquired in Jan 2017). Animal Health revenues were hurt due to global competitive pressure that affected sales of both food animal and companion animal revenues in the quarter.Gross Margin & Operating Income RiseAdjusted gross margin of 76.7% in the quarter increased 70 basis points primarily driven by higher realized prices and manufacturing efficiencies.Operating income increased 31% to $1.51 billion on higher gross margins. Operating expenses remained flat in the quarter. However, total operating expenses, as a percent of revenues, declined 390 basis points in the quarter.2017 Outlook UppedLilly raised its previously issued 2017 adjusted earnings and sales outlook. Adjusted earnings per share are now expected in the range of $4.10 to $4.20 compared with $4.05 to $4.15 previously. Revenues are expected in the range of $22.0–$22.5 billion compared with $21.8–$22.3 billion expected previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues is $4.12 per share and $22.18 billion, respectively.Gross margin is expected to be approximately 76%, lower than 77% previously. Adjusted tax rate is still expected to be approximately 22%.Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are still expected in the range of $6.4–$6.6 billion, while research and development expenses are projected to be $5.0-$5.2 billion, slightly higher than $4.9–$5.1 billion expected previously.Our TakeLilly’s second-quarter 2017 results were strong with the company beating estimates on both counts. The pharma giant also raised its sales and earnings outlook for the year. However, the news of the delay in re-filing for baricitinib sent shares down almost 2% in pre-market trading. So far this year, Lilly’s share price has risen 15.2% compared with an increase of 11.8% for the industry.The company also said that it will build on its oncology portfolio and work on developing next-generation immunotherapies. It will prioritize development of seven pipeline candidates.Going forward, new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo are expected to see higher revenues. Lilly also expects some established products like Trajenta, Forteo and Humalog to continue doing well. However, Alimta will continue to be impacted by competition. Other headwinds include competition from immuno-oncology agents as well as loss of exclusivity for many drugs in emerging markets. Meanwhile, the recent high-profile pipeline setbacks are an investor concern and so is the weak performance of the Animal Health segment in the first half.Lilly carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

129,BIIB,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for its anti-infective drug, Avycaz, has been accepted and granted priority review by the FDA.We remind investors that Avycaz is currently approved for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (""cUTI""), including pyelonephritis. The drug, in combination with metronidazole, is approved for treating complicated intra-abdominal infections (""cIAI"").The company is looking to get the label of the drug expanded to include hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia/ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP). A decision from the FDA is expected in first-quarter 2018.Allergan shares are up 0.5% so far this year, outperforming the industry’s decline of 19.8% in the same period.The sNDA submission was based on non-inferiority data from a pivotal REPROVE study, which evaluated safety and efficacy of Avycaz in adult patients with HABP/VABP. The study showed that Avycaz was non-inferior to meropenem in reducing death irrespective of cause.The drug also showed in vitro (study in controlled environment outside human body) activity against certain gram negative bacteria, which causes HABP/VABP.We remind investors that the FDA issued a refusal-to-file letter last month to the sNDA for Vraylar to expand its label to include negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia.However, boosting its generic portfolio, the company received approval in September for the biosimilar version of Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) cancer drug, Avastin for the treatment of five types of cancer.Allergan PLC.

130,BIIB,"The biotech industry has witnessed a great turnaround this year after the drug pricing issue crippled its performance last year. After declining 27.1% last year, the Medical-Biotech /Genetics industry has risen 15.3% this year so far, outpacing 12.7% gain for the S&P 500 in the same time frame.The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index is up almost 26% year to date after sliding 19.1% in 2016. The Zacks Industry Rank is #106 (to 40% of the 250 plus Zacks industries) for Medical-Biomed and Genetics, indicating a bright outlook for the sector going forward.The biotech sector has a number of things going in its favor. Strong quarterly results, new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products have played a pivotal role in bringing the sector on track this year. Another factor that has contributed to the sector’s surge is that President Trump's expected action on drug prices may not be as onerous as previously feared.These factors should continue to drive the sector through the rest of this year and probably the next as well despite challenges like rising competition, pipeline setbacks, slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs. On the broader macro front, the proposed tax reforms, if approved, will leave more cash in the hands of these companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been relatively fewer this year compared with the last.With biotech stocks on a tear, here we have picked three of the biggest biotech companies which look well poised for growth and can be added to one’s portfolioAmgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report)Amgen is one of the leading biotechnology companies in the world with several blockbuster drugs in its portfolio. Amgen’s newer drugs – Prolia, Xgeva, Vectibix, Nplate and Sensipar – are all performing well. Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline, including biosimilar drugs. Last month, it received FDA approval for Mvasi, its biosimilar version of Roche’s cancer drug, Avastin. Mvasi is the first biosimilar approved in the United States for the treatment of cancer. Other recent positive pipeline/regulatory developments at Amgen include EU approval for a pediatric formulation of Mimpara, positive long-term data from Kyprolis ENDEAVOR study, and regulatory filings for label expansion of Prolia and Kyprolis, among others.Supported by the positive developments, Amgen’s shares have outperformed the industry so far this year. Shares have risen 28%, comparing favorably with the industry’s gain. Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Earnings estimates for 2017 have risen 1.2% while that for 2018 have gone up by 1.3% in the past 90 days.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report)Celgene’s key growth driver, multiple myeloma drug Revlimid, continues to drive revenues at the company. Meanwhile, Celgene’s label expansion efforts for Revlimid bode well for further sales growth of the drug. Other key products – Pomalyst/Imnovid, Abraxane and Otezla – are also performing well. A recent positive development at Celgene was the FDA approval for Idhifa for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML)Celgene also carries a Zacks Rank of 2. Earnings estimates for both 2017 and 2018 have risen by 0.7% in the past 90 days. The stock has gone up by 26.1% this year, outperforming the industry.Biogen, Inc.

Scangos and CFO Paul Clancy.Biogen, also a #2 Ranked stock, has seen its 2017 earnings estimates rise 4.7% for 2017 and 2.3% for 2017 over the past 90 days. Shares have risen 11.5% this year.Two other biotech companies, though smaller than the above mentioned companies, are worth mentioning.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has seen its share price shoot up 106.6% this year so far with earnings estimates rising 5% for 2017 and 6.8% for 2018. The stock is riding high on the success of its cystic fibrosis (CF) pipeline, particularly its triple combination CF regimens as these have the potential to treat up to 90% of CF patients.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) saw the launch of its key pipeline candidates Dupixent for atopic dermatitis and Kevzara for rheumatoid arthritis in the United States this year. Both the drugs are also approved in the EU. Meanwhile, Regeneron’s key growth driver, Eylea, continues to drive revenues on market share gains and the company is expanding the drug's label for additional indications. While Regeneron’s shares have risen 25.9% this year, its earnings estimates have gone up by 16.6% for 2017 and 7.3% for 2018.Both Vertex and Regeneron have been sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for quite some time and may soon join the league of the big biotech stocks.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

131,BIIB,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report), a well-known name in the multiple sclerosis (MS) market, will report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.63%.Biogen’s shares have declined 0.4% this year so far while the Zacks classified Biomed-Genetics industry recorded an increase of 8.8%.Biogen’s earnings performance has been pretty impressive so far, having delivered back-to-back positive surprises. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 5.29%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAt the first quarter call, the company had said that it expects relatively stable demand for both Tecfidera and Tysabri (its multiple sclerosis drugs) in 2017 as patient growth in ex-U.S. markets offsets the modest decline in the U.S. due to rising competition from drugs like Roche’s Ocrevus. It remains to be seen whether its second-quarter performance reflects the trend.Meanwhile, the combined number of patients using Avonex and Plegridy is on the decline as patients transition to other oral multiple sclerosis therapies or other high-efficacy products.Zinbryta, launched in collaboration with AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) in Aug 2016, is expected to continue to contribute to revenues in the U.S. and the EU. The drug benefits from increased use of high-efficacy products.Spinraza approved for spinal muscular atrophy in Dec 2016 was off to a promising start backed by robust underlying demand Notably, Spinraza, which added $47.4 million to the top line in the first quarter of 2017, should contribute further to sales. At the Q1 conference call, the company had said that it is working on expanding access to Spinraza to all patients.However, at the call, the company had warned of possible logistics and coverage restriction on the drug in the U.S. as well as other markets. We expect management to provide an update on the issue at its second quarter conference call.Biogen’s biosimilar products - Flixabi (a biosimilar referencing Remicade) and Benepali (a biosimilar referencing Enbrel) are also generating higher revenues. The trend should continue this quarter as well.Headcount reduction and restructuring initiatives are expected to continue to lower operating expenses. Meanwhile, R&D expenses are expected to increase due to increased business development payments.At the second quarter call, investor focus will remain on Tecfidera’s scrip trends, sales ramp-up of Spinraza, pipeline progress and acquisition plans.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Biogen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -5.61% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at $4.21 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $4.46. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Biogen’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Biogen Inc.

132,BIIB,"Key highlights this week include impressive data from Vertex’s (VRTX  -  Free Report) cystic fibrosis (CF) pipeline while companies like Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) and Puma (PBYI  -  Free Report) got FDA approval for their hepatitis C virus (HCV) and breast cancer treatments, respectively.  Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesVertex CF Data Impresses: Vertex got a major boost with positive data on three different triple combination regimens in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation (F508del/Min). These are the first data to show the potential to treat the underlying cause of CF in these patients, who have a severe and difficult-to-treat type of the disease. The company is looking to start a pivotal program in the first half of 2018. Vertex’s shares were up significantly in pre-market trading.CRL for Amgen/UCB Osteoporosis Drug: Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and partner UCB got a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA for Evenity (romosozumab), their investigational treatment for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. However, the CRL doesn’t come as a surprise considering the emergence of a new safety signal in a late-stage study (ARCH). Although Evenity met both the primary endpoints and the key secondary endpoint in the study, the companies said that an imbalance in positively adjudicated cardiovascular serious adverse events was observed.The FDA has asked the companies to include data from the ARCH study in the resubmission as well as data from the BRIDGE study in men with osteoporosis (Read more: Amgen Gets CRL for Osteoporosis Drug Evenity's BLA). Amgen is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.FDA Nod for Gilead HCV Drug: Gilead has added another drug to its hepatitis C virus (HCV) portfolio with the FDA granting approval to Vosevi, a single-tablet regimen for the re-treatment of adults with chronic HCV. Vosevi provides physicians with a new therapeutic option for their hardest-to-treat patients. However, Vosevi comes with a boxed warning regarding the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in HCV/HBV co-infected patients -- this could limit uptake.Gilead’s HCV franchise, which was a major revenue generator, is under considerable strain due to new competition and pricing pressure. The company has underperformed the Zacks-categorized Medical-Biomedical/Genetics industry so far in 2017 with shares gaining 0.1% while the industry is up 8.9%.Puma Up on FDA Approval of Nerlynx: Puma gained FDA approval for its breast cancer treatment, Nerlynx (neratinib), which has blockbuster potential. Nerlynx, the first approved drug in Puma’s portfolio, is indicated for the extended adjuvant treatment of early-stage, HER2+ breast cancer, an aggressive type of tumor. This means that Nerlynx can be taken after an initial treatment so that the risk of the cancer coming back can be reduced further. Nerlynx’s approval was in line with expectations considering a favorable advisory panel vote earlier this year. Puma’s shares were up 8.5% on the news. Year-to-date (YTD), Puma’s shares are up a whopping 204.4%.Sarepta-BioMarin Settle Patent Dispute: Sarepta (SRPT  -  Free Report) and BioMarin settled their patent dispute regarding the use of Sarepta’s Exondys 51 and all future exon-skipping products for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The companies signed a licensing agreement providing Sarepta with global exclusive rights to BioMarin’s DMD patent estate for Exondys 51 and all future exon-skipping products. BioMarin has the option to convert the license to a co-exclusive right if it decides to proceed with an exon-skipping therapy for DMD. Terms of the deal include a one-time $35 million payment from Sarepta as well as certain milestone-based payments and royalties. Sarepta’s shares were down 3%.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index was up 1.1% over the last five trading sessions.
