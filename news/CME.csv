24,CME,"Tuesday's column discussed the value of weekly charts in analyzing the long-term health of a dividend play. Is the stock finding buyers at a prior level of upside resistance? How has the stock fared on a weekly closing basis? And do you see a potential new base forming?You want more tools. These can help. Check the RS Rating. This tool should apply to an income stock just as it does a high-adrenaline growth play.If your dividend stock has a Relative Price Strength Rating of 80 or higher, it means your stock is in the top fifth of the U.S. market in terms of 12-month relative performance. Knowing that may help you keep the conviction necessary to hold on.In IBD's Dividend Leaders screen, a quarter of the 59 names show an RS Rating of 80 or higher. They include Hasbro (HAS) (93 RS), ConAgra Foods (CAG) (91 RS), Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE) (90), Home Depot (HD) (87), Altria (MO) (84) and CME (CME) (80).It's also worthwhile comparing a stock's RS Rating with those of its industry peers. IBD Stock Checkup does that instantly for you. Home Depot ranks fourth among 18 stocks in the Retail/Wholesale-Building Products industry group. That's a strong showing. Analyze the moving averages. If your stock's 10-week and 40-week moving averages are rising, that's positive. It means the mid- and long-term price trends are up.Last week, many stocks punctured one or both support lines. Hasbro fell below the 40-week line briefly. But Coca-Cola Enterprises bounced off its 10-week average, revealing exceptional strength. As weeks pass, see if Hasbro can reclaim its 10-week line. A prolonged stay below this line signals weakness. Uptrend or downtrend? This is best checked on a weekly chart. Do you see a pattern of higher highs and higher lows over at least several months? CME has done so since April 2014 despite last week's brief plunge.

The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 fell 0.8% each, after wiping out earlier gains.Volume in the stock market today fell across the board.A step down in volume was perhaps natural, considering the Fed's meeting later this week.CME Group's FedWatch Tool puts the odds of a rate increase at about 7%. The probability of no change is pegged at almost 93%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe major indexes have been encountering resistance at their 50-day moving averages over the past six to seven sessions. If the stock market is to shake off the negative pressure, retaking the 50-day line is an important first step.Among market watchers, the recent worry is the narrowing of the spread between the 10-year yield vs. the 2-year yield. But the problem with using the yield curve for market guidance is that ""recessions typically haven't begun until 20 months after the curve inverts,"" as IBD Weekly's cover story ""The Big Squeeze"" pointed out.And not every economist agrees that yields should be the top focus right now. Johns Hopkins University economist Steve Hanke argues that the broad money supply as measured by Divisia M4 is a better guide to the economy. So far this year, Divisia M4 grew 4.8% in January, and 5% each in February and March.Hanke calls that kind of growth ""not bad"" and points to an economy where ""everything is running pretty smoothly.""Then why is the stock market struggling? It's much more useful to focus on what's happening than to search for causation. Individual investors should closely follow the charts for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.What are they showing? The choppiness that began in early February is still in place.On Monday. leaders advancing included Mastercard (MA), up 1.3%, and retailer Canada Goose (GOOS), up 1.4%.Mastercard will report Q1 results Wednesday before the market's open.Several items stand ready to break for either good or bad.First, banks are now expected to win at least a partial battle against some Dodd-Frank regulations. The Hill reported that Congress is near passage of a bipartisan package.Second, a decision on steel tariffs is near. Temporary exemptions for the European Union are about to expire. President Trump reportedly hasn't made a decision. Also, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is expected to leave for China soon for trade talks.Third, IBD's industry group lineup has taken definition. Going into Monday's session, only 10 sectors are outperforming the Nasdaq. New leaders could emerge from the outperforming sectors.The 10 sectors are software, up 13% year to date; consumer, up 8.2%; medical, up 6.9%; leisure, 6.3%; business services, up 6%; retail, up 5.8%; savings and loan, up 5.5%; apparel, up 4.6%; energy, 4.2%; and banks, 4%.Fourth, Trump implied that he can save the market. Speaking in Michigan recently, Trump admitted he is doing something that ""bothers the market."" He said the stock market ""would've been up 60%, but I have to do things. I can't let other countries take advantage of us, so we're doing trade deals.""The implication is that the market will recover once Trump finishes doing things that bother the market.McDonald's rose almost 6%, hoisting the stock over its 50-day and 200-day moving average lines after a strong quarterly report. Earnings increased 22% vs. the year-ago quarter.The Street expected earnings growth of 14%. Q1 revenue dropped 9%, but analysts expected a 12% decline.McDonald's is basing in a 18%-deep consolidation. The stock is 7% under a high marked in late January.The Federal Reserve's meeting Tuesday and Wednesday isn't expected to create big waves. The Street expects the Fed to stand pat on rates for now.

45,CME,"The 10-year Treasury yield hit 3% on Tuesday for the first time in more than four years, reflecting expectations that the Fed will hike its key rate four times in 2018. Stocks, which have struggled as Treasury rates have rallied strongly in recent sessions, sold off sharply yet again.Fed expectations are fluid. Around 10 a.m. Eastern Time, the CME Group FedWatch page showed roughly 53% odds of a fourth quarter-point rate hike coming in December, up from one-in-four odds after the deceptively strong March jobs report two weeks ago.But as the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones both closed 1.7% lower and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.3%, the 10-year Treasury yield pulled back to just below 3% and odds of a fourth Fed hike slipped to 39%.Bank stocks were among the better performers in afternoon trade on the stock market today. But Bank of America (BAC) reversed lower for a 0.4% decline as the market closed, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) lost 0.5%. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase are both still below their 50-day lines.Superregional Fifth Third Bank (FITB) surged 4.1% after soundly beating earnings estimates, but was well off session highs. West Coast-based Umpqua Holdings (UMPQ) gained 1.4%, extending its recent breakout.Bank stocks can see a big benefit from higher long-term rates if the spread vs. short-term rates widens. But the big move in the 10-year in recent weeks has seen narrowing spreads.While a higher 10-year Treasury means higher mortgage rates for home buyers, housing stocks got a lift initially Tuesday from strong earnings and housing data. Shares of PulteGroup (PHM) gapped higher on strong earnings, rising 2.9%, while Lennar (LEN) fell 1.7% and D.R. Horton (DHI) advanced 0.6%.March new home sales rose 4% to a 694,000 annual rate, well above the 630,000 rate expected and not far off November's 11-year high. Also, the Case Shiller 20-City Home Composite Price Index rose 6.8% from a year ago in March, the best gain since June 2014.Still, Tuesday's market action suggests, at least in the near term, that higher market interest rates may pose a hurdle for the S&P 500 and and the stock market generally as it aims to shake off the recent correction.Since jobs day, the Labor Department reported that core consumer inflation accelerated to 2.1% from a year ago in March. And now higher oil prices, which once again rose to their highest level since 2014 on Tuesday, could add to upward pressure on prices.At a minimum, the risk of another inflation undershoot has diminished. All the near-term risk is to the upside. That, in turn, could dampen demand for U.S. debt at a time when deficits are beginning to spiral higher and the Fed is curtailing its own holdings of Treasury and mortgage debt.In a Tuesday note, Lewis Alexander, Nomura's chief U.S. economist, projected that the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, looks likely to rise to 2.3% by the end of 2019, up from 1.6% in February.Core PCE inflation for March will be reported on Monday, April 30.The Federal Reserve will meet on May 1-2 but isn't expected to hike rates again until the June meeting.

46,CME,"Now that President Trump has turned down the heat on a China trade war, investor concern about rising inflation and a hawkish Federal Reserve may be taking center stage. On Friday, the 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.96%, just eclipsing the four-year high touched in February. The run-up in yields is a quiet reason for the stock market's struggles late in the week, even though chip warnings and Apple (AAPL) iPhone fears dominated the headlines. The S&P 500 index slid 0.85% on the stock market today, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones, Nasdaq composite and Apple all falling below their 50-day lines.Odds of a fourth Fed rate hike in December have climbed above 40%, according to the CME Group FedWatch page. That's up from a one-in-four chance after the deceptively strong March jobs report two weeks ago.Since jobs day, the Labor Department reported that core consumer inflation accelerated to 2.1% from a year ago in March.

Lennar (LEN) lost 1.8% and D.R. Horton (DHI) 1.7%.Financial stocks, which can see a gain in net interest income from higher rates, have fared relatively well.

That will likely continue in the next few months. CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX) and Target (TGT) all announced pay hikes effective this spring. CVS raised its minimum wage to $11 an hour and Target to $12. They are among dozens of major companies that announced wage increases in the wake of corporate tax cuts passed in December.As those wage hikes take effect and lift worker pay in coming months, replacing several months of notably soft wage growth last spring, the annual pace of wage gains is likely to keep trending higher.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Stock Market Answers 5 Big Questions This WeekThe Big Picture: Coming Week Could Turn Market AroundStocks To Watch: TD Ameritrade, Green Dot Among Stocks Added To IBD 50 ListLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

47,CME,"Aluminum approached a six-year high after top exchanges said they'll stop accepting metal from United Co. Rusal. The move raises concerns about how the market will replace supplies from the Russian smelting giant hobbled by U.S. sanctions.The metal advanced as much as 3.5% on Wednesday to $2,277.50 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange. That was just $13 away from the peak in December when it touched the highest since March 2012.Prices settled 2.2% higher at 5:53 p.m. in London and have rallied as much as 13% since Thursday, the day before U.S. sanctions were announced. If the gains had held, that would have been the hottest four-day rally in three decades.On Wednesday, Glencore Plc, the biggest buyer of metal from Rusal, declared force majeure — indicating unforeseen circumstances prevent someone from fulfilling a contract — on contracts covering 50,000 tons of the metal that should be of Russian origin, according to sources that spoke on condition of anonymity.If true, that compounds supply worries after both the LME and CME Group Inc.'s Comex said they won't allow new deliveries of metal from Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska's Rusal, the biggest aluminum producer outside of China.""There's definitely potential for prices to pass recent peaks,"" Helen Lau, an analyst at Argonaut Securities Asia Ltd., said from Hong Kong. ""Imagine how tight the world market is going to be if you lose a 10th of world supply, even for the short term. More and more companies are responding to the sanctions.""The LME introduced a temporary suspension on placing Rusal metal on warrant with effect from April 17 unless the owner demonstrates it won't breach sanctions, the bourse said. It set the date on the view that metal warranted before then would have been produced and supplied by Rusal before April 6, the day sanctions were announced. Rusal is evaluating the effect, it said in a statement.Comex said it has revoked the approved status for warranting and delivery of the company's brands against the futures contract.

48,CME,"Don't be fooled by the weak job growth or higher-than-expected unemployment in March. Better wage growth and less labor-market slack mean the stock market won't get much of a reprieve from Fed rate-hike fears.The good news: The surprisingly weak 103,000 job gain throws a bit of cold water on the notion that the economy is overheating. Yet a hawkish shift by the data-dependent Federal Reserve will continue to remain a risk for investors with every wage and inflation report. The consumer price index coming out on Wednesday is the next one to watch. UniCredit Research expects the core CPI, excluding food and energy, to rise 2% from a year ago vs. 1.8% in February.Following the report, Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite initially moved higher, then relapsed in late morning trade on the stock market today. The Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite were all down 1% or more.Before the report, stock market futures were deep in the red in reaction to President Trump's threat to strike back at China even harder, with tariffs on an additional $100 billion in imports.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe 10-year Treasury yield slipped about 5 basis points to 2.78% as stocks fell and the jobs and unemployment data surprised on the soft side. Odds of four Federal Reserve rate hikes this year, one more than expected, eased to about 26% after the report, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.Average hourly wages rose 8 cents to $26.82 an hour, lifting the annual gain to 2.7%, in line with expectations.Wall Street economists expected a 175,000 job gain, 4.0% unemployment and 2.7% average wage growth.Still, job growth has averaged a solid 202,000 the past three months, including revisions. A balmy February likely shifted some seasonal job employment forward, depressing March job creation.Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit, pointed out that jobless rate actually did decline in March — if you don't round to the tenths — from 4.14% to 4.07%. Over the past 12 months, the labor force has increased by 125,000 per month, on average, well below the pace of job creation. ""Looking forward, we continue to expect the jobless rate to fall towards 3.5% by the end of the year.""Employers also have been increasing work hours, further evidence of less slack. On a weekly basis, the average wage rose 3.3% from a year ago in March, the best gain in seven years.Investors should expect the improvement in hourly wage growth to be the start of a trend for two reasons.First, dozens of major employers announced wage hikes over the past few months, but few came early enough to show up in February's jobs report. Walmart (WMT) and CVS Health (CVS) hiked their minimum wages to $11 an hour. Six months after raising its minimum wage to $11, Target (TGT) said last month that it will pay all current associates at least $12 an hour starting this spring.Second, wage growth receded in the spring of 2017, rising just 2.2% at an annual rate from March through June. As those months that saw depressed pay gains drop off, replaced by months with firmer growth this year, the annual rate will trend higher.Take a closer look at Walmart's wage changes. Before its pay hike announced in January 2018, Walmart hadn't raised its base wage in nearly three years. That's a big deal. When Walmart hiked its minimum wage for all current associates to $10 an hour in February 2016, that wage hike was contagious.Walmart is big enough to put upward pressure on wages for other employers. Target and Costco (COST) were among those who quickly hiked pay shortly after that 2016 move. Average hourly earnings growth rose to 2.8% that July before momentum flagged.Walmart's 2016 wage hike came when the jobless rate was nearly 5%. Now it's around 4%, so competition for workers has intensified. At least for workers on the lower end of the wage spectrum, pay hikes appear to be broad-based. Starbucks (SBUX), Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all have said they're raising pay. Meanwhile, dozens of banks, including Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) hiked their minimum wage to $15 an hour for tellers.As wage gains accelerate and the jobless rate moves below 4% in coming months, Fed policymakers may lean toward four interest-rate hikes in 2018, not just three. Fed models assume that inflation will follow wage growth higher. There's reason to be skeptical. For example, Kroger said last month that it will use the bulk of its tax cut to offset the cost of higher wages and lower prices. The competitive environment facing Kroger from Walmart and Amazon (AMZN) via its Whole Foods division offers at least some reason to doubt whether wage pressure will feed through to higher prices.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: The Big Picture: Here's The Problem With The Stock Market RallyThis Defense Giant Breaks Out As 4 Peers Target Buy Points: Investing Action PlanHow To Invest In A Late-Stage Bull Market As FANG Stocks SlumpStocks To Watch: These Stocks Just Got Added To IBD 50, IPO LeadersTop Stock LGI Homes Breaks Out To Buy Zone On Strong Growth

49,CME,"Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) said Friday that shorting of its popular Volatility Index (VIX) will continue despite the collapse of one of the inverse ETFs betting against it.X The prediction came as the options exchange operator fell short of fourth-quarter forecasts, capping a tumultuous week for the stock. EPS jumped 38% to 87 cents but was a penny below expectations. Revenue leapt 66% to $265.6 million, reflecting the acquisition of Bats Global Markets, but was just below the $268 million consensus estimate, according to Zacks Investment Research.Organic revenue grew 8%, while options revenue climbed 12% to $130 million. Futures revenue jumped 31% to $35.6 million, led by a 21% increase in VIX futures.The popularity of the VIX, which is a measure of the S&P 500's future volatility, led to the launch of products that hedge against it. VIX's value goes up in times of volatility, but the extreme turbulence of the week caused the price of the inverse products to tank, and trading in them was suspended on Tuesday.During the earnings call, Cboe executives downplayed the importance of these trades, pointing out that exchange traded products that are designed to short volatility made up less than 5% of average daily volume of VIX in Q4.Management did not provide an exact overall number for the volume of VIX short futures, but they told analysts the total direct volumes from short and long volatility exchange traded funds was around 7%.Management predicted the strategy of short-selling VIX is not going away despite the recent turbulence, and stressed that issuers had made a ""self-interested decision"" to redeem their exchange traded notes.Cboe also said that, outside of those who had invested in inverted volatility products, those making the play are ""true professionals.""Shares of Cboe sank 3.6% to 107.11 on the stock market today, closing above their 200-day moving average after tumbling as much as 13% intraday. For the week, Cboe tumbled 20% amid worries about VIX trades. CME Group (CME), which beat quarterly estimates last week, rallied 2.5% Friday.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market is now in a correction. Read our cover story on why stocks sold off and what you should do now.The recent closure of short volatility exchange traded notes means traders do not have to hedge these trades with Cboe's VIX futures any more. Credit Suisse (CS) said Tuesday it will terminate its VelocityShares Inverse VIX product. On Friday, the Financial Times reported that Fidelity prevented clients from trading ProShares Short VIX Short-term Futures ETF (SVXY) temporarily.Cboe stock smashed through its 50-day moving average Tuesday as trading was halted on several inverted volatility products, raising concerns about the options exchange's trading volume.Meanwhile, the company was pleased with how smoothly the launch of Cboe Bitcoin Futures XBT, the first Bitcoin futures contract on an established exchange, had gone in December. By the time of the first settlement auction in January there had been more than 124,000 contracts traded with a nominal value of $1.5 billion.

50,CME,"Boeing (BA) helped spearhead a decent rebound for stocks on Tuesday as the Dow Jones industrial average component rose 8.38, or 1.7%, to 330.82 and retraced all of Monday's 1.9% drop. At least nine of the Dow industrials' 30 components advanced 2 points or more.Boeing recouped all of Monday's losses. While the Dow industrial average component is now spending its fourth week trading beneath the 50-day moving average, such action is normal for a big market leader that's taking a break. Watch for a potential new base to form, which sets up a potential buy point. But breakouts tend to work much better when the market status exits a correction.The Dow transports jumped more than 2%, suggesting that the greater economy is still fine. Last week, U.S. fourth-quarter GDP was revised to a 2.9% lift, up from the first revision of a 2.5% increase and better than the Econoday consensus forecast.The Nasdaq composite rallied 1%, just below a 1.3% gain for the S&P 500. The Dow utility average lagged, up just 0.3%. Volume fell mildly on both exchanges but was likely above average, according to early data.Top-rated companies in the leisure, automaker, e-commerce, software and chip equipment industry groups outperformed. Wood product, airline, oil drilling, oilfield services, home medical care, tobacco and paint stocks also rose sharply; these IBD industry groups all gained 2.5% or more.Boeing ignited its fierce rally Oct. 26, 2016, by clearing a 139.55 buy point in a superlong saucer with handle. Given that the advance reached as much as 165%, the current correction looks perfectly normal.A base that forms while preventing Boeing shares from penetrating their long-term 200-day moving average would add a bullish element to the overall picture.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Q1 earnings to fly 27% higher to $2.56 a share.While the 83 Composite Rating for Boeing on Stock Checkup is so-so, keep in mind that the stock is in a turnaround not unlike the one Apple (AAPL) engineered in 2017. Plus, Boeing's RS Rating remains a stout 95.This means Boeing has outperformed 95% of all publicly traded companies in IBD's database over the past 12 months.In other markets, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) hopped back above the 200-day moving average, rising 12% to 12.55. The Bitcoin-tracking fund is still down more than 43% year-to-date.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond edged up to 2.78%. According to CME Group, fed funds futures traders see only a 30% chance that the Federal Reserve will lift interest rates by a quarter-point four times this year. The majority expects the target rate to reflect three rate hikes, sending the fed funds rate to a range of 2% to 2.25%.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more analysis and commentary on growth stocks, bases, chart patterns, and financial markets.)RELATED:Stocks Near A Buy ZoneThe Golden Rule Of InvestingWhich Way Is The Market Headed Now?

51,CME,"Imagine being told one day that your paychecks would be in Bitcoin. Pretty cool, right? Except your liquid assets could tumble in value at any moment in this cryptocurrency future. And you'd have to convert your cryptocurrency to dollars to buy groceries at Walmart (WMT), coffee at Starbucks (SBUX) or books on Amazon (AMZN).The surge in value of Bitcoin and its digital currency rivals has not been matched by their everyday utility. Payment processor Stripe cut off Bitcoin support in January, citing slow transaction times and high fees.""We've seen the desire from our customers to accept Bitcoin decrease,"" explained Stripe product manager Tom Karlo.Bitcoin and other digital rivals are nowhere near ready for prime time. They might never match the utility of today's financial-system incumbents, the banks and payment companies that facilitate the flow of funds over tens of millions of merchant locations.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseYet much like millennials will never have a landline, a coming generation might do without bank accounts thanks to secure, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions. Blockchain technology and the vast new crypto wealth have opened the door to four cryptocurrency futures that could usher in a new financial order.What are these possibilities?""Virtual currencies might just give existing currencies and monetary policy a run for their money,"" International Monetary Fund director Christine Lagarde predicted last fall. ""Citizens may one day prefer virtual currencies, since they potentially offer the same cost and convenience as cash — no settlement risks, no clearing delays, no central registration, no intermediary to check accounts and identities,"" she said.That explosive potential helps explain why so many tech entrepreneurs and investors turned cryptocurrencies into a 21st Century gold rush, even as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has trashed Bitcoin as ""a fraud.""Dimon and other titans of finance voice certainty that commercial banks will remain indispensable, cryptocurrencies will stay on the fringe, and governments will want to keep it that way.Blockchain's potential to revolutionize the financial system has some central banks studying whether to issue their own digital currency. Yale University scholars have proposed the FedCoin. In this cryptocurrency future, FedCoin could make monetary policy more flexible and forceful, even allowing for negative interest rates.If a cryptocurrency acted as a reliable, widely accepted store of value, people could cut ties to their banks. They could keep some crypto cash in digital wallets, with other liquid assets in mutual funds, stocks and government bonds.A Bank of England study concluded that a central-bank cryptocurrency could boost GDP by 3%. Gains would come, in part, from shrinking ""monetary transaction costs that are analogous to distortionary tax rates.""Yet FedCoin looks far-fetched at present because of the massive disruption it could cause. Central bank crypto dollars ""could endanger the economically and socially important financial intermediation function of commercial banks,"" JPMorgan analysts warned.The contribution of fractional reserve banking to global growth — turning each $1 of deposits into $10 in loans — could fade. ""We would expect that central banks would think twice before disturbing this source of capital to the private sector."" Dimon is surely right about one thing: The cryptocurrency future will depend heavily on government. That could mean smothering it with regulation, stealing its thunder via FedCoin or cultivating it with a light regulatory touch.Bitcoin hit its 2018 low early on Feb. 6, the morning of a key Senate cryptocurrency hearing, briefly undercutting $6,000. The chairmen of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission both urged stronger oversight. But the financial regulators stopped short of sounding an alarm. Nor did they call for any legislation to rein in cryptocurrencies. In the weeks after that hearing, Bitcoin rebounded to around $11,000 but it has retreated yet again to below $7,000.Bitcoin had doubled in the first half of December, hitting a peak above $19,000 just as Bitcoin futures began trading on Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) and CME (CME). The anticipation of futures trading, touted as validation from U.S. regulators, stoked speculation.At the Senate hearing, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who earned his fortune as an early investor in the cell phone industry, said he sees a parallel between mobile phones then and cryptocurrencies now. ""The same kind of transformation is about to take place,"" he said.Warner criticized the CFTC for embracing Bitcoin options at this stage. He fretted that total cryptocurrency market capitalization could hit $20 trillion — vs. $300 billion now — with another 2017-like surge.""This rises potentially to the level of a systemically relevant event,"" Warner said.Yet there's reason to doubt that cryptocurrency frenzy will return. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) — Ma Bell in Warner's analogy — banned credit-card purchases of cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, the SEC and foreign governments have cracked down on initial coin offerings. And lately, Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Google, Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) have banned cryptocurrency ads.Even Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin warned via Twitter not long ago that cryptocurrencies ""could drop to near-zero at any time."" He added that ""traditional assets are still your safest bet.""The Bank for International Settlements, the central banker for global central banks, has warned that cryptocurrencies in the future could become a ""threat to financial stability"" if regulators aren't vigilant. U.S. regulators appear to be playing catch-up. As of Feb. 6, the cryptocurrency working group put together by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had held a single meeting.Politicians and central bankers worry that cryptocurrencies won't hold value in a panic. ""When things really go bad, where do Americans turn?"" Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker asked a fintech conference last fall. ""Well, they're going to come back to the government. That's the history of the country.""Harker did allow that other currency models might work if another ""large player"" besides the government provided trust.Who could fill that role? Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz offered some thoughts on the coffee chain's January earnings call.""I personally believe that there is going to be one or a few legitimate, trusted digital currencies off of the blockchain technology,"" Schultz said. He doubted that Bitcoin would be one of them.Cryptocurrencies ""will have to be legitimized by a brand in a brick-and-mortar environment, where the consumer has trust and confidence in the company that is providing the transaction.""Starbucks wants to play a role but isn't making a big investment in a cryptocurrency future right now, Schultz said.Cryptocurrency investors have speculated that Amazon might accept Bitcoin or one of its digital rivals. That specific cryptocurrency would vault past competitors as a trusted store of value and useful medium of exchange. Amazon even registered the domains AmazonEthereum.com, AmazonCryptocurrency.com and AmazonCryptocurrencies, kicking such talk into high gear.Alternatively, Amazon, Walmart — or a consortium of large companies — might issue their own cryptocurrency. Doing so could let them save on transaction costs and act as a competitive weapon.But Amazon has also been cozying up with JPMorgan. Recently, Amazon and JPMorgan have partnered in a health care venture and in creating a new type of bank account.Yet imagine if Amazon or Walmart rewarded loyal customers with tokens that could escalate in value. The tokens would jump to the head of the cryptocurrency pack with potential for broad acceptance as a currency. Customers would likely hoard the tokens, rather than spend them. The effect on sales and profits might be electric.For a digital currency to gain wide acceptance from outside businesses, the issuer would have to act like a central bank. Governing a currency requires trust, so some functions might need independence from corporate issuers.Those milestones could ease fears of a massive cryptocurrency crash. The Fed shouldn't need to rush in and save the day if AmazonCoin or WalmartCoin crashed.Currencies rely on conservative and predictable rules to assure the public that massive money printing won't destroy value. Could people trust the central bank of Amazon?Then again, will people always be able to count on the Fed?The Fed controls the creation of money, but central bankers seem to be losing their grip. Any loss of faith in the dollar and the Fed bodes well for a cryptocurrency future as dollar-skeptics look for an alternative store of wealth — besides gold.Bitcoin's peer-to-peer electronic payment system, first proposed in 2008 to verify transactions through a decentralized public blockchain, arrived on the scene as the global financial crisis triggered bailouts of one big bank after another.Bitcoin fulfilled famed economist Friedrich Hayek's idea of denationalizing money. He believed competition could help keep central banks honest and prevent runaway inflation.Doubts fueled by ""ballooning balance sheets of the major central banks in the aftermath of the global financial crisis"" motivated early cryptocurrency investors, JPMorgan analysts wrote. Yet the lack of any upsurge in inflation since ""has surely reduced concerns about fiat (legal tender issued by a central bank) money.""Yet the Fed now faces a much different challenge: a runaway federal deficit even amid a strong U.S. economy. The deficit will top $1 trillion in fiscal 2019 and $2 trillion by 2027, and there's no fix in sight. Republicans have overseen big deficit-financed tax cuts and increased government spending. Democrats want more generous Social Security benefits, Medicare for all and debt-free college.""The continued growth of public debt raises eventual sustainability questions if left unchecked,"" Goldman Sachs economists warned recently.The Fed seems on track to suffer the same fate as the Bank of Japan. The BoJ has been forced to accommodate sky-high government deficits with easy money and asset purchases. Japan, with a falling working-age population, hasn't had a whiff of inflation. But the U.S. might be a different story.Deutsche Bank global credit strategist Jim Reid put this shocking headline on a November report: ""The Start of the End of Fiat Money?"" Reid argued high debt levels will keep the Fed and other central banks too accommodative, putting fiat currencies at risk.""The fiat currency system may be seriously tested over the coming decade and ultimately we may need to find an alternative,"" Reid wrote. ""Cryptocurrencies are all the rage at the moment and are as much about blockchain as anything else, but there could be an increasing desire for alternative"" mediums of exchange in the years to come.""Keep in mind that fiat money is a relatively young innovation. It's only truly been the norm since President Nixon ended the dollar's quasi-gold standard in 1971.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Before You Buy Bitcoin, Read ThisBurned By Bitcoin?

57,CME,"Stock market bulls had their day in the sun Friday as the Nasdaq composite scored an all-time high, cheered by a strong jobs report and tame wage growth in February.X With about one hour remaining in the session, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq showed gains of around 1.5%. The S&P 500 reclaimed its 50-day moving average. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking slightly higher than Thursday's levels at the same time of day in the stock market today.Chevron (CVX), JPMorgan (JPM) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) outperformed in the Dow, with gains of 2.5% to 3%.Nonfarm U.S. payrolls surged 313,000 in February, well above the Econoday consensus estimate of 205,000. Wages rose a tame 2.6%, also below expectations. Investors moved out of bonds and into stocks on the news, sending the 10-year Treasury yield higher by 3 basis points to 2.89%. According to the CME Group FedWatch tool, the market has pretty much baked in a quarter-point hike at the March 21 Fed meeting. That would lift the federal funds rate to a range of 1.50% to 1.75%.Friday's session yielded a healthy supply of breakouts, good to see alongside robust gains for the major stock indexes.Rising bond yields helped the cause of financials, including a couple of online brokers. Charles Schwab (SCHW) added nearly 3% to 57.44, good enough for a breakout from a base with a 56.35 entry. E-Trade Financial (ETFC) showed similar action, rising 3% to 56.94. It cleared a base with a 56.10 entry.Goldman Sachs (GS), meanwhile, is near the top of a flat base with a 273.89 entry. Shares rose 1% to 269.66. The stock was unfazed by a Wall Street Journal report that CEO Lloyd Blankfein could step down as soon as the end of this year.Trucking stocks were among the day's best performers as the group rose more than 3%.

59,CME,"If the February jobs report out Friday morning comes in as strong as Wall Street expects, it will set financial markets up for another Fed interest-rate scare later this spring.X Here's the reason: Economists expect the new jobs data to match January's 2.9% hourly annual wage gain — the best since 2009. That's even though that surprising data point appeared inflated by a dive in the work week that disproportionately reduced hours for low-wage workers. But even bigger pay gains are likely coming this spring, reflecting recently announced wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX), which won't show up yet in the February jobs report.And as those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. This week, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.Wall Street also expects that the jobless rate dipped to 4.0% in February for the first time since 2000, as the economy added a robust 205,000 jobs.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11
"
60,CME,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowThe combination of low and falling unemployment with accelerating wage gains fits perfectly with the Phillips curve theory that has long guided Federal Reserve policy. As far as investors are concerned, the key point is that most Fed policymakers still seem pretty confident that inflation pressures won't follow too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.That's why an interest-rate scare is looking increasingly likely, even if a legitimate inflation scare doesn't materialize.Yet the competitive environment facing Kroger from Walmart and Amazon.com (AMZN) via its Whole Foods division, among others, offers at least some reason to doubt whether wage pressure will feed through to higher prices. Kroger said on Thursday that it will use one-third of its tax cut to boost shareholder returns, but the other two-thirds will go to higher wages and lower prices.Kroger gave weak profit guidance as it forecast smaller profit margins, sending shares crashing 12% on Thursday.Walmart's minimum-wage hike to $11 an hour was its first for new, entry-level workers since 2015, when it raised its minimum wage to $9 an hour. Then, in early 2016, Walmart hiked pay for all current associates to a minimum of $10 an hour, leading Target, Costco (COST) and others to raise their own wages. The point is that wage hikes can come in bunches. It didn't really happen last year, when wage growth hit a bit of a lull. But it does appear to be happening in 2018.If it does, Wall Street will continue to bump up odds for a fourth rate hike in 2018. Already those odds are about 1 in 3, up from about 20% a month ago, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:These Three Dow Jones Stocks Are Near Buy Points As 2 FANGs Make Bullish MoveThe Big Picture: This Is The Real News For InvestorsHere Are 10 Chip Stocks Breaking Out, Hitting New Highs Or Setting UpWhat Do Facebook, Grubhub, Salesforce And Epam Have In Common?

61,CME,"Major indexes felt investors' chill over news that Gary Cohn is leaving his White House role as chief economic advisor, but the Nasdaq composite continues to prove that it is the index to beat in 2018. However, as seen in recent sessions, the U.S. equity markets continue to show rapid seesawing action as well.X Due to a recent spate of heavy distribution, or pronounced institutional profit-taking, from Feb. 20 to March 1 in both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, IBD's current outlook continues to stand at ""Uptrend under pressure.""At 3 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq shaved its mild losses and is trying to hold above the breakeven level, up 0.1%, despite having multiple large-cap and megacap companies that do business overseas. But in the wake of continued uncertainty over the possibility of trade spats between the U.S. and China, the rest of Asia, and Europe, clearly the selling has been more focused on industrial companies.The Dow Jones industrial average, down at one point 1.4%, has cut its losses to around 0.7%. During session lows, at least half of the 30 components sank 1 point or more. IBM (IBM) was the sole stock within the Dow Industrials to rise 1 point or more.The S&P 500 slid nearly 0.8%, then cut the loss to less than 0.4% with an hour to go in Wednesday's session. At 2707, the large-cap benchmark has shaved its year-to-date gain to 1.6%.The Nasdaq is up 6.7% since Jan. 1.The Russell 2000 gained 0.7% as small caps outperformed. Perhaps institutional investors hold a general view that a budding trade war that focuses on tariffs on select products would hurt larger multinational companies more than smaller firms that sell primarily in the domestic market.The S&P SmallCap 600 is up 0.6%, and at 955 is now up 2% since Jan. 1.While steel stocks are emerging as a new leading sector thanks to strong gains by the likes of United States Steel (X), Steel Dynamics (STLD) and Nucor (NUE), the software, consumer and China sectors of the market continue to do well.Alibaba (BABA), Weibo (WB) and TAL Education (TAL) continue to show nice long-term uptrends and high relative strength. (See a detailed analysis of TAL's chart action near the bottom of this article.)Alibaba, a big winner in 2017, continues to a long trend of higher highs and higher lows. Notice on a daily chart how the Chinese and international facilitator of e-commerce and mobile payments had sold off in line with the early February correction that took the Nasdaq down nearly 12% from its perch. Yet Alibaba, hitting a 2018 year-to-date low of 168.88, did not undercut the Dec. 5 near-term low of 164.25. That's bullish.Plus, Alibaba has been weaving above and below its still-rising 50-day moving average. Such action indicates that the stock is trying to form a new base that could serve as a launching pad for a new breakout and a new run to price highs.When a stock breaks out and hits new highs, everyone in the market is happy, except for short sellers.Alibaba broke out of an eight-week cup with handle at 192.59 on Jan. 24, rallied 7%, then got reeled back into the belly of that chart pattern. So, a new base that potentially forms would technically serve as a base next to a base.Autodesk (ADSK) gapped up on very strong results and gave a rosy outlook based on success with its transition into a ""software as a service"" business model.

The leader in for-profit education for China's fast-growing middle class inched up on Wednesday, but more importantly, the large-cap consumer spending play continues to hold near a 36.26 buy point in a new four-month cuplike base.TAL, which has a relatively limited float of 182 million shares, has performed exceptionally well since it initially cleared a 12-week perfect cup with handle at 13.07 on Jan. 19, 2017 (adjusted for a 6-1 stock split later in the year). On that day, the stock vaulted 7.4% in very heavy volume and sprinted past the highest price within the downward-slanting handle within the base. Add 10 cents to a handle's high to find the exact buy point.To see that exact breakout, MarketSmith offers excellent easy-to-use historical charts that allow users to go back decades in time.On the day of TAL's January 2017 breakout, the correct buy point was 77.93, a dime above the handle's high, before the big stock split. In the handle portion of the base, TAL fell just 5% to 74.06. The handle indicates the final shakeout of remaining uncommitted shareholders before fresh new institutional demand comes in to lift the stock and spur the breakout to new highs.Since that breakout, TAL has advanced 200%.Over the same time period, the S&P 500 has gained as much as 27%, excluding dividends.TAL grew its revenue 39%, 38%, 43% and 68% over the past four years. In the fiscal year 2017 ended in February that year, the top line was $1.04 billion, hitting the billion-dollar level for the first time.The Street sees earnings rising 14% to 32 cents a share in FY 2018 (which just ended in February), then leaping another 62% to 52 cents in FY 2019 on revenue increases of 63% to $1.7 billion and 52% to $2.59 billion, respectively.In other financial markets, WTI crude oil futures slumped 2.3% to $61.14 a barrel despite reports that weekly U.S. crude oil inventories came in higher than expected at 2.4 million barrels, suggesting continued strong domestic output. In the prior week, inventories were higher at 3.0 million barrels.Bond traders have been conducting relatively quiet trading, at least from the view of U.S. Treasury long bonds. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note stood at 2.88%, relatively unchanged for the past two sessions and seven basis points below the year-to-date peak of 2.95%.The CME Fed Watch tool for analyzing fed funds futures currently shows no significant change in the probability that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates four times by December. The probability that the fed funds rate will hit a 2.25%-2.5% target range is 34%. This means the majority of bond traders see just three increases of a quarter point each for 2018, with the first one coming up after the Fed holds a two-day meeting on interest rate policy on March 20-21.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on top growth stocks, breakouts, sell signals, and other financial markets.)RELATED:Hot IPO LeadersDo You Know How To Spot This Money-Making Bullish Stock Chart Pattern?Stocks Near A Buy ZoneWill More Hot Growth Stocks Begin Forming This Key Pattern?Autodesk Shines After Its Q4 Results

77,CME,"The Nasdaq composite paced a fourth straight weekly gain for the major equity indexes Friday as investors shrugged off a lower than expected initial print on U.S. GDP (up 2.6%, below the 2.9% Econoday forecast) and some concerns on the future of President Trump's ""America First"" trade policy.X Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) showed that it's still in deep hibernation mode. The popular Bitcoin-tracking closed end fund pulled below its key 10-week moving average for the second straight week after topping out at 3,522 last month.While Bitcoin Investment Trust saw very dull volume, shares still dropped 2.4% to 1,645 and lost nearly 7% for the week. The weak action is not surprising given that in December Bitcoin showed the same type of climax top action witnessed during the end of the dot-com boom in late 1999.The S&P 500 was not far behind the Nasdaq, racing almost 1.2% higher. The Dow Jones industrial average, which also counts Intel among its 30 components, rose nearly 0.9% as at least 11 of the 30 names gained 1 point or more.

Notice how the cup base showed lopsided action, a flaw.However, the big gap up on Friday, paired with a 166% increase in volume vs. the prior 50 trading sessions, completely changed the complexion of the Santa Clara, Calif., tech firm.When the stock opened on Friday at 48.30, it traded less than 3% above the 47.40 buy point, and thus was in buy range. Don't chase a stock that has already advanced more than 5% past the proper entry point in a well-formed base.Intel posted a second quarter in a row of accelerating profit growth. Earnings in Q4 rose 37% to $1.08 a share, up from increases of 22% and 26% in the prior two quarters. Sales picked up 4% to $17.05 billion, boosted in part by hot demand for data center chips.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Intel sports an 84 Composite Rating, which combines all of IBD's key metrics on fundamentals, technical chart action, and growth of institutional sponsorship. While that's below the 90 minimum threshold you'd prefer for breakout candidates, Intel's 84 is not terrible. And due to big weekly gains, watch to see if that rating quickly improves.At the start of the year, Intel showed a 90 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, a 91 for EPS Rating, and an 87 for Relative Price Strength over the past 12 months.The Dow transports also joined the fairly broad advance, rising 1.1%. But at 11,125, the sector index still lost 1.6% for the week.The Dow utility average gained 0.4%, but the rate-sensitive index is still in an intermediate correction. At 699, the Dow utilities are still 10.2% below the Nov. 15 peak of 778.

Spot prices tumbled intraday below $11,000. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that Goldman Sachs (GS) was developing a trading desk for cryptocurrencies, with a possible debut in June, which would make it the first big bank to be a cryptocurrency market maker. And amid a growing market fixation on anything blockchain, Long Island Iced Tea Corp. vaulted a cool 183% Thursday after the iced-tea seller said it was rebranding itself as Long Blockchain (LTEA) to focus on ""the exploration of and investment in opportunities that leverage the benefits of blockchain technology.""Diamondback Energy (FANG) broke out in strong volume Wednesday, with Chevron (CVX), Concho Resources (CXO) among those clearing buy points on Thursday. BPBP, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) were among those breaking out in less-impressive trade. Energy stocks are seen as big winners from the tax cuts, while crude prices are holding at two-year highs.

Meanwhile, several mining stocks, including Vale (VALE) and Rio Tinto (RIO), also broke out.Memory-chip maker Micron Technology (MU) beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal first quarter and guided much higher than views for the current quarter.

Analysts expected Micron to earn $2.20 a share on sales of $6.39 billion. For the current quarter, Micron expects to earn an adjusted $2.58 a share on sales of $7 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street had been modeling $1.95 and $6.08 billion. Shares rose 4%.Consumer spending and the housing market turned it up a notch in November as the economy fires on pretty much all cylinders. Third-quarter GDP growth was revised down a tick to 3.2%, still the best pace since the first quarter of 2015, as business investment extended its recent strength. Consumer spending rose 0.6% on the month, while wages rose 0.4%. Consumers saved just 2.9% of income in November, the weakest in a decade, which is probably a reflection of greater optimism in the economic outlook. Existing-home sales surged 5.6% to a 5.81 million annual pace, the best in 11 years, as the supply of homes for sale got even tighter. New-home sales skyrocketed 17.5%.Nike (NKE) reported a 5% sales drop in North America, its second straight quarterly decline. But the No. 1 sports brand comfortably topped expectations as Q2 profit fell 8% to 46 cents a share and revenue rose 5% to $8.55 billion vs. views for 39 cents EPS and $8.39 billion. China sales rose 15%.

FedEx Express revenue rose over 8%, Ground segment revenue grew 12%, and Freight sales rose 10%. Shares rose 4.15%.

UPS has encountered some delays in getting packages to customers.Red Hat (RHT) reported Q3 profit that edged views while revenue, operating margin, and billings also topped estimates. The open source Linux software company is ramping revenue from new products — OpenShift and OpenStack — for hybrid cloud computing, analysts said. For the current quarter Red Hat estimated revenue in the range of $758 million to $763 million, above the consensus of $755 million.

But shares sank 4.55%.Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants (DRI) reported adjusted second-quarter earnings of 73 cents, up 14%, while revenue rose 14.6% to $1.88 billion, both beating views.

Meanwhile, Jack in the Box (JACK) agreed to sell its Qdoba burrito chain to Apollo Global Management (APO), the latest private-equity buyout of a restaurant chain in 2017.RV icon Winnebago (WGO) on Wednesday trounced Q1 earnings views. Shares fell 4.6% Wednesday amid concerns about creeping costs in its motor home segment, but closed up 0.7% for the week. REV Group (REVG), which sells RVs along with an array of specialty vehicles missed quarterly estimates. But the recent IPO rebounded from a steep Wednesday morning loss soar 11% for the week, hitting record highs.Stitch Fix (SFIX) topped estimates in its first-ever earnings report. Analysts said they were impressed with the online tailor's performance, with revenue of $295.6 million, up 25%.

The recent IPO fell 9.8% on Wednesday but rose 5.6% for the week.Accenture (ACN) reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that topped expectations. The Dublin-based global tech consulting and services said it earned $1.79 a share, up 13%, with revenue rising 12% to  $9.5 billion.Biogen (BIIB) reported that a much-followed experimental Alzheimer's drug did not meet success criteria after 12 months in a Phase 2 trial.

80,CME,"CME Group (CME) Bitcoin futures kicked off at $20,650, briefly the $20,000 mark a week after Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) launched its own futures for the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin prices reversed on spot markets after testing $20,000 earlier.XCME's Bitcoin futures, with the ticker BTC, fell back to $18,865. Cboe Bitcoin futures were at $18,800, near session lows but up sharply from Friday's $18,105.CME Group is a much bigger player in futures than Cboe, while its Bitcoin contract will be derived from prices on four exchanges. Cboe's contract is tied to just one, Gemini. So CME's Bitcoin contract could generate far more liquidity and be more apt to generate institutional interest. It should also be easier to buy and short.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) will let its investors trade Cboe Bitcoin futures starting Monday, but will wait on CME's contract. TD Ameritrade is one of the biggest online brokers, making it far easier for millions of investors to take part in Bitcoin. Interactive Brokers (IBKR) already lets its customers trade Cboe futures.

81,CME,"At least one of Wall Street's biggest firms is growing more comfortable with cryptocurrencies.X Goldman Sachs (GS) is setting up a trading desk to make markets in digital currencies such as Bitcoin, according to people with knowledge of the strategy. The bank aims to get the business running by the end of June, if not earlier, two of the people said. Another said it's still trying to work out security issues as well as how it would hold, or custody, the assets.The move positions Goldman Sachs to become the first large Wall Street firm to make markets in cryptocurrencies, whose wild price swings and surging values have captured the public's imagination but given pause to established institutions. Already, the bank is among just a few mainstream firms clearing a new breed of Bitcoin futures offered by Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) and CME Group (CME). Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC), for example, have been taking a wait-and-see approach.Goldman Sachs is now assembling a team in New York, one of the people said. While the bank hasn't made a decision where to house the desk, one possibility is that it will operate within the fixed-income, currencies and commodities unit's systematic trading function, which conducts transactions electronically, two people said. Darren Cohen, in the firm's principal strategic investments group, is also looking at opportunities, another person said.""In response to client interest in digital currencies, we are exploring how best to serve them,"" Michael DuVally, a spokesman, said in a statement.Publicly, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein has been circumspect. He tweeted in October that his firm was looking at how to deal with Bitcoin. In a Bloomberg Television interview last month, he said his bank didn't need a Bitcoin strategy yet because the digital currency is still just developing and volatile.And when the bank began clearing futures earlier this month, it demanded that some clients set aside funds equal to the full value of their trade, people familiar with the policy said at the time. The conservatism deterred some customers and led them to take their business elsewhere.

That company would trade on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada. Riot Blockchain would get 41.6 million shares from its 52% ownership of TessPay.A merger, if it were agreed to, would likely close in the second quarter of next year. However, the company said that no deal was guaranteed.""The decision to take the company public provides us access to traditional capital markets as we continue developing our blockchain technology solution,"" Jeff Mason, TessPay's CEO, said in a statement.

Byrne hasn't ruled the option out.""One of the possibilities is I sell the (Overstock) business and we have all the capital we need,"" Byrne told the Financial Times, adding that he has commissioned Guggenheim Partners to explore a possible sale.The sale of the online retailer, the Financial Times noted, would leave Byrne with Medici Ventures, an Overstock.com subsidiary that focuses on blockchain investment.Overstock jumped 14% to 60.90 in the stock market today. That jump came just two days after the stock blasted 22% higher after Morgan Stanley Investment Management disclosed an 11.4% stake in the company.The new joint venture announced Wednesday, called De Soto Inc., was formed by Byrne and De Soto along with Medici Ventures. The move marks Overstock's latest advance into the shared record-keeping technology, which was initially used to process Bitcoin transactions.More recently, though, the technology has increasingly been tested out by other companies — from IBM (IBM) to JPMorgan (JPM) — to potentially process financial transactions more quickly or create a digital trail to track shipments and prevent fraud.In a blockchain, transactions or other data are recorded on a digital ledger that everyone participating in the recording of that information can see. Everyone involved has to agree that the information being recorded is accurate before it is sealed off in a block of code, making it difficult to tamper with.But in many parts of the world, property ownership is based on informal documentation, allowing room for exploitation and corruption.De Soto, a world-renowned economist, has long seen stronger property rights as a way to prevent government repression and a way for the poor to participate in the economy. He has also seen blockchain as a way to solidify claims to property ownership.""You have an Internet of Things,"" de Soto told IBD last year. ""But what you don't have is an Internet of Rights.""De Soto Inc. plans to use blockchain to bring together scores of those informal property records to create a ""global repository on which ownership and transfer can be based."" The company plans to launch its first pilot program early next year.""About 80% of the world's population is unable to enter into the modern global economy due to lack of visible and standardized property records,"" de Soto said in a statement. ""Billions of people have resources that cannot easily be transformed into productive capital. Blockchain is a powerful tool to solve these structural issues, which are some of the principal causes of poverty and conflict.""Within real estate alone, the poor segments of the population in developing nations own $14 trillion in assets that amount to ""dead capital,"" or something that, essentially, has little value because it lacks the documentation necessary to convert it into money.""Lacking formal ownership and the legal protection it affords, citizens of the developing world may turn for protection to terrorist organizations, who gain power by promising enforcement of de facto local property ownership,"" Overstock's statement said.Meanwhile, as the hype grows around Bitcoin, Interactive Brokers (IBKR) said Tuesday that it will allow traders to short Bitcoin futures, a spokeswoman told Bloomberg. Cboe (CBOE) debuted such futures on Sunday.

95,CME,"The allure of bitcoin was too much for CME Group (CME).The world's largest exchange owner reversed course today and said it plans to introduce bitcoin futures by the end of the year, only a month after dismissing such a plan. The largest cryptocurrency, which has surged more than sixfold this year, climbed to a record high after the announcement.CME's neighbor across the street in Chicago seems to have had a lot to do with the decision. Cboe Global Markets said earlier this year that it was going to begin a bitcoin futures contract by year-end or early 2018, and awaits approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The CME contract will settle in cash and use a daily price from the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate, which is supported by digital exchanges Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit and Kraken. Missing from that list is Gemini, one of the other large global exchanges, which struck a deal with Cboe.A functioning derivatives market could help professional traders and investors access the incredible volatility inherent in bitcoin without having to trade on unfamiliar venues that may risk anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules. It will also allow traders to hedge their cash positions in the digital currency, which to date has been difficult to do.""As the world's largest regulated FX marketplace, CME Group is the natural home for this new vehicle that will provide investors with transparency, price discovery and risk transfer capabilities,"" Terrence Duffy, CME's chief executive officer, said in a statement today.The creation of bitcoin futures is a key step in opening the asset to institutional investors, who currently have few opportunities, said Spencer Bogart, head of research at Blockchain Capital, a San Francisco-based venture capital firm. Bitcoin Investment Trust, currently one of the only avenues for investors seeking bitcoin-backed securities, is trading at a premium of more than 30 percent above net asset value. The trust, known as GBTC, is a ""physical"" fund, meaning it holds bitcoin itself.""The amount of institutional money in bitcoin now is very little because there are very few vehicles,"" Bogart said. ""If there are bitcoin futures, there can be futures-based"" exchange-traded funds.In the race for bitcoin derivatives, both CME and Cboe have lost to a startup. LedgerX won CFTC approval to offer swaps and options on bitcoin and began trading earlier this month. Volumes have been light so far. Yesterday, 103 bitcoin swaps traded on LedgerX, while nine options contracts changed hands, according to the exchange. The LedgerX options trades are physically-delivered, giving investors who hold a contract to maturity the ability to own bitcoin outright.Ari Paul, a co-founder of Blocktower Capital, said LedgerX is starting out slowly on purpose. ""DRW is a market maker there,"" Paul said. ""There's pretty low volume. A million dollars a day. I do expect them to have a lot of volume very soon. They are intelligently ramping up.""Many investors who want to can't maintain ownership of bitcoin now, what's known as custody, ""either for regulatory reasons or because it's scary and hard,"" Paul said. But in a regulated market like futures that doesn't become an issue. ""The ability to easily short allows for market neutral strategies and makes high-frequency trading much easier. That draws a lot of attention from hedge funds and the traditional finance world.""CME and Cboe face challenges to win over investors to their bitcoin futures. If the underlying pricing is unsound that could steer people aways, said Mark Williams, a finance lecturer at Boston University's Questrom School of Business.""The concern is that CME will attempt to treat bitcoin like a corn or wheat future when this commodity is in a highly risky class of its own,"" Williams said. ""One of the major spots to buy and sell bitcoin are through unregulated bucket shop exchanges located outside of the reach of U.S. regulators."" He noted that since 2009, almost half of these types of exchanges included Mt. Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin market, have gone bust. ""CME has no other commodity future that looks like or behaves like bitcoin. To me this means trouble.""Jon West, head trader at digital asset brokerage Omega One, said the amount of daily margin CME and Cboe require will be a key ingredient. If it's too high ""then it's not very useful for hedging because you need to have so much money in your account,"" he said. CME should take it slow as it designs its contract, he said. ""It's a very complex asset with a lot going on.""The creation of bitcoin futures should make it easier to create an exchange-traded fund based on the digital asset. Yet so far that's been a much harder task. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March rejected a bitcoin ETF proposed by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss — the co-creators of the Gemini exchange — saying necessary surveillance-sharing agreements were too difficult given that ""significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated,"" according to the agency.CME is a giant in trading with products including futures on the S&P 500, oil and gold, and customer connections all around the world. The timing of the decision is a bit of a surprise. Just a month ago, CME President Bryan Durkin said on Bloomberg Television that ""I really don't see us going forward with a futures contract in the very near future.""Under Duffy's leadership it has pulled back from business interests that didn't align with its historic role as a futures powerhouse, such as shutting down its European operations and exiting credit-default swap clearing. Its resistance to bitcoin futures was seen as aligned with Duffy's vision of keeping the company's focus on what it has always done well.""I'm a little concerned about the fact that both of those futures contracts are cash settled,"" said Garrett See, chief executive officer of DV Chain, a sister company of trading firm DV Trading, which trades cryptocurrencies. The Cboe contract will be settled using auctions on the Gemini exchange. See said there has not been a lot of volume in those auctions, so he raised the question of what happens if an auction fails, or there's not enough volume to keep it from being manipulated.""I'm really excited to see derivatives come into the space,"" See said. ""I see it as a great step, but in an ideal world I'd really like to see physical delivery"" in futures.Another benefit is the increased regulation that will come with bitcoin futures, Omega One's West said. ""Futures trading should deter some black market business and push it into more regulated places,"" he said.

112,CME,"U.S. stocks got off to a riveting start to the new year, particularly in the tech sectors, as Apple (AAPL) behaved the way one would expect for a leading stock that is testing support at a key technical juncture.X Apple, the global consumer electronics and digital services play, rose more than 1.7% to 172.36 and bounced off its rising 50-day moving average.The 50-day line, which graphs a stock's average closing price over the trailing 50 trading sessions, has been rising ever since the stock edged slowly after a key breakout from an early-stage base at 118.12 on Jan. 6, 2017. Gains from that breakout from a solid cup with handle reached nearly 50%.More recently, Apple on Oct. 27 cleared a new second-stage cup with handle at 160.97 and volume was brisk, 64% above the stock's 50-day average turnover.Apple and fellow Nasdaq tech giant Alphabet (GOOGL) (up 1.9% to 1,073.21, now extended past a recent flat base entry at 1,006.29) helped lead the Nasdaq composite up 1.5% by day's end. The Nasdaq soared 28.2% in 2017, its best annual gain in four years.The Nasdaq 100 rallied nearly 1.8%; the index-tracking PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ), also up almost 1.8%, is now 28 cents below the all-time high of 158.77.The S&P 500 rallied more than 0.6% as investors also scooped up shares in infrastructure and building materials firms (please see the prior Stock Market Today column for more details), top Chinese company ADRs that are highly profitable and growing strong revenues, steel, automaker and generic drug groups.The Steel-Producers group is shaping up as Tuesday's top performer among the 197 groups tracked each day by IBD (see the entire list by going to Data Tables within the Stock Lists section of Investors.com).Strength in Apple, Chevron (CVX) (extended after a December breakout past a base on base at 120.99) and Walt Disney (DIS) (forming a new base) helped the Dow Jones industrial average edge 0.2% higher, overcoming a sell-off in insurance titan Travelers (TRV).Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) got off to a great start in 2018, rising at one point 15% to an intraday high of 2,320 in dull trading. At the end of 2017, even after a deep four-session plunge that took the Bitcoin-tracking ETF from as high as 3,522 to as low as 1,155, Bitcoin Investment still finished the year with a 1,556% return.It's likely that interest in Bitcoin is set to only rise, given the growing acceptance of e-commerce, digital transactions, concerns over the unusual gains in U.S. and other equities in 2017, and the relative ""newness"" of the alternative currency. The fact that both the CME Group and Cboe now conduct futures trading in Bitcoin is one of this currency's greatest accomplishments over the past few months.Watch to see how Bitcoin Investment acts around both the 10-day and 50-day moving averages. The latter has been catching up some, now well above 1,400. But the 50-day moving average, which usually acts as an excellent defense-oriented sell signal when a growth stock torpedoes through it in huge volume, has not been an effective timing indicator for this ultrahot ETF.Going back to Apple, amid all the speculation that the iPhone marketer is going to go on a huge shopping spree, investors should continue to simply monitor the price-and-volume action on a daily or weekly basis. And so far, the action remains healthy. One big reason is the possibility for further double-digit top and bottom line growth.Two, earnings growth may accelerate.The Street sees earnings rising 24% in the current fiscal year ending in September to $11.46 a share, up from an 11% jump in FY 2017 (ended in September that year). Services revenue is one big part of that picture. New products or new editions of the iPhone, MacBook and Apple Watch form another big part.Apple's ratings on Stock Checkup remain good, including a 90 Composite Rating and a decent B- grade for Accumulation/Distribution, which hints that fund managers are net buyers over the past 13 weeks of trading. The Accumulation grade goes from The C rating is neutral.In the medical sector, heart pump innovator Abiomed (ABMD) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT) continue to show leadership.The former rose more than 3% to 192.49, retaking its 50-day moving average in quiet yet rising turnover. Watch for a potential new flat base to form, possibly presenting a 200.38 entry.Abbott, a diversified pharmaceuticals, medical products and diagnostic systems giant, rallied more than 3% to 58.79 and new highs in steep turnover. Shares are still in buy range after clearing a narrow and shallow flat base with a 56.79 buy point.The 5% buy zone for Abbott, which has scored three quarters in a row of double-digit top and bottom line growth (EPS up 17%, 13% and 12% while revenue is up 30%, 24% and 29%), goes up to 59.63.Abiomed is a member of IBD's Sector Leaders growth stock screen.Investors dumped utility stocks as interest rates rose.The Dow utility average fell nearly 1.1% as the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note jumped sharply to 2.47%. The yield is near last month's peak of 2.49%. On Dec. 13, the Federal Reserve hiked the fed funds rate on overnight bank loans for the fifth time since December 2015.

128,CME,"Stocks jumped at Wednesday's open as markets awaited a final, procedural House vote on Congress' massive tax overhaul package. Gains by Intel (INTC), FedEx (FDX) and Micron Technology (MU) also factored into early trade.X The Dow Jones industrial average,the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 all opened to gains of 0.3%. All three indexes traded just shy of new highs.Senate approval of the GOP's tax reform legislation early Wednesday gave markets some early lift, as a re-vote expected in the House later in the day was broadly seen as a technicality. Markets remained wary of the ongoing need for a budget agreement, without which federal offices would be required to shut down after Friday.Real estate data continued to roll in, with the Mortgage Bankers Association reporting a 4.9% drop in total mortgage applications activity last week, putting the week 8% below last year's level.

The Energy Information Administration offers up its weekly oil inventories report at 10:30 a.m. ET.Chipmakers were showing strong early action, as Intel headed the Dow, up 1.1%, although JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (UTX) also traded near the head of the list. Intel's move followed news reports of a company memo in which Chief Executive Brian Krzanich declared the company was set to take more risks, as it boosts the amount of its revenue coming from growth markets, vs. its legacy PC business.Intel's gain sent just above a 47.40 buy point in a flat base.Micron Technology leapt 5% at the open. The Boise, Idaho-based chipmaker reported a triple-digit surge in fiscal first-quarter earnings and a 71% revenue increase, easily topping analyst estimates.

129,CME,"A Wall Street analyst's downgrade of megacap tech leader Apple (AAPL) didn't ruffle the feathers of institutional investors, even as major stock indexes cooled mildly Tuesday. Apple, down 0.9% to 174.79, still hovered only 1% below its newest buy point, 176.34 in a flat base.X Apple is also still extended from a prior buy point at 160.97, stemming from an eight-week cup with handle.Apple is also up more than 47% since it broke out of a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12 in early January. That cup with handle was part of a long bottoming base pattern, one of the most bullish chart patterns that help an investor time a new buy correctly after a stock has made a devastating correction.Nomura Instinet cut its rating on Apple to neutral on concerns that iPhone X sales are already incorporated into the stock's price. Jeffrey Kvall also noted a ""historically full multiple.""Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) took a well needed break, showing wild action as the Bitcoin-tracking exchange traded fund careened from a new all-time high of 3,523 to an intraday low of 2,630.With an intraday range of 33.9%, Bitcoin Investment is definitely not for the faint of heart. Yet for those who embrace time-proven chart patterns that have shown up in the greatest stock market winners going back to the late 19th century, Bitcoin Investment is acting just as one would expect after it bolted out of a deep yet well-formed cup with handle at 985.10.The gain from that Nov. 22 breakout has now exceeded 257%. The buy point is derived by adding 10 cents to the highest price within the two-week handle, or 985.00.At 3:40 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite rebounded a bit to cut its losses to around 0.4%. The leading U.S. equities index is also still up for the week following Monday's 0.8% boost. Investors are showing unwillingness to dump stocks as the House of Representatives passed a major tax reform package on Tuesday. The Senate is expected to do the same as early as Tuesday evening and send it to the White House for President Trump's signature before Christmas.The S&P 500 eased almost 0.2%. Finance, REIT, utility, solar and automaker stocks led the downside.Volume is running lower vs. the same time Monday on both main exchanges.The Dow Jones industrial average was off nearly 0.1%, with just two more components in addition to Apple down 1 point or more: Visa (V) and Goldman Sachs (GS). Goldman has gained nearly 4% since clearing a 247.84 buy point in a nine-month saucer with handle.Notice on a daily chart that Goldman broke out past the proper entry on Nov. 30 with a 2.6% gain in volume that expanded 148% higher than its 50-day average, a good sign. The Street expects the giant in fixed income and commodity trading and mergers and acquisitions to increase Q4 profits 2% to $5.16 a share.Microsoft (MSFT), one of the tech components within the Dow 30, dropped 1% to 85.53 in light trade and is mildly below an 86.30 buy point in a new flat base. The cloud computing, business software and Xbox giant initiated its slow yet steady advance with a late-July 2016 breakout past a 56.87 buy point in a three-month flat base that's part of a longer saucer pattern.As noted in this Investor's Corner column, the saucer pattern requires patience on the part of the investor before a proper new buy point finally emerges.Microsoft holds a solid 91 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. Apple sports a 94 Composite, supported in part by a stronger EPS Rating than Microsoft (90 for Apple on a scale of 1 to 99, 68 for Microsoft). A 90 EPS Rating means that Apple is superior to 90% of all companies in IBD's database in terms of near-term quarterly and long-term annual profit growth.Back to Bitcoin Investment Trust. While the ETF has simply skyrocketed amid a surge in interest in the alternative currency, one reason why Bitcoin perhaps has not yet reached bubble conditions is the fact that both the Cboe and CME Group have only recently begun trading futures on their respective exchanges.Two, the total value of Bitcoin being traded globally is said to be only a fraction of the total value of trading in bonds, stocks, commodities and forex.A third reason why Bitcoin could see future growth is that professional money managers are showing an increasing appetite. The Bitcoin.com news website reported that hedge fund manager Bill Miller, a former star of the Legg Mason Value Trust mutual fund, currently has half of its assets in Bitcoin.While biotech shares have not had a merry fourth quarter, Biogen (BIIB) stands out as one large-cap firm that could potentially break out.The stock got hammered after so-so Q3 results (earnings up 22% to $6.31 a share, revenue up just 4% to $3.08 billion), but the sell-off was limited to 13% after Biogen notched a 52-week peak of 348.48. Since then, the stock has been forming a flat base that could also stretch into a saucerlike pattern.Biogen's earnings have nearly quintupled from $4.12 a share in 2009 to $20.22 last year. However, growth is expected to slow amid stiff competition in treatments for multiple sclerosis and other chronic medical conditions. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising just 9% to $22.06 a share this year and up 8% to $23.81 in 2018.Within the IBD Big Cap 20, the current list showcases just one medical stock, AbbVie (ABBV).In other financial markets, investors dumped U.S. government bonds following the Federal Reserve's third hike in short-term interest rates of the year.

Disney jumped 6.75% for the week as it agreed to buy key Fox entertainment assets and more for $66 billion, including assumed debt.""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" will reap an estimated $220 million this weekend in the U.S. on top of $45 million in its Thursday's night openings. That's above Disney's estimate for $205 million.Disney is gearing up to launch a stand-alone subscription streaming service in 2019, with Star Wars films and a new live-action Star Wars series among the key content.Disney's upcoming streaming service, and its planned removal of Marvel and Star Wars content from Netflix, will make Netflix more reliant than ever on its own original content. But Netflix is increasingly becoming a must-have for households, even if they subscribe to other streaming or traditional pay-TV services. Netflix is a major reason why many traditional media players are scrambling.Netflix shares rose 0.3% to 190.12 in Friday's stock market trading. Netflix is in a flat base with a 204.48 buy point, but is currently trading below its 50-day moving average. A strong retaking of that support level in high volume could offer a buying opportunity.Comcast held out better than most media and entertainment stocks, but finally broke down in September before finding a bottom in early November. Comcast has formed a handle in a six-month consolidation, creating a 40.83 buy point.Comcast's Relative Strength line has been weak for months, as the stock has retreated while the S&P 500 index continued to march higher.Comcast is the leading U.S. cable and internet provider. It also owns NBCUniversal, making it a major content creator.Verizon is the No. 1 wireless operator. Telecom giants are often seen as distinct from cable and media stocks, but there is growing overlap. Americans, especially teens and young adults, increasingly use their smartphone as their screen for content. Also,Verizon offers pay-TV and internet service via Fios. Verizon also plans to launch 5G wireless broadband in select U.S. markets, competing with Comcast's landline broadband.Verizon bought Yahoo earlier this year following its purchase of AOL. Verizon owns Huffington Post and Tech Crunch.Verizon cleared a 51.28 bottoming-base buy point on Dec. 4, but then fell back down. But the Dow industrials component retook that entry on Dec. 11, closing Friday at 52.67.AT&T has an even better claim as a media claim than Verizon. In addition to being a wireless giant, AT&T owns the DirecTV satellite service, along with the streaming DirecTV Now. AT&T also is trying to buy Time Warner (TWX), which would make a major content player, with CNN, TNT, HBO and more.The Justice Department is fighting to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal, saying it would be anti-competitive.AT&T has cleared a 37.64 cup-with-handle buy point last week, ending Friday at 38.24. But there are definitely reasons to be cautious. AT&T fell to a two-year low on Nov. 6. It's rallied since then but the stock has no prior uptrend before the current consolidation. Shares have closed above their 200-day moving average for the first time in eight months.CSX CEO Hunter Harrison died Saturday from complications from an undisclosed illness.

Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said that Bitcoin played a very small role in the payments landscape, but that it was ""not a stable store of value"" and ""highly speculative."" Her remarks add to the chorus of banking officials weighing in on the much-hyped cryptocurrency. They echo those of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and others who believe Bitcoin, which can gain or lose thousands of dollars in a day, can't be depended on to retain consistent value.CME Group (CME) will launch its Bitcoin futures on Dec. 18.The megadeal is a reality: Disney is buying Fox's entertainment assets for an enterprise value of $66.1 billion. It includes 20th Century Fox's movie and TV studios, National Geographic, FX, 22 Fox regional sports networks, and certain international assets. Disney CEO Bob Iger, who is extending his contract past 2019 to 2021 because of the merger, expressed enthusiasm about the deal's ability to boost the media giant's direct-to-consumer strategy and spread the ESPN brand internationally. It's not clear how regulators feel about the transaction, and Disney has promised a $2.5 billion breakup fee. Fox will keep its broadcast, news as well sports networks FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network. Disney and Fox shares soared.Separately, Disney should expect a windfall from its latest entrant to the ""Star Wars"" franchise, ""The Last Jedi,"" which has already garnered largely positive reviews from critics and early viewers.

Fellow CAR-T player Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), though, retreated nearly 22% in two days despite strong data in patients with a form of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Investors wanted more data, analysts said. On Tuesday, GlycoMimetics (GLYC) rocketed on data from its drug in acute myeloid leukemia, but Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT) sank following its presentation of its sickle cell disease drug.

143,CME,"Depending on who you ask, Bitcoin is a bubble, a fraud, a money-laundering vehicle, a volatile mess or a crucial, necessary phase in monetary evolution.XStill, the currency, down sharply on Friday and over the weekend before a partial rebound Monday morning, has skyrocketed in value this year. Until it incinerates everybody's cash or transcends central banks as we know them, a whole bunch of Bitcoin-related plays — Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Goldman Sachs (GS) CME Group (CME) and CBOE (CBOE) — remain stocks to watch.Graphics processors from Nvidia and AMD are used to vet and clear cryptocurrency transactions. By clearing Bitcoin transactions, ""miners"" create more of the crypto coins. Nvidia is 24% extended past a 174.66 entry. It's often a good time to take profits after a 20%-25% advance.""Typically, growth stocks tend to advance 20% to 25% after breaking out of a proper base, then decline and set up new bases, and in some cases resume their advances,"" according to IBD's advice on profit-taking.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia is currently ranked No. 7 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.Shares of Nvidia jumped 5.3% to 216.14 on the stock market Friday, after the chipmaker late Thursday delivered strong third-quarter earnings and guidance.""We've been bearish for most of this year, anticipating that a slowdown in gaming would drive sharp revenue deceleration in 2017,"" Nomura-Instinet analyst Romit Shah said in a research note on Friday. ""However, Nvidia demonstrated good diversity in gaming with Nintendo Switch and cryptocurrency, offsetting weakness in core gaming earlier in the year.""Third-quarter sales for Nvidia's cryptocurrency-related products dropped 53%.""We remain nimble in our approach to the cryptocurrency market,"" management said on Nvidia's earnings call. ""It is volatile, does not and will not distract us from focusing on our core gaming market.""AMD, which plans to join forces with Intel to compete against Nvidia in laptop gaming chips rose 1.3% to 11.26 on Friday. In October, AMD, on its third-quarter earnings call, said it was forecasting ""some leveling-off of some of the cryptocurrency demand.""Goldman Sachs is currently near a 247.17 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. Shares eased 0.3% to 240.15 on Friday.The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Goldman is considering developing a cryptocurrency trading operation. Contrary to JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, who has said the cryptocurrency is doomed, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein appears to have hedged on the digital currency.He told CNBC this week that ""maybe Bitcoin is a kind of a bubble."" And he said ""it hasn't crossed my desk to set up a Bitcoin trading desk, but I wouldn't preclude it.""He added that he had a much more open mind about things like Bitcoin and that he had been wrong about other innovations taking off in the past. But he then said Bitcoin is ""something that I'm not comfortable with; I'm kind of an old dog to be absorbing that kind of a new trick.""Last month, Blankfein tweeted that he had not made up his mind about Bitcoin.Still thinking about #Bitcoin.

144,CME,"Bitcoin continued to trade wildly on Thursday, a day after swelling past $11,000 and then face-planted at below $10,000, as Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein said the cryptocurrency doesn't meet traditional standards for money while a top Federal Reserve policymaker said Bitcoin is a ""niche product.""X The digital currency, ever sensitive to price swings and the emotions of big and small investors alike, was down 2.8% to $9,540.14 in afternoon trading after sinking to $9,021 intraday. Etherium, another cryptocurrency, was down 2.4% to $427.51, but off their worst levels too.Last week, Bitcoin hovered in the $8,000 range. The latest big price swings come as more smaller, less sophisticated investors, curious about the hype, hop aboard and then bail on what has become a wild ride this year for the cryptocurrency.Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein said Thursday that it's too soon for his bank to develop a Bitcoin strategy, and questioned calling the digital instrument a ""currency.""""Something that moves up and down 20% in a day doesn't feel like a currency, doesn't feel like a store of value,"" Blankefein told Bloomberg Television.Goldman's commodity chief said Wednesday that Bitcoin should be treated as a commodity.Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles said Thursday dismissed the idea that Bitcoin could be a major rival to established currencies or that the Fed itself would issue its own cryptocurrency.""Digital currencies are a niche product that sometimes garners large headlines,"" Quarles said. He warned that digital currencies could pose ""serious financial stability issues"" if they became widely used.A Bank of England official on Wednesday downplayed the risks of the cryptocurrency, but urged caution nonetheless.""This is not at a size where it's a macroeconomic risk to the global economy,"" Jon Cunliffe, a deputy governor with the central bank, told BBC Radio 5 Live, according to the Guardian, ""but when prices are moving like that, my view would be investors need to do their homework.""But Joseph Stiglitz, the World Bank's former chief economist and a Nobel Prize winner, told Bloomberg on Wednesday that ""Bitcoin is successful only because of its potential for circumvention, lack of oversight. So it seems to me it ought to be outlawed.""David Mondrus, CEO of the blockchain company Trive, took issue with that comment.""Yes, circumvention of third parties, including government is one of the major uses/cases of Bitcoin,"" he said in an emailed statement on Wednesday, ""but it is precisely because of the failure and overreach of such parties that it was invented.""He added: ""Maybe it's time we stopped relying on third parties, governments and regulators to keep us safe and relied on ourselves.""Also Wednesday, U.S. authorities appeared to tighten the screws on the cryptocurrency. A federal court in California has told the trading platform Coinbase to submit to the IRS information about anyone who has moved $20,000 or more through their accounts annually between 2013 and 2015, according to the Verge.Bloomberg reported Wednesday that the biggest declines that day occurred as some trading platforms experienced hiccups in service amid some immense traffic volumes.Despite the growing skepticism, Nasdaq (NDAQ) and Cantor Fitzgerald plan to launch Bitcoin futures, following similar decisions by CME Group (CME) and CBOE (CBOE).Crypto-related stock and investments were also volatile in the stock market today, including Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), Overstock (OSTK), Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Marathon Patent Group (MARA).Bitcoin investment vehicle Bitcoin Investment Trust rose 1.4%, rebounding from much-steeper losses.

146,CME,"Tuesday was another day of fresh highs for the major stock indexes Tuesday, helped in part by strength in financials, plus news from the Conference Board that consumer confidence hit a 17-year high in October.X Indexes backed off a bit on news of another North Korean missile launch, but Wall Street mostly took the news in stride.With a little over one hour remaining in the session, the Dow Jones industrial average was near its session high, up close to 0.8%. Financials did the heavy lifting in the blue-chip index, with names like JPMorgan (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and American Express (AXP) up 1% or more.The S&P 500 gained 0.8%, while the Nasdaq composite lagged with a 0.3% gain. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking about 10% higher than Monday's levels.In testimony at his confirmation hearing before the Senate banking committee, Federal Reserve chair nominee Jerome Powell said the case for raising interest rates at the December meeting is strengthening. According to the CME Group FedWatch tool, futures traders think there's a 93% chance for a quarter-point hike, which would push the federal funds rate to 1.25%-1.50%.In economic news, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index rose to 129.5, well ahead of the consensus estimate of 124.5. Price action in the bond market was subdued, with the 10-year Treasury yield up 1 basis point to 2.34%.Semiconductor stocks underperformed again, one day after Morgan Stanley cited lower flash memory prices  and weak earnings growth next year as a reason to take profits in the group.In the stock market today, Thor Industries (THO) stayed in its torrid uptrend, rising another 12% to 152.55. Headed into earnings, the RV maker was quite extended from a 110.01 buy point. Thor was the top percentage gainer in the IBD 50. Group peer and fellow IBD 50 name Winnebago Industries (WGO) also did well, rising 6%.Strong earnings from Thor was good new for recent new issue Camping World (CWH). If demand for RVs is strong, it stands to reason that demand for camping equipment might also be robust. Shares of Camping World rose 6.5% to 45.83 as it works on a flat base with a 45.94 buy point.Goldman Sachs brought Camping World public in early October at 22.In M&A news, Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) jumped 6% to 155.60 after it sealed a deal with Roark Capital to go private for $2.4 billion. The deal values Buffalo Wild Wings at 157 a share.RELATED:IBD 50's Thor Industries Brings The Hammer, Crushes Q1 Earnings Why All Three-Weeks-Tight Patterns Are Not Created Equal Bitcoin Clears $10,000, But Several Crypto Stocks Tumble

147,CME,"Bitcoin's assault on $10,000 has stirred cryptocurrency bears who see fresh evidence of a bubble. Their problem? Shorting Bitcoin isn't easy.X The options to short Bitcoin are mostly through unregulated exchanges, and very risky given the cryptocurrency's volatility. Not to mention it hasn't exactly been a good year for Bitcoin bears given the 10-fold surge in price. But for those daring enough to try, there are ways to bet against Bitcoin's rise.""All the options to short in common markets are becoming available in the Bitcoin market,"" said Charles Hayter, co-founder of market tracker CryptoCompare. ""There's pretty good liquidity for shorting Bitcoin.""One of the most popular ways to short Bitcoin is through CFDs, a derivative that mirrors the movements of the asset. It's a contract between the client and the broker, where the buyer and seller of the CFD agree to settle any rise or drop in prices in cash on the contract date.""CFD is currently a great market if you want to short Bitcoin, especially ahead of that milestone 10K mark, which we think will bring some retracement,"" said Naeem Aslam, a chief market analyst at London-based TF Global Markets, which offers the contracts. ""The break could push the price well above $10,100, and it would be in that area when we could see some retracement.""Another common way to short Bitcoin is through margin trading, which allows investors to borrow the cryptocurrency from a broker to make the trade. The trade goes both ways; a trader can increase their long or short position through leverage. Depending on the funds kept as collateral to pay back the debt, this option increases the already risky Bitcoin trade. Bitfinex requires initial equity of 30% of the position.Short-margin trading positions on Bitfinex, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, were at around 19,188 Bitcoins on Monday, vs. 23,931 long positions, according to bfxdata.com, which tracks data on the bourse.Most of the brokerages that allow margin trading will also let clients borrow Bitcoin to short with no leverage. This will be a less risky way to bet Bitcoin price will fall.The futures market isn't as widely developed as CFDs and margin trading, but it's still possible to make bearish bets on Bitcoin with options. For now, LedgerX is the only regulated exchange and clearing agent for cryptocurrency options in the U.S. CME Group (CME) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange have both asked for approval to list Bitcoin futures, so that may open up the market to more investors.Investors can also indirectly bet against Bitcoin by shorting exchange traded notes with exposure to the cryptocurrency, like Stockholm-based Grayscale Investments's Bitcoin Tracker One and Bitcoin Investment Trust. The risk is that these notes don't always trade in line with Bitcoin, so the exposure won't be perfect.Aslam at TF Global Markets said he's not seeing an increase in demand to short Bitcoin.""Right now as of this minute, the race is still to the upside,"" he said.RELATED:Before You Buy Bitcoin Read ThisBitcoin Nears $10,000 Milestone; These Crypto Stock Plays Are MovingSquare Downgraded On Valuation After Bitcoin-Fueled Run-UpBitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And Trends

148,CME,"Bitcoin's relentless and volatile rally shows no sign of abating, with the world's largest cryptocurrency defying growing bubble fears to hit yet another milestone.XBitcoin rose as much as 6.7% to a record $8,224 as of 9:27 a.m. in New York. It's been a tumultuous year for the virtual currency, with three separate slumps of more than 25% all giving way to subsequent rallies.""The inflation in this thing is massive,"" Luke Hickmore, a senior investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments in London, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. ""When will it collapse? Who knows. It will cause a lot of pain.""Even as many skeptics call the asset a bubble waiting to pop, it's becoming too big for many on Wall Street to ignore. CME Group (CME), the world's biggest exchange, will start offering futures trading on bitcoin next month, while senior executives at Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citigroup (C) have said they are researching cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology that underlies them.Recent volatility has stemmed from a pickup in people switching to alternative virtual currencies, notably bitcoin cash. That's gaining popularity due to lower transaction costs and faster speed. New cryptocurrency iterations are springing up as disagreements over bitcoin's design persist and opportunities for making a quick buck prove hard to pass up.Bitcoin cash dropped 0.6% on Monday to trade at $1,184, down from a high of $1, 388 on Nov. 12, Coinmarketcap.com prices show. Bitcoin has advanced more than 700% this year and now boasts a market value of more than $130 billion.""I find it remarkable and somewhat frightening how, no matter how much bitcoin is pummeled by sellers, it simply bounces back even stronger,"" said Lukman Otunuga, an analyst at currency brokerage ForexTime Ltd.

150,CME,"Many investors are asking: Should I buy Bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies? And if not, why?X Bitcoin, the leading digital money, surged to a new record high above $17,000 Dec. 7 and was recently trading around $15,000. It's now risen nearly 1,550% this year and is up 6,540% since a low in January 2015. Nearly every day Bitcoin and other cryptos are making headlines. Some experts call them the new gold.But are Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies real investments or a speculator's game? And what about initial coin offerings, a hybrid of initial public offering and crowdfunding that has spawned Etherum and other projects? Even Wall Street is divided, so many experts warn Main Street investors to stay away or proceed with great caution.No less than Goldman Sachs (GS) is said to be considering a cryptocurrency trading operation, according to the Wall Street Journal. Yet JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said Dec. 8 he remains""highly skeptical"" of the cryptocurrency. Dimon in September called Bitcoin ""a fraud"" in September and said it would likely stay on the black market.Far from being safe for widows and orphans, like utilities, the Bitcoin market — which hit $150 billion in August — looks more like the 1840s gold rush. Many rushed in, but few got rich.On Nov. 12, Bitcoin fell to around $5,500, wiping out a rally on news that a plan to split the crypto currency was called off. It's bounced back since and was trading around $15,800 late Dec. 8.One risk is that governments likely will limit the currencies' use, such as barring them for tax payments, which would keep them out of the mainstream, according to UBS. China recently banned initial coin offerings and trading in cryptocurrencies, and it may not be the last government to act on concerns about giving up control over the flow of funds, the ability to monitor taxable gains or appearing vigilant in protecting investors.But many retailers are accepting Bitcoins as payment, including Microsoft, Target, Home Depot and Subway. And more uses are in the works.Only a handful of ETFs and other exchange traded products have significant exposure to Bitcoin or other cryptos. One is Grayscale's Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC). It's attracted $2.5 billion in assets and is up more than 1,250% this year.With a Bitcoin futures launch just around the corner, more vehicles could emerge soon. CBOE will start trading futures Dec. 10, followed by CME on Dec. 18. Earlier in the year, ETF provider VanEck's SEC filing to create a Bitcoin ETF was withdrawn because of a lack of futures.The surge in Bitcoin's value is a boon for Coinbase, an exchange where crytpocoins can be bought, sold and stored in wallets. Coinbase added more than 100,000 users Nov. 2 in a 24-hour period after CME Group announced its plans to introduce Bitcoin futures by the year's end, Bloomberg reported.In a picks-and-shovels move vs. actually holding Bitcoins, ETF provider Reality Shares in November filed to offer Reality Shares Nasdaq Blockchain Economy ETF, which would invest in companies that commit significant resources to blockchain technology, the Street.com reported. Blockchain is the technology behind Bitcoin and other cryptos. Also in November, Amplify ETFs also filed for Amplify Blockchain Leaders ETF and Horizons ETF Management filed for Horizons Blockchain Index.Bitcoin arrived on the scene in 2009. The digital currency is created and held electronically. Its value stems partly from the fact that it's decentralized; no single institution or government controls the network. It was developed based on a proposal from a software developer called Satoshi Nakamoto, according to CoinDesk, which tracks cryptocurrency prices and reports on events in the crypto space. Low transaction costs are another feature along with instantaneous transfers.Perhaps its biggest attraction is that its supply can't be increased or decreased at the whim of a controlling entity. Similar to gold and other precious metals, Bitcoins can be ""mined,"" but it's done by using computing power in a distributed network. And like gold, Bitcoin supply is limited. And it's headed toward terminal creation.Bitcoin rules state that only 21 million Bitcoins can ever be created, though the coins can be split into smaller parts. That could make Bitcoin, like gold, an attractive inflation hedge, backers say. There are 16.67 million Bitcoin in circulation now.On the other hand, the potential creation of new digital currencies creates ""the possibility of limitless supply of different cryptocurrencies,"" undermining the value of existing ones, UBS warned recently.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), an ETF that tracks the price of gold bullion, is up about 8% this year. That might look meager next to Bitcoin's surge. Hence, internet news searches for Bitcoin now outnumber those for gold.But cryptocurrencies have been volatile. On the way to its all-time high this year, Bitcoin plunged 28% from $2,682.59 on June 12 to $1,938.94. And it plummeted 35% from $4,950.72 on Sept. 1 to $3,336.41 on Sept. 14.Critics warn of a bubble. ""The relatively high volume of cryptocurrency turnover, against limited real-world use, suggests that many buyers are seeking speculative gain, never intending to use cryptocurrencies to make a real-world transaction,"" UBS analysts said in report quoted by CNBC.The blockchain software behind Bitcoin makes the digital currency a method of transferring value, but unlike at, say, a bank or real estate company. With blockchain, those expensive middlemen are no longer needed to ensure a transaction takes place as intended, a protection supplied by the blockchain software itself. The result: faster and cheaper transactions.And since blockchain and cryptocurrencies offer various layers of anonymity, they are seen as attractive to those living in countries where transfer of wealth is restricted. Detractors say cryptos also draw drug dealers, money launderers and tax dodgers along with legitimate investors.Coinbase is involved in a lawsuit in which it's trying to fend off IRS attempts to scan customer accounts for unreported taxable gains, Bloomberg reported.Those who want to own cryptocurrencies directly can go to exchanges to buy and trade them. Some of the largest are U.S.-based Coinsetter, Coinbase, Cryptsy, London-based Bitsamp and Bulgaria-based BTC-e.They'll need what the industry calls a wallet to store the private keys that give access to cryptos. Major exchanges offer soft, or hot, wallets for customers. Such wallets are available for desktop computers and mobile devices and include Bitcoin wallet, Mycelium, Xapo and Blockchain, according to Coindesk.Hard wallets in the form of flash-drive like devices bring an extra layer of security, by limiting exposure to the internet. They have to be plugged into a computer or phone before they can be spent. Three popular ones, according to Buybitcoinworldwide.com, are Ledger Nano S, KeepKey and Trezor. Just remember, don't lose it, forget your password or fail to back it up, or you might lose your cryptocurrency forever.While proponents extol the fraud-proof safety of blockchain technology, wallets have proved vulnerable. In the latest mishap, an estimated $280 million of Ethereum ether coins were locked up after a user accidentally deleted the code needed to access digital wallets hosted by Parity Technologies. The freeze affects all multisignature wallets created on Parity after July 20.Ethereum has jumped 5,628% this year from $8.03 on Dec. 31, 2016, and was at $459.99 Dec. 8. It surged as high as $464.99 early in the day.Meanwhile, the financial industry is moving ahead.In other moves by financial companies to bring Bitcoin to investors, on Sept. 6, CoinIRA, Goldco's digital currency unit, launched its new Digital IRA Bundles. The bundles, available in amounts of $25,000, $50,000 and $100,000, come prepackaged with digital currencies. Investors can choose from three portfolios based on their risk appetite: conservative, moderate or aggressive. The conservative bundle is made up of 50% Bitcoin, 41% Ethereum and 3% each in Ether classic, Litecoin and Ripple.Could exchange traded funds make digital cash more widely accessible?""A diversified ETF that has some exposure to cryptocurrencies will likely be somewhat less risky than direct investment,"" Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar, told IBD. ""But that's a bit like comparing the risks associated with juggling knives to those you'd face juggling chain saws.""Thus far no exchange traded funds trade on a major exchange like SPDR Gold Shares or iShares Gold Trust (IAU). Grayscale Investments' Bitcoin Investment Trust, which launched May 4, 2015, trades over the counter. Grayscale had filed for SEC approval to trade GBTC on NYSE Arca, but on Sept. 27 withdrew the application, remaining as a less-regulated investment trust.Morningstar Direct lists GBTC with its ETFs, but there doesn't appear to be an efficient arbitrage mechanism that keeps the price and NAV in balance. GBTC recently traded at a 44% premium to its holdings.GBTC shares fell as much as 54% from an Aug. 31 high but have rebounded to hit record highs and are up more than 1,500% this year. They started tumbling 20% Sept. 1 after short-seller Citron Research called GBTC the ""most dangerous way to own Bitcoin"" and said it should trade no higher than $550 a share.""Right now, many investors are using the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which is arguably even riskier than Bitcoin because it trades at high premiums, which means you could lose money even if Bitcoin doesn't go down,"" Eric Balchunas, ETF Analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, told IBD. ""In contrast, the ETF structure and its creation/redemption process would give investors the best possible chance to get A fair deal on investing in Bitcoin. ETFs have proved themselves in terms of being able to handle all kinds of non-equity holdings, such as bonds, physical gold and derivatives.""Potential ETFs under review by the Securities and Exchange Commission include Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, which the SEC rejected in March amid concerns including lack of liquidity and regulation. Officials are again reviewing the ETF candidate, a seemingly recurring process over the past three years.ETF provider ProShares on Sept. 27 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a ProShares Bitcoin ETF and ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF. Instead of owning the currency, both ETFs plan to track Bitcoin futures contracts.But the same day, VanEck withdrew its Aug. 11 application for VanEck Vectors Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which would have also invested in Bitcoin futures. According to VanEck's application withdrawal letter, the SEC's policy is to not review a registration statement until the underlying instruments (Bitcoin futures contracts) become available.Even Fidelity Investments is dipping its toes in the cryptocurrency field by teaming up with Coinbase. Fidelity's innovation unit on Aug. 9 said it will allow Fidelity customers to view their Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin balances in their Coinbase wallet accounts.Balchunas puts the odds at about 50/50 of a new ETF option in the next two years.""There have been two key developments since the SEC rejected it in March,"" he told IBD. ""One is the likelihood of a regulated Bitcoin futures and options markets, and the second is that the SEC's changing with the new administration, and its brand-new head of the division of investment management was a lawyer at the same firm that represented the Winklevoss twins' Bitcoin filing.""Still, caution is warranted.""In an ETF wrapper, volatility of Bitcoin could prove higher than alternative currency-based products and investors will need to be prepared,"" Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA's Director of ETF & Mutual Fund Research, told IBD. ""Interestingly, ARK Innovation (ARKK) and ARK Web X.0 (ARKW) provide exposure to Bitcoin, but have diversification to more traditional equity investments such as Amazon.com, Tesla and Twitter, dampening the risk.""ARK Investment Management, which runs six ETFs, offers exposure to Bitcoin and was the first ETF to own GTBC shares, which has helped boost the funds' performance.ARKK and ARKW were the top two sector ETFs based on their year-to-date returns through Dec. 7, according to Morningstar Direct, with respective gains of 83% and 80%.ARKK has attracted $295 million in assets since its October 2014 launch; ARKW has gathered $193 million since September 2014. Both funds bear a 0.75% expense ratio.Kinetics Internet (WWWFX) and Kinetics Market Opportunities (KMKNX) are among several Kinetics Mutual Funds that also own GBTC.Even as more options unfold for investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, investors should keep in mind potential risks.""If market prices retain any useful informational content, which theory suggests they do, then the 10x run-up in the crypto market capitalization over the last year signals there is something important taking place,"" ZenCash co-founder Rob Viglione said. ""Whether that something ends up being radically transformational, or simply a speculative delusion is yet to be seen.""This article was first published Nov. 13.RELATED:How To Invest In Stocks For Free With New Apps For BeginnersThe IPO Market's Hidden Gems: Can You Find The Next Google?Here's The Latest Bitcoin Rival That's About To Hit The MarketFidelity Starts Test To Let Customers See Their Holdings In Bitcoin, Other Digital CurrenciesMore Than Bitcoin: Blockchain's Links Reach JPMorgan, IBM, Wal-Mart

Together with Apple, the stocks account for a 19.2% weighting in the Nasdaq, according to IBD data. Trouble in these megacaps alone makes progress difficult for the Nasdaq.Apple was down 0.6%. Alphabet A shares fell 0.3%, while C shares fell 0.4%.Among the major indexes, the Nasdaq dropped 0.3% midday Tuesday, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively.

For more than two weeks, the stock has been bobbing near the 10-week line. The midcap company will report quarterly earnings Nov. 28 at 8 p.m. ET. The Street anticipates Q3 earnings will grow 52% to 97 cents a share.China Lodging's earnings growth for 2017 is expected to increase 56%. In 2018, analysts see a 37% increase.As of August, China Lodging had 3,500 hotels. The company pointed out in a presentation in August that disposable income in China is growing at an 8% pace despite the slowdown in GDP growth. The growth in income should help the hotel industry.Last year, China Lodging's pretax margin was 17%, the highest in at least nine years.Blue chips were mostly down midday Tuesday.

155,CME,"Volatility in the bond market is about to stage a comeback.At least that's what one trader is betting, judging by options-market activity signaling a conviction that Treasuries will either win big or fall hard in the next two weeks. The success of the wager, which involves an unusually large amount of money for an options strategy of this kind, isn't tied to the direction of yields. Rather, it depends on the return of the kind of turbulence that hasn't been seen in months.On Tuesday, someone ponied up almost $10 million to buy out-of-the-money put and call options simultaneously on 10-year Treasury futures, in what's known as a strangle, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and observations of trading levels. The position caught the market's attention because it involved block sizes of about 63,500, according to CME Group Inc. data. A strangle of that magnitude is rare, and possibly unprecedented, say rates traders familiar with the market.The strategy, which expires July 21, looked promising Wednesday, when Fed Chair Janet Yellen's testimony sent the 10-year yield down as much as six basis points. But the decline came to a halt after the Bank of Canada hiked rates as expected.Therein lies the challenge for this trade: Small swings won't cut it. Just to recoup the premium, the 10-year yield would have to rise or fall about 10 basis points from about 2.38%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Once it passes that point, there's no cap to the potential profit. For example, it stands to gain about $50 million on a quarter-point move in either direction from the starting level, which would involve approaching this year's highs and lows for 10-year yields.The calendar over the next several days presents ample opportunities to rekindle volatility. In the U.S., political drama aside, the Labor Department releases consumer price index data Friday, which could influence the Fed's timing for rate hikes and balance-sheet reduction. Retail sales data come out the same day. And, the day before the position expires, the European Central Bank announces a policy decision.An increase in volatility would be a departure from the trend of suppressed price swings this year. The 10-year yield has risen or dropped by more than 10 basis points just four times this year on a weekly basis, compared with 10 times in the same period of 2016.A measure of Treasuries volatility fell last month to levels that preceded the 2013 taper tantrum. The Merrill Lynch Option Volatility Estimate, or MOVE Index, derived from over-the-counter options on Treasuries maturing in two to 30 years, remains close to those lows.Open interest data released Wednesday confirm that there is new positioning in the options that form the strangle. The total volumes traded in the two options Tuesday exceeded the open interest change, signaling that the market maker who handled the trade may have hedged the risk on the position.
"
156,CME,"Fed: Wasn't it just a month or so ago that we were reassured by various and sundry Fed officials and their water-carriers in the media that the central bank was on an unavoidable path toward multiple interest-rate hikes over the next year? Well, maybe not so much.During her semiannual testimony to Congress on Wednesday, Fed Chair Janet Yellen was in full dove mode, suggesting that rates are near a ""neutral"" level and might not have to go much higher.""Because the neutral rate is currently quite low by historical standards, the federal funds rate would not have to rise all that much further to get to a neutral policy stance,"" Yellen said in her prepared remarks. But she also called the economy ""robust.""The fed funds rate, the bank's main policy instrument, is today at 1% to 1.25%, after a quarter-point hike last month, the third since last December. Many Fed-watchers had assumed there would be a rate hike in September, and maybe again in December, with two or three next year — part of the great unraveling of eight years of mistaken 0% interest-rate policy.Now, even one more rate hike this year is in some doubt. The CME Group's forecast tool, based on fed funds futures, gives a 49% chance that rates will be unchanged by the end of the year — versus a 50.9% chance of a rate hike of a quarter point or higher.So basically, it's a coin toss. In the eternal battle between Fed hawks and doves, it appears the doves are winning. But barely. And don't worry: The hawks will get their chance.Is that a bad thing? Well, we've said for a long time that the Fed is so far behind the curve on its rate hikes that instead of raising rates into a strong economy it now faces the possibility of raising rates in a weakening economy. Unfortunately, it's not at all clear that the Fed's policymakers really understand what's going on right now. And it has a history of making big mistakes at inopportune times.Take just one example: unemployment. The Fed's understanding of unemployment — a major part of its policymaking — seems incomplete, and that's being polite. We keep hearing that 4.4% unemployment is ""full employment."" In fact, the labor force participation rate of 62.8% is far below its level of 66% just before the financial crisis hit. Yellen marks that down to ""demographics,"" but that's just part of it.As Manhattan Institute Fellow and economist Diana Furchtgott-Roth writes in IBD, there are millions of jobs that go begging because employers can't find people with the skills to fill them. Indeed, the Fed's own Beige Book of economic conditions, just released, reports ""shortages of qualified workers"" in a large number of industries, ""which had limited hiring.""There are jobs out there. And there are millions of people on the sidelines who might like to work.If the labor force participation rate were merely back to its pre-financial crisis norm, there would be roughly 15 million more workers in the economy today. This explains why unemployment appears low, yet wage growth is slow. Low unemployment is a structural mirage, a result of millions leaving the workforce. That's not something the Fed controls with interest rates. Structural unemployment can only be addressed by tax and regulatory changes, not interest rate policy.Thus, the Fed's confusion. You can make a case that the job market is tight. Or you can make a case that it's historically very loose. Either one supports a very different interest rate policy.To avoid confusing us all with its schizophrenic policies, the Fed would do far better to have a steady rule as its guide, such as one of the many variants of the so-called Taylor Rule. That, at least, would create a far more transparent policy, one based on real-economy differences in current inflation vs. desired inflation, and GDP growth vs. potential GDP growth — and not one based on shifting subjective explanations of what's happening in the economy.Yellen has a very tough job. But no individual, or even small group of individuals, has enough knowledge and judgment to set interest rates. It only adds to confusion over monetary policy among households, businesses and financial markets. Sooner or later, the Fed has to stop making policy based on the economic intuition, political whims and monetary fictions, and move to something more predictable and transparent.RELATED:In Undoing One Epic Mistake, Is The Fed Making Another?Fed's Rate Hikes Are A Bullish Validation Of TrumponomicsIs America At Full Employment?

159,CME,"The stock market recovered after a soft start Thursday but was still in negative territory as Wall Street digested weaker-than-expected ADP private payroll data ahead of Friday's jobs report.The Nasdaq composite was down 0.5% after falling as much as 1.1% intraday; the S&P 500 gave back 0.4% and the Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.3%. Volume on the Nasdaq was tracking slightly higher than Wednesday's levels. NYSE volume was slightly lower.The so-called FANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL) — followed the Nasdaq's path, overcoming early weakness. Facebook and Netflix showed mild losses while Amazon and Alphabet edged higher.Generic drug makers and retail-related groups lagged, while metal ore, steel and foreign banks stocks outperformed.Investors sold bonds again Thursday, lifting the 10-year Treasury yield higher by 5 basis points to 2.38%. The bond market seems convinced about higher rates going forward, but traders of Fed Funds futures aren't so sure. The market currently thinks there's a 47% chance the Fed will hike rates one more time this year, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool.Benchmark crude oil added just over 2%, to $46.18 a barrel, after the Energy Information Administration reported a 6.3 million barrel drop in crude inventories, catching analysts by surprise. This echoed a report late Wednesday from the American Petroleum Institute that also showed an unexpectedly sharp decline in oil inventories.In M&A news, Home Shopping Network (HSNI) surged 27% on news it's being acquired by QVC Group (QVCA) for just over $2 billion. QVC reversed lower, falling less than 1%.In the stock market today, Costco (COST) outperformed, rising 0.6%, after the company reported a 6% rise in June same-store sales. But the stock is still damaged goods from a technical perspective after falling sharply on news of Amazon's plans to acquire Whole Foods Market (WFM). The thinking is that Costco's food business could suffer as a result of the merger.In the biotech space, Celgene (CELG) eased 1% to 131.59. The company announced a $413 million deal to acquire BeiGene (BGNE), giving it access to a key immuno-oncology treatment. Celgene is still in buy range from a 127.64 buy point.Inside the IBD 50, China names outperformed. Momo (MOMO), Autohome (ATHM), TAL Education (TAL) and NetEase (NTES) outperformed with gains of 1-2%.RELATED:Costco Sales Strong, But Amazon-Whole Foods Future LoomsFiber-Optic Stocks Rated Strong Buys; One Gets Big Price-Target Hike

160,CME,"The U.S. economy added 222,000 jobs in June, as the jobless rate ticked up to 4.4%, the Labor Department reported on Friday, the latest sign of renewed economic momentum.XAlong with an upward revision of 47,000 to April and May payrolls, it now looks like the apparent slowdown in hiring never happened. The average monthly job gain over the past three months is 194,000, after preliminary data last month showed payroll growth had slowed to a near five-year low of 121,000.Headline wage figures were tame, but key details suggest solid income gains.Although the jobless rate edged higher from June's 16-year low, as more people joined the workforce, the labor market momentum could add pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise rates again at its September meeting. The jobs data follow strong reports on manufacturing and the service sector from the Institute for Supply Management""The rebound in payrolls strongly supports (the Fed) view that the soft-looking spring data were 'transitory,'"" wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.""If payroll gains are sustained at anything like their June pace,"" Shepherdson says, the Fed has every reason to expect that the jobless rate will keep moving lower and wage pressures will finally pick up. He thinks the Fed may be forced to hike in September.For now, markets aren't buying it, with just 14% odds of a September hike, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool. Treasury yields, which have rallied strongly over the past week, oscillated up and down slightly after the jobs report. The sudden surge in recent days has had less to do with the Fed than the European Central Bank's readiness to begin scaling back its bond-buying program.The major averages recovered some lost ground on the stock market today, with the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index up 0.2% and the Nasdaq composite 0.5%. The S&P 500 is just above its 50-day moving average after closing below that key level on Thursday.The Labor Department said that the hard-hit retail sector added 8,100 jobs in June, after a string of monthly losses. Meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN) continues to hire apace, recently holding job fairs in Tacoma, Wash., Las Vegas, and Kansas City, Kan. Amazon also announced in April that it will hire 5,000 part-time customer-service reps to work out of their homes.McDonald's (MCD) recently said the fast-food chain and its franchisees will add 250,000 workers this summer — more than a year ago. McDonald's announced a partnership with Snap (SNAP) to recruit via its Snapchat social media site. Snap will connect users to an online application if they click on a McDonald's recruitment ad.The Institute for Supply Management service-sector and manufacturing surveys both pointed to strong employment gains in June. It's a different story for the auto industry, which has seen slumping car sales lately from Ford (F), General Motors (GM) and others. Ford and General Motors have both announced layoffs recently.Overall, the manufacturing sector added 1,000 jobs last month.IBD'S TAKE: IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" on Tuesday, June 27, a signal to investors to exercise extra caution in buying stocks and to take some money off the table to deploy when the turbulence subsides. Make sure to read IBD's The Big Picture each day to get the latest on the market trend and what it means for your investments.The one notable weak spot in the report was wage growth. Hourly average wages rose 0.2% on the month, below the 0.3% expected, putting the annual gain at a tepid 2.5%.Yet despite that dreary news on hourly pay, the report contained pretty good overall news about income growth. Factoring in hours worked and wage levels, average weekly pay rose 2.8% in June, matching the best total since July 2011. Aggregate pay, which also factors in employment growth, rose 4.5% from a year ago, tied for the best result since January 2016.One oddity from the report was a 35,000 rise in local government employment. That may have partly largely related to seasonal issues tied to the school calendar.The Fed still has two more jobs reports to sift through before the September 19-20 meeting. Small business hiring will be important to watch between now and then.  The Paychex/IHS Small Business Employment watch showed that hiring by small firms is now growing at the slowest pace since 2011 after a four-month deceleration. Meanwhile, the National Federation of Independent Business said its survey showed that the percentage of firms reducing employment overtook the share increasing payrolls in June.""Small business owners seem to be in a holding pattern while they wait to see what Congress will do with taxes and health care,"" said NFIB President and CEO Juanita Duggan.Of those looking to hire, 85% said they had trouble finding qualified workers.Over time, that tightness — full employment, as the Fed sees it — is expected to feed through to higher wage inflation, justifying less accommodative monetary policy.RELATED:Draghi Drama Undercuts Key Stock-Market SupportFed Hikes Rates, But Hawkish Tone Unnerves MarketsAmazon Announces Part-Time Hires As Retailers Shutter Stores

163,CME,"As the old saying goes, if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.Two dividend exchange traded funds are making a second attempt at a productive breakout.Global X SuperDividend US (DIV) cleared a 25.89 buy point of a flat base last week, then eased below the entry. On Monday, it advanced to close just shy of the buy point. The flat base formed just after completing a cup-with handle pattern.X The $17.2 billion fund, launched in March 2013, tracks the INDXX SuperDividend U.S. Low Volatility Index. As such, it invests in 50 of the biggest-yielding U.S. stocks. DIV offers an annualized yield of 6.4%, well ahead of the S&P 500's average payout of 1.9%.Utilities and real estate accounted for the two biggest sector weightings, at 25% and 24%, respectively. Consumer defensive and energy made up about 13% each, followed by consumer cyclicals at nearly 12%.Top holdings as of June 22 included H&R Block (HRB), Sturm Ruger (RGR), Armour Residential REIT (ARR) and Philip Morris International (PM), according to Morningstar Inc. All four have outperformed the market this year with gains of 25% or more through Monday's close.The fund has underperformed the S&P 500 through June 23, with a 6.7%-10% return. Its three-year average annual return of 2.5% is below the S&P 500's 9.8%. DIV carries an expense ratio of 0.39%.IShares Select Dividend (DVY) broke out past a 93.62 flat-base buy point June 13 before pulling back last week. On Monday, it closed pennies below the entry. The fund advanced 3% between each of the prior two flat bases and subsequent breakouts.The 13-year-old fund, which tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Dividend Index, has attracted $17.3 billion in assets. It has an annualized dividend yield of 3% and has a 0.39% expense ratio.Like DIV, DVY has a defensive tilt with utilities as its top sector weighting, at 30%. Consumer cyclicals made up nearly 18%, financial services 14% and industrials 11%. Consumer defensive names accounted for 10% of assets.Its top holdings included Lockheed Martin (LMT), CME Group (CME), McDonald's (MCD) and Philip Morris. DVY returned 6% this year through June 23. Its three-year average annual return of 9.9% is in line with the S&P 500 for the same period.Monday's ETF picks were slightly higher and remain in buy range: Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight (RSP) from a 92.63 entry and Schwab US Broad Market (SCHB) from a 58.26 buy point.RELATED:Which 2 Top ETFs Holding Amazon, Apple, Celgene Are In Buy Range?Beat The Market Twice With These 2 Leading Sector Plays

164,CME,"The Federal Reserve's hawkish policy tilt last week in the face of falling inflation and tame wage growth caught investors by surprise. Now the chief strategist at Bank of America and others on Wall Street are speculating that there's an ulterior motive: surging stock prices.X BofA's David Woo, who sees a range of data pointing to a loss of economic momentum, wondered in a research note why the Fed statement and outlook seemed to reflect a much different reality. ""Can it be the case that its hawkishness was prompted by something other than its reading of the economy?""Woo postulates that ""the Fed has become concerned about the recent surge in the equity market, especially tech stocks, that has been feeding off low interest rates and low volatility.""On Monday, tech investors seemed little concerned that high-priced stocks may be in the Fed's sights. Facebook (FB) rose 1.5%, Apple (AAPL) 2.9%, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) 1.7%, Netflix (NFLX) 0.7% and Amazon (AMZN) 0.8% on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Stocks started the week on a solid note, but overall the uptrend remained under pressure, as it has since big tech leaders swooned on June 9. That's a signal to exercise extra caution about buying stocks, cut losses quickly and take some profits to raise cash. Make sure to read IBD's The Big Picture each day to get the latest on the market trend.Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon rebounded in bullish fashion from their 50-day moving averages last week, while Apple is still below that key level. Netflix moved above its 50-day intraday Monday, but pulled back to close below that line.Eric Peters, chief investment officer at One River Asset Management, also puzzled over the Fed getting hawkish ""when they see no inflation.""""There's no red on the screens anywhere. All they ever see is green. Day after day. It's time to subdue Wall Street,"" said Peters' letter to shareholders.Yet Deutsche Bank economists take the Fed's avowed inflation concerns seriously, agreeing that there is a realistic possibility that the jobless rate, now at 4.3%, will sink well below 4% by the end of 2018, likely fueling ""a substantial increase in wage and price pressures.""The Fed's next move is expected to be a shift in its reinvestment policy, letting its portfolio shrink by up to $10 billion worth of mortgage and Treasury bonds each month, rather than continuing to reinvest principal as bonds mature.That will be a modest reversal of the Fed's quantitative easing, which was credited with inflating asset values in the wake of the financial crisis.""The sudden shift in focus on the balance sheet"" could, in part, reflect ""possible concern about the rise (in) asset prices,"" wrote Jefferies economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons after the release of the Fed's March meeting minutes telegraphed a likely change in reinvestment policy before the end of 2017.In its May meeting minutes, the Fed noted that ""asset valuation pressures in some markets were notable,"" though overall financial system vulnerabilities were ""moderate."" Minutes of last week's Fed meeting, to be released on July 5, could update that language.After last week's meeting, there is a big disconnect between the Fed's own policy outlook — with members expecting four quarter-point rate hikes by the end of 2018 — and Wall Street's expectation for just one hike through June 2018, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool.RELATED:Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet Are Flashing Potential Buy Signals Fed Hikes Rates, But Hawkish Tone Unnerves MarketsHow The Fed Surprised Markets Again, This Time Hitting Stocks   
"
165,CME,"The Federal Reserve surprised markets with its relatively hawkish outlook Wednesday after raising interest rates for the second time in 2017. Most Fed policymakers still expect another rate hike in 2017, and three more next year. The central bank also said it will start to normalize its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet by year-end, with the details suggesting a slightly faster run-off that some had expectedBefore the Fed announcement, market pricing implied no more rate hikes for another year, and stocks did not react well to Fed hawkishness.The Fed's decision followed the latest in a series of surprisingly tame inflation reports. The Labor Department reported earlier in the day that core consumer price inflation, stripping out volatile food and energy prices, fell to a two-year low 1.7%.After the Fed's policy statement, the weak-Nasdaq, strong-Dow trade resumed as Fed Chair Janet Yellen elaborated on the U.S. central bank's views.The Nasdaq fell 0.7% in late afternoon trade, while the S&P 500 fell 0.25%. But the Dow industrials turned up 0.2%, helped by rebounding banks.Expectations of a slower rate-hike trajectory hit Dow component JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and other bank stocks ahead of the Fed announcement. But JPMorgan and Bank of America erased nearly all their losses by the close, with several banks turning positive.Housing-related stocks were among the lead performers on the stock market today ahead of the news, thanks to the benign rate outlook. Homebuilder D.R. Horton (DRI) rose to a buy zone and hit an 11-year high, but pulled back somewhat as the markets soured.  Home Depot (HD), another Dow component, climbed 1.8%, rebounding from its 50-day line. Whirlpool (WHR) gained 1.4%.Fed policy expectations may continue to be volatile. On Tuesday, market participants were expecting the next rate hike by December. Before the announcement, they saw the Fed on hold until  next June. The 10-year Treasury hit the lowest level since the week of the November election and the 2-year yield saw its sharpest single-day drop since Brexit, but yields rebounded somewhat after the Fed statement.Even as the Fed has been on a tightening path, financial conditions have been easing, with the 10-year Treasury yield sinking about 50 basis points since mid-December.While economists still expect inflation to firm in the months ahead, their confidence in that outcome is waning after broad weakness in airline, apparel, auto and medical care costs.The Fed noted that inflation has been cooling, but Yellen said in her press conference that ebbing inflation appeared to be related to one-time changes, citing wireless data and prescription drug prices.""On a 12-month basis, inflation has declined recently and, like the measure excluding food and energy prices, is running somewhat below 2%,"" the Fed said in its statement. The Fed lowered its inflation forecast for 2017 but expects inflation to hit its 2% target over the medium term.Separately, the Fed detailed how it plans to reduce its balance sheet gradually. It'll let some expiring assets roll off the balance sheet, starting with $10 billion a month, or $6 billion from Treasuries and $4 billion from mortgage-backed securities.Jefferies economists characterized the telegraphed balance-sheet reductions as ""fairly aggressive"" compared to expectations.The caps will rise every three months by $6 billion for Treasuries and $4 billion for MBS until they reach $30 billion and $20 billion, respectively.Officials didn't reveal the exact timing of when the process will begin this year, as well as specifically how large the portfolio might be when finished.The CME Group FedWatch tool showed that markets now don't expect the next rate hike until March 2018. At that point, the Fed will likely have a new leader, with Fed Chair Janet Yellen's term ending in February.With job growth running ""well in excess"" of the trend growth in the labor force, Yellen said it's prudent to remove accommodation to avoid having to tighten too quickly later.RELATED:These Stunning Economic Reports Could Give Fed PauseBank Stocks Testing Key Levels Amid Fed, Weak DataThis Hot Sector Is Putting Stocks In Buy Range: Investing Action PlanHome Depot Finds Support In Buy Zone As Amazon Rattles Retailers

166,CME,"X U.S. stock indexes chalked up moderate gains midday Tuesday, as the Nasdaq found some solace from the same place it recently found pain — the quality mega-cap stocks.The Nasdaq trotted ahead 0.5%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average strolled to gains of 0.3% and 0.4% respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000 added 0.5%. Volume in the stock market today was sharply down as the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting got underway.The Street is expecting an interest rate hike Wednesday. The CME Group's FedWatch Tool pegs the odds of a quarter-point rate increase at 99.6%. The remaining 0.4% probability is for a half-point increase.Bulls have run into trouble in recent sessions, largely because of the action of the FANG stocks plus Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Since Thursday's small gains, these major players lost 6% to 10% before rebounding midday Tuesday.The FANG stocks include Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and the class A and class C stocks of Alphabet (GOOGL). Toss in Apple and Microsoft and those seven stocks account for about a third of the Nasdaq's weighting.So, the recent bout of selling among these seven heavyweight stocks may or may not say something about the market. The key question is where the money, raised by the selling, will go. Banks and financials are possibilities. So far this month, big percentage gainers among IBD's 197 industry groups include consumer loans, up 8%; banks Southwest, up 7%; investment banks, up 7%; superregional banks, up 6%; and money centers, up 6%.Among the superregionals, Dallas-headquartered Comerica (CMA) broke out at Tuesday's open, clearing a 73.51 buy point in more than twice its usual volume. The Street expects Comerica's earnings to jump 45% this year, which would be the best in six years.Other decent gainers include the Trump infrastructure plays: steel, up 6%; and cement, up 5%.Surprisingly, the lowly rated apparel-makers are up 7% this month. Within that group, March initial public offering Canada Goose (GOOS) is up 21% in June. The IPO is a wild mover, and earnings have been erratic. In fiscal 2014 ended in March, the small-cap company lost a penny a share. Then Canada Goose earned 93 cents a share in fiscal 2015, and $1.15 a share and 94 cents a share in fiscal 2016-17. The Street expects a drop to 37 cents a share this fiscal year.The chip sector, which has been among the uptrend's leaders, has fallen 1% to 2% in June.Another possibility for the money flow is that it will go back into the FANG and mega-cap stocks. Sometimes after some funds lighten up, other funds step in to increase their exposure.RELATED:Which Stocks Will Bolt Higher When The Market Improves?5 Bank Stocks Near Buy Points

But that legislation faces a tougher test in the Senate.Friday's market was building on the previous session's strength in the bank and financial sectors. Those two sectors have been laggards in recent months. Chips did well Thursday, but an early rally Friday fizzled.The Philadelphia semiconductor index, known as the SOX, climbed 1.8% Thursday and added 0.9% early Friday before tumbling 1.9% in midday trade. The sector slid as top chip company Nvidia (NVDA) made a bearish reversal after short seller Citron Research said the stock will fall to 130.The Powershares KBW Bank (KBWB) exchange-traded fund hustled 1.7% higher Thursday as it retook its 50-day line. Midday Friday the bank ETF was up 2%. The ETF is working on a 12% deep flat base, but the pattern looks somewhat like a double-bottom base. A fair number of bank stocks are showing similar action.Citigroup (C) broke out of a flat base Thursday with a 2% gain and added another 2% midday Friday. The stock remains in its 5% buy zone. Citigroup reported Q1 results in April, growing earnings 23%, the best in five quarters and almost 10% above the Street's estimate.Four stocks in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average notched gains of 1% or more. They were Caterpillar (CAT), which is extended from an April breakout; Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which are both trying to retake declining 50-day lines; and Pfizer (PFE), which is attempting to halt a 9% decline that began in early March.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, banks and financials claimed 10 of the day's top 20 up moves. Construction and machinery stocks grabbed two of the remaining positions. On the negative side, gold miners took the hardest hit.Economic news was thin Friday. The market is waiting for the 1 p.m. ET release of the Baker-Hughes weekly rig count.In the coming week, the Federal Reserve will meet Tuesday and Wednesday. The CME Group FedWatch Tool pegs the likelihood of an interest rate hike to the 1% to 1.25% range at 99.6%. The remaining 0.4% see a bigger increase to the 1.25% to 1.50% range. The expected rate hike could be another item behind the recent strength in bank stocks.RELATED:CBOE Volatility Index Hits Lowest Since 1993: Why You Should WorryStarbucks' Bullish Plans For China5 Ways To Get Ready For The Stock Market's Next Turn

169,CME,"Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren called for interest rate hikes at every other meeting in 2017 to keep the economy from overheating. But that made little impression on financial markets, with the Dow Jones industrial average, bank stocks, Treasury yields and even odds for rate increases at upcoming meetings all modestly lower in afternoon trading Wednesday.The Fed raised interest rates on March 15 by a quarter-point, to 0.75%-1%, as expected. But at that time policymakers signaled that they still planned to hike rates a total of three times in 2017, despite speculation that they might step up the pace.Rosengren, who has turned more hawkish in the past year, suggested that he's ready to tighten at a faster clip, with a total of four hikes in 2017.""My own view is that an increase at every other FOMC meeting over the course of this year could and should be the committee's default,"" Rosengren said in a Wednesday speech.San Francisco Fed President John Williams, who helped convince markets that a March hike was likely, was less decisive Wednesday, saying that he ""would not rule out more than three increases total for this year.""But financial markets largely shrugged of Rosengren's comments. Without confirmation from Fed chief Janet Yellen or other key officials, investors likely don't see his statement signaling a shift by the central bank.

180,CME,"The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey index out Wednesday rose to 57.7 in February as factory activity accelerated for the sixth straight month. That's the best reading since August 2014, giving the Federal Reserve more reasons to raise rates this month.Wall Street economists expected the ISM gauge to rise to 56.2 from 56.0 in January. Readings above 50 signal expansion, while those south of 50 suggest contraction.The new orders index jumped to 65.1 from 60.4, while the current production gauge hit 62.9, up from 61.4. The only somewhat soft spot was employment, which still expanded, but at a slower rate, slipping to 54.2 from 56.1.The steady improvement in the manufacturing sector is part of the solidifying economic backdrop that could lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again on March 15. Markets were pricing in 69% odds of a March hike on early Wednesday, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool. The odds doubled to 62% on Tuesday after two Fed policymakers gave a strong signal that they backed a near-term rate increased.The Dow Jones industrial average soared above 21,000 for the first time, with the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 also hitting record highs following President Trump's speech and speculation of a Fed rate hike.Banks, which stand to benefit from the steeper yield curve that generally comes with higher rates, were among the big winners on the stock market today. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), both Dow components, climbed 2.8% and 2.4%, respectively. Bank of America (BAC) rose 3.1% and Wells Fargo (WFC) 2.9%. Bank of America hit its best levels since late 2008, while JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo set all-time highs.The strength comes despite concerns that the auto sector, which had provided a big boost in manufacturing output in recent years, is now seen as a potential drag, amid a potential peaking of sales and rising inventory levels.Early reports of U.S. auto sales in February, which will released throughout the day on Wednesday, were generally positive. Ford Motor[ticker symb=F] set a record for SUV deliveries, though overall sales slipped 4%, just below Edmunds estimates. General Motors (GM) reported higher U.S. sales, though they fell short of Edmunds views. Ford shares edged up 1.4% intraday while General Motors climbed 2%.In other economic news, the PCE deflator, the Fed's favorite inflation gauge, showed a 1.9% yearly gain in January, the highest since 2012 and close to the central bank's 2% target. The core PCE reported 1.7% inflation. But the same report also found inflation-adjusted consumer spending falling by the most since 2009.RELATED:

181,CME,"President Trump's planned rollback of financial rules could undermine years of trans-Atlantic negotiations and threaten U.S. firms' access to European Union capital markets, according to the bloc's financial-services policy chief.Valdis Dombrovskis, a vice president of the European Commission, said on Tuesday that the EU would look at the ""practical outcomes"" of Trump's review of financial rules. If major changes are made, that would force the bloc to reassess the strength of U.S. market oversight and possibly reconsider so-called equivalence decisions that grant privileged market access.Companies like Chicago-based CME Group (CME), one of the world's largest clearinghouses for derivatives, rely on such equivalence determinations to conduct business with clients in Europe.""Decisions on equivalence are based on the assumption that rules in a third-country jurisdiction are achieving the same regulatory or supervisory outcomes as EU rules,"" Dombrovskis told lawmakers in Brussels. ""If this changes, it also makes us look anew at our equivalence decisions.""The comments are one of the strongest signs that Trump's deregulatory push could have global implications and throw into question efforts since the 2008 crisis to coordinate market oversight around the world. Regulators have spent most of the last decade imposing tougher rules on banks, attempting to limit the potential for firms to exploit differences between jurisdictions.Regulators have also struggled to align rules, however, taking years in some cases to agree on the strength of each other's rules. It took about four years of difficult negotiations for the EU and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to come to an agreement on equivalence between their clearinghouse regulations for derivatives.The EU and the Securities and Exchange Commission are still negotiating a separate equivalence decision for clearinghouses for stock options and other securities. EU banks' trades at such clearinghouses would be hit with billions of dollars in additional costs unless the matter is resolved.Europe's equivalence decisions affect a wide array of business, including accounting standards, credit ratings, price benchmarks and even the logging industry. The commission is in the process of debating its process for granting equivalence determinations, which have taken on new importance also since Britain's vote to leave the EU last year.Since Trump's inauguration, senior European regulators have cautioned the U.S. against easing regulations on the industry. Dombrovskis has joined European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and Bank of England Prudential Regulation Authority head Sam Woods this month in sounding alarm bells about such moves.""The last thing we need at this point in time is a relaxation in regulation,"" Draghi said on Feb. 6. ""Frankly I don't see any reason to relax the present regulatory stance which has produced a stronger banking and financial services industry than before the crisis.""Erste Group Bank AG Chief Executive Officer Andreas Treichl said he expects U.S. and EU banking regulation to diverge under Trump.""I don't think Trump will fail; I believe that if he goes on like this, he will prevail"" in rolling back financial regulation, Treichl said in Vienna on Tuesday. ""I also believe that the EU won't be moved by this until the consequences are so dramatic that they have no choice but to react.""

183,CME,"The U.S. economy added a stronger-than-expected 227,000 jobs in January as the jobless rate ticked up to 4.8%, the Labor Department reported.Economists expected to see a nonfarm payroll gain of 175,000 and 4.7% unemployment.November and December job gains were revised down a combined 39,000.Average hourly wages rose just 0.1%, trailing expectations of a 0.3% rise. Annual wage growth slowed to 2.5%, down from December's 2.8%, signaling no acceleration in wage pressures.Ten-year Treasury yields fell to 2.44%, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.65% in morning trade, back above the 20,000 level again. The Nasdaq climbed 0.3, despite Amazon (AMZN), which late Thursday reported fourth-quarter sales that trailed estimates. Amazon shares fell more than 3% in Friday trading on the stock market today, undercutting a recent buy point.Amazon said last month that it would create 100,000 full-time jobs in the next 18 months, while Wal-Mart (WMT) said it would add 34,000 jobs in the U.S.The retail sector added 45,900 jobs in January despite Macy's (M) and Sears (SHLD) announcing store closings after a blue holiday season as customers went online, not to malls.IBD'S TAKE: As the Trump rally hits a bit of turbulence, check out IBD Leaderboard to find which leading stocks are holding up, which are nearing a buy point, and which are signaling that it may be time to take profits.  The Federal Reserve signaled patience on Wednesday, noting that while confidence measures have surged since the election, business investment and other data haven't showed clear signs of an acceleration. Friday's strong job gains but weak wage growth may not change the picture much.After the report, markets were pricing in just 9% odds of a rate hike in March, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool. But markets still expect quarter-point hikes in June and December.The retail job gains may have been inflated by seasonal distortions. Nonstore retailers like Amazon added a seasonally adjusted 1,500 jobs, while clothing stores boosted employment by 18,000, a seven-year high.Elsewhere, professional and business services firms added 39,000 jobs; the construction sector 36,000; finance 32,000; food service and drinking places 30,000; health care 18,000; and manufacturing 5,000. Government employment fell by 10,000.While the industry jobs and wage gains come from the establishment survey, the monthly Census survey of households generates the unemployment rate. The slight rise in joblessness mostly reflected a drop of 660,000 in the estimated size of the population. Based on a smaller population, the employment-to-population ratio rose to 59.9% from 59.7%, matching the highest level since early 2009.In other economic news, ISM's January nonmanufacturing index came in at 56.5, just below December's 56.6, which matched the highest since October 2015. December factory orders climbed 1.3%, the Commerce Department said. Both reports were released at 10 a.m. ET.RELATED:Fed Is In No Rush To Hike With Eyes On Trump AgendaU.S. Manufacturing Gears Up As 'America First' Trump Takes Office

186,CME,"For the second time in 10 years, the Fed is poised to deliver an upward move in its target interest rate this week. The probability of a rate hike on Dec. 14 has risen to over 97%, according to much-watched CME Fed Funds futures.Consistent U.S. employment growth, coupled with improved housing figures, solid retail sales, rising consumer confidence and increased industrial production, have led Fed officials to prep markets for this long-awaited change.The positive data has fallen within the context of persistent anemic GDP growth, suppressed business investment/capital spending, and weak bank lending. Critical global events — Greek default, Chinese economic stress, emerging market weakness, commodity decline, Brexit, and the U.S. presidential election — had provided markets and central bankers reason to be cautious in 2016.Nevertheless, optimism over a lower regulatory burden and the tax stimulus expected under a Trump presidency has buoyed equity markets. The Fed clearly has the green light for a modest move, possibly more.What's important now is the likely pace of Fed action given economic data that might trigger them to proceed more, or less, aggressively. With so much interest in the Fed's thinking, three measures stand out as being critical:The output gap:  The difference between what the U.S. could potentially produce and what it is currently producing, the so-called output gap, has kept a lid on inflation pressures.The Fed's calculation of capacity utilization stands at 75.3%, significantly higher than the 66.7% that it hit in 2009, but still below the average of the past 45 years, 80%. The gap has, arguably for years, allowed the Fed to delay rate hikes without fear of inflation.The labor force participation rate, moreover, an important component of potential output, is just 62.7%, well below the 66% prior to the recession and the 67% peak hit in the late 90s/early 2000s. Productivity of U.S. workers, another major component of potential output, has also slowed during the past decade.While there are demographic reasons likely contributing to the decline in participation, Chair Janet Yellen has stated that she believes a stable labor force participation rate will be a sign that the economy is absorbing people discouraged from work. After citing ""underutilization"" in their statements for months, the Fed dropped the reference in March 2016 in favor of pointing to strong labor market growth, a sign that they believe the measure has narrowed.Further decline of the output gap in the U.S., a modest increase in labor participation and improvements in productivity would signal that the Fed needs to adopt a more aggressive posture.'Velocity' of money: Economists recite the old English proverb: ""You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink.""  If inflation is too much money chasing too few goods, then we won't have it without more money moving through the economy, which will require more lending by banks. After a steep recession, money velocity can dip as people pay down debts. It is expected to rise again as the economy moves into the later stages of recovery.The velocity of money, by its broadest measure Money with Zero Maturity (MZM), is maintaining all-time lows after years of this recovery, despite the Fed growing the monetary base in a massive way since 2009. After a minor increase following the recession, MZM velocity has declined for the past five years.The proverbial horse has been standing at the water's edge for years now, yet there's been little drinking. There are few signs that too much money is chasing too few goods: Banks are not lending out their rebuilt reserves and businesses are not spending or investing. A modest increase in velocity would signal a more normal economic expansion and compel the Fed to move more aggressively.Inflation expectations: While we hear quite a bit about the Fed's inflation target of 2%, and how we are not there yet, it is inflation expectations that often concern policymakers most. Keeping inflation expectations in check is a key barometer of whether the Fed is maintaining its credibility as an inflation fighter — whether markets believe the Fed will act prudently to maintain price stability. It is that credibility, in fact, that is the true currency of a central bank.Since Chairman Paul Volker broke inflation in the early 80s, the Fed has maintained credibility, and inflation expectations have come down dramatically, from over 6% to around 2% today.The economy can and often does experience temporary price rises, but if people believe these higher prices will not last, if their expectations are anchored, prices will eventually follow a more normal progression and avoid real economic harm. With inflation expectations anchored the way they appear to be today, the economy can continue to grow steadily.The five-year figure for inflation expectations is 2.07%, still anchored but up significantly from a July reading of 1.41. We can be sure the Fed has recognized the recent rise in this measure and it will lead to the Fed maintaining a more aggressive posture should it persist.There is a whiff of change in the air, particularly following the U.S. presidential election, and the optimism reflected in markets is sure to alter the Fed's considerations. A keen eye on these three measures — the presence or lack of presence of an output gap, the velocity of money, and inflation expectations — are likely to provide the clues to the pace at which the central bank will move in the months and years ahead.

188,CME,"U.S. stock indexes booked solid gains Wednesday afternoon, but biomed stocks dived on President-elect Donald Trump's vow to bring down drug prices.The Nasdaq advanced 0.7%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1% and 1.4%, respectively. The small cap Russell 2000 rose 0.5%. Volume in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges.Medical stocks struggled after Trump said in a Time Magazine interview that he doesn't like ""what's happened with drug prices"" and would bring down prices. Trump made no mention of investment in research and development, which is never free. Companies such as Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) put 40% of revenue into research and development, while Big Cap 20 stock Incyte (INCY) put 63% of revenue into R&D last year. Without strong growth in revenue and profits, R&D budgets would shrink, and the odds of developing new drugs would also fade.High-end biomeds, which rely the most on R&D, led the retreat Wednesday with the group down about 4%.Meanwhile, for the rest of the market it was business as usual.Bank stocks, which have led the Trump rally, were little changed. The exchange-traded fund PowerShares KBW Bank (KBWB) inched up 0.7% to 47.05. The bank ETF has gained about 21% since its Election Day close.Steel has been another area of strength in the stock market and that continued Wednesday afternoon. Gainers among steel producers included United States Steel (X), up 5.4%; AK Steel (AKS), up 3.7%; and Nucor (NUE), up 1.7%. Steel alloy stocks also showed strength. Carpenter Technology (CRS) popped 4.5% as it retook its 50-day line. Allegheny Technologies (ATI) rose 1% as it tried to clear a base.In economic news, the Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey was little changed in October. Layoffs slipped, but so did the rate of hiring. The job openings gauge is one that Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen watches closely.

The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1%. Volume in the stock market today was running lower on the NYSE and higher on the Nasdaq.Yellen's term runs through January 2018. President-elect Donald Trump has talked both ways on Yellen. In May, he said he had ""great respect"" for Yellen. In September, he said Yellen is ""very political"" and ""she should be ashamed of herself.""Meanwhile, CME Group's FedWatch Tool pegs the chance for a December rate hike at 90.6%, unchanged from the previous day.Banks are expected to benefit from higher rates, and the bank stocks continued to show strength Thursday. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index popped 1.6%. PowerShares KBW Bank Portfolio (KBWB), the exchange-traded fund that tracks the index, has risen almost 14% since the market's Election Day close. The ETF has 24 bank stocks in its portfolio with Bank of America (BAC) its biggest holding at 8.4%.In the S&P 500, Best Buy (BBY) was the day's best performer, up 11% in huge volume.

191,CME,"Bears swatted the U.S. stock indexes lower midday Thursday with the catalysts open to question.The Nasdaq lopped off 0.7%, gaining back some ground after being down as much as 1.3%, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average matched that loss. The lone gainer was the Dow Jones utility average, up 1.3% in the stock market today.Volume rose on both exchanges vs. the same time on Wednesday, keeping to a recent trend of increasing on downward price action, which is a bearish pattern.What was driving the indexes lower? Some analysts pointed to weak data from China. Others said the likelihood of an interest-rate hike from the Federal Reserve continues to make the market uneasy.China's September exports fell 10% from the year-ago level, far weaker than the 3% drop expected. U.S. Steel (X) gapped down 6%, while specialty steel firm Carpenter Technology (CRS) gapped down 3%. Apart from the China factor, steel prices have dropped, putting additional pressure on steel firms.Meanwhile, a rate hike is looking more certain. CME Group's FedWatch Tool puts the chance of a rate hike by December at about 70%, up from 67% earlier in the week..IBD'S TAKE: Here is a savvy Way To Play Interest Rates, and it's not about investing in banks.Another factor that could be roiling the markets is the U.S. presidential election. A study by Sam Stovall of S&P Global Market Intelligence shows that the party that currently controls the White House wins if the S&P 500 rises from the end of July to the end of October. Right now, the gauge is down about 2.5%, which would suggest challenger Donald Trump will win. But this gauge has roughly two more weeks to run before it gives a conclusive reading. The accuracy of the gauge going back to 1944 is 86%.The years when the election indicator didn't work tended to be years when a strong third party was in the mix. This year the Libertarians and the Greens are threatening to pull amounts that could be pivotal on a state-by-state basis.Blue chips were mostly down. Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) was one of the few exceptions, up 1.4% in brisk volume.

192,CME,"Financial markets are beginning to believe the Federal Reserve.That's the simplest explanation for the tumble that major stock indexes took on Tuesday, which saw the 10-year Treasury yield rise to a four-month high and the U.S. dollar index hit its highest level in seven months.While the U.S. central bank's key overnight lending rate is barely above zero and policymakers have repeatedly reined in their intentions for further hikes, markets have taken each Fed pronouncement with a grain of salt. Whether investors doubted the Fed's resolve or its economic forecast, markets have been pricing in an even lower-rate future than the Fed has telegraphed. No longer — at least not to a significant extent.When the Fed's rate committee last met on Sept. 21, members' projections pointed to a hike in December and two rate hikes in 2017. Yet markets, while on board with the December hike, persisted in pricing in less than a 33% chance of a subsequent hike before the fourth quarter of 2017.But over the past seven trading sessions, which have seen the 10-year Treasury yield rise from 1.56% to 1.76%, investors have gotten with the Fed's program, so to speak. Now, markets are pricing in roughly a 46% chance of a rate hike in September 2017 (following an earlier hike this December), the CME Group's FedWatch tool shows.Here's why this is causing a simultaneous re-pricing of stocks in the short term:While the uptick in government bond yields might make stocks modestly less attractive on a relative basis, the bigger issue is likely the rise in the dollar against other major currencies as investors see the Fed tightening and other major central banks easing. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback vs. a basket of major currencies, jumped to 97.7 on Tuesday, the highest since March 10, from 96.9 on Monday.That's a negative for the earnings of U.S. multinationals which get a sizable share of their sales and earnings in foreign currencies, such as Pfizer (PFE), Boeing (BA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL).Further, while other countries may be helped by weaker currencies, including eurozone nations and the U.K., economists believe the overall effect of a stronger dollar dampens global growth. That's especially true of emerging markets, which have high levels of dollar-denominated debt that becomes harder to service as the dollar rises.The surprise, if there is one, is that the rise in Treasury yields has come after a September jobs report showed a smaller-than-expected 156,000 gain. The explanation is that Fed policymakers think the U.S. has already reached full employment and that the economy only needs to create perhaps 100,000 jobs a month to keep the jobless rate steady.IBD'S TAKE: How can you tell if a jobs report is too hot, too cold or just right? Markets may react negatively or positively on the day of the report, but the key for investors is to stay abreast of the market's prevailing trend. Visit IBD University for a primer on how to time the stock market and read The Big Picture column every day.The good news is that the markets have come most of the way in adjusting to the Fed's timetable. Yet, the Fed has been pretty unreliable in its predictions, so markets may still need to adjust — one way or another — if policymakers turn out to be too optimistic or pessimistic when it comes to growth, inflation and the job market.RELATED:Divided Fed Holds Off On Rate Hike, Sees Slower Tightening PathU.S. Added So-So 156,000 Jobs In September, Won't Change Fed Dollar Dive On Fed Boosts Outlook For Exports, Corporate Profits

194,CME,"Wall Street economists expect Friday's employment report to show that the economy added 190,000 jobs in September and the jobless rate held steady at 4.9%.August's 151,000 job gain was a step back from this year's monthly average growth of 181,500. Yet, because of the implications for Federal Reserve policy, markets are more nervous about an upside surprise than another subpar result.Treasury yields have been on the rise this week, with the 10-year yield rising close to a four-month high on Wednesday amid stronger ISM reports on manufacturing and nonmanufacturing. As inflation creeps closer to the Fed's 2% target, the risk is that stronger-than-expected job growth and wage gains will lead markets to price in a somewhat faster pace of rate hikes in 2017.On the other hand, even a weak jobs report is unlikely to shift the Federal Reserve's December timetable for hiking its key interest rate.There are two reasons a December hike is pretty much a done deal. First, as Dan North, chief economist at trade credit insurer Euler Hermes North America, puts it: ""The Fed has painted itself into a corner, just like last year.""Projections by 13 of 17 participants at the Fed's September 2015 meeting pointed to a rate hike before year end, and they followed through in December, even as the economy was slowing to first gear, as subsequent data confirmed.At the latest meeting, North notes that 14 of 17 participants saw a rate hike by year end. ""Anybody smell any paint?""As of now, markets see about a 60% chance of a hike in December, but just a 40% chance of a subsequent hike before the fourth quarter of 2017, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.The second reason that a weak jobs report won't shift Fed policy helps explain the first: Most Fed policymakers already think the U.S. is close to full employment — the point at which job gains only need to match the net additions to the workforce, or else wage and inflation pressures will intensify.IBD'S TAKE: How can you tell if a jobs report is too hot, too cold, or just right? Markets may react negatively or positively on the day of the report, but the key for investors is to stay abreast of the market's prevailing trend. Visit IBD University for a primer on how to time the stock market and read The Big Picture column every day.John Williams, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve, laid out that case in August: ""The current pace of job gains is well above what we need, which I put to be somewhere around 80,000 a month, although estimates range from 50,000 to around 100,000.""Williams added: ""We should expect the pace of job gains to slow, and no one should be alarmed when it does.""With two more jobs reports after this one before the Fed meets Dec. 13 and 14, North figures it would take three weak reports to derail a year-end hike.RELATED:Divided Fed Holds Off On Rate Hike, Sees Slower Tightening PathThe August Jobs Report Was The Weakest Since 2010

195,CME,"Oil climbed above $50 a barrel in New York for the first time since June as declines in U.S. crude inventories and OPEC's pledge to reduce supply lifted hopes the global glut may clear.Futures increased 1.2%. U.S. crude stockpiles shrank below 500 million barrels last week for the first time since January, government data show. OPEC pledged in Algiers on Sept. 28 to reduce the group's output to 32.5 million to 33 million barrels a day in a bid to shrink the world's bloated oil supplies and boost prices.The market is set to remain oversupplied in 2017 and prices will stall at $55 a barrel as shale drillers get back to work, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s Head of Commodities Research Jeff Currie said.""The main issue is the big decline in North American storage,"" said Tim Pickering, founder and chief investment officer of Auspice Capital Advisors Ltd. in Calgary. ""The OPEC agreement is just spin to help support the market.""Oil has advanced 13% since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to the first production cut in eight years. Some analysts have expressed doubt that individual output quotas — to be determined at a meeting of the group in Vienna on Nov. 30 — will be sufficient to erode the market surplus as several countries boost production to restore disrupted supplies.West Texas Intermediate for November delivery rose 61 cents to $50.44 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It's the highest close since June 9. Total volume traded was 14% above the 100-day average at 2:48 p.m.Open interest in WTI, or the number of contracts outstanding, rose to 1.91 million as of Wednesday, the most in three years, according to CME Group Inc. data compiled by Bloomberg.Brent for December settlement rose 65 cents, or 1.3%, to $52.51 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It's the highest close since June 8.

196,CME,"Brexit is back in the news, but this time it's weighing on gold prices and gold mining stocks. The difference: Unlike in June, there's no real panic, just a vague sense of foreboding, but nothing bad enough to keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates.December gold closed down 3.3% to $1,269.70 an ounce on Tuesday, the biggest one-day decline since December 2013. It was the sixth straight losing session as gold undercut a key technical level.Gold price moves have a big impact on the profitability of gold miners, which tumbled on the stock market today. Royal Gold (RGLD) fell more than 9% to close at 68.64 Tuesday, hitting its lowest level since June 29. Newmont Mining (NEM) shares plunged 10.1% to 34.25, the lowest since June 22 — the day before the U.K. voted to leave the European Union.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), one of the most popular gold ETFs, fell 3.5% to 120.97, its lowest level since June 23.A stronger dollar and tighter Fed also can be a negative for emerging markets and industrial metals. Shares of diversified miners BHP Billiton (BHP) and Rio Tinto (RIO) fell modestly. BHP fell 0.6% to 34.65, still extended from a recent buy range. Rio Tinto sank 1.4% to 33.10 after briefly rising above a 33.87 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: The industrial metals sector finally hit bottom early this year after years of falling commodity prices due to overcapacity and the slowdown in China. Here's how the mining industry has been restructuring. Keep an eye on Rio Tinto, which is near a buy point. For a primer on timing stock purchases, visit IBD University.The sense of panic after the U.K. Brexit vote initially sent gold prices surging 8% to a two-year high of $1,366 on July 6. That panic quickly dissipated as Britain's economy showed little immediate evidence of trouble.But British Prime Minister Theresa May has committed to officially launch the two-year process for exiting the EU by the end of March and has reportedly signaled a ""hard Brexit."" Now markets are beginning to brace for somewhat negative economic news coming out of Europe.Incremental economic weakness in Europe is bound to keep the Bank of England, European Central Bank and Bank of Japan on a course of easier policy even as the Fed gets set to tighten, albeit at a snail's pace.That central bank divergence is a recipe for a stronger dollar. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of developed market currencies rose 0.5% on Tuesday to 96.14, hitting its highest level since early August. Meanwhile, the British pound fell to $1.27, its lowest level since 1985, down from $1.48 before the Brexit vote.On Tuesday, markets were still pricing in 63% odds of a quarter-point rate hike at the Fed's Dec. 14 meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.A stronger dollar tends to make gold less essential as a store of value — at least in the absence of a global panic. Despite the higher dollar, which is a negative for the dollar-based earnings of U.S. multinationals, major stock indexes were mixed in early afternoon trade on Tuesday, meaning that most investors are taking the latest Brexit news in stride for now.RELATED:Do Gold And Silver Have Anything Left In The Tank?Easy Fed Policy Gives Boost To Gold Stocks, Mining GiantsSmall Caps And Tech Funds Set Records As Investors Cheer A Dovish Fed

197,CME,"Federal Reserve policymakers and financial markets are on the same page when it comes to the next three meetings. The real question is what happens after that, and the Fed on Wednesday is unlikely to be able to assuage concerns about the pace of future rate hikes following recent data pointing to slowing growth and rising inflation.If that combination were to persist, which is no sure thing, a diet of gradual Fed rate hikes could be unappetizing to markets and perhaps harder for the economy to digest. Yet the rise in the 10-year Treasury yield in recent weeks, even amid a string of disappointing data, suggests investors are increasingly on guard for this scenario.Still, with no action expected from the Fed on Wednesday, the Bank of Japan's policy decision hours before the U.S. central bank issues its statement may grab investors' attention. Japan's central bank is expected to take more aggressive action to revive growth and inflation after its surprise move to adopt negative interest rates in early 2016 fell flat.Chances for a Fed interest-rate hike on Wednesday are between slim and none. Likewise, economists see virtually no chance at all for a hike on Nov. 2, days before the presidential election. Though Fed policymakers would never say so, they may be as concerned about the economic reaction to a Donald Trump victory as they were about a U.K. vote to leave the European Union, though those latter concerns seem to have been overwrought at this snapshot in time.As for December, markets are pricing in a 55% chance of a rate hike. After that, markets see only about a 25% chance of an additional rate hike before September 2017, the CME Group FedWatch tool shows.Yet, even as data-dependent Fed policymakers acknowledge a high degree of uncertainty about the outlook for growth and inflation, the tilt of their comments over the past month has pointed toward a path of rate hikes that is somewhat less gradual than markets anticipate.IBD'S TAKE: Hawkish Fed policymakers have been able to point to tightening labor markets. But the mostly timely job health gauge just took a wrong turn.Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said in her Aug. 26 speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo., that the U.S. economy is ""now nearing the Federal Reserve's statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability,"" setting the stage for a near-term rate hike.In a Sept. 9 speech, the generally dovish Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, signaled concern about the economy overheating: ""A failure to continue on the path of gradual removal of accommodation could shorten, rather than lengthen, the duration of this recovery.""Incoming economic data have been on the weak side, with August retail sales falling and a 151,000 job gain obscuring a big drop in the workweek, but it's not clear that the Fed will adjust its language accordingly. Meanwhile, core consumer price inflation continued to accelerate, rising 2.3% from a year ago.So-called ""bond king"" Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital, predicted in a Reuters interview on Sept. 9 that interest rates had bottomed and suggested that the Fed, talking about hiking as growth slowed, risked taking a ""bond unfriendly turn.""There are two things that might save the day for markets though on Wednesday. One is that the Fed statement, or Yellen in her press conference, could stress that the Fed is willing to let inflation overshoot its 2% target for an extended period. The other is that Japan may unload significant new firepower which convinces markets that, despite the Fed's itchy trigger finger, the era of easy central banks is still in force.

Apple (AAPL) rose nearly 2% to 104.81, rebounding back above the critical 50-day line, while Verizon (VZ) rallied 0.5%. Verizon is reclaiming a portion of Friday's 3.3% slide and trying to hold above its 200-day moving average.A recent pullback since early July has sent Verizon back into the belly of a prior cup base that formed between April 5 and June 22, featuring a 54.59 buy point. Verizon broke out in late June in heavy volume but rallied just 4% before retreating.

The stock has been rebounding since late June and is trying to form a new cup base. American Air reported a 2.8% drop in revenue passenger miles in August vs. a year ago as capacity edged up 1.4%. The total passenger load factor, a measure of the degree of airplane seats filled, slipped to 82.9% from 86.5%.AA also expects total revenue per available seat mile to fall 3%-5% in the third quarter vs. a year ago.The market will likely keep a sharp eye on comments from Federal Reserve officials Neel Kashkari and Lael Brainard, who are both scheduled to speak at 1 p.m. ET. Kashkari heads the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank and Brainard is a member of the Fed's board of governors. The Fed is slated to meet on interest rate policy on Sept. 20-21. According to the CME Group, the fed funds interest rate futures market now shows a minute probability that short-term interest rates will be raised 25 basis points to a target range of 0.5%-0.75%.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market is showing again that it's under heavy selling pressure, and the current outlook was switched to ""Uptrend under pressure"" on Friday.

200,CME,"The U.S. economy added 151,000 jobs in August, the Labor Department said, 24,000 less than expected. The jobless rate held steady at 4.9%.The report was viewed as close to Goldilocks — not too hot, not too cold — because it's likely to keep the Federal Reserve on hold when it meets on Sept. 21.Major stock indexes saw moderate gains after the report. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped slightly after the lower-than-expected job gain, but subsequently turned higher. As of midmorning, markets were pricing in about a 25% chance of an interest-rate hike in September, unchanged from the prior day. The probability of a December hike -- now about 57%, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool -- actually rose slightly.There were some definite soft spots in the report. Hourly wage gains slowed to a 2.4% annual gain from July's cycle-high of 2.7%. The average workweek ticked down to 34.3 hours from 34.4. That combination, along with slower job growth, means slower overall income growth may weigh on consumption.IBD'S TAKE: The Federal Reserve is likely to resume hiking interest rates later this year. How will markets react? Will improved earnings outweigh higher interest rates? Understanding the stock market's prevailing trend is a key consideration in when to buy stocks or take defensive positions. For a primer, visit IBD University.The goods-producing sector of the economy shed 24,000 jobs, with losses of 14,000 in manufacturing, 6,000 in construction and 4,000 in mining. Temp workers assigned through employment agencies fell 11,900.Job gains came in leisure and hospitality (29,000), local government (24,000), social services (21,700), professional and technical services (20,100), finance (15,000), retail (15,100), and health care (14,400).June and July employment gains were revised down by a net 1,000. Over the past three months, job gains have averaged 232,000, but that likely overstates the strength of the labor market because it includes a rebound from May's inexplicably weak gain.RELATED:The August Jobs Report Was The Weakest Since 2010

Volume in the stock market today was running higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq.The market was back to its bad news is good news for the interest-rate outlook. With the unexpectedly weak payroll numbers for August (151,000 jobs added vs. 175,000 expected), the focus shifts back to the Federal Reserve. The Fed had been hinting at a rate hike, but Friday's number might either make that less likely or at least push back the timetable.CME Group's FedWatch Tool pegged the odds of a rate hike in September at 21%, down from the previous session's 24%. The Federal Reserve's next meeting will be conducted Sept. 20-21.Meanwhile, the jobless rate held steady at 4.9%. While that number might not sound so bad, it disguises sharp differences. For black Americans, the economy probably feels more like an outright recession. The unemployment rate for black Americans is 8.1%. For Americans with a college degree, the rate is 2.7%.Big name stocks were doing well in Friday's early trade.Apple (AAPL) gapped up 1%, retaking its short term, 10-day line.

203,CME,"Stocks reversed lower in afternoon trading Friday after Fed chief Janet Yellen said the economy was strong enough to justify a rate hike and her No. 2 said that could mean a move in September.Yellen said a strong labor market had strengthened the case for a rate increase. She said the Fed forecasts moderate growth in GDP and inflation rising to 2% over the next few years. Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said her remarks were consistent with a September rate increase. He saw the possibility of two rate hikes this year.Stocks, which had extended modest gains on Yellen's comments, reversed lower. The major averages are off session lows, with the Nasdaq down 0.1%, the S&P 500 off 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average retreating 0.3%. Volume was tracking higher than the same time Thursday on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq exchanges in the stock market today.Yellen's much-anticipated speech at Jackson Hole, Wyo., led Fed funds futures traders to up their bets for a rate increase, but only after the election. But they now see a 30% chance of a rate hike at the Sept. 21 meeting and a 36% chance at the Nov. 2 meeting -- both up modestly after Fischer's comments. But they see 58% change of a rate increase at the Dec. 14 meeting, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool. They still haven't priced in a second hike as likely at any point through next July.Bank stocks turned mixed. Bank of America (BAC) rose 1.4% and Citigroup (C) 0.6%. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) briefly turned negative but are now up 0.2%.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) disappointed investors even though it beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. Q3 guidance came up a little short. Shares slumped nearly 6%. The stock has undercut its 50-day moving average.Nautilus (NLS) muscled higher for a 6% gain, emerging from a wide and loose consolidation on big volume. It will replace Outerwall (OUTR) in the small-cap S&P 600 index after the close Sept. 1. Outerwall is being bought out by Apollo Global Management.

204,CME,"Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said Friday that the case for a rate hike has ""strengthened"" in recent months, as labor market slack is fading.The U.S. economy is ""now nearing the Federal Reserve's statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability,"" Yellen said.Financial markets, which already have been pricing in a good chance of a rate hike in December, initially took her comments in stride. Investors are less concerned about the timing of the next hike than the one after that. Treasury yields initially rose a bit, then headed slightly lower after release of Yellen's speech transcript.That was before Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer told CNBC that he saw Yellen's comments as consistent with a rate hike at the September meeting. Further, he said, a second increase could come as early as December, adding that the Fed won't know what's appropriate ""until we see the data.""Those comments caused a bit more turbulence, with the 10-year Treasury yield bouncing from an intraday low of 1.53% to 1.59%. Major stock indexes gave up modest gains stock market today and turned red, though afternoon losses were slim.After Fischer's comments market pricing still points to the next hike being in December, CME Group's FedWatch tool shows, though the odds of a hike in September edged up from 21% to 30%.But if Fischer's comments about two hikes this year begin to look realistic, bond market pricing will have to shift pretty markedly. Right now, markets are pricing in just a 31% chance of a second hike coming by the meeting on July 26, 2017.Yellen's speech and Fischer's comments both underscore just how unsure Fed policymakers are about the future. In addition to talking about economic data showing the Fed's goals of full employment and 2% inflation may be around the corner, Yellen highlighted arguments pointing to very low interest rates for a long time to come.""By some calculations, the real neutral rate is currently close to zero, and it could remain at this low level if we were to continue to see slow productivity growth and high global saving,"" Yellen said.The neutral interest rate is the rate at which monetary policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive.The path of rate hikes next year is the big issue for investors. Even as markets have shifted in recent weeks toward expecting a rate hike as early as December, the 10-year Treasury yield has drifted slightly lower. The reason markets have been so calm about the next rate increase is that investors don't expect an ensuing hike until at least the fall of 2017.Yellen, as expected, didn't offer any precise timing for the next Fed interest rate hike. Markets had already moved up the expected timing after a run of mostly better-than-expected data, including the strong July jobs report, a jump in new-home sales and a surge in durable goods orders. New data on Friday were on the soft side, though, with second-quarter GDP growth revised down to 1.1%, and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index slipping unexpectedly.Banks, which stand to benefit from higher rates, perked up with Yellen's comments about a stronger case for a rate hike, but later gave up much of their gains. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) each saw minor gains, but Bank of America (BAC) was up 1.4%.
"
205,CME,"After the 2013 ""Taper Tantrum,"" the pre-hike panic in 2015 and the dot-plot disturbance at the start of 2016, markets have exhibited an eerie sense of calm in recent weeks over the prospect of the Federal Reserve tightening policy.The surprise is that even as the strong 255,000 job gain reported on Aug. 5 increased expectations for a rate hike before year end — markets are now pricing in a roughly 50% chance — the 10-year Treasury yield has drifted lower and remains not too far above the record lows set in the days after the U.K.'s Brexit vote.Into this placid environment, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen is set to tread on Friday as she delivers a speech at 10 a.m. ET at the biggest central banking conference of the year. The title of this year's Jackson Hole, Wyo., confab is ""Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future"" or, in simpler terms, how can the Fed save our slow-growth economy when the next recession hits.Fed watchers don't expect Yellen to offer any clarity on when the next rate hike will be, but investors will be listening closely for any hints about where rate policy may go in 2017 — and which camp she sides with. Right now there's a pretty stark divide within the central bank: Some policymakers see little reason to be proactive in hiking rates when growth is slow and inflation is low; others think economy is at full employment, inflation is rising toward the 2% target and it's time to implement a diet of gradual rate hikes.Here's what's behind the bond market's Jedi-like calm: Investors don't seem phased by the growing prospect of a rate hike in coming months because they're convinced that the rate hikes after that one will be a long time in coming. That's a markedly different attitude than prior occasions when the Federal Reserve shifted policy. The tapering of quantitative easing purchases in 2013 and the telegraphing of rate hikes to come in mid-2015 both precipitated a big rise in market interest rates. Then the Fed's dot-plot chart last December, which signaled four rate hikes in 2016, helped send markets into a tailspin at the start of the year.At the moment, the CME Group's Fed Watch tool sees just a single hike through next July, with just a 23% chance of a second hike at the meeting on July 26, 2017.The outlook for a very slow pace of rate hikes follows ""rather sobering"" economic news, says Sara Johnson, senior research director of global economics at IHS Global Insight.""Sluggish growth in the second quarter, three quarters of decline in capital spending"" and continued slow productivity growth have led policymakers to repeatedly curb their expectations for the economy, Johnson said.Still, she said, even if markets appear calm about the next rate hike, there's no telling if they'll remain so once a rate hike becomes a reality. She notes that emerging markets have rallied in recent months as investors have become willing to take on more risk, but that risk-aversion tends to creep in when the Fed is tightening.Bond yields remained little changed Thursday, while the major stock indexes fell slightly.

Volume in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges.The Dow Jones utility average dropped 1.6% on further signs that the Federal Reserve may be preparing to raise interest rates. CME Group's Fed Watch Tool sees an 18% chance of a rate hike in September, but a 43% chance of one in December. Higher rates could make the dividends of utilities look less attractive.Most utilities have recently lost their 50-day moving average line. Southern Company (SO), for example, shows typical action -- losing the line Aug. 11 and since unable to reclaim it.One stock that is comfortably above its 50-day line and that shows no signs of weakness is retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA). The stock rose 0.6% and notched another new high. Ulta Beauty is slated to report quarterly results after the close Thursday. Wall Street expects earnings to advance 21% to $1.39 a share. That would be the slowest quarterly growth in nine quarters. However, Ulta beat views last time around by 12%.Among the blue chips, losers led winners by a 9-4 ratio in the Dow. The biggest percentage losers were Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), down 1.5%, and McDonald's (MCD), down 1.3%. The best performer was Nike (NKE), up 3%.Of the 197 industry groups followed by IBD, farm machinery was the day's No. 1 winner, up about 5%. The worst performer was the metal products distributor group, down 6%, but that was chiefly because of one stock: Olympic Steel (ZEUS) plunged 16%.

212,CME,"Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen on Monday highlighted ""disappointing"" jobs data and subtly shifted her view on when additional rate hikes would be appropriate from ""probably in the coming months"" to ""probably.""Yellen omitted any reference to the possible timing of future rate increases, saying that the Fed will have to wrestle with ""new questions about the economic outlook"" after the May jobs report showing that the economy added just 38,000 jobs last month.""Is the markedly reduced pace of hiring in April and May a harbinger of a persistent slowdown in the broader economy?"" Yellen asked rhetorically at a speech in Philadelphia.After initially paring gains, stocks rallied to session highs following Yellen's comments, with the S&P 500 hitting a 7-month high intraday and the Nasdaq reaching the highest since late December. Yet investors may not put too much faith in Yellen's ability to pull her colleagues in a more dovish direction. After an ultra-dovish speech in late March, markets were betting that the Fed wouldn't hike until December or even until 2017.Other Fed members began warning earlier in May that markets were wrong. Then, on May 27 at Harvard University, Yellen also signaled that a summer rate hike was in the cards: ""Probably in the coming months (a rate) move would be appropriate.""Other Fed policymakers chimed in on Monday, essentially saying that the May jobs report was a bump in the road that pretty much eliminates chances for a hike in June but not necessarily July.Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, speaking in Finland, said that the 4.7% jobless rate is his estimate for ""full employment"" and that he expects growth to remain sufficient ""to justify a gradual removal"" of monetary policy accommodation.Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said that while the Fed shouldn't hike in June, he still sees the economy on a moderate growth path and thinks two hikes before year's end will be appropriate.Yellen said she is cautiously optimistic about the economy: ""I continue to think that the federal funds rate will probably need to rise gradually over time to ensure price stability and maximum sustainable employment in the longer run.""Yet she noted a number of concerns beyond the lousy jobs report, including weak business investment, slow productivity growth, international uncertainties from the U.K. possibly leaving the European Union, and slowing growth in China.Further, Yellen said she sees current policy as only ""modestly accommodative"" and said that it may be appropriate to let the unemployment rate undershoot the Fed's objective by a bit to help lift inflation toward its 2% target more quickly.While Yellen might not have a lot of support on the Fed for that approach, it's clear that after a surprisingly weak May jobs report, policymakers are more data-dependent than ever.The CME FedWatch Tool now sees only a 4% chance of a June rate hike and about a 26% chance of a July move. Even a tightening by September is now just below 50-50. Before the jobs report, the odds were about 25% to 30% for June hike and roughly 60% by July.

"
216,CME,"The troubling takeaway from the surprisingly weak May jobs numbers is that the economy is stuck in slow-growth mode for the foreseeable future.While last month's overall gain of 38,000 jobs, including a 25,000 rise in private payrolls, was dragged down temporarily by the labor strike of 35,000 Verizon (VZ) communications workers, the weakness was broad-based. On net, just 51.3% of industries added jobs, the lowest since February 2010, Labor Department data showed.Considering that Verizon likely brought in some temp workers during the now-resolved strike, private payrolls were close to flat in May outside of health care, which added 45,700 jobs last month and just under a half million over the past year.Although there were some pockets of hiring strength, the weak job gains and downward revisions totaling 59,000 to the increases reported in March and April suggest that growth is getting much harder to come by as the economic expansion gets long in the tooth.The slowdown looks like more than a one-month blip: The 155,000 private-sector jobs added over the past two months is the worst stretch since January 2011 -- even assuming that the strike artificially knocked 25,000-35,000 off the total.As markets priced in a slower timetable for Federal Reserve rate hikes, shares of Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) sold off hard on the stock market today.Instead of a likely hike in July, markets now see the Fed waiting until November, the CME Group FedWatch tool showed. The 10-year Treasury yield plunged to 1.71%, and the dollar fell 1.5% against other major currencies.One decent bit of news in the employment report is that the trend of firming wages remained intact, as hourly pay rose 0.2% from April and 2.5% from a year ago. That's consistent with anecdotal reports of companies having to pay more to attract or keep good workers, and many finding qualified workers in short supply.Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT), Costco (COST), Panera Bread (PNRA) and Wendy's (WEN) have all said they've raised pay in recent months.The drop in the unemployment rate to 4.7% from 5% in April appears at first to be consistent with a tight labor market. Still, the sudden drop in joblessness, which reflected fewer people in the workforce rather than an increase in employment, should be taken with a grain of salt, given the household survey's higher margin of error.Yet the overriding problem is that employers, who are now paying new employees more, are seeing profit margins pressured and finding that opportunities for profitable growth have narrowed.""The 'disconnect' between weak real GDP growth and strong employment growth seems to be resolving itself as employers are defending profits (and trying to boost productivity) in a soggy environment by managing payroll costs,"" wrote IHS Global Insight economists Nariman Behravesh and Ozlem Yaylaci.The reality portrayed by the weak jobs report got some confirmation from the Institute for Supply Management's survey of non-manufacturing industries, with the index slipping to a 28-month low of 52.9 in May from 55.7 in April -- well below expectations. The employment gauge fell into negative territory, dropping 3.3 points to 49.7, just below the neutral 50 level.A range of other economic data points and industry trends suggest a similar conclusion that the much-anticipated pick-up in growth may not materialize.Analysts think U.S. auto sales are close to peaking, and those views were supported by lower sales in May for General Motors (GM) and Ford (F), even as Autodata reports that incentives have climbed north of $3,000 per vehicle.Construction spending fell a surprising 1.8% in April, more than reversing March's gain. To top off that bad news, the construction sector shed 15,000 jobs in May after losing 5,000 in April. Anirban Basu, chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors, said that many private developers are concerned by possible overbuilding in commercial, office and lodging markets and sense that ""the current real estate cycle is now in its seventh inning or later.""Wal-Mart closed 154 U.S. stores at the start of the year, and Macy's (M) and other department stores are cutting their square footage as Amazon (AMZN) continues to eat into their business. Even Home Depot (HD), in one of the strongest retail sectors, hasn't added any stores in the U.S. in more than a year.Somehow, the retail sector has seemingly defied gravity when it comes to employment, adding 11,400 jobs last month and 323,000 over the past year. The explanation may be that the workweek has shrunk, since aggregate hours of work in the retail industry are down 0.3% over the past three months.Food services and drinking places added 22,200 jobs in May. But the accommodation sector shed 1,500 jobs, after cutting 2,300 the prior month.Manufacturers cut 18,000 jobs in May. While the sector has stabilized, there's little hope for an upturn, with the dollar still strong and global growth still weak.

220,CME,"A battle for the bigger exchange appeared to escalate between the U.S. and the EU on Tuesday after NYSE owner Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and CME Group (CME) expressed interest in acquiring the London Stock Exchange Group.The bids under consideration would risk sabotaging Germany-based exchange operator Deutsche Boerse's plans to form a ""merger of equals"" with the London Stock Exchange Group.That deal, if it happened, would create an organization that would oversee a massive swath of the Continent's trading and cap years of wrangling for dominance between Deutsche Boerse and the LSE. It would also come at the end of a trail of failed attempts by many others to take over the London exchange.Intercontinental Exchange said, in a statement responding to media speculation, that it was ""considering making an offer for LSEG"" but has made no decision on the matter and hasn't approached the London group. ICE has until March 29 to announce its decision.CME, which deals in the huge derivatives market, was also mulling an offer, the Wall Street Journal reported.

221,CME,"CME Group (CME) is reducing trading hours for livestock futures, the latest measure taken by the Chicago-based exchange in response to beef producers who say there is too much volatility and undue influence from high-frequency traders.A working group will be formed with the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association to examine more changes in trading, including setting up so-called circuit breakers to pause the market, CME Group said Wednesday in a statement. The change in hours was “based on customer requests,” said CME, the owner of the world’s largest futures market.CME Chairman Terry Duffy said at a cattle industry conference in January that he would push for changes in livestock markets to curb volatility that beef producers say make it harder to hedge their financial risk effectively. Last month, the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said that high-frequency trading and wide price swings made futures “more of a liability than a benefit.”“Nothing is more important to us than the integrity of our markets, which help farmers and ranchers to discover prices and transfer risk,” Tim Andriesen, CME Group managing director of agricultural products, said Wednesday in the statement.Effective Feb. 29, futures and options in cattle, hogs and feeder cattle on CME Globex will trade from 8:30 a.m. to 1:05 p.m. Chicago time, Monday through Friday, pending approval from regulators. Options trading by open outcry will be from 8:30 a.m. to 1:02 p.m.On most days currently, electronic trading runs from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.In December, a measure of volatility in cattle futures soared to the highest since 2004, while prices increasingly reached daily trading limits. That deterred cattle owners from using the derivatives to protect against price swings, the 28,000-member beef association said in a letter to the exchange Jan. 13.CME Group said its data show that traders not using high-frequency techniques have triggered wide price swings. Duffy said the cattle market may be “broken” because transactions have slumped in cash markets, a benchmark for futures.High-frequency trading accounted for 10% of average daily volume in cattle in 2015, CME Group said at the January industry conference.

(Not all those stocks appear on the table in the paper.) We considered only stocks with upward earnings revisions. The top five:Brinker International (EAT): The Street expects the owner of Chili's Grill & Bar and Maggiano's Little Italy restaurants to boost earnings 16% in the fiscal year ending in June. Pretax margin hit at least a nine-year high in fiscal 2015.On Feb. 2, Brinker declared an increase in the quarterly dividend from 28 cents a share to 32 cents. The annualized yield is 2.6%.Campbell Soup (CPB): Recently the soup maker has been acting more like a growth stock than a dividend stock. Analysts expect earnings to jump 14% the fiscal year ending in July, which would be the best annual growth since 1999.Campbell hasn't raised the dividend since 2013. The quarterly payout is 31.2 cents a share for an annualized yield of 2.1%.Air Products & Chemicals (APD): The Street is pegging earnings growth at 13% for the year ending in September. In 2015, Air Products raised its dividend for the 33rd year in a row. Look for another increase to be declared sometime in March. The  yield is 2.5%.Dunkin' Brands (DNKN): Analysts see earnings growth at 13% this year. That's up from 11% last year but below the three-year growth rate of 15%.  Dunkin' declared a dividend increase early this month. The quarterly payout was raised from 26.5 cents a share to 30 cents. The yield is 2.8%.CME Group (CME): EPS are expected to rise 13% this year. The company recently raised the quarterly dividend from 50 cents a share to 60 cents. The yield is 2.6%.Honorable mention: Hasbro (HAS) 12% EPS growth; Hormel Foods (HRL), 11%; and Clorox (CLX), 10%.

"
244,CME,"The mild winter has cut demand for heating oil and diesel, creating huge stockpiles. Global refining margins sank 34% in Q4, the steepest decline in eight years, according to data from BP.

371,CME,"In the stock market, a great company is like a high-performance Porsche, and volume is the stock's fuel. You can blather all day about the company's potential, its fabulous new product, its incredible CEO. But if the company's stock, after making a great run, begins to hit new highs in low volume, it will likely cease to act like a high-performance roadster.In fact, the stock may be beginning to put on the brakes on its spectacular run.When new highs keep occurring in low volume, it's prime time to be watching for serious sell signals.IBD has shared dozens of proven sell rules to help you keep most of your hard-earned investment gains in individual stock market winners and leadership-quality ETFs on Wall Street. After a stock sees a volume dry-up at the peak, be ready to sell at least some shares when a stock drops very hard through the 50-day moving average in gigantic volume. Or the stock may shatter a long-term trend line.Did the stock have a pair of 2-for-1 stock splits recently? Or did the stock get socked really hard after breaking out of a badly formed late-stage base? If the answer is yes to any of these questions, it's time to get your defensive game on.Please go to a daily chart at IBD and look at the bottom part of each chart. Each thin vertically-aligned bar represents how many shares a stock traded each session. It's easy to tell on any given day whether trading increased vs. the prior day, decreased, or stayed virtually the same.Now look at those volume bars again. See the 50-day average volume line, drawn in red, draped across the high end of those volume bars? The level of that line shows how many shares exchanged hands each day over the 50 most recent trading days. It's called a ""moving average"" because after a session on Wall Street is over, a new daily volume figure has been born. Thus, a new average over the past 50 days is created; the average keeps moving.The 50-day moving average makes it easy to spot trends in turnover. The same goes for the 10-week moving average, which shows typical weekly turnover over the past 10 weeks, on a weekly chart.A stock's volume often tracks above its 50-day average when a stock's price climbs to new high ground. This is where this stock has never been before. There is no overhead resistance, and buyers should be luring offers with their increasing bids.If this doesn't drum up increased volume, you have a problem. Remember, too, that the uptrending stock already has had institutional support behind it. That's how it got to be an uptrending stock.What do you think would happen if the big-money funds stopped buying? The stock would fall under its own weight.And if you see that stock consistently making new highs without solid volume, that's a sign that the tide may be turning. That is, sellers may have more influence over the stock's future prices than the buyers.CME Group (CME) shows how volume served as a gauge for the stock's health.The operator of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures and options market built a cup from August 2003 to January 2004. The base showed just a few weeks of high-volume selling during the stock's descent, and more weeks of high-volume buying on the right side of its base.CME ran up five weeks in a row in mostly heavy volume (1). That great price-and-volume action not only put the finishing touches on the base, but it also sparked a fine breakout. Even after the stock got extended from a 79.40 buy point, the gains in high volume continued. In the week ended Feb. 27, 2004, CME shot up 9.7% to new highs in volume that jumped 67% above the weekly average (2).Now look at CME's two-week-long dip near its 10-week moving average in late March (3). The declines were mild, and volume in one of those two weeks dried up. Volume then really picked up in the ensuing four weeks as CME lurched into new highs (4).A cup with handle formed from July to September 2004. The breakout in the week ended Sept. 24 shows another volume surge (5).Now compare all this positive price-volume action with CME's behavior in December. CME hit new highs, but volume settled into an eerie quietness (6). You could have taken that as a serious warning from a well-behaving stock.At the time, its IBD ratings were fantastic: a 99 EPS, a 97 Relative Price Strength. But this Porsche, which had taken you so far for years, had run out of gas.The stock peaked at 230.25 in early January 2005, dropped hard through the 10-week moving average, triggering a defense-type sell signal. CME fell 29% in three months, setting the stage for a new base to form.CME broke out of a large double-bottom base with a 220.59 buy point during the week ended June 3, 2005, and posted an amazing run. It rallied 214% by October 2007. A new base formed, a five-week flat base. CME broke out past the correct entry point of 693.10 in early December that year.The rally lasted all of three weeks. CME made a closing high of 710.75 in the week ended Dec. 21, 2007. But volume really dried up. On a weekly basis, 2.3 million shares exchanged hands, 23% below the 10-week average.Over the next four weeks through January of 2008, CME dropped more than 24% off its peak of 714. By the end of 2008, the futures and options exchange traded at 208, 71% below its all-time high.(A version of this column first appeared in the Jan. 10, 2011, edition of IBD.

372,CME,"CME Group (CME) agreed to buy Michael Spencer's NEX Group in a trans-Atlantic deal that creates a trading venues giant spanning futures to Treasuries and foreign exchange.CME Chief Executive Officer Terry Duffy is defying industry skepticism about big cross-border exchange mergers by offering a deal that values London-based NEX at 3.9 billion pounds ($5.5 billion). CME, which already has a near monopoly over trading in Treasury futures, will add BrokerTec, the largest market for trading Treasuries.Other exchange operators have been hesitant to pursue cross-border mergers. At an annual Futures Industry Association conference this month in Boca Raton, Florida, top market executives highlighted the difficulties of international deal-making during a panel discussion. A year ago, Duffy himself talked about the difficulties of cross-border takeovers, saying countries believe their operators are ""part of their DNA.""NEX and CME agreed to a price of 500 pence and 0.0444 new CME share, according to a statement on Thursday. At the current share price and exchange rate, that values each NEX share at 1,000 pence, a premium of 49.2% over the company's closing price on March 15, shortly before Bloomberg reported the Chicago exchange operator's interest in NEX.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseDuffy, 59, built CME through big takeovers, including deals with the Chicago Board of Trade and New York Mercantile Exchange. A tie-up of derivatives trading powerhouse CME and NEX could be buoyed by their complementary businesses.Spencer, 62, will join CME's board once the deal completes, and he will act as an ambassador for the enlarged company in its dealings with key clients, regulators and officials in Europe and Asia. The lover of French wine and rugby has a fortune of about 1.03 billion pounds.Justin Bates, an analyst at Liberum Capital Ltd., said that the 10 pound per share offer for NEX is a very good price, but the 50 percent cash component of the deal leaves the door ajar for a competing offer.""If I had shares I'd be holding on,"" Bates said by phone. ""Spencer staying on is probably a necessary requirement certainly in the early stages. In CME's shoes you would want that for the first few years to ensure a seamless integration.""NEX investors will receive a dividend for the company's year ending March 31.NEX, better known by its old name ICAP, dominates electronic Treasury trading. Its fixed-income division is home to about 80 percent of trading volumes in a $14.5 trillion market. CME enjoys a near-monopoly over trading of Treasury futures. Putting cash and derivatives trading under the same roof at CME would save major banks millions of dollars a year by enabling them to set aside less collateral.The failed $13 billion merger of London Stock Exchange Group Plc and Deutsche Boerse AG cast a pall over the exchange world last year. The deal was addled by the U.K.'s surprise vote to leave the European Union and disagreement over where the combined company's headquarters should be based. Since then, there's been a small comeback: Amsterdam-based Euronext NV this month completed its acquisition of Ireland's stock exchange, a hub for exchange-traded funds.

373,CME,"ETF providers hope to have cracked regulators' code for creating the first exchange traded product backed by Bitcoin — but it's going to cost you.Van Eck Associates and SolidX Partners on June 6 filed a request to list a Bitcoin-linked ETP to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The fund will be physically backed, which means it will hold actual Bitcoin, and will be insured against loss or theft of the cryptocurrency, according to the firms.The SEC asked companies to pull about a dozen applications for cryptocurrency-linked products in January, and last year rejected the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF. SolidX and VanEck were among the companies who had filed to list funds. They hope to have addressed regulators' concerns with changes they made in the new, joint request by increasing the share price and basing prices off regulated trading firms, according to SolidX Chief Executive Officer Daniel Gallancy.""Based on various comments, it seems that regulators are concerned right now about having an ETF that is available to retail investors,"" Gallancy said in a phone interview. ""We think that will change over time, but right now a good place to start is with a product geared purely toward institutional investors.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHopes for a Bitcoin ETF were running high last year after the CME Group (CME) and Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) listed Bitcoin futures, as investors speculated the SEC might approve funds linked to financial instruments trading on major exchanges. But those expectations soured as regulators said they were concerned about the high volatility and lack of depth in the market, and about pricing and trading that would be based on lightly regulated platforms.""While I'm still skeptical a Bitcoin ETP gets approved in any form this year, you gotta be in it to win it, and this extra hustle from VanEck could pay off down the road,"" said Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst.SolidX and VanEck want to address these concerns by basing prices for the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust on an index that tracks over-the-counter trading by U.S.-based institutions, which are regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. MVIS, a subsidiary of New York-based VanEck, will compile the index and publish price updates throughout the day.VanEck oversees more than $45 billion in assets and manages more than 70 exchange traded products. SolidX is a New York-based financial technology company, developing cryptography software and capital markets products.If approved, the product will be priced at 25 Bitcoins per share, which equals about $188,000 at June 6 prices, to target institutional investors, Gallancy said. This compares with a double-digit share price for most ETFs. This would be a change from the focus in the ETF industry, which has traditionally been on individual investors.The firms haven't determined fees for the fund yet, but Gallancy said it will probably be on the more expensive side compared with other ETFs, as they'll be handling the additional risk and hassle of trading cryptocurrency.SolidX would handle custody of Bitcoin using a so-called cold storage solution, which means private keys that serve as ownership codes are kept offline. Funds will be insured one-to-one by a syndicate of insurers, which the firms didn't disclose.VanEck had previously filed a Bitcoin future-based ETF. A physically backed Bitcoin ETF will be attractive as it tracks Bitcoin spot prices more closely, said the firm's head, Jan van Eck.

Rising interest rates have expanded net interest margins — something noted in Morgan Stanley's Q1 earnings report. The regulatory environment has been easing for banks and other financials. Higher market volatility has resulted in more trading activity — and commissions — for brokers.But financials are lagging several other sectors this year, including software, apparel, health care and semiconductors.To its credit, iShares Brokers-Dealers and Exchanges has a number of solid stocks. Charles Schwab is up about 25% from a breakout to new highs in November. Nasdaq shares are up about 20% from a November buy point. E-Trade has risen some 45% from a Nov. 27 breakout.Among losers, Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) plunged in early February after trading was halted on several inverted volatility products, potentially lowering trading volume at its Chicago Board Options Exchange.

387,CME,"Italy's populists didn't just wrest control of their own government, they've hijacked Federal Reserve monetary policy too.As long as Italy's membership in the eurozone looks about as secure as the Leaning Tower of Pisa, central bankers are going to be much more hesitant to hike interest rates or otherwise tighten policy.As the Italian political crisis erupted and global financial markets plunged Tuesday, Fed rate-hike expectations took a dive. Just over a week ago, markets were pricing in roughly 50-50 odds of four Fed rate hikes in 2018. But during the worst of yesterday's rout, odds of just two Fed hikes spiked close to 50%.With panic subsiding Wednesday as stock and bond markets rebounded, odds firmed for three hikes this year, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool. But more volatility is likely with any flare-up in Italy's political risks.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe emerging consensus is that the European Central Bank will delay its plan to taper bond purchases. As for the Fed, the five additional rate hikes through 2019 that policymakers penciled in back in March are starting to look less sure.What does this mean for the stock market? Well, this isn't a consensus, but those who saw rising interest rates as the biggest threat to markets are suddenly feeling more upbeat.Doug Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners Management, wrote that a messy resolution to an Italian rebellion against European Union rules will weigh on global economic growth and corporate profits. The upside to Italy's crisis for stock market investors, in his view, is that upward pressure on inflation and interest rates will ease, lengthening the economic cycle and aiding stock valuations""A somewhat elongated cycle (caused by less interest-rate stress) reduces the market's downside target by 10%, slightly improves (+4%) the 'fair market value' and modestly increases the top end of the anticipated trading range,"" Kass wrote.Easier Fed policy in the face of elevated risk out of Italy makes sense, and not only due to the prospect of slower growth. If the Fed keeps raising rates as planned as the ECB stays in easing mode, that will spur more upward pressure on the dollar. That, in turn, will choke growth in emerging markets where companies often borrow in dollar-denominated debt.Outflows from emerging markets in a slower-growth environment could contribute to a series of crises in places like Turkey and Argentina.If Italy's crisis, which is really about a long-underperforming economy with too much debt, turns out to be positive for U.S. stocks, it wouldn't be the first time. Stocks took off when the Greenspan Fed cut rates three times in the fall of 1998 to counteract a wave of financial crises from Southeast Asia to Russia. Of course, that was in the middle of the dot-com boom.Still, when stimulus from tax cuts and higher federal spending begins to ebb in late 2019, softer global growth could further undercut U.S. momentum. Even if the Fed curbs rate-hike plans, monetary policy may still be too tight under such soggy conditions.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:This Hot Biotech Dives On FDA Hold; FANG Stock Enters 'Friend Zone'Dow Jones Stocks Apple, Microsoft, Intel, Nike, Visa Are In Buy RangeSquare Moves Into Buy Zone, Leading Italy-Resistant FinancialsHow JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley Made The Bank Sell-Off Much WorseForget Trump: Why We're Headed For A Long, Cold U.S. And China Trade War

388,CME,"Just when it looked like the new normal of lackluster growth was history, Italy's political crisis threatens to throw a soggy pizza on the Trump economic boom.As Italian government bond yields surged on Tuesday, triggering long-dismissed fears about the fate of the European Union's currency area, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled nearly 400 points, or 1.6%, on the stock market today. The S&P 500 slid 1.2%.While those fears about a breakup of the euro may be overdone, the uncertainty surrounding Italy is likely to linger and exacerbate global economic fragility at a consequential time.Just consider how expectations have swung for the U.S. economy: A week ago, the odds of four Fed rate hikes in 2018 were just over 50%, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool. Now those odds have sunk to 15%, and the odds of only two rate hikes have spiked to 44%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA relatively positive impact of the global flight to safety was to push U.S. Treasury yields lower, with the 10-year yield sliding to 2.79% and the two-year yield to 2.34%, which will lower borrowing costs for companies and consumers. But the 10-year yield has fallen harder, once again squeezing the yield spread and thus banks' net interest margins. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) — Dow Jones and S&P 500 components — skidded 4.3% and 3.4%, respectively, on Tuesday.Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index continued its recent ascent, jumping to its highest level since July 2017.The roughly 6% rise in the dollar vs. other advanced economy currencies over the past three months is a negative for the earnings of U.S. multinationals, since it makes foreign-earned revenue worth less in dollar terms. But economists also see a stronger dollar as a negative for global growth, especially for emerging markets where companies often borrow in dollar-denominated debt that is harder to service when the local currency falls.A stronger dollar is already pressuring developing economies. The rush to safety sparked by Italy's political turmoil will add to that pressure, leading to outflows from emerging markets, and increasing financial vulnerability in places like Turkey and Argentina. Brazil is already reeling from a truckers strike.If a stronger dollar comes at the same time China's economy begins to slow, the global outlook could quickly shift from the best in a decade into a relative soft patch. Economic data from China over the past month have indeed been on the weaker side.European economies also have slowed, leaving the U.S. as the main standout of late. While there's reason to think that the U.S. economy has  enough of a head of steam to avoid a letdown this year, it may not approach the heights expected from the Trump tax cuts.The real risk is that when the stimulus from tax cuts and higher federal spending begins to ebb in late 2019, a softer global economic backdrop will further undercut U.S. momentum. Even if the Fed curbs rate-hike plans, monetary policy may still be too tight.Italy's underperforming, over-indebted economy and financial system emerged from crisis after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi pledged in 2012 to do ""whatever it takes"" to preserve the currency union in 2012, then launched a massive bond-buying program. But now the question is whether Italian politics will allow Draghi to work his magic.The ECB had been moving to phase out its bond-buying program. While that's looking increasingly unlikely, Draghi will have limited ability to backstop Italian debt if political leaders remain bent on flouting EU budget deficit rules and embarking on a fiscal expansion.In March, Italians backed two populist parties, the 5 Star Movement and Northern League, which formed a tentative coalition government this month. The latest crisis erupted when Italian President Sergio Mattarella blocked their appointment of a euro critic as finance minister on Sunday. He then installed pro-market International Monetary Fund economist Carlo Cottarelli as interim prime minister.A new election could happen in late July, but a top EU official's warning stoked further outrage.""The coming weeks will show that the development of the markets, government bonds and the economy of Italy will be so far-reaching that this will be a possible signal to voters not to vote for populists on the right or left,"" European Budget Commissioner Günther Oettinger said.Oettinger may be right, but it's also possible that Italians are fed up with EU rules after a prolonged period of economic stagnation.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:This Top Stock Set To Hit Buy Zone; Key Tech Sector Holds UpHow JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley Made The Bank Sell-Off Much WorseForget Trump: Why We're Headed For A Long, Cold U.S. And China Trade WarThese 4 Top Stocks Hit Buy Points, But Only One Closes In RangeStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

The Hang Seng has let an 11.9% year-to-date gain shrivel to less than 0.5%.Despite the decline in Chinese mainland equities, Autohome, a member of IBD Leaderboard since Jan. 2 this year, scored a new breakout from a rare pattern called the ascending base. In such a pattern, the stock has already broken out but then posts three quick corrections of around 10% to 20% over a nine- to 16-week period.

This base gave a 67.79 standard buy point.A narrow five-day handle formed on the tail end of the base. That provided a slightly lower buy point of 65.67, a dime above the handle's high.

393,CME,"While President Trump's apparent China trade-war detente grabbed all the headlines on Monday, Treasury yields and Fed rate-hike odds quietly continued their recent surge.That may explain why stocks, which rallied early after Trump's Sunday tweet called for a rescue of Chinese telecom gear giant ZTE, had trouble staying positive. The S&P 500 briefly turned negative before the blue-chip index clawed out a 0.1% gain. The Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite also settled with slim advances.The two-year Treasury yield, which hit a new post-financial-crisis high of nearly 2.55% on Monday, has kept marching higher despite some market-friendly economic data. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3.0%, a level first breached in late April.Two data points this month had seemed to set Wall Street up for a monthlong reprieve from Fed rate-hike worries. First, average hourly wages grew a disappointing 2.6% vs. a year ago in April. Then core consumer price inflation unexpectedly held steady at 2.1%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePerhaps even more important, the Federal Reserve began to send a more forceful message that it won't overreact when inflation creeps above its 2% target, as most expect it will.Nevertheless, odds of a fourth rate hike this year climbed to 51%, up from less than 40% a month ago, according to the CME Group FedWatch page.The message from the bond market is that there will be no reprieve about Fed concerns anytime soon. One possible contributor to the steadily rising market rates is spiraling federal borrowing needs, even as the Federal Reserve reverses some of its financial-crisis-era bond purchases in a move dubbed quantitative tightening.The bond market is sending a second message: Even if the Fed doesn't overreact to inflation data, its current rate-hike trajectory may be too aggressive. And some economists think the Fed's current rate-hike intentions already are. The Fed is pulling away monetary stimulus amid a surge in fiscal stimulus this year. But as federal stimulus starts to wane, the economy is due for a letdown in the second half of 2019.The expectation of strong growth now and a soft patch around the corner explains the narrow gap between the 10-year Treasury and two-year Treasury yields of about 45 basis points.The flat yield curve is bad for banks' net interest margins, since banks borrow at long-term rates and lend at short-term rates.  That's why both homebuilders, which thrive on low interest rates, and banks, which can benefit from rising rates, are among the market's biggest laggards.IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial industry group has sunk to 182 out of 197 industries based on stock performance.

394,CME,"The major indexes enjoyed a slow yet steady afternoon rebound but still closed mildly lower on Thursday. Some commodity stocks and cyclical plays paced the upside, including ship transport, logistics, coal and homebuilding. Preliminary volume figures were mixed as traders fret over how the U.S. and China will handle two-day talks on trade.Inside the IBD 50, small-cap energy play Warrior Met Coal (HCC) gapped up at the open. At one point the energy play rallied to an all-time high of 26.93, briefly surpassing a 26.53 buy point within a nearly nine-week cup without handle.Meanwhile, as Apple (AAPL) tiptoed closer to a potential new breakout, an emerging group of new leaders powered past their own buy points and sharply outperformed the market. They included Marathon Oil (MRO) (up 6% in double average volume) and Tableau Software (DATA) (up nearly 7% in more than four times usual turnover).The Dow Jones industrial average eked out a tiny gain of 5 points as it notched a positive reversal. Dow components Boeing (BA) and 3M (MMM) were the only two out of 30 names to rise 1 point or more.Ninety minutes into Thursday's session, the blue chip index slid as much as 1.6% before slowly climbing higher the rest of the way.The Dow industrials poked below its long-term 200-day moving average for the second time since April 2. That's evidence of a new shakeout taking place.At 23,930, the Dow industrials still stands nearly 10% off its peak, despite the fact that IBD's current outlook for the market holds at ""Uptrend under pressure.""The S&P 500 also slid below the long-term 200-day moving average but turned a loss of more than 1.4% to just a 0.2% dip, another bullish sign. Still, watch to see if the large-cap benchmark tries in future trading sessions to mark another close below the 200-day line.The Nasdaq composite was off less than 0.2% after having fallen as much as 1.5%. The premier index of growth companies continues to test buying support near the 7000 level.Volume ran sharply higher on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Wednesday and slipped lower on the NYSE, according to early data.The Russell 2000 and the Dow transports both fell 0.5%. The Russell 1000, a popular small-cap gauge, is clinging to a tiny year-to-date gain.Marathon Oil rallied more than 6% at one point and got as high as 19.51 before cooling off some. The stock easily surpassed an 18.76 buy point in a 13-week cup with handle. The 5% buy zone extends up to 19.70.Marathon is an integrated oil and gas firm. The large-cap firm from Houston posted earnings of 18 cents a share in Q1, reversing a 13-cent net loss in the year-ago quarter. Sales boomed 62% to $1.73 billion.Marathon is not the only company with strong relative performance and good IBD ratings, as seen in IBD's stock quotes and in the Stock Checkup tool. Ecopetrol (EC), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Italy's Eni Spa (E) all hold a Relative Price Strength Rating of 80 or higher.While oil and gas explorers slumped, integrated firms such as Marathon Oil advanced smartly as the rally in crude oil futures show no signs of abating. U.S. WTI near-term futures bounced from a nearly 0.7% loss to finish up and well above $68 a barrel.WTI crude is now up more than 13% year to date. In contrast, the S&P 500, at 2627, is down nearly 1.7% since Jan. 1. The 500 ran up 19.4% in 2017.Tableau, meanwhile, gapped out of a base-on-base pattern at 87.70, rising more than 7% to 91.30 in quadruple normal volume.Tableau is a Big Data analytics software expert. The Seattle-based firm notched its fourth quarter in a row of solid earnings per share. Revenue climbed 23% to $246.2 million, the biggest jump in five quarters.According to IBD Stock Checkup, Tableau's so-so 68 Composite Rating belies a strong 89 RS Rating, meaning the company is outperforming 89% of all publicly traded firms in IBD's database over the past 12 months. Given Thursday's strong advance, watch to see if Tableau's ratings edge higher.Going back to Apple, the iPhone, iPad and digital services titan acted stingy in giving back Wednesday's strong gain, a good sign for the bulls. The stock initially fell more than 1% to 174.63 in brisk trade. Then it wiped out those modest losses to end 0.2% higher to 176.89.The megacap tech is possibly forming the right side of a shallow seven-week double-bottom base. The middle peak between the base's  two lows is 178.94. Hence, a new buy point would be 179.04, 10 cents above that middle peak. The decline within the base is very light at 12.5%.Apple is still trading near all-time highs, another bullish sign. At $897 billion, it's the largest company by market value on the U.S. financial markets. In IBD Stock Checkup, the Cupertino, Calif., firm shows decent ratings such as an 85 for EPS (Earnings Per Share) and 86 for Relative Price Strength.Earlier this week the iPhone giant reported a 30% jump in fiscal second-quarter earnings to $2.73 a share, the biggest jump in 10 quarters, as revenue grew 16%, marking a sixth quarter in a row of top-line acceleration.Apple's revenue slumped 9% during the fiscal fourth quarter of FY 2016, then rose 3%, 5%, 7%, 12% and 13% in the next five quarters.The Street expects Apple's earnings turnaround to keep shining brightly. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect profit to climb 30% in the June-ending fiscal third quarter to $2.17 a share.Despite the nifty reversal by the major indexes, investors also seem to show nervousness on the outcome of two-day trade talks between top U.S. and Chinese economic officials in Beijing.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and other key players arrived in the Middle Kingdom on Thursday for talks later in the day and Friday.Bloomberg reported a senior Chinese government official as saying that China will refuse any U.S. preconditions for negotiations, such as narrowing the bilateral trade gap.On Friday, a number of top Federal Reserve officials and regional bank presidents are slated to speak, including William Dudley, John Williams, and Esther George. On Wednesday, the U.S. central bank kept short-term interest rates unchanged. The fed funds rate that's charged on overnight cash infusions to major lenders currently hovers at a 1.5%-1.75% target range.CME futures see a nearly 45% probability that the Fed will raise the fed funds rate three more times to a target range of 2.25%-2.5%, slightly down from recent days. Numerous money center banks, Wall Street investment giants and regional lenders have recently been hit with intense selling.Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) have either sliced below or came close to touching their 200-day moving averages.

Experts say it could result in huge cost savings and increased profits for companies using it.""We really believe this could be one of the major innovations of the last 20 or 30 years, including the internet; it could be even possibly bigger than the internet was as far as disruption,"" said Eric Ervin, CEO of Reality Shares.A Reality Shares' report states that usage of blockchain is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 61%, and well-known companies including Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Intuit (INTU) are committed to adopting and developing blockchain technologies. In addition, it notes that there are over 1,200 blockchain startups, with private investment in those reaching nearly $5 billion in 2017, according to various sources.So, how exactly are the companies involved with the technology, and how can investors tell the real players from the fake ones?Ervin says that Reality Shares uses an economic impact score to see what impact blockchain will have on a company's future earnings. For example, even though IBM (IBM) is a huge company with many other projects going on such as artificial intelligence, ""blockchain's one of IBM's biggest initiatives in the entire company,"" he said. ""Their long-term strategic vision is really embracing blockchain and being the go-to provider of it.""Last year, IBM developed a food traceability blockchain platform for Walmart (WMT) to enhance food safety and transparency. It also partnered with Walmart and Chinese retailer JD.com (JD) in a Blockchain Food Safety Alliance collaboration to improve food safety in China. Ten other major food suppliers and retailers have expressed their interest as well.Another large player is Intel, which has developed a chip that allows for transactions to be committed to a shared database. ""If I'm a pharmacy and you get a prescription of Oxycodone, you can't forge it and create two copies of that anymore because it's all based on the blockchain,"" said Ervin. ""They (Intel) think their revenue alone could go up almost 20% just from this new chip that they've built, which will be at the core of all of these blockchain-as-a-service solutions.""Amazon's cloud service AWS is investing in blockchain in health care and life sciences, financial services, supply-chain management, security and compliance. A wide variety of applications have been developed by its AWS partners, including T-Mobile (TMUS), consulting firm PwC, vision specialist VSP Global, Samsung and Deloitte.Because blockchain needs a lot of processing power, chip producers such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are poised to benefit from the development and sale of specialized chips. First Trust's LEGR invests in providers of products and services to enable other firms to employ blockchain technology. Chips and other such providers comprise about 50% of the portfolio.The other 50% is comprised of firms that employ the technology to make their business more efficient, such as CME Group (CME), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Overstock.com (OSTK), said Ryan Issakainen, senior vice president at First Trust Portfolios.The fund will not invest in names that have not shown an actual test case, he adds: ""We don't want to have a company that says they're going to have a new cryptocurrency offering for a certain type of service, but they haven't made investments in it yet."" An example would be Eastman Kodak (KODK).Amplify's BLOK is the only actively managed fund among the four ETFs. Christian Magoon, CEO of Amplify ETFs, says that this allows the fund to quickly include new names or sell those that are involved in controversies.Besides the big conglomerates involved in blockchain, Magoon says the fund also holds some more pure-play names, such as Japanese IT firm Digital Garage, Japanese financial conglomerate SBI Holdings, and Japanese internet and media firm GMO Internet. GMO operates several cryptocurrency exchanges, offers a wallet service for cryptocurrencies, and a blockchain service to store medical records.""I think what's going to happen for investors is: You could wait (for more of a) pure play or some big announcement happens like 'Canada's government to use blockchain,' but for us, we're trying to be early in the game,"" he said.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Blockchain Expands Beyond Bitcoin To Amazon, Nvidia, AlibabaAI, Robotics, Blockchain Among Hot New ETF Industry TrendsFirst Trust Launches New Blockchain ETF To Meet Demand

It came just days after the firm announced it was acquiring Ziddu.com, a blockchain-focused firm which had zero revenue.But there was positive news on the digital currency front after Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) President Chris Concannon said the market could support the launch of a Bitcoin exchange traded product, or ETP.In a letter sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission, he cited data collected from the company's launch of Bitcoin futures late last year.In January, the SEC voiced concerns over investor protection and market fragmentation, but Concannon has claimed Bitcoin commodity markets ""are developing quickly.""""While the current Bitcoin futures trading volumes on Cboe Futures Exchange and CME (CME) may not currently be sufficient to support ETPs seeking 100% long or short exposure to Bitcoin, Cboe expects these volumes to continue to grow and in the near future reach levels comparable to those of other commodity futures products at the time that they were included in ETPs,"" Concannon said in his letter.He also stated that being able to invest in digital currencies through an ETP would ""provide a more transparent and easily accessible vehicle for gaining such exposure.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Before You Buy Bitcoin, Read ThisStill Bullish On Bitcoin?

401,CME,"Major stock indexes turned lower in afternoon trading Tuesday, unable to hold early gains despite another tame reading in consumer inflation before the open.X Semiconductor names Micron Technology (MU), Broadcom (AVGO) and Intel (INTC) were early outperformers in the Nasdaq 100, but gains  faded for all three. Late Monday, President Trump blocked a proposed merger between Broadcom and Qualcomm (QCOM), citing national security concerns. A nearly-7% intraday gain for Micron faded to less than 1% late Tuesday, while a 4% gain for Intel morphed to less than 0.5%.The Nasdaq composite fared the worst, falling 0.9%, but after seven straight gains, some consolidation isn't out of the ordinary. The S&P 500 lost 0.5% and the Dow Jones industrial average gave back 0.4%. Volume on the Nasdaq was tracking higher than Monday's level. NYSE volume was on pace to be slightly lower.General Electric (GE) lagged in Dow, falling 4%, after JPMorgan reiterated its underperform rating and cut GE's price target to 11 from 14.Consumer inflation in February was another nonevent as prices overall rose 0.2%, with the core rate also up 0.2%. Both numbers matched expectations. Year-over-year, core prices rose 1.8%, slightly below the consensus estimate of 1.9%, according to Econoday.Even as inflation data remain tame, the market is still expecting a quarter-point hike at the March 21 Federal Reserve meeting, putting the chances at around 89% according to the CME FedWatch Tool.In the stock market today, Century Aluminum (CENX) showed bullish price action after flashing a sell signal from a 20.78 buy point. Shares gapped above the 50-day moving average, rising around 7%. BMO Capital Markets on Monday upgraded shares to outperform from market perform and raised its price target to 28 from 20, citing positive effects from recently announced tariffs by the Trump administration. The aluminum producer has the look of a compelling turnaround story after some softness in earnings and sales last year. Full-year profit is expected to jump 210% this year and 52% in 2019.On the downside, Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) slumped 3% after reporting earnings before the open.

402,CME,"With Bitcoin and other coins in the cryptocurrency market still making headlines on a near-daily basis, investors want to know: Can they get in on the digital currency craze, too?X The answer depends on whether you want to actively trade Bitcoin futures or an investment trust — and if you qualify to do so. Because Bitcoin trading is still in its infancy relative to say, government-backed dollars or gold, it can be highly risky.Still, millennial- and smartphone-friendly app Robinhood on Thursday announced it would allow customers in five states to trade cryptocurrencies for no commission fee, starting in February. It's now letting clients monitor market data and create custom alerts for 16 cryptocurrencies.Three of the five companies featured in this year's Best Online Brokers report allow Bitcoin futures trading for a select group of clients. The other two let users see Bitcoin quotes and/or offer digital currency tracking services. All five are keeping a close eye on developments in the cryptocurrency market.And keep in mind — even if your broker doesn't allow cryptocurrency trading or you don't meet their requirements to do so, you can still get exposure indirectly via Bitcoin or blockchain-related stocks and mutual funds or exchange traded funds holding those or Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC).Let's start with Fidelity Investments. The Boston-based fund giant does not currently offer Bitcoin trading. But it's been actively monitoring and showing interest in the digital currency field. ""I love this stuff — Bitcoin, Ethereum, blockchain technology — and what the future holds,""  CEO Abigail Johnson told attendees at the Consensus 2017 conference in May.And in August, the Boston-based fund giant announced a partnership between its Fidelity Labs unit and digital wallet provider Coinbase that allows Fidelity clients to track their cryptocurrency balances in their accounts. While Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market are on Fidelity's radar, according to brokerage services head Ram Subramanian, its view for the time being is that cryptocurrency trades are ""not an appropriate dealer offering.""Likewise, Charles Schwab is taking a wait-and-see approach and does not currently offer Bitcoin futures trading for its clients. But it began displaying real-time Bitcoin futures quotes on its StreetSmart Central and StreetSmart Mobile platforms in December.""On cryptocurrencies, we're actively evaluating and weighing the risks to ensure client interests are protected before we make cryptocurrencies available,"" Schwab spokesman Michael Cianfrocca told IBD. ""Most of the client questions we're getting are more educational in nature — what they are and how they work vs. asking for the ability to invest in or trade at this point.""Given the still untested and volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, most online brokers that allow Bitcoin futures trading impose higher margin requirements than the exchanges. They also tend to limit access to more sophisticated traders with amply funded accounts to cover potentially high risk.TradeStation allows its futures account holders to trade Bitcoin futures on both Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) and CME Group (CME).""We believe that CME's launch of the new Bitcoin futures contract represents a major milestone in the development of cryptocurrency derivatives markets that appear to be more fair and transparent than trading the underlying cryptocurrency,"" John Bartleman, president of TradeStation Group, said in a statement. ""We're excited to support CME's new offering from the first day of trading and to extend to TradeStation clients the opportunity to trade this emerging market.""TD Ameritrade is testing the waters. It offers access to CBOE Bitcoin futures (XBT) via the broker's thinkorswim platform and TD Ameritrade Mobile Trader app, but it's not available to all clients. You must be approved to trade futures in your account and meet certain criteria. The margin requirement for Bitcoin futures is currently 1.5 times higher than exchange margin requirements.""TD Ameritrade is purposely enabling certain subsets of customers to access these markets as part of a conservative and deliberate approach to this new marketplace and volatile product,"" the broker says on its website.IBD'S TAKE: Are Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies real investments or a speculator's game? Individual investors should be extremely cautious about diving into this new area. Read this feature about Bitcoin risks and possible gains first.Interactive Brokers offers trading for both CBOE (GXBT) and CME (BRR) Bitcoin futures. But in order to trade, customers are first required to obtain trading permissions from Interactive for U.S. Crypto Futures. The margin requirement is 50% for long investments. The broker didn't allow customers to short Bitcoin futures initially, but decided to do so in mid-December for CBOE futures, citing client demand.Interactive charges $5.51 per contract for the CBOE futures and $15.01 per contract for the CME futures. Those rates include broker commission, plus exchange, regulatory and clearing fees.Though some investors can now trade Bitcoin futures, it's important to keep in mind that the cryptocurrency market is still young and largely untested. Those who have been watching Bitcoin's price, futures or Bitcoin Investment Trust have seen over the past two months just how volatile the currency and its related investments can be.As Interactive Brokers' website warns: ""Trading in Bitcoin futures is especially risky and is only for clients with a high risk tolerance and the financial ability to sustain losses.""Want to read more about the other top brokers, the latest commission trends and more?

403,CME,"The U.S. economy added 313,000 jobs in February, while the unemployment rate held at 4.1%, the Labor Department said on Friday.X Average hourly wages rose 4 cents to $26.75 an hour, up a tame 2.6% from a year earlier. That missed consensus expectations of 2.9% rise. January's wage gain, originally reported as a 2.9% rise, was revised down to 2.8%.Wall Street expected a gain of 205,000 jobs and 4.0% jobless rate.December and January payrolls were revised up by a combined 54,000.After the jobs report, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 futures moved significantly higher on the stock market today. The S&P 500 index, which closed a point below its 50-day moving average on Thursday, reclaimed that key level at Friday's open.The 10-year Treasury yield rose a few basis points to 2.9% but the jobs and wage data didn't substantially bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to add an extra interest-rate hike in 2018.Despite the blowout jobs number, the data may give stocks a tad more running room before Fed hike expectations begin to bite, but investors shouldn't take too much comfort.While the data don't show that Goldilocks-type wage gains are history, bigger pay gains are likely coming this spring, reflecting recently announced wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX), which don't show up yet in the February jobs report.And as those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. This week, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.The retail sector added 50,000 jobs, while construction employment surged 61,000 and manufacturers hired a net 31,000.The likely combination of low and falling unemployment with accelerating wage gains would fit perfectly with the Phillips curve theory that has long guided Federal Reserve policy. As far as investors are concerned, the key point is that most Fed policymakers still seem pretty confident that inflation pressures won't follow too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

404,CME,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowThat's why an interest-rate scare is looking possible, even if a legitimate inflation scare doesn't materialize.The competitive environment facing Kroger from Walmart and Amazon.com (AMZN) via its Whole Foods division, among others, offers at least some reason to doubt whether wage pressure will feed through to higher prices. Kroger said on Thursday that it will use one-third of its tax cut to boost shareholder returns, but the other two-thirds will go to higher wages and lower prices.Kroger gave weak profit guidance as it forecast smaller profit margins, sending shares crashing 12% on Thursday.Walmart's minimum-wage hike to $11 an hour was its first for new, entry-level workers since 2015, when it raised its minimum wage to $9 an hour. Then, in early 2016, Walmart hiked pay for all current associates to a minimum of $10 an hour, leading Target, Costco (COST) and others to raise their own wages. The point is that wage hikes can come in bunches. It didn't really happen last year, when wage growth hit a bit of a lull. But it does appear to be happening in 2018.If it does, Wall Street will continue to bump up odds for a fourth rate hike in 2018. Already those odds are about 1 in 3, up from about 20% a month ago, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:These Three Dow Jones Stocks Are Near Buy Points As 2 FANGs Make Bullish MoveThe Big Picture: This Is The Real News For InvestorsHere Are 10 Chip Stocks Breaking Out, Hitting New Highs Or Setting UpWhat Do Facebook, Grubhub, Salesforce And Epam Have In Common?

405,CME,"Bitcoin rebounded Tuesday after briefly undercutting the key $10,000 support area once again as South Korea banned the use of anonymous bank accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges and U.S. regulators signaled more scrutiny into companies suddenly pivoting to blockchain technology.X South Korea, which accounts for 20% of global Bitcoin transactions, said the new ruling will begin at the end of the month and will ban foreigners without local bank accounts and children under 19 from purchasing Bitcoin.But the crackdown may be a precursor to a larger one as Seoul considers banning all crypto trading.Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it will be monitoring companies' names and business models to ensure they aren't just taking advantage of investors.""The SEC is looking closely at the disclosures of public companies that shift their business models to capitalize on the perceived promise of distributed-ledger technology,"" Chairman Jay Clayton told an audience at a Northwestern law school conference, according to Bloomberg.Long Island Iced Tea changed its name to Long Blockchain (LBCC) in December, sending shares soaring 183% over the name change. In October, an animal hormone production seller Bioptix changed its name to Riot Blockchain (RIOT) with the intent of investing in the blockchain space. Eastman Kodak (KODK) jumped over 200% after announcing it was creating Kodakcoin earlier this month, and Hooters operator Chanticleer Holdings (BURG) said it was getting a cryptocurrency loyalty program.Bitcoin's spot price was $11,119.59 on CoinDesk, after briefly undercutting $10,000.

Among Bitcoin-related stocks, Riot Blockchain rose 0.6% on the stock market today, Long Blockchain tumbled 5.1%, Overstock.com (OSTK) rose 4.5%, and Marathon Patent Group (MARA) advanced 1.5%.IBD'S TAKE: It is crucial for investors to understand the difference between cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, and the blockchain software programs that enable them. It is also important to get a feel for just how speculative digital monies like Bitcoin are right now before investing directly in the currencies or through related exchange traded funds or stocks.While regulators look at curtailing Bitcoin, Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman confirmed to CNBC the exchange is looking at Bitcoin futures but didn't say when or if a launch would happen.""We are continuing to investigate the idea of a cryptocurrency futures (contract) with a partner and we continue to look at the risk management around that, making sure we are putting the right protocols in place, making sure there's proper demand, and that the contract is different from what's already out there,"" Friedman told CNBC.Cboe (CBOE) and CME Group (CME) have already launched Bitcoin futures.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And Trends

406,CME,"Federal Reserve policymakers saw ""substantial underlying economic momentum,"" but continued to back gradual interest rate hikes, according to newly released minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee policy meeting on Jan. 30-31.Fed officials raised their economic forecasts from December predictions, with the Trump tax cuts and the stock market soaring to record highs last month buoying short-term growth prospects. But policymakers said ""gradual policy firming would be appropriate.""  Policymakers predicted ""labor market conditions would strengthen further"" but saw few signs of heavy wage pressures.X  That initially eased fears that the Fed might be more aggressive in 2018, but not for long.The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite initially added to already-solid gains following the Fed minutes release, with all three rising more than 1%. But the Nasdaq reversed to close down 0.2%. The S&P 500 sank 0.55% and the Dow Jones fell 0.7%, after both had retaken their 50-day moving averages intraday.The 10-year Treasury yield, which edged lower soon after the report, rose 4 basis points to 2.94%, hitting fresh four-year highs.Treasury yields have risen sharply in 2018 on strong global economic growth, accelerating wage gains and the U.S. getting a one-two punch of fiscal stimulus from tax cuts and higher government spending. That helped trigger the recent, short stock market correction.The markets have largely priced in three rate hikes in 2018, starting with a quarter-point move at the March meeting, but a fourth hike has been less likely.The odds of four hikes this year has risen to about 29%, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.

That's better than the 1.7% yield for the S&P 500.Meanwhile, at least 10 additional companies in the same industry group hold a Composite Rating of 90 or higher on a scale of 1 to 99, including Teledyne Tech (TDY), Heico (HEI), Curtiss-Wright (CW), Rockwell Collins (COL), Spirit Aerosystems (SPR), Huntington Ingalls (HII), General Dynamics (GD) and KLX (KLXI).You can compare all of the IBD Ratings of each of these stocks with peers in the same industry group by using Stock Checkup to speed your fundamental analysis. Focus on those with rising relative strength lines, which are painted in blue in all IBD charts. A fast-rising RS line means a stock is sharply outperforming the S&P 500.At 3 p.m. ET, the Dow utility average shot more than 2.2% higher, beating gains of 1.3% to 1.5% for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite. The Dow Jones industrial average gained nearly 0.6% as 12 of the 30 components rallied 1 point or more.The Dow utilities group is a big laggard so far in 2018, falling as much as 17% below its December peak of 778. Yet these dividend-rich defensive plays are getting relief from reports that members of the Federal Reserve's FOMC policy board are hinting at a continued ""go slow"" approach toward raising the cost of money.While a quarter-point hike in the short-term fed funds rate is likely in the bag during next month's meeting on interest rates, futures traders still see less than a 40% chance that, by year's end, the Fed would raise the fed funds rate by more than three times. The current target range is 1.25%-1.5%, and the majority of futures traders tracked by CME Group see the range rising to 2%-2.25%.That rate would still be much lower than the expected 12-month forward earnings yield of the S&P 500, which is around 5% to 5.5%, depending on which Wall Street investment strategist you trust.Meanwhile, investors bought back long-term bonds. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond edged down to 2.88%. Earlier in the week, the yield hit as high as 2.95%, creeping closer to the January 2014 peak of 3.04%, a key psychological level for institutional investors.Going back to the military supplier group, Huntington Ingalls recently broke out of a three-month flat base with a 253.54 buy point. The 5% buy zone goes up to 266.22.Notice on the submarine and Navy class destroyer builder's daily chart that Huntington's relative strength line has ascended into new high ground, a bullish sign.KLX is finding buying support at the 50-day moving average for the second time since its breakout from a cup-shaped base at 54.50 on Oct. 3.The first and second pullbacks to the 50-day or 10-week line can offer a timely entry to establish a new position in a leading stock or to add a small amount of shares to a winning core position.Among the FAANG stocks, Google search engine operator Alphabet (GOOGL) looked poised to finish a second straight week up. The internet content titan is up just 0.5% to 1,115.40, but Friday's advance is the eighth in 10 sessions. The stock is also up more than 2.5% for the week.Like the Nasdaq itself, Alphabet has turned in an impressive rebound after tickling its 200-day moving average Feb. 9.See on a daily chart how the megacap tech ($775 billion in market value, which is share price times shares outstanding) bounced sharply off its intraday low on Feb. 9, then finished up big in whale-like volume. That's bullish.For now, Alphabet is in a new base, less than 7% below its all-time peak of 1,197. The recent correction of 17% from head to toe is too deep to be a potential flat base. The correction is also too narrow in time to serve as a cup or a cup with handle. So keep watching.Also keep an eye on Alphabet's proprietary ratings.The Relative Price Strength Rating is not great, but at 78 on IBD Stock Checkup it's decent for a mature large cap. The very best growth companies tend to show an RS Rating in the high 80s or more. However, Alphabet, for now, should be viewed as a potential new big cap leader.Alphabet's Composite Rating is grand at 98.Elsewhere, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rallied more than 6% to 17.82 following positive reports that South Korea in fact may allow certain types of transactions in digital currencies. However, as noted frequently in IBD's Stock Market Today columns, the closed end fund has a very long way to go before forming a legitimate new base and staging a potential new breakout point.Universal Display (OLED) got hammered again, falling 15% to 131 in massive volume. The expert in organic light-emitting diodes for TVs and smartphone displays reported stout earnings growth, up 69%, as revenue jumped 55% to $115.9 million.However, the former stock market leader had already triggered two key sell signals: 1) Universal slammed beneath its 50-day moving average in huge trade on Jan. 24-25; and 2) the stock triggered the golden rule of investing as it slid 8% below the most recent late-stage base buy point of 192.85.In other markets, the persistent rise in crude oil seems to confirm the recent weakness in the U.S. dollar as well as optimism over the global economy, not just OPEC's continued willingness to limit its production.WTI near-term futures rose 1.3% to $63.58 a barrel, marking a three-week high. The year-to-date high for WTI is $66.14, last seen in late January. WTI prices have not touched the $70 level since late November of 2014.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on financial markets and top stocks.)RELATED:Can GE Stay In The Dow Jones Industrials?Finding Excellent Growth Stocks: Who Are New Hot IPOs?How The Time The Stock Market: Does Every Follow-Through Work Out?What Is The Current Stock Market Direction?How To Build A Good Watch List: Check These Stocks And The Annotated Charts

408,CME,"One of the world's biggest Bitcoin markets may be easing up on a threatened cryptocurrency crackdown, as Bitcoin continued a recent strong rebound.X South Korea's financial regulator said Tuesday the government will support ""normal transactions"" of cryptocurrencies, three weeks after banning digital currency trades through anonymous bank accounts, according to the government-affiliated Yonhap News. The South Korean government also will ""encourage"" banks to work with cryptocurrency exchanges, the report said.The statements helped to buoy Bitcoin early Tuesday, with its prices notably higher on Korean cryptocurrency exchanges including Bithumb and Upbit compared with other global markets.Bitcoin rose 5% to $11,720.48 on Tuesday, after regaining $11,000 on Monday, according to Coindesk. Bitcoin has nearly doubled since briefly undercutting $6,000 on Feb. 6. Ethereum and Ripple fell nearly 2% while Litecoin jumped 10%.Cryptocurrencies fell sharply in January following reports that Korea was considering an outright ban on cryptocurrency exchanges to calm the country's overheated market for digital currencies.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersKorea's tough stance on cryptocurrencies also came as the nation tried to prevent virtual coins from being used for money laundering and other illegal activities. On Sunday, Yonhap reported that a South Korean government official who helped create laws to tackle cryptocurrency speculation was found dead at his home in Seoul.Jung Ki-joon, 52, may have suffered a heart attack while sleeping, police said. His colleagues said job-related stress may have led to his death. The Wall Street Journal quoted a government spokesperson as saying Jung died ""from some unknown cause.""Bitcoin prices surged much higher in South Korea than other parts of the world, leading traders to coin the phrase ""kimchi premium"" to describe the phenomenon, the Journal said. Bitcoin peaked around $19,500 in mid-December — over $20,000 in early CME Bitcoin futures — then lost nearly 70% of its value by early February as regulators around the world, especially South Korea and China, stepped up curbs on the newfangled assets. Bitcoin only retook the $10,000 mark last Thursday.Among Bitcoin-related stocks and equities, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) jumped 12% on the stock market today to recover the 50-day moving average, Marathon Patent Group (MARA) rose 1.1% and Overstock.com (OSTK) rallied 1.25%.Riot Blockchain (RIOT) fell 4.7% in choppy trade as it struggled to find support after tumbling 33% Friday on a CNBC investigation.

409,CME,"It was a tale of two stock markets Tuesday as a disappointing earnings report and a 10% decline for Walmart (WMT) weighed on the Dow Jones industrial average, while strength in semiconductor stocks helped cushion a tiny decline for the Nasdaq composite.X Chip stocks were strong across the board, helped by a 6% rise in NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Qualcomm (QCOM) raised its bid significantly for NXP to 127.50 a share vs. a prior bid of 110 a share. Broadcom (AVGO) has been spurned so far by Qualcomm in its bid to acquire the San Diego-based company.At the close, the Dow slumped 1%, ending below the 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 gave back 0.6% and the Nasdaq fell less than 0.1%. Preliminary data showed volume in the stock market today coming in lower than Friday's levels. The Nasdaq on Friday snapped a five-session win streak. The NYSE indexes Tuesday ended six-session win streaks.Bitcoin was in rally mode again after South Korea's financial regulator said the government will support ""normal transactions"" of cryptocurrencies. According to CoinDesk data, Bitcoin was recently trading around $11,600, up 4%.The U.S. dollar index rallied 0.6% on the heels of Friday's 0.7% gain. The dollar is still in a downtrend, however. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield added 2 basis points to 2.89%. The greenback's strength wasn't good news for gold as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) gave back 1.3% to 126.24.Applied Materials (AMAT) extended its win streak to seven sessions, rising 3%. Shares jumped more than 14% last week on strong earnings. Applied Materials is working on a double-bottom base with a 58.83 buy point with strong signs of accumulation as the base forms.Meanwhile, a soft start for Domino's Pizza  (DPZ) ended up looking OK by the close despite a sales miss from the company early Tuesday. After falling more than 5% intraday, shares added 0.3%. Domino's first cleared a double-bottom base with a 211.85 entry, but volume was light. Today, it cleared an alternate entry of 222.01 in very heavy volume but ended below the buy point. Domino's was featured as a possible call-option trade in the latest Earnings Preview column.IBD'S TAKE: Domino's is one of several top-performing restaurant stocks in IBD's database. For a look at the other leaders in the group, consult an IBD Stock Checkup.Inside the IBD 50, China Lodging (HTHT) was a big winner, up 4% to 153.52. The stock rallied nicely after a breakout over a 142.90 buy point, but then it erased a double-digit gain from the buy point, good enough for a sell signal. But China Lodging is back above the 50-day line and showing relative strength again.Amex-listed Cheniere Energy (LNG) is showing good supporting action at the 10-week moving average for the first time after a breakout from a base with a 51.61 buy point.

412,CME,"Core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, rose a faster-than-expected 0.3% in January and 1.8% from a year ago, the Labor Department reported on Wednesday, raising the odds of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.X The overall consumer price index rose 0.5% on the month and 2.1% from a year ago, amid higher energy prices.Food at home prices rose 0.1% on the month as Amazon.com (AMZN) continues to inject even more intensive competition into the grocery business since closing its acquisition of Whole Foods last summer.Wall Street expected the core CPI to rise 0.2% on the month and 1.7% from a year ago. The consensus called for a 0.3% monthly and 2.0% annual rise in the broad CPI.After the report, futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite reversed from solid gains to down more than 1% at one point. The major averages fell modestly at the open but the Nasdaq led an upside reversal.Menawhile, the 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.88%, back at four-year highs. The odds of a Fed rate hike at the March meeting rose to 83.1% at CME Group's FedWatch Tool, up from 76.1% on Tuesday. There's now a 24.2% chance of four or more rate hikes in 2018, up from 17% on Tuesday.Separately, retail sales unexpectedly fell 0.3% in January and were flat excluding autos.The CPI report had been as a potential market mover as investors are suddenly nervous about the prospect of faster wage growth, rising inflation and a more aggressive Federal Reserve.The upside surprise in core prices came as prices for medical services rose 0.6% in month, coming after minimal increases over the past year that left the annual rise at 2.0%. Prices for transportation services rose 0.8% on the month and 4.0% on the year. Meanwhile, apparel prices jumped 1.7%, even as the annual trend remained down 0.7%IBD'S TAKE: After the Thursday, Feb. 1, market action — when the Dow Jones industrial average was still within 2% of its record high — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when will make sense to get aggressive again.Thanks to a just-arriving fiscal boost from tax cuts and more stimulus coming from last week's $320 billion deficit-hiking spending deal, the balance of economic risks has shifted to the upside. JPMorgan economists are now expecting the jobless rate to fall to 3.2% by the end of 2019, and they think the Fed could raise rates eight times by then.After January's jobs report showed that average hourly wage growth accelerated to 2.9% in January from a year ago, after being stuck around 2.5% for most of 2017, markets suddenly started to price in a risk that dormant wage and price inflation may shift into higher gear.Wage growth is seen a prelude to higher inflation, and there is reason to expect better wage gains, even if the wage acceleration that showed up in January's employment report was a misleading product of a shorter workweek.Walmart (WMT) announced in January that it was hiking base pay to $11 an hour, three years after it last announced a boost in starting pay to $9 an hour. Last week, CVS Health (CVS) said it also will adopt an $11 minimum wage in April. Both companies tied their wage hikes at least loosely to their tax cuts, but that's only part of the story. Competition for quality workers led Target (TGT) to boost its wage to $11 starting last October, when tax reform was still up in the air. At the time, Target made a commitment to raise its base wage to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. Starbucks (SBUX), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also are among the dozens of big employers who have hiked wages in the wake of tax cuts.Even with tax cuts, the risk that wage growth will feed through to higher inflation had appeared modest enough for investors to mostly discount, as consumers have grown to expect internet price transparency and the ever-expanding reach of Amazon to keep inflation in check.Those competitive dynamics and the need to boost productivity help explain why Walmart, even as it hiked its minimum wage in January, also shut dozens of Sam's Clubs employing about 10,000 workers, cut 3,500 store co-manager positions and thinned the ranks at its headquarters.If companies don't have the luxury of raising prices to offset higher wages, pay hikes stand to cut into profits, which is among the reasons that CVS shares traded lower after announcing wage increases.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why The Stock Market Sold Off, And What You Should Do NowThis Shock Economic Outlook May Keep Stock Market On EdgeHow Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

"
414,CME,"The Nasdaq composite led another broad-based rally Friday on the back of decent buying in the semiconductor, retail internet, internet content and other technology sectors to cap a rosy start to 2018.X The tech-rich index, up nearly 0.7% at around 3 p.m. ET, also got an assist from fast growing firms in the game software space, such as Electronic Arts (EA) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI). The former, up 5% to 112.46, reclaimed both its 50- and 200-day moving averages in swift trading, a positive sign. Watch for a potential new base to finish.Meanwhile, Activision, a nice winner in 2017, is also showing nice support at the 50- and 200-day moving averages lately, but there's clear upside price resistance near the 66-67 level.Stiff gains in heavier than usual volume are a bullish trend, for it hints at a strong appetite for equities by the institutional crowd, i.e. mutual funds, hedge funds, large investment advisors, banks, insurers and pension managers.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were not far behind, up around 0.5% to 0.6%. The Nasdaq is poised to finish the week up more than 3%. Six of the 30 Dow Jones industrial average components rallied 1 point or more.Another Dow 30 component, DowDuPont (DWDP), is having a terrific week, rising for a fourth straight session and moving further past a 73.95 entry in a sound flat base. Shares are up 1% to 75.28 in mildly below-average turnover.Keep an eye on the chemical giant's relative strength line, drawn in blue in all IBD and MarketSmith charts. A sharply rising line means a stock is sharply beating the S&P 500. That's one key to market outperformance for your portfolio. Also, if DowDuPont's RS line stretches into new high ground, that would also be bullish.Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) delivered a solid rebound, rising 6% to 2,347 and snapping a ""mild"" three-day losing streak.As noted in a Stock Market Today column earlier this week, the Bitcoin-tracking ETF is not at any proper buy point. Keep watching to see if it keeps the current correction to a reasonable decline.Given that Bitcoin Investment soared more than 1,500% last year, it's totally acceptable to see a drop in the 40% to 50% range off the 3,522 all-time peak. However, the market laws of supply and demand still apply. Over time, you want to see this and any other ETF or ETN (exchange-traded note) rise in higher or above-average trade, and fall in lighter turnover.Trading exchanges CME Group (CME) and Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) could be alternatives to playing the Bitcoin trend, but keep in mind that Bitcoin futures trading activity, while increasing, is still small for both of these companies relative to their gigantic business involved with equity index, option, fixed income and commodities derivatives.CME Group, up fractionally on Friday, got a solid bounce off the 50-day moving average earlier in the week. The stock may form a new base, but for now it's well extended after clearing a 128.06 buy point in a good flat base in active turnover on Sept. 6 last year.Meanwhile, government bond investors did not ruffle their feathers following a smaller than expected increase in monthly U.S. payrolls. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond, in fact, edged up to 2.47%, meaning that bond prices fell on selling pressure. The yield is still below a 2.62% peak seen in 2017, but one could reasonably expect the yield to continue rising amid broad expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise the cost of money perhaps three more times this year.In December 2015, the Fed pushed the fed funds rate on overnight loans to big banks from a near-zero level to a target range of 0.25%-0.5%. In December last year, the U.S. central bank raised rates for a fifth time, sending the fed funds rate to a 1.25%-1.5% range.RELATED:The Bull Market Is Still Hot: What Should You Do Now?Stocks Near A Buy ZoneA Screen For Excellent Growth Stocks: Inside IBD 50How To Achieve Great Long-Term Investing Returns In Stocks: Use This Simple Routine

415,CME,"Bitcoin traded sharply higher Friday, while rival cryptocurrency Ethereum pegged a new high and Ripple retreated from Thursday's record levels. Meanwhile multiple cryptocurrency debit card providers suspended service under orders from Visa (V) Europe.X Companies including Bitwala, Cryptopay, Wirex and TenX reportedly told customers that their prepaid cards would no longer function, though funds stored on cards are safe while they seek to resolve the issue with card issuer WaveCrest. The cards allow users to spend cryptocurrencies, mainly Bitcoin, at traditional brick-and-mortar retailers.In a statement to The Next Web, Visa is said to have clarified that its move was not a crackdown on cryptocurrencies, but action against one company that broke its rules.Meanwhile, amid a state crackdown in China, Bitcoin miners are setting up shop outside the country.Bitmain, an operator of two of China's largest Bitcoin-mining collectives, will establish regional headquarters in Singapore and now has mining operations in the U.S. and Canada, the company told Bloomberg.On the spot market, the price of Bitcoin was up 10% at  $16,731.48, according to CoinDesk.

Literally just say the word ""blockchain,"" apparently.X In the latest evidence that the shared record-keeping technology is this year's quickest way to give a stock an amphetamine-like jolt, Long Island Iced Tea  (LTEA) — which sells iced tea and what have you — said on Thursday that it is changing its name to Long Blockchain.Long Blockchain will focus on ""the exploration of and investment in opportunities that leverage the benefits of blockchain technology,"" according to a statement from the company. The company said it would request to change its trading symbol as well.

426,CME,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose slightly Monday morning, while Bitcoin's wild ride took another leg down.During Thursday's session, chip giants Intel (INTC) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) undercut recent breakouts while Facebook (FB) drifted below its 50-day moving average. Those issues come as energy stocks power up, with Chevron (CVX) among Thursday's powerful moves into buy zones.X S&P 500 futures rose 0.15% vs. fair value. Dow futures were up a fraction. Nasdaq 100 futures were slightly above fair value.Bitcoin futures were falling yet again this week, with CME and Cboe futures tumbling to about $14,100. CME futures opened trading on Sunday evening at $20,650. Several Bitcoin- and blockchain-related stocks were retreating as well.Long Blockchain (LTEA), which surged 183% on Thursday on its decision to change its name from Long Island Iced Tea, was down 31% in premarket action. Riot Blockchain (RIOT) lost 12% and Overstock.com (OSTK) 5.5%.Intel fell 1.7% to 46.76 in Thursday's stock market trading, dropping below a 47.40 buy point cleared on Wednesday. Volume was 44% above normal, slightly more than on Wednesday's breakout. However, Intel's action, by itself, is not that concerning or surprising.While you never want to see a stock fall below its entry point, Intel had surged 9.9% over four days in heavy volume from near the bottom of a cup-like base. Breakouts from cup bases without handles are less likely to succeed, because after a big run up, a pullback is natural as weak holders exit. The Dow technology giant could retake that buy point, ideally in robust trade.But other chip action renewed concerns about the broader chip sector.KLA-Tencor fell 3.4% to 108.62, easily dropping below the 110.11 entry crossed on Monday. Volume was below normal, suggesting big institutions weren't dumping shares. Then again, Monday's breakout volume was just OK, 9% above average. You want to see volume at least 40%-50% higher than normal on breakouts.Meanwhile, chip groups were among Thursday's losers with chip equipment down 2%. Few chip-equipment makers are trading above their 50-day lines, with ASML (ASML), Applied Materials (AMAT) among those finding resistance there recently. Among chipmakers, Micron Technology (MU) is still above that support area, but fell 2.9% Thursday. That erased more than half of Micron's 4% pop Wednesday following the memory giant's strong earnings and guidance.Facebook nudged down 0.25% to 177.45 on Thursday, barely undercutting its 50-day line. Since breaking out past a 175.59 buy point in late October, Facebook has made little progress, briefly dropping out of buy range a few weeks ago. Facebook's Relative Strength line has been nudging lower since the start of November, reflecting the FANG stock's underperformance in recent weeks.Facebook rival Snap (SNAP) sank 0.8% to 15.37 on Thursday. But that completed a handle in its first-ever proper consolidation. That lowers the potential entry slightly to 16.55 from 16.98. Keep in mind that Snap's new base is well below its highs, so the stock could face upside resistance. Also, the Snapchat operator is struggling with user growth and finding a path to profitability in the face of intense Facebook competition.Energy stocks and groups were market leaders for a second straight session. Oil prices are at two-year highs while Trump tax cuts should especially benefit the oil and gas industry.Chevron rose 3.25% to 124.82 on Thursday, retaking a 120.99 entry with volume that was nearly double normal. Concho Resources (CXO) also broke out on strong volume, while EOG Resources (EOG), BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) were among the oil stocks breaking out on less impressive trading. But those moves still added to the general optimism surrounding the sector.Diamondback Energy (FANG) surged 5%, becoming extended after leading the way with a high-volume breakout Wednesday.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: The Next Potential Pitfall In WashingtonThese Oil, Mining Stocks Hit Buy Zones On Global Growth, Trump Tax Cuts: Investing Action PlanArtificial Intelligence Software To Grow Nearly 30 Times By 2025You'll Never Guess Who's Pivoting To Blockchain NowHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

427,CME,"Bitcoin began 2017 trading under $1,000. Then it got much bigger. Investors big and small arrived, sometimes bailed hard — as they did on Friday — then arrived some more. Concerns were raised that Bitcoin barely qualified as money. Concerns were raised that its immense transaction volumes were swallowing up the world's energy. Comparisons to Dutch tulip mania piled up, and a securities regulator in December said ""We've seen mortgages being taken out to buy Bitcoin.""X Which all leads to one question for 2018: Is there any chance Bitcoin's jagged, face-melting run for the stratosphere might become a bit tamer?The advent of Bitcoin futures from Cboe (CBOE), CME Group (CME) and, eventually, Nasdaq (NDAQ), has the potential to reel Bitcoin back into orbit. A Bitcoin ETF in 2018? Certainly not impossible. Greater attention from regulators could help inform investors and stamp out fraud.After a week of some moderation on spot market, volatility has roared back in recent days. Shares of Bitcoin-related stocks like Riot Blockchain (RIOT), Marathon Patent Group (MARA) and Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) are also seeing big daily moves, while companies looking to rebrand themselves with blockchain such as Long Island Iced Tea (LTEA) and Net Element (NETE) keep jumping in. And other cryptocurrencies, especially Ethereum and Litecoin, have shot up in price recently.But most big banks are unlikely, for now, to gorge on the tulips, and it's still debatable whether treating Bitcoin like a normal investment will make it behave like one. Others wonder if investors are prepared for the more complicated world of investing next year that the futures will bring — to a market where 40% of all Bitcoins are reportedly in the possession of 1,000 holders who could, on a whim, lop thousands of dollars off its price.""So, someone who put in $10,000 now has $2 million in his account — does he know how to protect it when trading might go against him?"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, a managing director at financial analytics firm S3 Partners.IBD'S TAKE: Are Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies a speculator's game? Individual investors should be extremely cautious about diving into this new area. Read this feature about Bitcoin risks and potential gains.Those questions were perhaps underscored on Friday, when Bitcoin's price crumbled below $12,000, then picked up another $1,000 later in the day, after a week of warnings from financial officials abroad and worries about possible insider trading. Bitcoin futures contracts from Cboe and CME were tracking close to the price of Bitcoin itself.Futures contracts will allow investors to wager on whether Bitcoin's price will rise or fall without owning the cryptocurrency directly. If more investors, possibly anticipating a bubble, use the futures to bet on a drop in Bitcoin, that might help tap the brakes on cryptocurrency's feverish price increases, the reasoning goes.That short-selling would also allow investors to hedge against their long bets on Bitcoin and make plays in the market more easily.""So if I bought Bitcoin at $200, and it's trading at $15,000, I might want to hedge out some of that without actually selling my Bitcoin,"" Dusaniwsky said. ""And this might be much easier with futures, to get in and out of that position intraday.""The contracts would also have trading and price limits, and could open a pathway for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund that would trade on the stock market — a development Dusaniwsky said was likely in 2018. Cboe this filed with the SEC to list six Bitcoin ETFs. The more securities available overall, the more opportunity to short. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the company that owns the New York Stock Exchange, also wants to offer a Bitcoin ETF.The massive retail brokerage TD Ameritrade (AMTD) said this month that it will let some clients trade Cboe's Bitcoin futures, and rival E-Trade Financial (ETFC) followed days later. Also this month, Interactive Brokers (IBKR) said it would allow customers to make some bets against those futures.Last week, there were some indications that short-sellers may have moved in and tempered the markets. Bloomberg reported at that time that the price of Cboe's Bitcoin futures, which cost up to 13% more than Bitcoin itself, had over a few days drifted much closer to the spot price of the cryptocurrency.But not everyone is convinced that Bitcoin futures will mellow out cryptocurrency markets.""While the futures markets help bring traditional financial institutions into the space, they do encourage speculation rather than owning the underlying asset and are unlikely to dampen volatility,"" Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research, said in an email, noting that a Bitcoin ETF or mutual fund would instead be more helpful in easing volatility.Any short-sellers would also be betting against a cryptocurrency whose price has ballooned more than 1,300% since the beginning of 2017. While short-selling seems likely, there might not be as much of it as many are anticipating.""Number 1, short-sellers aren't gluttons for punishment,"" Dusaniwsky said. ""With Bitcoin going up $1,000 a day some days, I don't see these guys jumping into the short side, just doing outright short positions, on a whim.""Financial institutions might be fine with letting their customers make futures trades, but the big banks are largely staying away from doing it themselves.But Goldman Sachs (GS) is setting up a trading desk for cryptocurrencies and hopes to have it running by the end of June, sources told Bloomberg Thursday.That would make Goldman the first of Wall Street's top trading firms to jump into the crypto-mania. Peers like Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) are waiting to see what what happens.Bitcoin futures are too new and too small, with too little regulatory underpinning, for the banks to get into right now, said CFRA analyst Ken Leon before the Goldman news broke.The volatile cryptocurrency isn't exactly fodder for banks' wealth management divisions, either. Banks, who have tried to detox from the high-risk investments that battered them during the financial crisis, would also have to calculate the potential loss risk of any asset tied to Bitcoin.""I wouldn't expect to see JPMorgan (JPM) involved anytime soon,"" said Clyde Tinnen, a corporate-finance partner at the law firm Withers Bergman, which advises clients on cryptocurrency markets.But hedge funds are getting in the game. Fortress Investment Group and Horizon Kinetics have purchased Bitcoin recently, while executives from firms like Quantbot Technologies and Steven Cohen's Cubist Systematic Strategies recently met to discuss how they could profit from cryptocurrencies, according to the Wall Street Journal.Still, as Bitcoin's price has scorched higher, and as startup entrepreneurs attach the ""crypto"" prefix to whatever's trending, the Securities and Exchange Commission has started to notice. The agency in December stopped at least two initial coin offerings — a form of digital fundraising — that it deemed suspicious or in violation of securities laws.The SEC has also issued advice to investors to avoid getting conned, and even urged caution when considering celebrities' promotions of things like ICOs — an announcement that came after Floyd Mayweather, Jr., Paris Hilton and a few others have thrown their support behind them. ""Any celebrity or other individual who promotes a virtual token or coin that is a security must disclose the nature, scope, and amount of compensation received in exchange for the promotion,"" the agency warned in November, later adding that those celebrity endorsers ""often do not have sufficient expertise to ensure … compliance with federal securities laws.""But as Bitcoin exchanges strain under the weight of more interest and more serious money, disputes among developers over how best to speed transactions through the network seem likely to resurface in 2018.Disagreement over how to proceed has led two ""fork"" currencies that have formed out of Bitcoin: Bitcoin Cash, in August, and Bitcoin Gold, in October. Those cryptocurrencies use different algorithms and equipment and have different sizes of the blocks of code that store transaction information.As that debate goes on, or as Bitcoin's price drifts out of reach, investors could turn their attention to lower-profile, lower-drama currencies such as Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Ethereum, Litecoin and others.""Some of them could even gain advantage in the future by offering better compliance with regulatory requirements,"" JPMorgan analysts said in a research note in December.As more people have piled into Bitcoin, the doubt from bigger names in the financial world has built up on a daily basis. Most recently, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said Bitcoin's presence in the payments landscape was still very small. But she said, as others have, that it was ""not a stable store of value"" and ""highly speculative."" UBS' global chief economist called Bitcoin the ""bubble to end all bubbles"". Brian Armstrong, the co-counder and CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, said in a December blog post: ""Please invest responsibly.""""Most of the investors that I talk to, they look at Bitcoin truly as a commodity,"" Tinnen said, adding that they tend to guard against the cryptocurrency's occasional stabs downward with defensive investments elsewhere. ""I have to say that they are very enthusiastic, and sometimes that enthusiasm means that they are not always taking as clear-eyed a view as they should in order to hedge it.""Others, Dusaniwsky said, might not be the kind of traders you typically see on the stock market. They might not be familiar with the investment vehicles that are coming into the market. They might not know how to use, say, stop-loss orders, he said, or otherwise trade their positions more professionally, if the up-market this year heads south.""You've got a lot of sheep that are long Bitcoin,"" he said, ""and the wolves might be starting to get into the market.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:SEC Has This Advice For Investors In Bitcoin, Other CryptocurrenciesBefore You Buy Bitcoin, Read ThisStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

428,CME,"The Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday temporarily suspended trading in securities of Crypto Co. (CRCW), a blockchain technology and consulting company whose stock has soared this month, citing concerns about what it described as murky financials and ""potentially manipulative"" stock transactions.X The move comes as the agency tightens its scrutiny of blockchain and cryptocurrency companies, amid worries about an investment bubble and fraud. The SEC in recent weeks has stopped at least two initial coin offerings that raised its suspicions, and issued investing advice on cryptocurrencies.The suspension of Crypto Co. took hold at 9:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday and will run until 11:59 p.m. ET on Jan. 3, the agency said.Before trading was halted, shares of Crypto Co. finished 12.3% higher at 575.00 on Monday.

""because of concerns regarding the accuracy and adequacy of information in the marketplace about, among other things, the compensation paid for promotion of the company, and statements in Commission filings about the plans of the company's insiders to sell their shares of The Crypto Company's common stock.""The agency also said that questions arose ""concerning potentially manipulative transactions in the company's stock in November 2017.""The company began trading in September. Its stock has exploded this month, swelling more than 3,000% since Dec. 1.The Crypto Company last week announced a 10-for-1 stock split, saying that its shares had ""experienced a recent surge in value and demand, in correlation with the Q4 rise of the entire digital currency market.""""We are aware of the recent fluctuation in our stock, and want to see orderly market activity surrounding the trading of our stock,"" CEO Mike Poutre said in a statement announcing the split. ""Splitting the stock will increase our float of free trading shares and is the responsible thing to do.""In that statement, he urged caution among investors, and said a lot of companies were ""taking advantage of the euphoria associated with this space, and we do not want be associated with them.""In late November, the company said it had agreed to acquire, via a subsidiary, a majority interest in Coin Tracking e.K., a company based in Germany that aggregates cryptocurrency data and provides portfolio-monitoring services for digital assets.RELATED:SEC Has This Advice For Investors In Bitcoin, Other CryptocurrenciesBitcoin Futures, Spot Prices Converge After CME Trading DebutBefore You Buy Bitcoin, Read This

The ETF, which marks its eighth anniversary next month, has gathered $2.1 billion in assets.

432,CME,"Bitcoin continued its ascent on Wednesday a day after derivatives marketplace giant CME Group (CME) said it would launch bitcoin futures by year-end.XThe cryptocurrency was up 1.5% at to $6543.06 on Wednesday evening after spiking 5.5% on Tuesday. While bitcoin has surged in value this year, its rise has frequently been tripped up by remarks from skeptics — among them JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, who has called it a ""fraud"" — who believe bitcoin's failure is inevitable.The bitcoin futures contract will be cash-settled, CME said in a Tuesday release. CME CEO Terry Duffy said the decision to launch a bitcoin futures contract, similar to those of commodities like silver or gold, followed ""increasing client interest in the evolving cryptocurrency markets.""CME's move also comes as the global financial system weighs the degree to which bitcoin should be treated as a currency or a commodity. The Chicago Board Options Exchange, the biggest such U.S. exchange, hopes to offer bitcoin futures late this year or early 2018.IBD'S TAKE: JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon has made clear his doubts about bitcoin. Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said the digital currency was ""Enron in the making."" The man known as ""Bitcoin Jesus"" has fewer doubts.Other big financial institutions have also been trying to respond to the growing interest of their clients.  The ETF provider ProShares filed for a bitcoin ETF, following applications from others that fell through earlier this year. Goldman Sachs (GS), meanwhile, has also reportedly considered whether to develop a bitcoin trading platform.Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman's CEO, and Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman have signaled more openness to the bitcoin.

433,CME,"Major indexes traded mostly flat in afternoon trading Wednesday, leading some observers to believe that the expected major tax reform legislation has already been baked into the stock market's advance. However, another view could be that U.S. equities are holding on to solid gains for the fourth quarter and are not showing any signs of heavy selling.XMeanwhile, one of the hottest exchange traded funds dropped hard for a second straight session, but the two-day correction for Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) looks normal after a 250% run-up from a Nov. 22 breakout past 985.10 in a deep cup with handle.Bitcoin Investment Trust fell as much as 24.8% intraday and briefly undercut its short-term 10-day moving average. The ETF is now down 16% to 2,518, still holding a 155% post-breakout gain.At 2:30 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite was still trading flat, but at 6964 the tech-rich index is still up nearly 0.4% for the week and holding a 7.2% gain since Oct. 1. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average squeezed out fractional gains. Volume is running mildly lower vs. the same time Tuesday on both main exchanges.Steel, oil and gas, metal ores, air freight and gold mining shares led the market's upside, offsetting sharp drops in desktop software, tobacco, dairy, hospital, restaurant and electric utility stocks.The Dow utility average, sinking 1% and 1.6% on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, sank another 0.4% amid a rebound in interest rates. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note is trying to clear 2.50%.The CME Group's Fed Watch tool now shows a 56% probability that the Federal Reserve will hike the fed funds rate on overnight bank loans by a quarter point to a 1.5%-1.75% target range when it meets on March 21, 2018. As noted in a prior IBD Stock Market Today column, Bitcoin Investment has had such a monster run that the 50-day moving average is irrelevant as a technical tool to determine the right time to sell the hot security. Instead, a clean break of the 10-day line would be a good trigger for holders to capture at least partial profits in a core position.Bitcoin, which now trades a record 112,000 shares on average over the past 50 sessions, broke out of a deep yet satisfactory cup with handle on Nov. 22 by surpassing the high of the handle at 985 by 10 cents. Add 10 cents to the highest price within a handle in good bases such as the cup, saucer or double bottom to determine the correct entry point.Among big and megacap techs, Apple (AAPL) continues to do just fine. However, Monday's breakout from a new flat base at 176.34 has failed to bear fruit so far. Shares are virtually break-even at 174.43, hovering just below the proper entry.While Monday's nice gain showed little gusto in terms of volume, on Friday the iPhone marketer showed heavy institutional activity as shares rose 1%. In that session, 40.2 million shares exchanged hands, 49% above the stock's 50-day average. That's a sign of persistent demand ever since Apple broke out of a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12 in early January.Go to that breakout and volume was limp. But investors were waiting for quarterly results. And volume gushed higher on Feb. 1 after Apple began reporting its string of new year-over-year increases in both the top and bottom lines.Earnings in that December-ended fiscal first quarter edged up 2% to $3.36 a share, halting a three-quarter slide. Then earnings ramped up 11%, 18% and 24% in the next three quarters.Wall Street sees profit rising 12% to $3.77 a share in the December-ending fiscal first quarter of FY 2018 on a 10% pick-up in sales to $86.23 billion.Meanwhile, Concho Resources (CXO), a former big market winner, rose more than 3% to 144.46 in slightly higher than normal turnover and is close to surpassing a new 147.87 buy point in a nearly six-week flat base.That flat base sits on top of a much larger, wilder base that has elements of both a double bottom and a cup with handle. See the mild three-week pullback in October? The 6.2% drop from 137.28 to 128.86 generated a good handle that showed quiet volume and a downward slant along the lows.Both of these elements are necessary ingredients for a good handle, which is essentially a final shakeout of uncommitted shareholders before the stock sees a big jump in institutional demand, sparking a breakout.Concho, which specializes in the Permian Basin and West Texas, is staging a solid turnaround in fundamentals. It showed falling earnings and net losses for eight straight quarters through Q3 of 2016. But in the past two quarters, Concho has boosted profit 100% and 41% on revenue gains of 43% and 46%.The relatively weak 69 RS Rating, as seen in Stock Checkup, reflects the stock's long basing action. Watch to see if that rating improves quickly. The EPS Rating is 68 on a scale from 1 to 99, but that masks Wall Street's consensus estimate for earnings to rise 150% this year to $1.85 a share and up 28% to $2.36 in 2018.West Texas Intermediate near-term oil futures jumped 0.8% to $58 a barrel. Brent crude also rallied 0.8% to $64.33.Elsewhere, some biotechs are making a slow comeback. Biogen (BIIB) rallied and is working on the right side of a new base that so far has the dimensions of a flat base.

436,CME,"Some of the world's biggest derivatives brokerages criticized plans by U.S. exchanges to offer bitcoin futures and options, saying the contracts have been rushed to market without proper consideration of the risks.The brokerages, who laid out their concerns in an open letter via the Futures Industry Association on Wednesday, said exchanges failed to get enough feedback from market participants on margin levels, trading limits, stress tests and clearing. Highlighting bitcoin's elevated volatility and reliance on unregulated venues for pricing, the brokerages also questioned whether exchanges had the tools to prevent market manipulation.Misgivings among the FIA's members, who include Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), underscore the controversy surrounding bitcoin as it moves from the fringes of finance toward the mainstream. CME Group (CME) and Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) both used an expedited self-certification process to approve the listing of bitcoin futures, hoping to tap investor demand after the cryptocurrency's more than 1,400% rally this year.""A more thorough and considered process would have allowed for a robust public discussion among clearing member firms, exchanges and clearinghouses,"" the FIA said in its letter, which was addressed to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and signed by FIA Chief Executive Officer Walt Lukken.IBD'S TAKE: Are Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies real investments or a speculator's game?

Read this feature about Bitcoin risks and possible gains first.  While the letter is unlikely to change the exchanges' plans, it raises questions about how many brokerages will participate once bitcoin derivatives start trading later this month. Some dealers, particularly the so-called clearing members required to stand behind client trades, are concerned about their exposure if the cryptocurrency's extreme volatility leads to trader defaults. There should have been a public discussion about whether a separate guarantee fund — used to limit the impact of defaults — was warranted for the new contracts, the FIA said.The exchanges were allowed to offer bitcoin products after pledging to regulators that they comply with the law. Cboe will start trading futures on Dec. 10, while CME's contracts are set to debut on Dec. 18. The products will be subject to CFTC oversight.Bitcoin, which surged past $17,000 for the first time on Thursday before retreating Friday, has received mixed reviews on Wall Street. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has called the cryptocurrency ""a fraud,"" while Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, said recently that it's too early for his bank to need a bitcoin strategy. Franklin Templeton's Mark Mobius called it a bubble, but added that ""bubbles can last a long time."" Some hedge funds are waiting for futures to bet against it, more than half a dozen people trading the assets told Bloomberg News.The FIA said its members have reservations about the reliability of prices underlying the bitcoin contracts. Some of the venues on which the cryptocurrency trades have suffered hacks and breakdowns. Bitcoin plunged nearly 20% in less than 90 minutes on Nov. 29 after reports of intermittent outages at cryptocurrency exchanges struggling to keep up with user interest.Bitcoin is ""a commodity unlike any the commission has dealt with in the past,"" CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo said in a Dec. 1 statement. ""We expect that the futures exchanges, through information sharing agreements, will be monitoring the trading activity on the relevant cash platform.""CFTC spokeswoman Erica Elliott Richardson said that Giancarlo has been ""clear that market participants should take note that the relatively nascent underlying cash markets and exchanges for bitcoin remain largely unregulated markets over which the CFTC has limited statutory authority, and that investors should be aware of the potentially high level of volatility and risk in trading these contracts.""Some brokerages are skeptical.""We remain apprehensive with the lack of transparency and regulation of the underlying reference products on which these futures contracts are based and whether exchanges have the proper oversight to ensure the reference products are not susceptible to manipulation, fraud, and operational risk,"" the FIA said in its letter.RELATED:How To Decide If Bitcoin Is Safe For You To TradeBitcoin Tumbles From Frenzied Run; JPMorgan's Dimon Still 'Highly Skeptical'This Is When You Can Start Trading Bitcoin FuturesBitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And Trends

437,CME,"Stocks cooled a bit in afternoon trading but the major indexes held on to moderate gains on Friday. The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average all showed gains of 0.3% to 0.4%, and the latter two look poised to make mild weekly gains.X The Nasdaq looks set to finish roughly flat for the week. But at 6837 it still boasts a handsome 27% gain year to date. Winners are outstripping losers on both exchanges. Volume is running mildly lower vs. the same time Thursday on both main exchanges.Meanwhile, leading megacap tech Apple (AAPL) is on course to make a second down week in a row, but the 1% loss is minimal and shares are staying on the north side of the critical 10-week moving average, currently near 166.A strong rebound off the 10-week line would offer current shareholders a new follow-on entry point.In follow-on buys, always buy a smaller amount of shares than in a prior buy, such as when a stock is breaking out of a proper base.In Apple's case, the iPhone giant lurched out of a new second-stage cup with handle at 160.97 on Oct. 27 in heavy volume. That followed a breakout from a bottoming base in early January at 118.12.As noted in this prior Stock Market Today column, Apple has proved to be a worthy turnaround play.Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) dropped 111.05, or 6%, to 1,708.96, surrendering nearly half of Wednesday and Thursday's steep advance. Yet the exchange traded fund has had a phenomenal 2017 after breaking out of a base at 139.60 on April 27.The daily swing from intraday low to high over the past five sessions has ranged from 8% to as much as 41%. Yet it's remarkable that GBTC is holding nicely above a 10-day moving average, an excellent timing tool for selling a fast-moving stock or ETF. The trust most recently burst past a very deep cup with handle at 985.10 in late November and has gained as much as 93%.The weekly chart, however, deserves close study too.Notice how both this week and the past week, GBTC traded in very wide weekly range and is on the verge of making a tight weekly close in enormous turnover. Such action resembles the ""railroad tracks"" chart pattern, which can signal a top in a highflying stock.William O'Neil, chairman and founder of IBD, has noted this rare pattern in his best-seller ""How to Make Money in Stocks."" Yet for now, a clear break of the short-term 10-day moving average would offer a good exit point for investors.Elsewhere, major banks continued to thrive in the fourth quarter amid an expanding economy. Bank of America (BAC) rallied 0.6% to 28.95 and has now advanced more than 13% from a 25.45 buy point in a flat base. Shares also held up well in three pullbacks to or near the 50-day moving average since October.BofA shows a mediocre yet improving Composite Rating of 86 on a scale of 1 to 99, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating is bullish at B+. Prefer those shares within your watch list that have a C grade or higher.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note was back at 2.38% after dipping to as low as 2.33% on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve meets for the last time on interest rates and a quarter-point hike on short-term rates to a 1.25%-1.50% target range is all but assured. A small fraction of the fed funds futures market sees a half-point rise, according to the CME Group's Fed Watch tool.RELATED:How To Make A Million Dollars By Trading In ETFsWhat Is A Bottoming Base?

United Airlines (UAL) also raised its unit revenue outlook and announced a $3 billion buyback.

444,CME,"U.S. stocks were little changed in midday action Wednesday, despite President Trump's disruptive plan regarding Jerusalem and a Senate committee's backing of a partial rollback in Dodd-Frank.X The Nasdaq crept 0.1% higher, while the S&P 500 was just barely above flat. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1%, while the small cap Russell 2000 fell 0.1%.Volume in the stock market today was below the previous session's pace.Trump is expected to announce that the U.S. is recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. This would make the U.S. the first country to do so. The U.S. would then eventually move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.On a quieter note, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee approved a bipartisan rollback to parts of the Dodd-Frank law in a 16-7 vote Tuesday. Four Democrats on the panel voted with the majority. The rollback has the support of nine Democrats in the Senate, and initial support from Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen and Yellen's replacement Jerome Powell.The bipartisan legislation doesn't involve a full repeal.The bill would raise the trigger for more intense regulation of financial firms from the current $50 billion in assets to $250 billion, thus easing the regulatory burden on smaller financial institutions. This would benefit firms such as Charles Schwab (SCHW), which rose five sessions in a row before pulling back Tuesday and so far Wednesday; SunTrust Banks (STI), which rose six sessions in a row before its pullback; and American Express (AXP), which advanced six sessions in a row, going into Wednesday's session.Major money centers such as Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) would not get a break. At midday, all three were down slightly.Bank stocks, including the big players, have benefited on the belief that the Federal Reserve will crank interest rates at least a quarter point after the Fed meets Dec. 12-13. CME Group's FedWatch Tool estimates the odds of a rate hike at 100%. The only difference is between those who expect a quarter-point hike (90.2%) and those who see a half-point increase (9.8%).A half-point increase would be a bold move, and the Ben Bernanke/Janet Yellen Fed isn't known for boldness.In recent sessions, the chipmakers, chip designers and chip-equipment makers have fallen 9% to 14% off their highs. As of Tuesday's close, the chip sector fell to No. 8 among 33 sectors — its worst ranking of the year.Speculation among market watchers swirls around two views: Either chip stocks will offer a buying opportunity when they stop falling and rebound or their leadership position will be turned over to some other sector such as banks and financials.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, solar and steel producers led the upside. Oil-related stocks led the downside.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index, a gauge of consumer confidence, decreased in December.

445,CME,"Bitcoin just passed $11,000, and a bid by the world's largest futures exchange to make it even more mainstream is probably inevitable.But that doesn't mean U.S. regulators will let trading resemble the Wild West.Since CME Group (CME) announced last month it would bring Bitcoin to the derivatives market, the company has been in heavy negotiations with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. While the agency has limited power to halt CME's plans — or a proposal from Chicago rival Cboe Global Markets Inc. (CBOE) — it is demanding changes.The CFTC has been working with the companies to ""address various issues, and to change some aspects of the contracts,"" Erica Elliott Richardson, a spokeswoman for the agency, said in a statement. ""We expect that outstanding issues will be resolved in the near future,"" she added, without providing specifics.Bitcoin is on a tear in 2017, an 11-fold surge that took off even more after CME Chief Executive Officer Terrence Duffy announced in October that the company would offer futures trading by the end of the year. The move is considered key to Wall Street's broader embrace of the crypotcurrency, likely enabling increased speculation and — perhaps someday — products such as exchange traded funds.Still, Bitcoin's jump has been met with caution in some circles, and outright dismissal in others. Vanguard Group Inc. founder John Bogle advised investors on Tuesday to avoid the virtual currency ""like the plague,"" while JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon has called it an asset bubble and a fraud.Under U.S. law, exchanges like CME, which profit from increased trading volumes, can approve new futures contracts themselves. The process, which is used in most cases, is known as self-certification and involves sending a written confirmation to the CFTC that the contract complies with relevant rules. Often, agency officials will engage in a back-and-forth with a company.Nasdaq Inc. (NDAQ) also intends to introduce Bitcoin futures and is planning to roll them out next year, said a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named discussion a private matter.Spokesmen for CME and Nasdaq declined to comment, while a spokeswoman for Cboe didn't respond to a request for comment.CME and Cboe have provided the CFTC with draft terms for contracts governing Bitcoin futures, said Elliott Richardson, the agency spokeswoman. She added that ""concerns about Bitcoin futures expressed by some market participants"" have been a factor in the CFTC's discussions with the companies.Earlier this month, Thomas Peterffy, the billionaire chairman of Interactive Brokers Group (IBKR), wrote an open letter to CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, arguing that Bitcoin's large price swings mean its futures contracts shouldn't be allowed on platforms that clear other derivatives. An outsize loss on the digital currency could cripple a firm, preventing it from meeting its obligations to pay out on all sorts of contracts.""A large cryptocurrency price move that destabilizes members that clear cryptocurrencies will destabilize the clearing organization itself,"" wrote Peterffy, whose firm is a CME clearing member. That could impair ""its ability to satisfy its fundamental obligation to pay the winners and collect from the losers on the other products in the same clearing pool,"" he said.The CFTC has been reviewing CME's and Cboe's plans for managing risks associated with Bitcoin futures and collateral requirements, said Elliott Richardson. Cboe's contracts will be cleared by Options Clearing Corp., while CME will clear its own futures. CME has estimated that initial margin on the contracts — or the amount of collateral set aside relative to the value of a trade — may be as high as 30%, an unusually high amount.""Once the contracts are launched, commission staff will engage in a variety of risk-monitoring and oversight activities,"" said the CFTC's Elliott Richardson. ""These activities include monitoring and stress-testing positions and observing and analyzing open interest, initial margin requirements, and variation margin payments.""

451,CME,"If the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) had been trading in the early 20th century, it might've had Ford Motor, Standard Oil and Thomas Edison's business ventures in its portfolio.XJust as those companies were transformational in their day, the companies in the ARK Innovation ETF are changing life in the 21st century.The fund is actively managed by a group of six analysts and a director of research who scan the broad economy looking for disruptive companies, says Tom Staudt, interim chief operating officer of ARK Invest.With technological advances spreading to every sector, the fund seeks out new frontiers in high tech, health care, agriculture, manufacturing and just about any other area.

That suggests management showed it is able to keep its ad pricing strong, keep costs under better control, or do both.Alphabet had broken out earlier this year.The mega-cap Nasdaq component hopped out of a 10-week shallow cup with handle with an 824.40 buy point in flat trading on Jan. 6 this year. After a brief tumble back near the proper entry and a test of the 50-day moving average nearly two weeks later, the stock resumed its rally. Shares are now up nearly 27% from that initial breakout.At 2:30 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite stretched its morning gains and held on to a more than 2% gain. At one point, it was on track to eclipse a 2.1% lift seen on June 28, 2016. That session served as the first day of a new market rally attempt. Two days later on June 30, IBD changed the Market Pulse current outlook to ""confirmed uptrend"" after the major indexes posted a rare Day 3 follow-through, signaling that a new uptrend for stocks was potentially emerging.As seen in IBD's ETF Market Strategy tool, June 30 last year was a great time to begin looking for good stocks forming bases and setting up new breakouts, as well as buying shares in a broad-based ETF such as PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq 100.QQQ on Friday rose 4.13, or 2.8%, to 151.09, in volume that's running more than double its 50-day average. QQQ is now up 40.4% since IBD's Big Picture column noted the new buy signal.The S&P 500 rose 0.8% while the Dow Jones industrial average lagged with a less than 0.2% gain.

The iPhone giant is also nearly 4% past a second-stage flat-base breakout at 156.75. In an excellent flat base, the decline from head to toe should not exceed 15%. Volume should also dry up within the base. The flat base must also stretch a minimum five weeks from the first down week.The megacap tech rallied past that entry on Aug. 2 and hit new highs before pulling back.Apple has rallied more than 39% since it broke out of an initial cup with handle on Jan. 6-9 at 118.12.Fiscal Q4 results are due Thursday after the close. The Street expects Q4 earnings to rise 12% to $1.87 a share, extending a streak of low double-digit EPS growth to a third quarter. After that, growth is expected to accelerate; fiscal year 2018 profit is expected to rise 24% to $11.15 a share.Apple's IBD ratings have improved since the start of the year.On Jan. 1, the iPhone and iPad giant showed a lousy Earnings Per Share Rating of 45 and a Relative Price Strength Rating of 59. Today, they've risen to 85 and 77, respectively, on a scale of 1 to 99.Apple's example in 2017 is a good lesson in how a stock chart can help an investor spot an excellent turnaround situation. Four quarters ago, the company posted a 15% drop in Q4 earnings per share and a 9% slump in revenue (its third straight year-over-year drop). With such results, and a lagging stock price, no wonder Apple's IBD ratings plunged into mediocrity.However, under the leadership of CEO Tim Cook, the company continues to create innovative and popular new products.

The Cambridge, Mass.-based company's shares gapped past a 44.34 buy point in strong volume.Molecular diagnostics firm Exact Sciences (EXAS) topped the 42.28 buy point of a flat base.

The stock was trying to find support at the 50-day moving average.The Fed will conclude its meeting at 2 p.m. ET. Fed Chair Janet Yellen will conduct a news conference at 2:30 p.m. ET. CME Group's FedWatch Tool puts the odds of no change on interest rates at 98.6%, an overwhelming consensus that has been the case for some time. The odds for a rate decrease dropped from 1.4% to zero, and the odds for an increase rose from zero to 1.4%.Rates are at 1% to 1.25%, a range that was set with the June increase in the fed funds rate.Bank stocks, which are sensitive to interest rate changes, have been rising recently.

"
468,CME,"The Federal Reserve took a small step to begin unwinding its crisis-driven asset purchases on Wednesday, but since the move was widely expected, the meeting's real drama hinged on the outlook for future rate hikes.Despite a string of benign inflation readings, Fed policymakers stuck to their guns, indicating a likelihood of four more rate hikes through the end of 2018.The updated outlook reflects a stark contrast with financial-market pricing, which sees just one rate hike (in December) likely through August 2018, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool. The odds of a rate hike by December rose to about 67% from 58% a day ago and just below 50-50 a week earlier.Starting in October, the Fed said it will gradually begin scaling back its $4.5 trillion balance sheet by letting $10 billion in principal run off per month, rather than continuing to reinvest all proceeds of maturing Treasury and mortgage bonds.In a post-meeting press conference, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said that the Fed's projections reflect a consensus that surprisingly tepid inflation this year is ""due to transitory factors that are likely to disappear over the coming year.""Yellen said members would alter their outlook if incoming inflation data continue to undershoot expectations. Yet she also noted a risk that tight labor markets could push up wage and price inflation to an extent that the Fed has to respond by hiking rates faster than expected, potentially risking a recession.Yellen's term is set to expire in February, and President Trump hasn't said if he will reappoint her. Trump has several other Fed vacancies to fill.After the Fed announcement, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite initially after trading mixed on the stock market today. But following Yellen's comments, the Dow closed up 0.2% and S&P 500 0.1%, while the Nasdaq pared its loss to 0.1%.Treasury yields rose on the Fed announcement.Bank stocks, which have snapped out their funk lately and can get a margin boost from higher rates, were bid higher on the news. On Monday, shares of Citigroup (C) broke above a 69.96 flat-base buy point, often a precursor of further near-term gains, to hit its highest level since January 2009. Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) both have been making a run at buy points. BofA and JPMorgan rose nearly 1% after the Fed news, moving to just below buy range.IBD'S TAKE: Don't look to the Fed for a green light to buy stocks or a red light to sell them. IBD readers were ready for the stock market's push to record heights this month because on Aug. 22, IBD shifted its market trend gauge to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a flashing yellow light turning green. Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The rate outlook also looms large for homebuilders, among the best performing industry group this year as interest rates have undershot expectations. NVR (NVR) and D.R. Horton (DHI) are ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in the Building-Residential/Commercial industry group by IBD Stock Checkup, based on earnings, sales and margin trends, as well as relative stock performance.Shares of NVR and D.R. Horton lost more than 1% after the Fed announcement.While there was some evidence of incremental dovishness at the Fed, it wasn't enough to make a difference. In June, 12 of 16 members expected 4 more rate hikes through 2018. Now, it's 11 of 16, meaning there was one new dove. Also, the group of policymakers expects two further rate hikes in 2019, down from three in June. Prices for core personal consumption expenditures are expected to rise 1.9% in 2018 vs. a 2.0% projection in June.But markets focused more on the intermediate term than the long term.""In addition to the macro tailwind of higher rates, banks should benefit from regulatory changes that are currently not reflected in share prices,"" David Kostin, Goldman Sachs chief equity strategist, wrote in a note to clients this week.Kostin said he doesn't expect the gradual reversal of the Fed's asset purchases, known as quantitative easing, to result in another ""taper tantrum,"" the name for the sell-off sparked by then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke's signal in 2013 that the central bank would begin slowing its QE asset purchases.Still, a ""reinvestment reflux"" isn't out of the question. Ahead of the Fed announcement, IBD explained how a number of factors could lead Treasury yields to continue their resurgence over the next few months. Those include a flood of new Treasury issuance stemming from the recent deal to lift the debt ceiling, growing prospects of a deficit-increasing tax cut and a move by the European Central Bank to begin curbing its bond buys.RELATED:5 Reasons The Bond Market May Throw Another Fed TantrumCitigroup Breaks Out; These 4 Other Banking Giants Are Near BuysKB Home, Builders In Focus But Ugly Feud Surfaces: Investing Action PlanStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLeaderboard: Daily Updates On Stocks With Potential For Big Gains

470,CME,"The Federal Reserve has done everything it could to prepare investors for the big policy shift widely expected to be announced after today's meeting: the gradual unloading of the trillions in government bonds and mortgage securities it sopped up to support the recovery from the financial crisis.Yet even though the $10 billion a month in maturing debt that the Fed initially plans to let run off from its balance sheet amounts to a mere trickle, the bond market may still throw another fit — a sequel to the 2013 taper tantrum, when then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled that the Fed was likely to slow its asset purchases later in the year.The 10-year Treasury yield already has climbed 20 basis points to 2.24% over the past two weeks, bouncing back from the lowest levels since just after President Trump's election. Below are four more developments — in addition to the change in the Fed's policy of reinvesting all maturing debt — that may lead Treasury yields to continue their resurgence over the next few months.These developments — and the higher interest rates that they might bring — would likely be good news for bank stocks, which have recently snapped out of a funk. On Monday, shares of Citigroup (C) broke above a 69.96 flat-base buy point to hit its highest level since January 2009. While other investing criteria are important, a breakout is often the precursor of further near-term gains.Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) also are making a run at buy points. BofA has a 25.45 buy point in a base-on-base pattern. JPMorgan has a 95.32 potential buy point.JPMorgan shares rose fractionally on the stock market today. Bank of America edged lower while Citigroup was little changed.Along with the central bank's policy statement on Wednesday, the Fed members will release their economic projections, including their expectations of how many times the Fed will hike rates. In other words, we'll find out whether Fed policymakers have been transformed into doves or are sticking to their guns.The most likely answer after the stronger-than-expected August consumer price index is that the Fed will stick to its outlook of four rate hikes through the end of 2018. Based on Fed-member projections in June, it will take four new doves to shift the Fed's hawkish consensus, which stands in sharp contrast to market expectations of just one more hike (in December) through August 2018, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool.All of a sudden, it looks like the Trump agenda may be getting back on track. ObamaCare repeal has a real shot at becoming law by the end of September. More significantly for financial markets, the GOP is now getting serious about cutting taxes, with key Senate Republicans agreeing on the broad outline of a plan that raises the deficit by $1.5 trillion, which is more than some Wall Street firms have been expecting.While there are some big hurdles ahead, the bond market may start pricing in the impact of more fiscal stimulus, which could put upward pressure on inflation and create a bigger supply of debt.IBD'S TAKE: IBD readers were ready for the stock market's push to record heights this month. On Aug. 22, IBD shifted its market trend gauge to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a flashing yellow light turning green. Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The timing of President Trump's deal with top congressional Democrats this month to lift the limit on government borrowing until Dec. 8 means that the Treasury Department has begun unwinding all of the extraordinary measures it took to keep from violating the debt limit that was hit in March. Unwinding those measures worth as much as $400 billion and meeting the government's ongoing borrowing needs will create a flood of new Treasury issuance at the same time the Fed is beginning to scale back its balance sheet.In addition to the Fed's gradual unwinding of its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, at a pace that will double to $20 billion a month after three months, the European Central Bank is expected to begin tapering its bond buys in coming months. To the extent this leads to upward pressure on European bond yields, the attractiveness of those bonds may increase relative to U.S. Treasuries. That in turn may push bond yields higher.JPMorgan Asset Management portfolio manager Andrew Norelli believes that central bank balance sheets have been important in ""maintaining the buoyancy in financial asset prices."" Although the pace of such purchases has slowed, the Bank of Japan and ECB are still accumulating assets at a $1 trillion annual pace. Yet these central banks, including the U.S., could cumulatively be net sellers by mid-2018, Norelli says.RELATED:Citigroup Breaks Out; These 4 Other Banking Giants Are Near BuysFlood Warning: Federal Reserve, Treasury Both Set To Unload DebtStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLeaderboard: Daily Updates On Stocks With Potential For Big Gains

471,CME,"After months of hemming and hawing about this year's surprisingly tepid inflation data, it's time for Federal Reserve policymakers to put their cards on the table: Have they been transformed into doves, or are they sticking to their guns?XThe likely answer may not please investors — unless they're piling into bank stocks, as more portfolio managers seem to be doing lately. On Monday, shares of Citigroup (C) broke above a 69.96 flat-base buy point to hit its highest level since January 2009. While other investing criteria are important, a breakout is often the precursor of further near-term gains.The big news widely expected on Wednesday is an announcement that the Fed will gradually begin scaling back its $4.5 trillion balance sheet by letting $10 billion in principal run off per month, rather than reinvesting all proceeds of maturing Treasury and mortgage bonds.But since that decision has been telegraphed for a couple of months, the real question for investors is whether anything has really changed since a majority of Fed members penciled in their expected trajectory of four quarter-point rate hikes between now and the end of 2018.Here's the likely problem for markets: Back in June, 12 of 16 Fed committee members were projecting one more hike this year and three more in 2018. That means it will take four new doves to shift the Fed's hawkish consensus, which stands in sharp contrast to market expectations of just one more hike (in December) through August 2018, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool.The upshot is that higher Treasury yields and lower stock prices are the most likely initial reaction to the Fed's announcement at 2 p.m. ET Wednesday. Yet Treasury yields have risen for six straight sessions through Monday, lifting bank stocks that have lagged the broad market all year.Bank of America (BAC) also is making a run at a buy point. BofA, which rose 1.3% to 24.70 on Monday, has a 25.45 buy point in a base-on-base pattern. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) climbed 1.4% to 92.92, moving back above its 50-day moving average. JPMorgan has a 95.32 potential buy point.IBD'S TAKE: IBD readers were ready for the stock market's push to record heights this month. On Aug. 22, IBD shifted its market trend gauge to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a flashing yellow light turning green. Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.A number of factors are combining to lift yields, including a stronger-than-expected consumer price index for August, the Fed's coming reinvestment shift and a flood of Treasury issuance, thanks to President Trump's deal with top congressional Democrats to lift the limit on government borrowing until Dec. 8.Despite all the dovish talk as inflation undershot in recent months, four more doves may be too much to hope for, given that core inflation rose a shade under 0.25% on the month. Central bankers schooled to expect higher inflation to follow low unemployment may not be that quick to learn a new trick.""In addition to the macro tailwind of higher rates, banks should benefit from regulatory changes that are currently not reflected in share prices,"" David Kostin, Goldman Sachs chief equity strategist, wrote in a note to clients.Kostin said he expects markets to avoid another ""taper tantrum,"" the name for the sell-off sparked by then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke's signal in 2013 that the central bank would begin winding down its QE asset purchases.Still, a ""reinvestment reflux"" could be in the cards, partly because the debt ceiling deal means that the Treasury Department needs to unwind all of the extraordinary measures it has taken since March — worth as much as $400 billion — when the government's authority to issue new debt ran out.RELATED:Citigroup Breaks Out; These 4 Other Banking Giants Are Near BuysFlood Warning: Federal Reserve, Treasury Both Set To Unload DebtStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLeaderboard: Daily Updates On Stocks With Potential For Big Gains

478,CME,"Right now financial markets couldn't care less about a tight job market and upward pressure on wages.Sentiment can only move in a negative direction from here, and there's a decent chance that Friday's August jobs report could be the first step toward such a shift.Another strong payroll increase is widely expected, with Wall Street predicting a 180,000 gain. The Amazon.com (AMZN) jobs day on Aug. 2, a one-day 50,000 hiring binge, will likely boost the total, which reflect payrolls during the midmonth survey week.The two big numbers to watch, though, are the jobless rate, which could slip to a new 16-year low of 4.2% (markets are expecting a steady 4.3% rate) and average hourly wage growth, which is seen ticking up to an annual 2.6% gain but could surprise on the upside.A drop in the jobless rate is hardly a sure thing, but it wouldn't rank as much of a surprise, especially since the ranks of the unemployed have actually climbed the past two months in a short-term reversal of the trend.A number of factors highlight the possibility of an upside surprise for wage growth. For one thing, another 9-cent increase in average hourly wages, as seen in July, would lift the annual gain to 2.8%. Meanwhile, the Paychex-IHS Markit Small Business Employment Watch on Tuesday reported 3% annual wage growth for the first time since the recession.IBD's own analysis of daily Treasury statements shows that federal income and employment taxes withheld from worker paychecks have been growing at a solid 5.4% annual rate in recent months vs. the 2.0% annual gain in aggregate hours worked. That also suggests wage growth is closer to 3% than 2.5%.Companies continue to highlight growing wage pressures in earnings calls. A notable recent example came from Carrols Restaurant Group (TAST), the largest franchisee for the Restaurant Brands International (QSR) Burger King chain. In an Aug. 10 conference call, the company said it's seeing 6.8% wage inflation, up from 6% the prior quarter and the 3% to 5% range it anticipated back in November.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market has been on a roll lately, and IBD readers were prepared. On Aug. 22, IBD shifted its market trend gauge to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a flashing yellow light turning green. Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The point isn't that wage inflation — or consumer price inflation — is in danger of taking off, only that markets have grown too complacent about Federal Reserve policy at a time of near-full employment in the U.S. and the broadest global growth in a decade, which is pushing up industrial metals prices. It seems like only a matter of time before there's a wakeup call.San Francisco Fed President John Williams said in early August that he sees the jobless rate falling to 4.1% by year-end and offered these words of caution: ""We don't want to let this go too long because eventually inflation pressures will emerge at some point.""The Fed wants to avoid a situation in which it has to tighten policy more quickly, raising the risk that the economy would stall. In the minutes of the Fed's July meeting, policymakers also upped their assessment of vulnerabilities associated with asset-price levels from ""notable"" to ""elevated.""If and when sentiment shifts, bank stocks will likely be the winners. Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) have all slipped to or below their 50-day moving averages. That's happened as bond investors have stretched out pricing for the next Federal Reserve rate hike all the way to June 2018, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool, dampening the outlook for banks' net interest margins.Bank of America and Morgan Stanley have both fallen below buy points. JPMorgan remains in a buy zone above an 89.23 buy point from a double-bottom base.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, the S&P 500 index started strong, striving for a fifth-straight gain and approaching its all-time high. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 2.13%, just above the lows since the week of the 2016 election, when the prospect of a unified GOP government reset growth expectations higher.Market expectations sharply contrast with Fed members' own June consensus of four more rate hikes through the end of 2018, though the surprisingly tame inflation data of recent months has likely shifted that consensus in a more dovish direction.RELATED:The Bond Market Is Going CrazyLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

479,CME,"Bond investors have finally done it, stretching out pricing for the next Federal Reserve rate hike beyond the point of absurdity — all the way to June 2018, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.Tuesday's market action saw the 10-year Treasury yield sink 3 basis points to 2.13%, briefly falling to the lowest level since Nov. 10, two days after Election Day reset expectations for the U.S. economy.Yet the odds that financial markets are betting correctly about the rate outlook look minuscule at a time when so much is going right for the U.S. economy and the broader global economy.Industrial commodities prices are surging, a reflection of the most broad-based global expansion in a decade. Wage pressures are building, according to the Paychex-IHS Markit Small Business Employment Watch, which on Tuesday reported 3% annual wage growth for the first time since the recession. The jobless rate is at a 16-year low 4.3% and numerous economists expect it to fall to 4.0% within a matter of months and keep falling.Even tragedy may lift U.S. economic growth. While Hurricane Harvey's devastating floods will depress immediate economic activity, as the waters recede there likely will be a construction boom in Houston, with the need to replace thousands upon thousands of ruined vehicles.Bank stocks have been paying the price for falling Treasury yields and the downgraded Fed rate-hike outlook, which cast doubt on the expectation of higher rates and wider net-interest margins that helped make the sector one of the winners of the postelection rally. Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) have all slipped below their 50-day moving averages. Bank of America and Morgan Stanley have both fallen below buy points, potentially negative signs advising investors to remain on the sidelines. JPMorgan remains in a buy zone above an 89.23 buy point from a double-bottom base.IBD'S TAKE: Bullish chart patterns showing a stock breaking out of base into a buy zone give investors the best chance of reaping near-term gain, especially when a series of other important factors is present.While headlines about North Korea drove a safety bid in Treasuries early on Tuesday, stocks recovered from early losses and turned in decent gains. The real game-changer for markets has been the disinflationary trend that has seen the Fed's preferred personal consumption expenditures annual inflation rate slide from 2.2% in February to 1.4% in June, with core inflation easing to 1.4% from 1.9%. (July figures are due out on Thursday morning.)But markets are seriously overestimating the Fed's patience. The reason for the current consensus to keep rates on hold until at least December is that Fed policy makers have pretty clearly decided to use this window to shift their reinvestment policy and begin gradually scaling back the central bank's $4.5 trillion balance sheet. The change, allowing principal in maturing Treasury and mortgage bonds to run off, rather than reinvesting it, is itself a tightening of policy, so the Fed doesn't want to hike rates at the same time.With wage growth creeping higher and the jobless rate sinking, Fed members are very likely to hike again sooner than markets expect. Industrial metals prices, a leading indicator of inflation, are on the rise, with copper, aluminum, and zinc all at multiyear highs, which has sparked breakouts of mining stocks like BHP Billiton, Southern Copper and Vale over the past week.The weakness in Treasury yields as miners surge doesn't make a ton of sense. While higher commodity prices partially reflect dollar weakness, eventually that weak dollar will put upward pressure on prices of U.S. imports.Hurricane Harvey could intensify an apparent shortage of construction workers, while a surge in used car demand could at least temporarily ease a supply glut that's weighing on used car prices.Meanwhile, Trump policies also may have inflationary consequences. The Commerce Department is collecting preliminary duties of 17% to 31% on Canadian softwood lumber used in home building. Trump may decide this week to walk away from President Obama's deportation deferral program for people who arrived in the U.S. as unauthorized immigrants when they were children, which would gradually phase out their work permits.While subdued inflation pressure reflects competitive pressures in a wide of array of industries, including the grocery industry that just saw Amazon.com buy Whole Foods, the inflation outlook won't be tame enough to keep the Fed on the sidelines for long with unemployment headed to 4%.RELATED:4 Miners, 2 Clinical Trial Plays Ace Buy Points, Take New HighsLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

480,CME,"Though the Federal Reserve kept its key interest rate steady last month, it's widely expected to start unwinding its balance sheet in September.XWhen the Fed stops buying Treasuries and mortgage backed securities, the increased supply could send prices down and drive yields up, leading to higher interest rates.That means investors will again focus on which sectors of the stock market are most likely to outperform as rates climb. For instance, banks and other financials, industrials and consumer discretionary are areas that tend to benefit from higher rates.A couple of new (or fairly new) kids on the exchange traded fund block aim to offer outperformance with stocks in a rising rate environment. One of the newest is ProShares Equities for Rising Rates (EQRR), which launched July 25.""EQRR is for investors who expect rising interest rates and want to outperform traditional large-cap indexes as rates go up,"" Michael Sapir, co-founder and CEO of ProShare Advisors, said in a statement. ""EQRR takes those sectors most positively correlated with interest rates, then within those sectors invests in the companies that have tended to outperform during periods of rising rates.""The fund, which tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Large Cap Equities for Rising Rates Index, has attracted $14.3 million in assets. The biggest sector weightings as of Aug. 21 were financials at 30%, energy 24%, materials 18% and industrials 16%. Information technology accounted for 12% of assets.Its top holdings included E-Trade Financial (ETFC), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Lincoln National (LNC) and Bank of America (BAC). The top 10 stocks, which account for about 30% of assets, are all banks or insurers.EQRR carries a 0.35% expense ratio.Fidelity Dividend ETF for Rising Rates (FDRR), set to mark its anniversary Sept. 12, has gathered $152.5 million.The fund, which tracks the Fidelity Dividend Index for Rising Rates, invests in large and midcap companies that are expected to keep paying and growing their dividends. The stocks must also have a positive correlation of returns to rising 10-year U.S. Treasury yields. Boston-based Geode Capital Management serves as subadvisor for the fund.Technology led FDRR's sector weights at nearly 22%, followed by a 14% weighting in health care, 11.5% consumer cyclical and 10% in financial services as of Aug. 18, according to Morningstar Inc. It had modest exposure to sectors such as real estate and utilities, which pay big dividends, but can be highly sensitive to increasing interest rates.Six of the fund's top 10 holdings as of Aug. 21 were Dow Jones industrial average components: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Merck (MRK) and Exxon Mobil (XOM). The top 10 comprised nearly a quarter of total assets.The ETF has slightly underperformed the broader market this year with a 7.4% return vs. the S&P 500's 10% gain through Aug. 21. FDRR's expense ratio is 0.29%.Keep in mind that with FDRR still under a year old and EQRR about to mark its first month, there isn't a proven yet track record available.The next Fed monetary policy meeting is scheduled for Sept. 19 and 20. The odds of a rate hike in December are at 40%, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.RELATED:Miss Thursday's Breakouts? 2 Fresh Ideas As Market Hits HighsNext-Gen ETFs For Rising Rates Offer High Yields And Low Volatility

481,CME,"The U.S. economy added 209,000 jobs in July, as the jobless rate dipped, revisiting a 16-year low of 4.3%, the Labor Department reported on Friday.XWhile average hourly wages rose a tame 2.5% from a year ago, and the data are unlikely to change near-term policy, the underlying details show strong labor market momentum and suggest that Wall Street may be underestimating the extent of Federal Reserve tightening in 2018.An inkling of realization crept into markets on Friday, with the 10-year Treasury yield scooting up 4 basis points to 2.26%. Meanwhile, the dollar clawed back a bit of lost ground after sinking to a 2-year low in recent days, and bank stocks, which can shine when the Fed is raising rates, moved higher.One prominent take on the huge lines of people that showed up at the nationwide Amazon.com (AMZN) hiring blitz this week was that there are droves of people who need jobs, so the economy must not be anywhere near full employment.Yet data from Friday's report, new hiring bonuses at Disney (DIS), discussions of labor-market tightness on earnings calls and the difficulty small firms are having in filling jobs all suggest that what slack there is in the job market is disappearing pretty quickly.Here are a few data points that show the job market has a serious head of steam:Not only has the monthly average job gain accelerated to 195,000 over the past three months, but that's happened as the workweek has lengthened. For the first time since late 2015, aggregate hours worked rose 2% from a year ago in consecutive months.Even with tame wage growth, more hiring and longer hours are boosting incomes, and that should gradually yield more pricing power for business. Aggregate pay rose 4.5% from a year ago in July, after increasing 4.6% in June. Again, that's the best two-month trend since late 2015.On a positive note, 349,000 workers joined the labor force in July, meaning they're working or looking for a job. But that figure is from the survey of households that can yield unreliable shifts in any month, both up and down. The trend is less impressive: Over the past four months, a total of 293,000 people have joined the labor force, but that's been swamped by the cumulative 513,000 increase in employed workers.The jobs data don't change the outlook for the Fed waiting until December for its next rate hike. The Fed is widely expected to announce that it will gradually begin scaling back its $4.5 trillion balance sheet at the conclusion of its Sept. 19-20 meeting. However some Fed policymakers have expressed concern that inflation will bubble up if the jobless rate keeps falling.The battered retail sector added 900 jobs in July. The data include non-store retailers, which added 1,400 jobs. Amazon had already been holding job fairs to staff various facilities around the country even before the nationwide event. Amazon also announced in April that it's hiring 5,000 part-time customer-service reps to work out of their homes.Employment in food service and drinking places surged 53,100. McDonald's (MCD) said in mid-June that the fast-food chain and its franchisees will add 250,000 workers this summer — more than the Golden Arches hired a year ago. McDonald's was recruiting through a partnership with Snap (SNAP), which will connect users to an online application if they click on a McDonald's recruitment ad on its Snapchat social media site.While such creative strategies might help connect employers with hard-to-find workers, Disney is trying to attract cooks, bus drivers and housekeepers by publicizing hiring bonuses that start at $500 and rise as high as $1,500 for culinary employees. Disney reports fiscal third-quarter earnings after the close on Tuesday.A National Federation of Independent Business survey out Thursday indicated that 35% of small firms reported job openings they couldn't fill in July, the highest percentage since 2001.IBD'S TAKE: For an analysis of why Amazon's stock chart is now signaling greater risk, read IBD Leaderboard, where IBD's top market writers help you spot buying opportunities as they emerge and sell signals to lock-in profits. With its post-earnings sell-off, Amazon has fallen to No. 10 in IBD's Internet-Retail group, based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see which companies are setting the pace. Before the jobs data, Jefferies economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons characterized subdued wage gains as ""unprecedented"" at this advanced stage of the business cycle, but said they see ""a more sustained cyclical acceleration going forward.""Their view is that the labor market is approaching full employment for both skilled and unskilled labor, noting ""the increased inclination of workers to change jobs for higher wages.""The long lines at Amazon's job fairs do raise a lot of questions about how much those people reflect labor-market slack (the jobless looking for work or people looking to add a second job) or people looking for greener pastures. There are, after all, millions of retail workers who may be worried that their store is about to be ""Amazoned"" out of business, and Amazon's wages starting at $12 an hour, plus benefits, are surely a draw.On earnings calls within the past several weeks, numerous companies have talked about wage pressures and tight labor market conditions.Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) and railroad operator Union Pacific (UNP) both said they are seeing 5% wage inflation.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) is seeing 6% wage growth and an even-greater increase in compensation costs when non-wage benefits are included.On the other hand, staffing company Robert Half International (RHI), which serves accounting, health care and other professions, has seen temp bill rates decelerate to 2.5%.""What we're seeing is that our clients — they're just unwilling to pay more, because they don't believe they can pass it through in what they bill their clients,"" Robert Half CEO Harold Messmer said on a July 26 conference call, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.""So, it's actually pretty unprecedented in our experience that on the one hand the labor market tightens, on the other hand wage inflation declines,"" Messmer said.Yet NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said that the tight labor market is raising costs for small employers. ""More than a quarter of all owners reported raising wages in July, and the pressure was especially high in the construction industry,"" he said.Meanwhile, San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams is on edge about the falling jobless rate, which he expects to sink to 4.1% by year end.""I just think we don't want to let this go too long because eventually inflation pressures will emerge at some point,"" Williams said.Despite muted inflation readings in recent months, Williams still envisions four rate hikes between now and the end of 2018, while financial markets see slim odds of more than one through next August, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool.RELATED:The Fed Just Gave A Green Light To Wall StreetAmazon The Inflation Killer Will Lower Grocery Prices With Whole FoodsAmazon Still Prime With Analysts; Intel, EA Touted; Starbucks Cut

482,CME,"The number that keeps Federal Reserve policymakers up at night isn't the monthly job gain. It's the jobless rate.Though unemployment ticked up to 4.4% in June from May's 16-year low of 4.3%, San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams said on Wednesday that he sees the jobless rate falling to 4.1% by year end.X""I just think we don't want to let this go too long because eventually inflation pressures will emerge at some point,"" Williams said.Wall Street expects Friday's jobs report to show that the unemployment rate returned to 4.3% in July as the economy added 178,000 jobs.Although the massive 50,000-job hiring spree by Amazon.com (AMZN) this week won't begin to show up until the next job report, the company had already been holding job fairs to staff various facilities around the country even before the nationwide event.

Disney reports fiscal third-quarter earnings after the close on Tuesday.Economists expect Friday's jobs report to show that wages rose 0.3% on the month but a tepid 2.5% from a year ago.IBD'S TAKE: For an analysis of why Amazon's stock chart is now signaling greater risk, read IBD Leaderboard, where IBD's top market writers help you spot buying opportunities as they emerge and sell signals to lock-in profits. With its post-earnings sell-off, Amazon has fallen to No. 10 in IBD's Internet-Retail group, based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see which companies are setting the pace. Jefferies economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons characterized subdued wage gains as ""unprecedented"" at this advanced stage of the business cycle, but they see ""a more sustained cyclical acceleration going forward.""Their view is that the labor market is approaching full employment for both skilled and unskilled labor, noting ""the increased inclination of workers to change jobs for higher wages.""One question raised by the long lines at Amazon's job fairs is the extent to which the job candidates are currently employed and looking for higher pay. Or are they largely people entering the labor force or looking for a second part-time job?On earnings calls within the past several weeks, numerous companies have talked about wage pressures and tight labor market conditions.Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) and railroad operator Union Pacific (UNP) both said they are seeing 5% wage inflation.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) is seeing 6% wage growth and an even-greater increase in compensation costs when non-wage benefits are included.On the other hand, staffing company Robert Half International (RHI), which serves accounting, health care and other professions, has seen temp bill rates decelerate to 2.5%.""What we're seeing is that our clients — they're just unwilling to pay more, because they don't believe they can pass it through in what they bill their clients,"" Robert Half CEO Harold Messmer said on a July 26 conference call, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.""So, it's actually pretty unprecedented in our experience that on the one hand the labor market tightens, on the other hand wage inflation declines,"" Messmer said.But he doesn't expect the situation to last, and neither does the Fed's Williams. Despite muted inflation readings in recent months, Williams still envisions four rate hikes between now and the end of 2018, while financial markets see slim odds of more than one through next August, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool.In other words, a continued drop in the jobless rate could set Wall Street up for multiple rate-hike surprises in 2018.RELATED:The Fed Just Gave A Green Light To Wall StreetAmazon The Inflation Killer Will Lower Grocery Prices With Whole FoodsAmazon Still Prime With Analysts; Intel, EA Touted; Starbucks Cut

483,CME,"A busy day of headlines Tuesday resulted in a nice day of outperformance for the Dow Jones industrial average and a new high for the S&P 500 but a sluggish day overall for tech stocks.Alphabet (GOOGL) cast a pall on the tech sector after the company reported earnings late Monday. Shares fell 3%.At the close, the Dow rose almost 0.5%; the S&P 500 added 0.3% and the Nasdaq composite rose less than 0.1%. Small caps fared the best with the Russell 2000 up 0.8%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq both coming in higher than Monday's levels.X Inside the Dow, Caterpillar (CAT) soared 6% on a nice earnings beat and second straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. McDonald's (MCD), meanwhile, jumped 5% as Wall Street cheered solid earnings as well as a 3.9% increase in U.S. same-store sales, nicely above expectations.Financials also outperformed as bond yields rose. Dow components JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) ended with gains of nearly 2%. JPMorgan is back near highs but just below a 94.08 buy point. Goldman has been a laggard in the financial sector for a while now as it trades near  its recently converged 50- and 200-day moving averages.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was up 7 basis points  to 2.32% as the two-day Fed meeting got underway. A decision on interest rates is due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.The market is not expecting a rate hike tomorrow, and one more before the end of the year is still in question, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool. Futures traders think there's a 47% chance the Fed will hike rates one more time before the end of the year.Some oil and gas-related groups outperformed as oil prices jumped. September WTI crude oil jumped $1.55, or 3.3%, to settle at $47.89 a barrel.Heavy-volume gainers included Rio Tinto (RIO). Shares jumped 5% to 45.93. It's still in buy range after gapping up over a 45.81 cup-with-handle buy point. Mining firms outperformed on the heels of strong results from Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), which soared nearly 15%.On the downside, shares of Seagate (STX) crashed more than 16% on a big earnings miss. It's been a laggard since gapping below the 50-day moving in late April. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) was another big loser, down 10%, despite another quarter of strong bottom-line and top-line growth.

490,CME,"Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen told Congress Wednesday morning that the balance sheet will shrink ""appreciably,"" but stock indexes surged as she seemed to cede ground to the doves on the softer inflation trend.Yellen said that the recent decline in core inflation was only ""partly the result of a few unusual reductions in certain categories of prices."" Previously Yellen had implied that the Fed could overlook lower inflation readings as it continued on its rate-hiking path. In a Q&A, she acknowledged the potential for an""undershooting"" of the Fed's 2% inflation target, a signal that future rate hikes will be more data-dependent vs. moving proactively in anticipation of firmer data.The Fed's Beige Book report, released Wednesday afternoon, didn't suggest the central bank should be in a rush to tighten policy further. The report found ""slight to moderate"" economic growth across the country, with inflation and wage gains tame.Yellen's modest shift in tone sent Treasury yields lower Wednesday, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.6% to a record high. The S&P 500 index climbed 0.7% 0.8% while the Nasdaq composite gained 1.1% on the stock market today.Bank stocks lagged, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC). JPMorgan lost 0.3% and BofA 0.9%, though Wells Fargo rallied to close up 0.2%. Wells and BofA are near buy points.Any concern that Yellen might deliver a hawkish message seemed to melt away on Tuesday afternoon, after one of the Fed's leading doves, Lael Brainard, stole Yellen's thunder.Brainard said that she's on board with the Fed's plan to begin normalizing its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. But before the Fed hikes rates again, Brainard wants to implement the change in reinvestment policy and wait for more clarity on the path of core inflation after the disinflationary trend of the past few months.Yellen is unlikely to seek a fight with the Fed's dovish wing as they wait for clearer signals about inflation. There's no real urgency to do so, with the Fed getting ready to incrementally adjust its current posture of reinvesting all principal from its maturing Treasury and mortgage bonds.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said Tuesday that a paring of the balance sheets by the Fed and other central banks could be a ""little more disruptive than people think."" JPMorgan, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo report earnings on Friday, with Bank of America next week.IBD'S TAKE: IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" on Tuesday, June 27, a signal to investors to exercise extra caution in buying stocks and to take some money off the table to deploy when the turbulence subsides.

If that is the case, we would not have much more additional work to do on moving to a neutral stance,"" Brainard said.Technology stocks have been under pressure the past two weeks as the Fed and European Central Bank both getting ready to reduce the impact of their bond-buying programs.RELATED:Yellen May Trigger Stocks, Banks; Amazon Reviews: Investing Action PlanStrong Job Growth Signals Economic Momentum; September Rate Hike In PlayDraghi Drama Undercuts Key Stock-Market Support

491,CME,"As Brent crude oil closed on Wednesday at its lowest level since before OPEC and other nations agreed to cut output, someone bet half a million dollars on prices surging to $80 by year-end.Options to buy 10 million barrels of Brent crude for $80 a barrel in December traded Wednesday, far exceeding the next-largest contracts, according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg. Placed in two trades, the transactions were especially large given they were to purchase crude at 66% above the day's closing price.Oil prices plunged 4% in London and 5% in New York on Wednesday as a surprise expansion in U.S. crude stockpiles undermined those analysts arguing a market rebalancing is now underway. Nonetheless, there were also reasons to be bullish, including escalating tensions between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, terror incidents in Iran, and the halting of Libya's biggest oilfield.""That is clearly a geopolitical insurance premium,"" Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S said by phone of the options trades. Tensions in the Middle East are ""being ignored right now, but that is dangerous and potentially leaves many being caught in a bear trap.""Costing 5 cents a barrel, the options trades look most likely to have been placed by a wealthy individual investor or a speculative fund. Alternatively, they could be part of a wider hedging strategy, even though no corresponding futures trades were placed around the same time. The contracts' value will rise and fall depending on how close Brent futures get to $80 a barrel by the end of the year.Saudi Arabia and other oil producing nations announced earlier this week that they were cutting ties with Qatar, a move that initially pushed oil prices higher until fears about an oversupplied market returned to the fore. Libya's Sharara oilfield, which had been pumping 270,000 barrels a day, was forced to halt Wednesday because of worker protests.The disappointing U.S. stockpile numbers — a 3.3 million barrel increase rather than an anticipated decrease — sparked a frenzy of selling on Wednesday. Trading volumes on West Texas Intermediate crude rose to their second highest level ever, according to preliminary data from CME Group.Traders hunted protection against an increase in U.S. crude prices too. WTI $50 calls were the most heavily traded option on Wednesday, while 36 million barrels of new bullish contracts were added for the nearest two trading months, according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg. With prices nearing their lowest level this year, oil could be set for a short-term rebound, Petromatrix GmbH analyst Olivier Jakob wrote in an emailed report.

Trade often fades before a holiday.The stock market will be closed Monday for the Memorial Day holiday.Bulls got some good news before the market's open.

Higher interest rates should be helpful to banks, but the bank stocks haven't gained much from the outlook.

"
497,CME,"The Federal Reserve isn't quite ready to start shrinking its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, minutes from the May 2-3 meeting released on Wednesday signal.While policymakers continue to think it will likely be ""appropriate to begin reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings this year,"" Wall Street banks including Goldman Sachs had begun looking for a shift as early as September. Now that seems unlikely to happen so quickly.Perhaps even more important than the timing of the reinvestment shift is the ""low"" scale of the initial balance sheet reductions envisioned by the Fed.As Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson explained, committee members endorsed ""a staff paper proposing that the balance sheet roll-off should begin at a 'low' pace, increased gradually  every three months, circumstances permitting."" Shepherdson sees the Fed beginning to let maturing principal run-off from the portfolio as early as October, but at a level that won't fray investors' nerves.After the release, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite added to their modest gains on the stock market today, with the S&P 500 coming just short of a newall-time high. The 10-year Treasury yield slipped. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), and other banks stocks whose net interest margins can be sensitive to interest-rate changes remained fractionally mixed following the release. JPMorgan and BofA fell 0.1% while Citigroup (C) neared a buy point.Reinvestment has kept the Fed's balance sheet steady in recent years. A decision not to reinvest maturing bonds would act as a monetary tightening.JPMorgan economists highlighted a possibility that the Fed will pause hiking rates if core inflation readings continue to come in on the soft side, as they have the past two months.But Fed policymakers signaled they see a rate hike ""soon,"" backing up expectations for June hike.After release of the March minutes, which policymakers first stated the a reinvestment policy shift would be appropriate this year, the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index turned negative. Bank of America and Dow component JPMorgan fell more than 1% that day, while fellow Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citigroup reversed lower as markets were caught off guard by the Fed discussion.Prior Fed comments have made pretty clear that the central bank won't spring a sudden change on the market —  Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, a voting member of the FOMC policy committee, said he wants to make balance sheet reductions like ""watching paint dry.""If policymakers wanted to telegraph that such a change might be forthcoming within the next few meetings, the minutes would be the place to do so.IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks, one of the big winners of the initial Trump postelection rally, continue to lag their 50-day moving averages, a signal of technical weakness. After last week's market plunge on rising political uncertainty, the stock market uptrend is under pressure, a status that advises investors to exercise more caution when buying stocks. Make sure to read IBD's The Big Picture every day to stay on top of the market trend.How markets will react to the change when it happens isn't exactly clear. Goldman Sachs sees the announcement of balance sheet adjustment as ""a smaller tightening step"" than the Fed's typical 25-basis-point rate hike, Goldman's chief U.S. economist, Jan Hatzius, explained recently.Goldman has been expecting rate hikes in June and again in September, then a balance sheet tightening in December. But the recent run of weaker inflation readings suggests that the Fed might hold off hiking rates in September and instead announce a more market-friendly balance sheet adjustment, Hatzius said last week.Before the Fed minutes' release, markets were pricing in an 83% chance of a June hike and 50-50 odds for the subsequent hike coming in January 2018, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool.Interpreting the impact of a shift in the reinvestment policy isn't crystal clear. Fed Chair Janet Yellen explained in January that the 10-year Treasury yield could rise by 15 basis points over the course of 2017 as ""the end-date for reinvestment draws closer."" She noted that such a change in longer-term yields is roughly the same historical impact of two 25-basis-point hikes in the federal funds rate.Bank investors weren't too concerned heading into Wednesday's Fed minutes release, with Morgan Stanley (MS) and most other banks stocks little changed after all rose more than 1% Tuesday. JPMorgan, Goldman and Morgan Stanley moved toward their 50-day moving averages, while BofA flirted with taking that key level. Citigroup, which fell below an aggressive buy point in the May 17 selloff, retook that entry last Friday and is near record highs.RELATED:Fed Holds Rates Steady, Gives Markets Breathing RoomHow The Fed Surprised Markets Again, This Time Hitting Stocks

499,CME,"Stocks staged a less-than-spirited advance on Thursday, but some large-cap techs were showing more fortitude.The Nasdaq composite was leading the major indexes, rising nearly 0.4% at 12:45 p.m. ET, but that's still well off morning highs and just a sliver of Wednesday's 2.6% walloping. The Nasdaq had gained as much as 0.8% early.The Nasdaq 100, getting support from the likes of Apple (AAPL) (still extended from a recent 3-weeks-tight entry point at 141.12) and Netflix (NFLX) (up nicely since a March breakout at 129.39, in a sturdy uptrend as well), is slightly outperforming with a gain of more than 0.5%.Both Apple and Netflix, which were recently on IBD Leaderboard, are true leaders in their respective industries and still show excellent prospects for further top and bottom line growth.Mild gains were sticking beyond lunchtime on Wall Street in the wake of news that the Justice Department has appointed former FBI chief Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate potential dealings between White House staff and Russia. The Dow Jones industrial average was just above break-even a day after it slid more than 1.7% and pierced its 50-day moving average in heavy volume.Volume is up on the NYSE vs. the same time on Wednesday but slightly lower on the Nasdaq.The S&P 500 gained roughly 0.2%, boosted by strength in the biotech sector amid news coming from the well-followed ASCO conference. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Incyte (INCY), Sage Therapeutics (SAGE) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) were among the top gainers in IBD's biotech industry group.Among these four, Regeneron holds the best IBD Composite Rating at 96, and for good reason. Revenue has grown more than 10-fold over the past five years, from $446 million in 2011 to $4.86 billion in 2016. It is a recognized leader in treatments that reflect excellent science, and has changed the face of treatment for age-related macular degeneration.Regeneron stopped losing money in 2012, earning $4.66 a share in 2012. Earnings have grown almost every year since then, up 40% to $11.34 a share.The stock has bounced nicely since hitting a 52-week low of 325.35 in August last year, and may now be working on a first-stage bottoming-base pattern.The Street sees Regeneron's earnings lifting 12% this year to $12.67 a share and another 21% to $15.32 in 2017. Other rising industry groups in the stock market today include diversified operations, medical software, fabless semiconductors, chipmaking and fiber-optic gear.Shire Group (SHPG), meanwhile, advanced nearly 3% to 187.46 in heavy trading, further adding distance above its 50- and 200-day moving averages on positive data for a treatment for hereditary angioedema. Shire, part of the ethical-drugs industry group, and Regeneron are still in the early stages of forming the right side of potential new bases. It's important to have patience and see if these and other names in the two beaten-down medical industry groups can flex enough price strength to get in a proper position to break out.The market's general price-and-volume action, as noted in Wednesday's Big Picture column, represented a notable change in character among institutional investors compared with prior declines by the Dow to and below the key intermediate-term support line. Therefore, IBD changed its current outlook from ""confirmed uptrend"" to ""uptrend under pressure,"" meaning that new buys are permissible, but must be done with extra caution.The Dow industrials' Accumulation/Distribution Rating is now at C+, down from B- yet still positive. IBD's Accumulation rating covers 13 weeks' worth of price-and-volume action. A grade of C+ or higher indicates that mutual funds, hedge funds, insurers, pensions, banks and the like are overall accumulating equities.As seen in the general market indicators page, which is a PDF link found at the bottom of the Big Picture column each day, at least 17 names within the 30-member Dow Jones industrial average still have an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B or higher, a good sign. You can see all 30 stocks' ratings at the top of the Dow Jones daily chart on the link.Small caps also rebounded, yet rather meekly compared with Wednesday's carnage. The S&P SmallCap 600 rallied 0.1% after sinking 2.4%. It too fell sharply below its 50-day moving average; at Wednesday's low, the 600 was 5.5% below its all-time high of 866.In other financial markets, WTI crude oil continued to rebound amid a fading U.S. dollar, rising nearly 0.8% to $49.44 and hitting one-month highs. Gold futures on the Comex cooled nearly 0.4% to $1,254 a troy ounce, but have bounced more than 3% since hitting as low as $1,216 on May 9.The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond continued to sink, edging down 2.21%. Yet according to the latest analysis of fed funds rate futures at CME Group, the probability of a new 25-basis point hike in short-term interest rates at the Federal Reserve's June 14 meeting is still more than 69%.RELATED:What's The Market Direction?

The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average edged down 0.1%. Volume in the stock market today was lower on both major exchanges.Blue chips were mostly down with Apple (AAPL) taking the hardest hit, off 1.9% in fast trade. Apple topped the Street's consensus view on earnings by 4%, but missed on revenue.

502,CME,"U.S. stock indexes inched higher in late morning trade Tuesday, as the Federal Reserve began its two-day meeting.The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 were just above break-even, while the Dow Jones industrial average was up 0.1%. Volume in the stock market today rose on both major exchanges.The Federal Reserve began its two-day meeting, but expectations were muted. The Street expects the Fed to stand pat on interest rates. CME Group's FedWatch Tool sees a less than 5% chance of a rate hike when the Fed wraps up its meeting Wednesday. However, the gauge sees about a 70% chance of a rate hike in June, including 3% who expect a half point increase rather than the usual quarter point.Blue chip stocks were mostly up early Tuesday. The biggest gainer among Dow industrial average components was Visa (V), up 1.35%. The stock rose apparently on optimism about its group after Mastercard (MA) reported a 6% beat on earnings in Q1. Mastercard gapped up 2.2% in torrid trade. Rival Visa reported its quarterly results in late April, topping views on earnings by about 9%.Infrastructure-related stocks showed strength Tuesday.

"
503,CME,"X The Federal Reserve held its key interest rate steady on Wednesday, as expected, issuing a benign statement that should do little to dampen Wall Street's recently buoyant spirits.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite extended modest losses slightly after the Fed announcement. The Nasdaq has led the way lower throughout the session after a mixed earnings report from Apple (AAPL). Bank of America (BAC) shares and Dow component JPMorgan Chase (JPM) edged higher. Both Bank of America and JPMorgan are consolidating modestly below their 50-day moving averages.The status-quo Fed statement points to a June rate hike, though it won't be followed by a press conference from Chair Janet Yellen and leaves something of a gap between the Fed's stated intentions and slightly more dovish market expectations.The Fed statement emphasized the continued strengthening in the labor market, while noting that slower growth in the first quarter was ""likely to be transitory."" The Fed also noted that business investment has stepped up. Inflation is nearing the central bank's 2% goal but core price gains eased in March.The only possibility of news — and the probability was  low — was that the Fed would highlight its intention to begin scaling back its asset holdings by modifying its policy of reinvesting all maturing mortgage and Treasury bonds.The minutes of the Fed's March meeting, which were released April 5, indicated that policymakers believed the time had nearly come to begin shrinking the central bank's bloated balance sheet, which would act as a monetary tightening.""Most participants anticipated that gradual increases in the federal funds rate would continue and judged that a change to the committee's reinvestment policy would likely be appropriate later this year.""But the Fed statement retained the same language, noting that committee members anticipated maintaining the same reinvestment policy ""until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well underway.""The ongoing risk to markets is that the Fed's signals imply a somewhat faster pace of tightening than investors are expecting. Before Wednesday's announcement, markets already saw a 71% chance of a rate hike in June, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool. But a subsequent hike wasn't expected until at least December, when markets saw a 52% chance of an increase in the Fed's benchmark rate.The Fed has indicated that policymakers don't want to raise rates and alter the investment policy at the same time, increasing the chances that markets will respond to the balance sheet reduction without a hitch. Combined with the Fed's signal that two more hikes can be expected this year, the implication is that committee members' preferred timetable includes ""rate hikes in June and September, and the first step in the (Fed's) balance sheet normalization process in December,"" wrote Ward McCarthy, Jefferies' chief financial economist.IBD'S TAKE: Just as Wall Street seems to be reining in its expectations for the economy, surging income and employment taxes are signaling that wage gains may have shifted into higher gear.Wall Street has grown a bit less bullish about the economic outlook, given uncertainty about President Trump's fiscal policies and weaker readings on GDP growth in the first quarter and job growth in March. Yet the markets and the Fed may no longer quite be on the same page.The Fed's belief is that the U.S. is already close to full employment and that higher wage growth, when it comes, is likely to flow through to higher inflation. Yellen has said that the longer-run trend in labor force growth is between 75,000 and 125,000 per month, so anything faster than that soaks up any remaining slack.At some point, the divergence between Fed signals and market expectations will be resolved, possibly by the June 14 meeting.RELATED:How The Fed Surprised Markets Again, This Time Hitting StocksMarkets Are 'Too Negative' On Trump Tax-Cut Odds: GoldmanJobless Rate Falls To 10-Year Low Of 4.5%, Keeping Pressure On Fed

504,CME,"X U.S. stocks looked to be set to take a well-deserved breather, posting minor losses early Tuesday following two weeks of strong gains. Yet key indexes still closed ahead as money flowed sharply into a select group of underperforming industries.The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average all staged gains of around 0.1% to 0.2%. But small caps failed to take advantage of the late-hour rebound. The small-cap S&P 600 sank 0.4%, but it was down as much as 0.7% during intraday lows. The Russell 2000 slumped almost 0.6%.Volume rose sharply on both main exchanges. Tuesday's action on the Nasdaq appeared to be stalling, but it doesn't affect the overall distribution day count for that major index. Read more on this technicality in today's Big Picture column.At 1399, the Russell 2000 is clearly lagging the S&P 500, which finished Tuesday at 2391. The former is up 3% year to date, the latter up 6.8%.At least eight industry groups, many of them dwelling at or near the bottom of IBD's 197 group and subgroup rankings, belied the flat action of the major market benchmarks with gains of 2% or more.They included the hospitals (up 3.8%), cement and concrete (up 3.2%), department stores (up 2.7%), consumer loans (up 2.2%), coal (up 2.1%), and long-term medical care (up 2.1%). Meanwhile, two more struggling groups — discount and variety retail and clothing manufacturing — saw gains of  1.6%.Is it bargain-hunting? That may help explain part of it. But quarterly results are likely another major factor.Take Coach (COH), part of the apparel makers group. The stock shot more than 11% higher to 43.03. Shares leapt past a 41.80 buy point within a long saucer-with-handle pattern. That pattern is part of a long bottoming base. The buy point is derived from adding 10 cents to the March 30 intraday high of the four-week handle, or 41.79.Early Tuesday, the maker of luxury handbags, accessories and fashion clothing reported a 5% rise in fiscal third-quarter earnings to 46 cents a share, edging the consensus view by 2 cents. Revenue slipped 4% to $995 million. Coach has been focused on store closures and developing new products to promote the exclusive character of its products. Sales in the Stuart Weitzman designer-shoe business edged up 1% and gross margin improved to 62.1%, up 390 basis points. Coach had been reportedly pursuing a potential acquisition of rival Kate Spade (KATE), but is now said to be aiming at adding the Jimmy Choo collection of luxury-category women's shoes to its brand portfolio.As seen in a weekly chart, Coach shares have been in a deep freeze ever since topping at 79.70 in March 2012. Yet since the stock has carved out a nearly 10-month saucer base that features a stingy decline of 22% from the 43.71 peak, a good sign.Also, notice how since January of this year, Coach has logged seven up weeks in above-average weekly turnover and only one down week in heavy trade.Coach's Apparel-Clothing Manufacturing industry group is ranked a lowly 146th out of 197 industry groups for six-month relative price performance. That's slightly up from 164th six weeks ago. Yet the 28-member group shows just two companies with an RS Rating of 80 or higher, and both trade below 10 a share.When a stock has emerged out of a bottoming base pattern, it's not a surprise to see a low Relative Price Strength Rating. Prior to Tuesday's big gain, Coach showed a thin RS Rating of just 30, well off its nine-week high of 60 on a scale of 1 to 99.Among the other beaten-down groups that rebounded nicely Tuesday, Community Health Systems (CYH) of the Medical-Hospital industry group surged nearly 20% to 10.32, closing above the critical 10 level for the first time since late October. The Franklin, Tenn., firm reported a 70% drop in Q1 earnings to 7 cents a share. Revenue fell 10%. However, it beat profit views by 14%, and Q2 profit is seen rebounding 56% to 14 cents a share.Due to Tuesday's big gains, Community Health saw its RS Rating catapult from 70 to 92. Watch to see if that rating continues to rise or stay high in the near term. A 92 means Community Health now bests 92% of all stocks in IBD's database over the past six months.In the cement, concrete and aggregates industry group, Martin Marietta (MLM) gapped up and powered nearly 8% higher to 239.85 in volume that jumped 152% above average. The stock is now just 1% below a recent 52-week peak of 243.98. The stock has been basing for 14 weeks and has formed a saucerlike base with a 244.08 new entry.Martin Marietta's Q1 earnings fell 3% to 67 cents a share, but that followed an 886% leap in adjusted profit in the year-ago quarter. It crushed Wall Street's consensus view of 40 cents. Revenue rose 7% to $844 million.Martin Marietta was formerly part of Leaderboard, but its Jan. 25 breakout past a 236.51 entry failed to bear fruit. Leaderboard currently shows nine long growth-stock plays and features annotations on daily and weekly charts to identify proper buy points and signals of heavy institutional buying or selling.In economic news, April U.S. car sales disappointed the Street at an annualized rate of 16.9 million units, well below the Econoday forecast of 17.2 million. Some automakers got drilled. General Motors (GM) slid 3% to 33.20, diving well below its long-term 200-day moving average. Volume shot 60% above its 50-day average. With a 40 RS Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, GM is outrunning only 40% of all publicly traded companies over the past 12 months.The car sales data followed a lower-than-expected reading on the U.S. manufacturing landscape. On Monday, the ISM survey for April came in at 54.8, below the consensus view of 56.5 but still indicating expanding activity in the nation's factories.On Wednesday, keep an eye out for the ADP private-sector jobs report for April (Econoday sees a 170,000 lift in payrolls) and the nonmanufacturing ISM services survey (seen at 55.8).The Federal Reserve's latest meeting on interest rates started today and is expected to finish Wednesday amid little fanfare. According to CME Group, the activity among fed funds rate futures traders shows that there is a 95% probability that the key rate on overnight bank loans will remain in the 0.75%-1% target range.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Will These 10 Top Growth Names Win Big In 2017?The Case For A New Bull Market In GoldHow To Find Great Breakouts: Check The Stocks Near A Buy Zone Weekly FeatureHow To Spot Group And Sector Rotation: Use IBD's 197 Industry Groups TableIBD Big Picture: Fed Minutes Spook Stocks; Which IBD 50 Names Should You Sell?

506,CME,"XPresident Trump's directionless policy agenda and his bear hug of dovish Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen are wreaking havoc on market expectations, with an assist from international uncertainty.The 10-year Treasury yield on Thursday sank to 2.23%, a level not seen since the week after Trump's election. Wells Fargo (WFC) tumbled 3.3% to its worst close since Nov. 9, the first day of the postelection rally, after reporting weaker-than-expected revenue. Dow component JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C) cleared analyst estimates with their first-quarter reports, but saw modest early gains turn into losses of about 1%, with both stocks stuck below their 50-day averages.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index both appeared headed for a third straight lower close as weakness continued to extend beyond financials to infrastructure stocks, another group that soared on the Trump agenda. The Dow, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite are all trading below their 50-day moving averages.Dow construction equipment giant Caterpillar (CAT) slipped 1.9%, while steel maker U.S. Steel (X) tumbled 5.9%. U.S. Steel crashed 10% on Wednesday, its worst loss in nearly a year, as steel makers and miners plunged with iron ore prices.IBD'S TAKE: While the stock market rally has stalled out in the U.S., emerging markets stocks are rallying. Learn why they're rising, and which emerging markets are outperforming their peers.This week's action appears to represent the biggest reversal of the Trump effect to date. The reversal is more obvious in the Treasury market, where yields have fallen to their lowest levels in almost five months, than in equity markets that are still not too far from the lofty postelection peaks. Perhaps the clearest evidence of the change is visible in Fed rate expectations.Despite the Fed's stated intention to raise rates twice more this year and also to begin unwinding its balance sheet by a change in its reinvestment policy, which represents a third tightening, markets are now only pricing one more hike this year, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool. What's more, the second rate hike isn't seen until at least March of 2018. That's basically where expectations stood before Trump's election led the Fed to take a hawkish shift.Trump's announcement this week that he is putting repeal of ObamaCare back at the top of his agenda, even though prospects for success look negligible, seem to have cemented doubts that Trump will be able to enact pro-growth tax cuts and infrastructure. That's a bitter pill for investors who had been banking on big corporate tax cuts in the Trump era.The White House also revealed this week that it is undertaking a broad search for options to offset the cost of tax reform. While the possibility of success can't be completely ruled out, the outcome will likely hinge on whether Trump can get near-unanimous support among GOP senators for a big deficit-increasing tax cut at a time of high and rising debt levels.The latest blow to Fed expectations and banks came when Trump told the Wall Street Journal in a Wednesday interview that he liked low interest rates and would consider reappointing Yellen as chair at the end of her term in February 2018. There are three Fed governor openings that Trump has to fill, and there's now substantial doubt that he'll appoint any hawks. That's quite a surprise, considering that Trump said Yellen's low rates had created a ""big fat, ugly bubble"" during the campaign. Prospects for faster growth and higher rates that allow for a wider margin between lending and borrowing rates had made banks among the big winners of the Trump rally.RELATED:Stock Rally Tiring As Trump Policy Agenda Runs In CirclesThis 'Explosive' Protectionist Signal From Trump Looks Like A Dud

507,CME,"The stock market loves to do the unexpected. Veterans on Wall Street call it a contrarian streak.Did you see the latest example of the market's psychological mischief? On the night of the Nov. 8 presidential election, fear consumed traders. At one point futures on the Dow Jones industrials index plunged 800 points. Yet by Friday, the index finished the week up 959 points, more than 5%.This past week, the popular blue-chip gauge refused to give back any of last week's rally. The Russell 2000, meanwhile, started the week with an upward surge of nearly 1.3%, after catapulting more than 10% higher last week. With less than an hour to go in Friday's trade, the popular small cap index was poised to gain another 2.4%.The S&P 500 closed down less than 1 point on Monday, but also looks to finish higher for the week. That's bullish action, considering that the large-cap benchmark climbed an astonishing 79 points, or 3.8%, last week.The NYSE composite also looks set to gain some additional ground for the week, following a 3.5% gain last week.Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) all struggled on Monday with losses of 2% to 3% each, yet the market cap-weighted Nasdaq composite finished down only 0.4% on Monday. Why? The Nasdaq is certainly dominated by large tech and consumer-oriented companies, but don't forget the thousands of other smaller firms in the fields of banking, retailing, manufacturing, biotechnology and commodities.Did you see solid gains in heavy volume by Airgain (AIRG) (now up 35% past 17.04 IPO base buy point), Cognex (CGNX) (extended 10% past a 53.55 flat base proper entry) and WingStop (WING) (building a new base since Aug. 15)? All of these Nasdaq-listed names rallied big for the week in rapid turnover.Such action is a hint that equity trading desks and large funds aren't finished buying yet, even after last week's big stock market bounce.Looking ahead, will the market do something even more unexpected?To be more specific, will four years of Donald Trump in the White House be just what the doctor ordered to keep the aging stock market rally going even with 7-1/2 years of gains already behind it? And could the rise in U.S. equities even accelerate?America and the world are still pondering the latest sea change in U.S. politics and governing. But the accompanying chart suggests that good times for long-suffering equity investors may be closer around the corner.Why? The market action since 2000 has been showing similar action to an earlier period: 1968 to 1987.For 14 long years from 1968 to 1982, the S&P 500 struggled to break free from a grinding trading range. Slow growth and high inflation kept it trapped in a series of bear markets, the worst of which cut the market in half in 1973-74.That all changed in 1982 when President Ronald Reagan slashed taxes and unleashed an 18-year super bull market.Jump to 2000. After extraordinary stock gains that ultimately ended in extreme excesses, it was time for another long period of consolidation. It took 13 years for the S&P 500 to completely break through to new high ground. But for the past two years, the stock market has been stuck in neutral.History doesn't precisely repeat itself, but as the late writer Mark Twain was once quoted as saying, it does rhyme. Today, if you overlay the current market with the earlier period on the chart, an interesting parallel emerges.

508,CME,"Tech stocks were in the driver's seat again for the third straight session Thursday as Wall Street weighed strong housing data, more earnings reports and comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.However, data networking gear stalwart Cisco Systems (CSCO) and retailing giant Wal-Mart (WMT) lagged in the Dow after reporting earnings. Cisco slumped nearly 6% and Wal-Mart gave back 3%.Nasdaq 100 component NetApp (NTAP) gapped up over a 36.20 buy point but gave back early gains. Shares still rose 7% after the maker of network storage and data management hardware reported better-than-expected earnings late Wednesday.The Nasdaq composite added 0.5%, the S&P 500 rose 0.3% and the Dow Jones industrial average was mostly unchanged. Volume on the Nasdaq was tracking slightly higher than Wednesday's level in the stock market today. NYSE volume was on pace to be slightly lower.In economic news, U.S. new-home construction jumped to a nine-year high in October, weekly jobless claims dropped 19,000 to 235,000, a sign that the U.S. labor market is getting tighter. Economists expected a small increase to 257,000.Meanwhile, in testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, Yellen reinforced expectations of a rate hike at the Dec. 14 meeting. Currently, futures traders think there's a 90% chance of it happening, according to data from the CME Group.Among the day's movers, consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) gapped up over a 40.31 buy point, jumping 13% to 45.70. The stock opened at 42.93 and was in buying range for awhile but not anymore. A big earnings beat was the catalyst, helped by strong sales of televisions and related home theater products, mobile phones, wearables and connected home devices.MaxLinear (MXL) outperformed in the IBD 50, rising 4% to 22.15. It's still in buy range from a 21.52 cup-with-handle buy point. Nvidia (NVDA) also did well with a nearly 2% gain. Shares soared 30% last week on strong earnings, but the stock is close to moving above an upper channel line which would be a sell signal for those with a big profit in the stock. Elsewhere, Middleby (MIDD) continued work on the right side of a base as shares rose around 3%. The stock is working on its sixth straight gain after reporting earnings last week. Earnings growth has averaged 32% over the past four quarters. Sales growth has averaged 28% over the same time period.

""It's saying that somebody in the market is either hedging for potential higher prices in 2017, or somebody is taking a bet that prices will be higher next year.""Oil prices on Tuesday had the biggest one-day surge since April as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries embarked on a final diplomatic effort to secure an oil-cuts deal.

The producer club, meeting formally on Nov. 30 in Vienna, is under pressure to formalize a deal it set out in September that's supposed to limit supply.The surge in calls trading also helped lift the total number of lots traded to an all time high.

The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.2% as Financials and Home Depot's (HD) earnings weighed on the blue chip index. The market-leading Russell 2000 fell 0.4%. The small-cap index has been on a seven-day winning streak.Volume was tracking modestly lower in the stock market today on both the NYSE and Nasdaq.Home Depot reported its fiscal third quarter earnings this morning of $1.60 per share, surpassing the consensus estimate of $1.58. On the revenue side, Home Depot recorded $23.15 billion. Same-store sales rose 5.5%, which also beat Wall Street's 4.4% estimate. The stock was down 2% after trading higher in the premarket following the earnings beat.Home Depot has been in a downtrend since early August and may be in the process of building the right side of a base. The stock has a great earnings track record and an EPS Rating of 94. However, the RS Rating is a weak 36.

514,CME,"October's 2.8% annual rise in average hourly wages was the best since 2009, but it's a safe bet that the pace of wage gains will keep rising in coming months, likely by a good amount.That may dent the market's confidence that the Federal Reserve, after hiking rates next month, will stay on hold until the very end of 2017.There are three reasons why a further pickup is pretty much baked in the cake:First, labor markets are getting tighter and the competition for good workers is heating up.Starbucks (SBUX) on Oct. 3 gave a wage hike of at least 5% to every barista and manager at all of its U.S. stores. In July, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon announced that the company would boost the minimum wage for 18,000 tellers and customer-service workers from $10.15 to $12 over two years.On an Oct. 26 conference call, Panera Bread (PNRA) said average associate wages rose 5% in the third quarter, both to ""effectively compete for talent"" and keep up with higher minimum wages. Panera CFO Michael Bufano went so far as to call the level of wage inflation ""unprecedented"" and noted that the company raised bakery prices 2.4% during the quarter to offset cost increases, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.Second, average hourly wages have been rising at a 3.1% annual rate over the past six months and even faster over the past three months, 3.3%. In other words, monthly wage growth would have to slow to keep the annual rate of increase from rising significantly.Third, wage growth went through a slump in late 2015 and early 2016, so the weak comparison is likely to make the wage acceleration look even stronger than the underlying trend. In particularly, the three-month pace of wage growth fell to 1.9% in December 2015 and again in February 2016.Then, at the end of February, Wal-Mart (WMT) boosted wages by $1.5 billion, and Target (TGT) and Costco (COST) quickly followed with wage hikes of their own.IBD'S TAKE: The best stocks tend to have margins that are high relative to those of rivals and that are steady or growing, so look for companies that have the pricing power to withstand rising wages. For a primer on profit margins, read this Investor's Corner. IBD makes research easier with a proprietary SMR Rating that combines sales growth, profit margins and return on equity. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see how your stocks rate.Markets took the news in stride on Friday that average hourly wages accelerated, with the 10-year Treasury yield and U.S. dollar index both losing ground. Yet it's hard to tell what's driving markets at the moment, in particular whether Donald Trump's revived presidential hopes are trumping other market-moving news.On Friday, Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart said he was ""open to running the economy hot"" to heal the labor market, but that's not yet a consensus view.Lockhart also said that ""turmoil around the election"" could interfere with December rate-hike plans.In September, when the Fed signaled that a December rate hike was coming, the median projection of policymakers was for two hikes in 2017. For now, markets aren't taking the Fed at its word. On Friday, the CME Group FedWatch tool showed markets pricing in a 71.5% chance of a December hike but just a 30.6% chance of a second hike through November 2017.RELATED:U.S. Added 161,000 Jobs, But Best Wage Gain Since 2009 Puts Pressure On Fed This Is The Best News About Wage Growth In A Year (But Markets Won't Love It)

515,CME,"The U.S. economy added 161,000 jobs in October, the Labor Department reported Friday, slightly below views, while wage gains ramped up.Economists had expected an increase of 173,000 jobs, though the prior two months were revised up by a combined 44,000.The unemployment rate dipped to 4.9%, as expected.But average hourly wages rose 0.4%, slightly stronger than expected. Hourly pay climbed 2.8% vs. a year earlier, the best since 2009, sending the 10-year Treasury yield higher.Odds of a December interest-rate hike, which had come down in recent days as markets fell and Donald Trump's odds of winning the White House rose, stood at 71.5% on Friday morning, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.This is the last employment report before Election Day on Nov. 8. The latest IBD/TIPP Presidential Election Tracking Poll has Trump and Hillary Clinton tied for a third straight day at 44%. There will be one more jobs report before the Fed's year-end meeting.The pace of job gains has moderated and is now running at 181,000 per month this year, a significant step down from monthly gains of 229,000 last year and 251,000 in 2014.Yet Federal Reserve policymakers have been expecting and even hoping for a moderation in job growth, so slower growth is unlikely to alter rate-hike plans. That's because they think the U.S. is close to full employment and don't want the labor market to overheat, forcing them to pick up the pace of rate hikes.That's why the pace of average hourly wage gains, which offers the clearest signal about how much labor market slack remains, is even more important than job growth in determining the Fed's rate-hike trajectory.Some anecdotal evidence has been pointing to a possible acceleration in wage gains from the muted pace that has defined the recovery.Starbucks (SBUX) on Oct. 3 gave a wage hike of at least 5% to every barista and manager at all of its U.S. stores.On an Oct. 26 conference call, Panera Bread (PNRA) said average associate wages rose 5% in the third quarter, both to ""effectively compete for talent"" and keep up with higher minimum wages. Panera CFO Michael Bufano went so far as to call the level of wage inflation ""unprecedented"" and noted that the company raised bakery prices 2.4% during the quarter to offset cost increases, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.David Ownby, CFO of the Regal Entertainment (RGC) movie theater chain, said wages pressures were ""at the high end of the range maybe of what we have experienced historically.""Keith Cline, CEO of the La Quinta Holdings (LQ) hotel chain, spoke of ""competitive wage inflation"" to get the best people, noting that ""labor in our industry is tight.""IBD'S TAKE: The best stocks tend to have margins that are high relative to those of rivals and that are steady or growing, so look for companies that have the pricing power to withstand rising wages.

518,CME,"When the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on June 15, among the stated reasons was concern about Brexit just a week ahead of the United Kingdom's fateful vote.Minutes of that meeting show that rate-setting committee members discussed the magnitude of the effect on financial markets from a U.K. vote to leave the European Union.""It is a decision that could have consequences for economic and financial conditions in global financial markets,"" Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said in her post-meeting press conference. ""If it does so, it could have consequences in turn for the U.S. economic outlook that would be a factor in deciding on the appropriate path of policy.""The same might be said of the coming U.S. election. Economists and market analysts have estimated that a victory by Donald Trump could send major indexes down 5% to 12% and emerging market currencies, particularly Mexico's, could take a hit.(Trump and Hillary Clinton are tied at 44% in the latest IBD/TIPP Presidential Election Tracking Poll, after Clinton led by four points as of last Friday, when the FBI announced it was investigating new emails related to Clinton's email scandal.)Yet it's a safe bet that the Fed's decision Wednesday won't be guided by a candid discussion of the impact of a Trump victory. The GOP nominee has already criticized Yellen for letting politics determine the easier-than-expected path of policy. While there's ample reason to doubt that charge, contributions to Hillary Clinton's campaign by Lael Brainard, a leading dove and possible Clinton treasury secretary, have put the Fed in the political spotlight and risked undermining its reputation for independence.The Fed can avoid that uncomfortable conversation for now because there's never been a chance of a rate hike so close to next week's election. The real question is how a Trump victory could alter the chances of a hike in December. Odds have fallen from all-but-certain territory as Trump's electoral odds have improved since the FBI bombshell. The CME Group's FedWatch tool now shows 69.1% odds of a rate hike next month, down from roughly 85% last week.IBD'S TAKE: Stocks have fallen, gold prices have soared and the dollar has retreated in recent days, as the FBI reveals more evidence that stocks will fall if Trump wins.The 10-year Treasury yield and dollar both surged before Trump's rebound, as the Fed moved toward hiking rates even as other global central banks are still in easing mode for the foreseeable future. The rise in rates has been a modest negative for interest-rate sensitive sectors. Shares of Ford Motor (F) are close to a four-year low, while Home Depot (HD) shares are near an eight-month low.Meanwhile, the dollar's strengthening boded poorly for U.S. multinationals like General Electric (GE), which is close to an eight-month low after curbing its full-year earnings guidance as the dollar's rise cuts 6 cents per share from its bottom line.But now investors have bigger concerns, even as yields have come down and the dollar has lost a bit of the ground it gained on other major currencies last month. While the actual policies that Trump will implement as president are difficult to predict because he's unpredictable and they will require the backing of Congress, his threats of tariffs, walking away from Nafta and an immigration crackdown are making investors nervous.RELATED:FBI Reveals More Evidence That Stocks Will Fall If Trump WinsFed Keeps Rates Steady, Signals Slower Rate Hike Future

Markets don't see another rate hike until March 2017, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool.But markets have been on a roller-coaster ride since they woke up after the U.K. Brexit vote results came in on June 23. Stocks initially tumbled, but the S&P 500 and Dow industrials hit all-time highs this week. After falling to a historic low of 1.34% before last week's June employment report, the 10-year Treasury yield has bounced back to 1.59%. That jobs report, showing a 287,000 increase in payrolls, erased concerns caused by the negligible May payroll gain.For now, yields may keep rising without a Fed hike because markets might start to price in a faster pace of rate increases in 2017 and 2018.Fed policymakers have signaled that they want time to assess the impact of the U.K. voting to leave the European Union. Initial indications are that the vote will hurt the U.K. but shouldn't be much of a negative for the U.S., which got a short-term boost from lower interest rates that fueled a surge of mortgage refinancing.While eurozone economies are expected to face a drag from weaker trade with the U.K., the real wild card is whether the political backlash that spurred the Brexit vote spreads to other parts of Europe, especially Italy. The next shoe to drop could come in October, when Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's package of constitutional reforms meant to overcome gridlock faces a referendum.If Renzi's vote fails, he'll be on the way out, and the vacuum could put the anti-EU Five Star Movement in the driver's seat. But all that could take a year or more to play out, and the odds of Italy ever abandoning the euro are slim.Bottom line, European politics are unlikely to provide the Fed much of an excuse to stay on the sideline for long, particularly if core inflation continues to pick up.The core CPI, excluding food and energy, rose 0.2% in June and 2.3% from a year ago. The annual gain matched the biggest increase since September 2008.Services inflation, excluding energy services, rose 3.2% from a year ago in June, also matching May's gain for the biggest since September 2008.The Fed has set a 2% inflation target. But the central bank's preferred price gauge, the PCE deflator in the income and spending report, showed only a 1.6% annual gain as of May.Food prices fell 0.1% in June, as the price of food consumed at home fell 0.3% and the food away from home rose 0.2%. Now, food at home costs 1.3% less than a year ago, while food away from home is up 2.6%. That pricing differential may be among the reasons why fast-food chains like McDonald's (MCD) and Wendy's (WEN) have a seen a slowdown.Sales at food services and drinking places fell 0.3% in May, one of the softest spots in an otherwise solid retail report.Meanwhile, industrial production perked up 0.6% in June, the best gain in 11 months. Manufacturing output rose 0.4%, mining 0.2% and utilities 2.4%. That's the first time all year that each of the three categories saw an increase.Overnight, China said the world's No. 2 economy expanded 6.7% in the second quarter vs. a year earlier, matching Q1's pace. Economists had expected a dip to 6.6%. Meanwhile, separate June reports on industrial production, retail sales and bank loans all showed accelerating growth, topping forecasts.

528,CME,"The U.S. economy saw job growth rebound in June as payrolls surged by 287,000, following May's downwardly revised 11,000 gain.Average hourly earnings edged up 2 cents to $25.61, up 2.6% from a year ago, which is the biggest annual gain in 2016 and tied for the best of the recovery.Over the past three months, job gains have averaged 147,000, which marks a clear slowdown from the 196,000-per-month gain in the first quarter and 229,000 average monthly gain in 2015.Still, along with the upward trend in wage gains, the more moderate pace of job growth likely would have been fast enough for the Federal Reserve to start hiking rates again soon, but Brexit will likely keep policymakers on the cautious side.While major stock indexes got a nice lift from the encouraging jobs report, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both up over 1% in the morning, the 10-year Treasury yield has barely budged from the record lows set earlier in the week.IBD'S TAKE: Stocks rose solidly Friday on the jobs report. Investors are cheering the stronger hiring, but without fears that it will trigger a near-term rate hike due to Brexit.According to the CME Group FedWatch tool, markets don't expect any rate hikes through at least June 2017, but some economists find that hard to believe.""Some moderation in employment dynamics was expected as the U.S. economy has basically reached full employment, and the trend growth in the labor force is somewhere between 100,000 and 125,000,"" wrote Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research.In other words, employment growth above 125,000 will reduce what little labor slack is left, in his view. Bandholz expects a rate hike at the end of 2016.Wells Fargo Securities economists are on the same page: ""The continued rise in payrolls along with the very modest rise in average hourly earnings will keep (Fed) policy tilted toward another fed funds rate increase this year, but we believe it is unlikely to come before the election,"" wrote John Silvia and Sarah House.The rebound in job growth came as the leisure and hospitality sector added 59,000 jobs, health care 39,000, information industries 44,000 and retail 30,000.The goods-producing sector added 9,000 jobs, but that came after four months of declines. In June, mining industries shed 6,400 jobs, while construction employment was flat and factories added 14,000 workers.The jobless rate rose to 4.9% from 4.7% in May, as 414,000 people streamed back into the labor force, while employment rose by 67,000, according to the household survey that tends to be more volatile than the more closely watched establishment survey.The Verizon Communications (VZ) strike had cut May employment by as much as 35,000, and its resolution provided a comparable boost to the June payrolls.Many analysts had expected an upward revision to May's figures. Bandolz noted that imperfect seasonal adjustments to the data by the Labor Department likely explain a big part of May's weakness and June's strength.
"
529,CME,"The unexpected U.K. vote to leave the European Union has predictably set off a flight to safety, sinking global equity markets and Treasury yields, while boosting the value of the dollar.The immediate consequences are the opposite of what the weak global economy needed and have just put further pressure on the Federal Reserve and other central banks that were already running low on firepower.While there's much uncertainty about how the EU's second-largest economy will disentangle itself from the economic and political union, and while the process will play out over two years or more, economists are now forecasting a brief U.K. recession in 2017.Yet the U.K. only accounts for about 2.4% of global GDP, meaning that even a moderate recession is something the rest of the world should be able to take in stride. So why would global markets come unglued over Brexit? The short answer is that there's a lot more at stake than just U.K. GDP.""It is not an exaggeration to suggest a new world order will need to be defined, and further changes to the EU's composition clearly cannot be ruled out,"" wrote Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research. ""This is a momentous day for the U.K., but also for the EU -- investors simply can no longer make the assumption that the status quo will always prevail.""The Brexit vote will provoke ""a crisis of confidence in the whole (European) integration project,"" wrote Daniela Schwarzer of the German Marshall Fund of the U.S. ""Market pressure may be particularly high on the southern periphery where sovereign debt is reaching unsustainable levels and instabilities in the banking sector persist. The situation is particularly fragile as Portugal, Spain, Italy and France all have weak leaders or face political instability.""Still, Schwarzer writes, there is an opportunity for France and Germany to offer reforms in short order that address ""what people seem to worry most about: security, welfare and migration.""For now, though, uncertainty about the future of Europe and concern about the disruption of trade are likely to weigh on investment and growth. IHS Global Insight, which had been forecasting 1.5% GDP growth in Germany in 2017, now sees growth of 0.4% to 0.9%.U.S. economic growth also may take a small hit. A stronger dollar after Brexit will hurt the earnings of U.S. multinationals, make domestic manufacturing less competitive and dampen capital investment. Global banks and travel-related stocks, such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), American Airlines (AAL), Priceline (PCLN) and United Airlines (UAL) were among Friday's biggest losers.The dollar's rise also could trigger bigger problems in emerging markets, especially China, which could come under further pressure to ease its currency peg as the country tries to keep its economy from slowing too much. Slower global growth also will be a negative for commodities prices.Federal Reserve policymakers were divided earlier this month between those who wanted to raise rates one more time in 2016 and those who favored two hikes. Now, Fed rate hikes appear to be off the table for the foreseeable future, after a lone hike in December 2015The CME Group's FedWatch tool says markets are pricing just a 22% chance of another rate hike by the policy meeting next Feb. 1.The Fed released the following statement Friday morning: ""The Federal Reserve is carefully monitoring developments in global financial markets, in cooperation with other central banks, following the results of the U.K. referendum on membership in the European Union.""The Federal Reserve is prepared to provide dollar liquidity through its existing swap lines with central banks, as necessary, to address pressures in global funding markets, which could have adverse implications for the U.S. economy,"" it said.The 10-year Treasury yield fell 17 basis points to 1.57%, hitting a four-year low intraday, as prices for the safe haven asset climbed. In the short term, this should be a positive for the housing sector, for consumers who refinance their homes and for auto purchases.As far as actually boosting growth, it's not clear that the extraordinary measures already tried by the Fed, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan can make much more of a difference. The ECB and BOJ continue to conduct asset purchases, known as quantitative easing, and more recently have tried negative rates, with little or nothing to show for it.""Monetary policy ... may have become counterproductive at the margin,"" wrote Andrew Bell, the chief executive of Witan Investment Trust in London. ""The next phase will need to create a source of demand"" via fiscal policy.Thomas Simons, senior money market economist at Jefferies Fixed Income, told IBD that Brexit will increase the urgency of central bank policy that puts money in the hands of consumers, rather than quantitative easing that reduces borrowing costs but requires an appetite for lending to work.While the U.S. economy remains in relatively good shape because it is domestically fueled and services-oriented, he thinks the Bank of Japan is going to have to lead the way in a so-called helicopter drop: ""transfer cash directly to the treasury, then the treasury would have a large amount of fuel"" to propel the economy out of its funk.
"
530,CME,"The Federal Reserve, while holding rates steady as expected on Wednesday, took a dovish turn but also signaled that markets might still be too complacent about the chances for rate hikes later in the year.While a hike at the next meeting July 27 is very much of a long shot, individual members’ projections for future policy still point to two hikes this year. However, six Fed officials now see just one hike this year, vs. just one official back in March. Eleven still see at least two hikes this year. Not all of those 17 officials are voting members this year.The median forecast among policymakers is for a federal funds rate target of 1.6% at the end of 2017 and 2.4% at the end of 2018, down from a respective projections of 1.9% and 3.0% in March.But markets are no longer pricing in any tightening at all this year, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool, with a 48% chance at the February meeting next year.Stocks initially held onto their modest gains from before the Fed announcement, but turned negative shortly before the market close. The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow industrials all closed 0.2%.The 10-year Treasury yield fell after the Fed meeting to 1.59%, closing at the lowest levels since 2012. The dollar eased.Given the recently poor track record of Fed projections, which had penciled in four 2016 rate hikes last December, investors may take the latest batch of forecasts with a grain of salt. Further, policy uncertainty is especially high, with the upcoming Brexit vote deciding whether the U.K. will leave the European Union, which could trigger a bout of investor risk-aversion.Fed Chair Janet Yellen said in a post-meeting press conference that the Brexit vote due for later this month played a factor in the decision to leave rates unchanged, and its outcome could impact policy in the months ahead.The Fed statement noted that labor market gains appear to have slowed in recent months, even as economic growth has picked up.Mixed recent data suggest the Fed's ""cautious approach"" to normalizing rates is appropriate, Yellen said. She highlighted weak business investment, even outside the energy sector, as an unexpected and persistent economic drag.Treasury yields have been sinking along with market expectations for future rate hikes since May’s employment report showed just 25,000 private-sector jobs were added last month. Policymakers and investors will be awaiting further data to see if job creation has slowed markedly, or whether the report was a one-month blip.Yellen is seen as among the most dovish Fed policy committee members. In a June 3 speech, following the weak jobs report, she characterized current rate levels as only “modestly accommodative.” In the same speech, she downgraded her sense of whether and when further rate hikes would be appropriate from “probably in the coming months” to “probably.” She also raised a possibility that slower hiring in April and May would prove to be “a harbinger of a persistent slowdown in the broader economy.”The Fed projections show that more members have come around to her viewpoint, though she doesn't yet hold sway.Members now see 2.0% growth in 2016, 2017 and 2018, trimming estimates of 2.2% this year and 2.1% next. The slower trajectory of expected rate hikes comes despite modestly higher-than-expected inflation, with members seeing core inflation of 1.7% this year, up from a 1.6% forecast in March.

The proposal requires regulatory approval.Few exchanges still have trading floors. Most fully operate out of nondescript data centers rather than grand temples of capitalism like the iconic New York Stock Exchange building in Manhattan. One of the biggest exchange operators, CME Group (CME), shut most of its pits last year and plans to close more in the next few months. The options market is an exception, a trend driven by some investors’ preference for the human touch when placing the complicated orders options trading is known for.“There’s still a very good reason for trading floors to exist in options trading to facilitate these complex options trades,” Chicago-based Boyle said in an interview.BOX is one of 14 exchanges in the U.S. equity options market. The Chicago Board Options Exchange has had a trading floor in Chicago since the 1970s, NYSE Group has them in New York and San Francisco, and Nasdaq (NDAQ) operates one in Philadelphia. But starting a new trading floor is unusual these days.“I can’t remember the last time someone has opened an open-outcry floor,” said Larry Tabb, the CEO and founder of research firm Tabb Group LLC, who’s been in the securities industry since 1980.BOX is owned by TMX Group, which also controls the Toronto Stock Exchange, and a group of brokers.

But the details offered a less-than-ideal combination: slowing growth, falling employment and higher prices.Meanwhile, U.S. auto sales flattened out last month after speeding ahead in April out of March's soft patch. General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) reported surprisingly sharp declines, while Fiat Chrysler (FCAU). Construction spending also took a step back, falling 1.8% in April, which was surprisingly weak since there was a big upward revision to the prior month's rise, from 0.3% to 1.5%.Factoring in the ISM and construction reports, but not auto sales, the Atlanta Fed's GDP tracker cut its forecast for second-quarter growth to 2.5% from 2.9%. That would mean less than 2% growth for the first half of the year, following a weak first quarter. Still, markets are pricing in a 60% chance of a late July rate hike, though just a 24% of a move in June, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.The ISM production index eased to 52.6 from 54.2 in April. Meanwhile, the employment index held steady at 49.2, indicating a sixth straight month of declining factory jobs. The real sign of strength came in the index of input prices, which rose to 63.5, the highest since June 2011, as 13 industries reported paying higher raw material prices, with just 3 seeing lower prices.""Prices are the main story from this report,"" wrote Wells Fargo economists John Silvia and Tim Quinlan. ""The rise for input prices puts a squeeze on profits and prompts concerns of further Fed rate hikes.""The most hopeful signs in the report — new orders barely dipped to a solid 55.7 and export orders held at 52.5 for a third straight month of growth — were offset by a drop in the order backlog index to 47 from 50.5.Auto production, which has been a bright spot for U.S. manufacturing, faces demand headwinds. General Motors reported an 18% sales drop in May, or 13% excluding declines in low-margin fleet sales.General Motors also reported parts shortages. GM shares fell 3.4% to 30.22 on the stock market today.Ford (F) sales sank 5.9%, and its shares slid 2.8% Wednesday.Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), which has benefited especially from low gas prices due to its reliance on Jeep SUV and Ram truck sales, reported a 1.1% sales increase. But Fiat Chrysler shares still fell 1.8%.April construction spending was weak across the board. Residential construction fell 1.5% amid a 3.1% drop in apartment construction. Private nonresidential building also fell 1.5%, while spending on public projects fell 2.8%.Anirban Basu, chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors, said the data may signal ""growing skittishness among private developers, who have become increasingly concerned by possible overbuilding in commercial, office and lodging markets.""Basu also noted that ""nonresidential construction is facing severe constraints given an insufficient number of qualified workers.""Basu's analysis echoed anecdotal information assembled in the Fed's beige book.""Retailers across many Districts reported increased competition from online sales, citing a shift in consumer preferences away from in-store shopping,"" benefiting the likes of Amazon (AMZN).Also, the report noted, ""continued difficulty finding workers in numerous occupations"" in the Richmond district.""Contacts in Atlanta and Richmond said high-skill workers in high-demand fields continued to be hard to find, and low-skill jobs were also becoming harder to fill. In St. Louis, contacts that reported having trouble filling job vacancies primarily cited few applicants or candidates lacking the necessary skills. In St. Louis, more than two-thirds of hiring managers reported increasing wages and salaries by more than they had in the past few years to retain employees and attract new ones.""Jefferies fixed income economists summed it up like this: ""The labor market and inflation continue to develop in a manner consistent with the Fed’s goals, though the tone across various districts remains mixed. The reports in the Beige Book do not present any evidence that the FOMC should delay a rate hike in June.""

And April pending home sales jumped 5.1% to a 10-year high.The data indicate the U.S. economy is strengthening, boosting the odds for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates soon. The probability of a quarter-point rate hike in June is at 30%, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool. The odds of at least a quarter-point hike in July is now 58%.

540,CME,"There used to be time when a big day for Apple (AAPL) and its chip suppliers would lift the Nasdaq to a lofty gain, but that wasn't the case Monday. The Apple effect was true, at least for a while, but faded as stocks ended with small losses in lower volume. The S&P 500 lost 0.2%, the Nasdaq fell 0.1%…
"
541,CME,"Back in the day, if you wanted to get long the S&P 500 you had to purchase 500 separate stocks… That’s too many positions for your average investor / trader to manage, a fact which in the early days kept all but the most sophisticated market participants from trading the S&P 500 directly. Then, in April of 1982 the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) began trading a new type of futures contract. These contracts were “cash settled” which represented a radical departure from the “physically settled” commodities that had preceded them. Cash settlement changed the game and opened the door to financial futures contracts: instead of having the shorts forced to deliver a commodity at expiration they could merely settle the cash value of the contracts instead.The end result of all this meant that instead of buying 500 individual stocks a trader could buy one contract which gave them nearly the same risk exposure as owning the basket of individual cash equities themselves which made up the S&P 500 index. It turned out to be a popular idea. Just about a year later, the options markets followed suit, creating S&P 500 options contracts. These were derivatives on a derivative, based on an index. The mental gymnastics required to intuitively grasp such concepts took years to percolate through financial markets, but it could be argued that this made the economy stronger in many ways as a result.Then came the era of financial engineering which gave rise to over the counter derivatives. These “swaps” began to trade hands in greater and greater volumes, allowing sophisticated investors (which in this context means rich, not necessarily smart) the opportunity to make leveraged investments on baskets of stocks with greater ease than ever before.This process helped create the fertile environment in which we now live. In this new financial order, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) allow investors a plethora of opportunities to trade products heretofore unavailable to them. Many of these ETF’s are built upon the financial innovations of the past. Examples include leveraged and inverse equity ETF’s as well as exchange provided contracts for speculating on volatility and other higher dimension markets.For traders looking to speculate on the rise or fall of the US stock market, the current state of financial innovation offers a dizzying array of alternatives to choose from for any given risk exposure. For example, if we wanted to get long, i.e. to profit from rising prices in the S&P 500 we could:No pun intended, but that’s a lot of options! Given the choices, how do we evaluate which position to take? To begin to answer a question like that, it helps to visualize a number of likely scenarios. This can help a trader identify which position offers the best balance between risk and reward subject to a trader’s own internal needs and wants.  For every trader, this scenario analysis begins with the humble 1-lot.Depending on the market, a “1-lot” can take on a number of meanings. In the US stock market, the term refers to 100 shares or a “round” lot. In the futures markets the term refers to 1 contract. In the world of vanilla options, 1 contract can take on meanings ranging from 1 contract to 100 shares to a yard of yen. Whatever your numeraire or denomination, every student of the market begins with a 1-lot.Let’s begin by defining some hypothetical prices to get started. It is important to remember that these prices are not real prices, but merely provide an example to serve as a starting point for your own analysis of the market. Additionally, since not all of the products mentioned are available for long-term positioning, we will assume for the purposes of this example that we are looking to profit from a short term move that will occur during an intraday time-frame. This way we can compare apples to apples instead of short term against long term positions.Thus, suppose that at 9:30am the S&P 500 index is trading at 2075.0 even. Furthermore, suppose for simplicity assume that the S&P 500 futures contract is trading at 2075.0 as well. Additionally the SPY ETF is trading at $207.50. Let’s assume we think the market is going to rise by the end of the day. How could we profit from such a belief?Let’s start by evaluating some of the possible positions we could take to “get long” the S&P 500 index. The first method is to simply buy 100 shares of the SPY ETF. In this case, the cost of this position would be $20,750.00 given the purchase price of $207.50. Likewise, the max risk of this position is also $20,750.00. It is important to note that each “point” in the SPY is worth $100 per one-lot. Because the SPY tracks the cash equities closely, it will exhibit a very high correlation with the underlying index (aka we could call it “Delta one”)The second method we could take is with futures – we could buy 1 E-mini S&P contract on the CME. Depending on the current mood of the exchange, the collateral we would have to post for this position is probably around $5,000. Unlike some of the other methods we will discuss, if the position moves against us by more than around 100 ticks we could experience what is known as a margin call, which is a situation in which we have to post more collateral than we initially allocated when we initiated the position. Each “point” in the E-mini is worth $50 per one-lot.  Much like the SPY, the price of the E-mini futures contract will have very high correlation with the underlying index.A third method comes from Vanilla Options. For example, we could buy 1 contract of some kind of vanilla call option on the S&P 500 index. This could be an in the money, at the money, or out of the money option based on trader’s degree of aggressiveness. Out of the money options are in general the most aggressive type of position: the underlying must by definition make a significant move in order for the option to become in the money.  Going long options has the benefit of a known, limited amount of collateral to initiate the position. However, due to their mathematical complexity long options will have a varying degree of correlation with the underlying index (and thus subject to “dynamic hedging”)Another path we could take is with products called binary options. These are similar to long vanilla options but have a binary payout instead. In other words, if the strike of a binary option is 2100, the option will payout $100 if the underlying is above 2100 at expiration and zero otherwise. These options share many of the same traits as vanilla options, such as limited collateral and varying degree of correlation with the underlying. However there is one important difference: because binaries represent yes/no outcomes, the current price of a binary option is a proxy for the market’s expected probability of the underlying closing above a given strike at expiration. This could be more intuitive for some traders to understand compared to the premium of a vanilla option.The final option combines aspects of options and futures together into one product. Double barrier spread contracts, technically swaps in the United States, are in many ways like a future but act like options due to their barriers. In general, a spread contract has an upper and a lower strike. The upper strike puts a cap on the maximum value of the position (max value is upper strike minus lower strike). The lower strike puts a floor on how much money you can lose going long the position.For example, suppose again that the E-mini S&P 500 futures contract is trading at around 2075.0. In particular, let’s take a look at the Nadex US 500 Spread with an upper strike of 2085 and a lower strike of 2065 which is based on the E-mini S&P futures. In this scenario, it is quite likely that the spread is trading at right around 2075.0, the middle of the range. In this scenario the spread will likely act a lot like a futures contract, rising and falling tick for tick. Here the funding required is much less where each “point” in the Nadex spread is only worth $10 per one-lot or $1 per tick.As the underlying approaches a barrier, however, optionality will creep into the price of the spread. For example, in the scenario above there could be another option with an upper barrier of 2095 and a lower strike of 2075. In this case, the price of the spread is likely to be above 2075. How much “premium” the price will include depends on the market’s expectation of future volatility. In general, the higher the expected future volatility the greater the spread price will diverge from the underlying when near a barrier.Now let’s examine what happens to each position under a rally in the stock market. In the first scenario, let’s assume that the S&P 500 experiences a decent rally towards the end of the day and is trading around 2095 by 4:15pm eastern time.In this scenario the SPY ETF is going to make money as the underlying index rises in value. After subtracting the costs of the fund the SPY is going to rise by a similar percentage to that experienced by the underlying index itself (e.g. [2095 – 2075] / 2075 = approximately 1%) . Your maximum risk, although it is unlikely to be encountered in a given day, is the full value of the position.The second method is via E-mini futures. In this case the dollar profit is relatively easy to calculate, simply take the number of points profit (20) and multiply it by the value of a point ($50) which means the e-mini one-lot will make $1000 in this scenario using initial collateral of around $5000. This is a return of around 20% on the collateral. Remember, however, that our maximum risk in this position could actually be greater than the initially collateral we posted.To calculate how much money we made from buying a vanilla option, we need to know how much premium we paid for the option and what the strike was. If the premium we initially paid was too high or the strike too far out of the money, we could still lose money even though the market rallied as we expected. If we paid a cheap enough price for the premium, however, we could make a decent percentage return on our investment.To calculate how much money we made from buying a binary option, we simply need to know the initial price we paid for the option (cost) and the final closing price of the underlying. If the underlying closes above our options strike, then we make $100 minus this initial cost, otherwise we lose the initial premium. This provides us a wide range of risk/reward opportunities. For example, we could simply buy a binary with a strike below the current price of the S&P 500, for example say 2070. If we paid $70 for this option it would expire at $100 even if the market moved sideways, no need for a rally. However we risk losing the full $70 if the market drops below 2070. Alternatively we could also take an aggressive stance, paying $20 at 9:30am for the 2090 strike. When the market rallies to 2095 this binary will make $80 profit on a $20 investment.Finally this brings us to the double barrier spread contracts. If we select a spread which is trading in the middle of the upper and lower strikes then the position's P&L will behave like a futures contract until it approaches one of the barriers. If we select a spread with a lower barrier near the current level of the market, its price will be determined by the market's current expectation of future volatility. This creates the potential for option like ROI if you're correct and the market rallies, as in this case the spread acts more like an out of the money call option.There are a wide range of methods available to modern traders to get long a stock index like the S&P 500. Which one is right for you depends on your preferences for blending risk and reward? The good news is that you can structure the trade in different ways depending on your current risk stance and outlook on the market whether you want to trade aggressively, or conservatively.Futures, options and swaps trading involve risk and may not be appropriate for all investors. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

542,CME,"There are two possible explanations for why markets so badly misjudged how close the Federal Reserve is to resuming interest-rate hikes.One possibility is that investors misread Fed Chair Janet Yellen's speech on March 29 asserting that ""caution is especially warranted"" when it comes to raising rates with global risks so high and policymakers so low on conventional ammunition to counteract a downturn.Yet it seems much more likely that markets received the surprisingly dovish message as it was intended and responded just as Yellen hoped, easing global stresses that had grown as the dollar's rise exacerbated pressure on China to devalue its dollar-linked currency.Wednesday's release of the minutes from the Fed's April 27 meeting -- less than a month after Yellen's market-shifting speech -- suggest another explanation. Yellen went out on a limb. While she was able to move markets, she couldn't get other generally dovish policy-committee members to follow her.Now the U.S. dollar index is rebounding, reaching its highest point since -- you guessed it -- Yellen's March 29 speech, which isn't great news for U.S. multinationals like General Electric (GE) and Apple (AAPL), whose foreign earnings take a hit when the dollar rises. On an otherwise good-news day thanks to earnings surprises from Wal-Mart (WMT), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Cisco Systems (CSCO), the S&P 500 is testing lows also not seen since her New York Economic Club appearance.IBD's Take: How strong is Salesforce's stock -- and how does it stack up vs. rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupIn recent weeks, markets had pegged December or possibly next February for the likely timing of the Fed's next rate hike, with the odds of June falling close to zero. Now the odds favor a July hike and there's a roughly 40% chance of a second hike by December, according to the CME Group FedWatch page.""A June hike ... seems to be a very realistic scenario,"" wrote Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research. ""The only real question remains whether the last round of data is enough to convince the more cautious FOMC members, most likely including Chair Yellen ... that the growth rebound is more than a fluke.""On Thursday, New York Fed President William Dudley said at a press briefing that ""a tightening in the summer, the June, July time frame is a reasonable expectation.""He noted that market expectations of a summer rate hike were ""way too low"" in recent weeks. That echoed other Fed officials this week.Probably the most surprising part of the April meeting minutes was the characterization that ""Most participants judged ... it likely would be appropriate for the Committee to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in June,"" provided that economic growth picked up after a slow first quarter, labor market conditions continued to strengthen and inflation moved closer to 2%.Even though most members credited the Fed's dovish inter-meeting communications for the easing of global financial conditions, most Fed policymakers were anxious to begin removing policy accommodation, ignoring Yellen's call four weeks earlier to tread with extra care.It seems likely that Yellen -- unless she backed away from her strong stance in such short order -- wasn't part of the majority thinking a June rate hike might be appropriate. That would be quite a change from her predecessor Ben Bernanke's apparent ease in building a consensus.Yellen's speech had essentially positioned the Fed, at least temporarily, as the world's central bank, making global growth economic and financial risks from China and other emerging markets just as much a part of the rate-setting calculus as inflation at home.But while her stance seemed prudent in light of the market turmoil that followed closely after the Fed's move to raise rates in December for the first time in a nearly a decade, her colleagues showed that they're not prepared to play central bankers to the world -- unless it's clear that the world is falling apart.

543,CME,"Wednesday was shaping up to be a solid session for the stock market, that is, until the minutes from the late-April Fed meeting were released at 2 p.m. ET.The minutes showed that committee members weren't averse to a rate hike in June if economic data continues to be strong. At the start of the week, the odds of a rate hike at the June meeting, according to CME Group FedWatch, were 4%. Now they're at 34%. The 10-year Treasury yield spiked on the news, rising 10 basis points to 1.87%.The Nasdaq halved a 1% intraday gain, rising 0.5%. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 were mostly unchanged.Preliminary data showed volume on the Nasdaq coming in slightly higher than Tuesday's levels. NYSE volume fell. On the NYSE, declining stocks outnumbered advancers by more than 2-to-1. It was the other way around on the Nasdaq, with winners topping losers by a small margin.After the close, Salesforce.com (CRM) jumped  5.5% in after-hours trading after the enterprise software maker reported strong earnings. Tesla (TSLA) was under pressure, though, on news of a share offering. Shares of Tesla jumped 3% in the regular session after Goldman Sachs upgraded shares to buy from neutral, citing valuation.In the stock market today, financials outperformed on growing expectations for a Fed rate hike. In the ETF space, SPDR S&P Bank (KBE) and SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) outperformed, rising around 4% each, but both are still trading near their 200-day moving average lines after getting resistance there last month.Retailer Lowe's (LOW) cleared a base in heavy volume, rising 3%, after reporting strong earnings before the open. Lowe's price action was much different than Home Depot's (HD), which slumped 2.5% Tuesday on similarly strong results.But the news wasn't so good at Target (TGT). Shares gapped down and lost 8%. A bigger-than-expected 5% decline in fiscal Q1 sales trumped a better-than-expected 17% increase in profit.

544,CME,"Stocks sagged Wednesday afternoon after the Federal Reserve's April minutes hinted at a rate hike in June.The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 held moderate gains running up to the release. The April 26-27 minutes revealed that members considered a June hike likely if the economy continued to improve. The Fed will next meet June 14-15.The Nasdaq was up 0.1% after being up as much as 1%. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each lost 0.4%. Volume was running slightly higher on the Nasdaq. Accurate volume data on the NYSE were not available.Blue chip financials made strong moves. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) popped 3.6% and Goldman Sachs (GS) 2.6%. Traders attributed the gains to somewhat higher conviction that the Fed might raise rates at its June 14-15 meeting. Higher rates could help boost bank margins and also encourage more loans.CME Group FedWatch pegged the probability of a Fed rate hike in June at 19% just before the Fed released its minutes and 34% after the release. A few days ago, the probability was fixed at 15%.The economy has been showing some signs of strength.A stronger-than-expected report Tuesday on industrial production caught the Street by surprise. Analysts expected a 0.2% gain in April industrial production, but the percentage came in at 0.7%. While that pleased the bulls, the bears pointed out that the number was largely driven by a 5.8% surge in utilities production. Weather was unseasonably warm in March, setting up an easy comparison. However, the weather factor was no secret when the Street shaped its estimates.A couple of top-rated stocks made nice moves on news.Beacon Roofing Supply (BECN) rose almost 2% in strong volume. The stock dropped 5% Tuesday in heavy trade on news of a secondary offering. Apparently second thoughts prevailed Wednesday, although the stock remained below the 50-day line. The secondary offering involves CD&R Roadhouse Holdings' sale of $8.5 million shares. Beacon is not selling shares, and so there will be no dilution. The count of shares outstanding will remain the same.Fast-food chain Sonic (SONC) dived nearly 9% in heavy volume. Sonic lowered guidance on same-store sales for fiscal Q3 ending in May.Sonic is No. 3 vs. the other restaurant stocks at IBD Stock Checkup. Who is No. 1 and No. 2?After the close, cloud-computing company Salesforce.com (CRM) will report fiscal Q1 results ended in April.

546,CME,"Three exchange traded funds that specialize in dividend stocks are tracing bullish patterns on their charts. Moreover, they seldom drop more than 15%.Slow and tight price activity characterizes this trio of ETFs, reflecting the quieter nature of stocks that tend to belong to mature companies whose dividends appeal more to investors than share appreciation.For investors content with dividends and moderate price appreciation rather than the immediate satisfaction of a price rally, the three funds -- all part of IBD's ETF Leaders screen -- are sound choices. But there's a trade-off with the low volatility of dividend ETFs because price performance is dull.PowerShares High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers Portfolio's (PEY) worst drop since the 2009 market bottom was a 19% correction in May 2010. (That excludes the Aug. 24 market mini-crash.)The fund's dividends produce an annualized yield of about 3%. In the latest monthly payout, investors got about 3.5 cents a share. The ETF is up about 13% this year, but it declined 12% in a November-January correction.The Dividend Achievers fund tracks a portfolio of stocks with solid dividends and dividend growth rates. The ETF is close to new highs after finding support at the 10-week moving average, despite the fact that some of its top holdings are oil companies that have been battered lately. Murphy Oil (MUR), the largest component, is about 30% below a 52-week high.As its name implies, the mission of PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio (SPHD) is not just to tap dividend companies, but also stocks with historically subdued price performance. Its steepest decline since the fund launched in 2012 was 10% in 2014. Shares are finding support at their 50-day moving average.The ETF's annualized yield is about 3%. Shareholders were paid about 11.5 cents a share at the end of April. The bulk of the portfolio is in financial, utility and industrial companies.IShares Select Dividend (DVY), which is also rising slowly from its 50-day average, had a couple of 18% declines in 2010 and 2011, but the worst drop since then was a 9% correction in 2014. Shares are near highs as they test the 50-day line. Shareholders are paid dividends on a quarterly basis. In March, they got a little over 63 cents a share.IShares Select Dividend tracks a Dow Jones index of 100 of the highest-dividend-yielding securities, excluding real estate investment trusts. Top holdings include Lockheed Martin (LMT), CME Group (CME), Chevron (CVX) and Philip Morris (PM).The comfort of steady performance, however, was nowhere to be found on Aug. 24, when machinations in electronic trading resulted in a mini crash for most stocks. PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend collapsed as much as 38% before paring most of the loss. IShares Select Dividend crashed 35.5%, and PowerShares High Yield plummeted 29% before both erased most of those huge losses.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

"
550,CME,"The Federal Reserve held its key rate steady, as expected, on Wednesday and gave no signal that it's ready to shift to tightening mode at its next meeting in June.The Fed noted in its post-meeting statement that even amid further labor-market strengthening, ""growth in economic activity appears to have slowed"" while household spending growth has moderated. The Fed also cited soft exports and business fixed investment, while noting further improvement in housing.Unlike the March statement, in which global economic and financial concerns outweighed stronger activity and an inflation uptick in the U.S., domestic growth issues took precedence.Global concerns have moved to the background -- gone was March's warning that ""global economic and financial developments continue to pose risks"" -- even if they continue to weigh on U.S. investment and exports.With global risks having abated, the Fed has moved closer to renewing the normalization of interest rates begun last December, but it's not there yet. The CME Group FedWatch page shows that investors are now pricing in 52% odds of a rate hike at the Sept. 21 meeting, but just 19% odds of a move on June 15, down slightly from Monday's odds.Stocks, which had sold off on weak earnings from Apple (AAPL), Twitter (TWTR) and others, rebounded following the Fed statement, with the Dow and S&P 500 closing modestly higher on the stock market today. Meanwhile the 10-year Treasury yield dipped, after rising in the seven prior sessions.The first big test of the Fed’s messaging will come in June, when policymakers will have to show their cards by updating their expectations for the trajectory of Fed rate hikes. The question then will be whether it's on track for two quarter-point hikes this year, as indicated after the March meeting, or just one, as financial markets now predict.A surprisingly dovish speech from Fed Chair Janet Yellen on March 29 gave investors confidence that the Fed will take its time before shifting out of neutral. She highlighted the risks tied to China’s link to the dollar and noted the plight of other commodity-dominated emerging economies that borrow in dollars.The Fed's dovish turn aided a 5% fall in the dollar against other major currencies from its 2016 high, easing global stresses and lifting profits of U.S. multinationals. Wal-Mart (WMT), Apple, General Electric (GE) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) have cited the negative impact of currency fluctuations in recent quarters.In the same speech, Yellen noted that the level of the fed funds rate, still close to zero, left central bankers low on ammunition -- all the more reason not to raise rates prematurely.Only one dissenter at the March meeting, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Esther George, wanted a quarter-point hike.A further sign that policymakers, as a group, aren't ready to shift to tightening mode: The statement omitted a judgment as to whether the risks to the Fed's forecast were balanced or still pointed to the downside, as previously implied.Still, a number of bank economists put out research notes saying that if economic data meaningfully improve between now and the June meeting, a rate hike could be on the table. Some said the same about April. One more reason why it may be unlikely: The U.K. is set to vote a week after the Fed's June meeting on whether to remain in the European Union.
"
551,CME,"With the Federal Reserve set for a two-day, no-action meeting, Chairwoman Janet Yellen has reason to smile: Finally, investors and central bankers are on the same page.Despite the universal view that the Fed won't touch rates this week and the strong sense that policymakers won't sound any less dovish after another quarter of dismal growth, Treasury yields just rose for the sixth straight day, albeit to a historically low 1.91%, from 1.75% on April 15.In other words, markets are doing the Fed's work for it -- without throwing a tantrum. That, in turn, may give Fed policymakers a bit more patience to stick with their recent shift toward erring on the side of being too dovish.The first real test of the Fed's messaging won't come this week, but in June. That's when policymakers will have to show their cards by updating their expectations for the trajectory of Fed rate hikes. The big question then will be whether the Fed is on track for two quarter-point hikes this year, as indicated after the March meeting, or just one -- as financial markets currently predict.The CME Group's FedWatch page shows that markets see a 0% chance of a rate hike this week. November is the first meeting with better-than-even odds of a rate hike, at 53%, but Sept. 21 meeting odds are just a whisker below 50%.On Monday, the U.S. dollar index dipped a quarter-point to 94.8, having barely budged after a two-day tumble set in motion by Fed policymakers cutting their 2016 rate-hike plans in half in March. An abbreviated dollar rally got its legs cut out from under it two weeks later when Yellen gave a speech signaling that the Fed has become the world's central bank -- at least for the moment.Yellen highlighted the economic and financial risk tied to China's link to the dollar, and she noted the plight of other commodity-dominated emerging economies that borrow in dollars. The stronger dollar, after its biggest rise in decades starting in late 2014, had exacerbated those international pressures while also depressing the earnings of U.S. multinationals.In the same speech, Yellen said that the level of the fed funds rate, still close to zero, left central bankers low on ammunition, but she said that it's a reason for greater caution against raising rates too quickly.The modest weakening of the dollar, especially if it continues, is good news for the earnings of corporations from Wal-Mart (WMT) to Apple (AAPL), General Electric (GE) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). All have cited the negative impact of currency swings in recent quarters.A weaker dollar should, over time, be positive for net exports and business investment, two economic soft spots that the Fed highlighted. A weaker greenback has also helped push up the price of dollar-denominated commodities, including crude oil.Despite some lackluster data recently, including disappointing retail sales and a slower rise in core inflation in March, Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research, sees renewed rate hikes no later than September.Because the June meeting comes just a week before the Brits vote whether to leave the European Union, the Fed's decision will be a close call, Bandholz says.""The tightness in financial conditions (early in the year) has been reversed,"" he said.With payrolls growing by about 2% a year and a little bit of real wage growth on top, the Fed's outlook is ""fundamentally all on track.""Incoming data, particularly faster wage growth, could shift up the timetable of rate hikes. Last week, Target (TGT) hiked its minimum wage to $10 an hour, following recent wage boosts from Wal-Mart and Costco (COST).

552,CME,"The stock market turned in a solid performance Wednesday, as the release of the minutes from the March 16 Federal Reserve meeting didn't do much to alter an overall bullish tone.At the close, the Nasdaq was up 1.6%, the S&P 500 added 1.1%, and the Dow Jones industrial average picked up 0.6%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in slightly lower than Tuesday's level. Nasdaq volume rose a bit.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil for May delivery jumped $1.86, or 5.2%, to $37.75 a barrel after the U.S. government reported an unexpected drop in crude inventories.Biotechs did the heavy lifting in the Nasdaq. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) outperformed, rising 6%. Regeneron (REGN) and Biogen (BIIB) were among the best performers in the Nasdaq 100, up 6% and 5% respectively.In a nutshell, the Fed minutes showed that sentiment was running against a rate hike later this month. CME Group FedWatch currently has the odds of a rate hike at 3%. The 10-year Treasury yield added 3 basis points to 1.75%.In the stock market today, fast-growing homebuilder LGI Homes (LGIH) jumped nearly 13% in strong trade. It cleared resistance around 25 as it worked on the right side of a possible base. Late Tuesday, the company said new-home closings surged 23.2% in March.Most IBD 50 stocks were higher, led by Acuity Brands (AYI), which bolted  more than 13% upward following a strong quarterly earnings report. The stock rocketed past an alternate entry at 242 after hesitating around an earlier 225.28 entry of a cup-with-handle base.Pfizer (PFE) and Allergan (AGN) both rose after the drugmakers abandoned a $160 billion deal that would have shifted Pfizer’s headquarters to Ireland and provided the company an overseas tax shelter. Allergan rose 3.5% after plunging almost 15% on Tuesday following the Treasury Department's unveiling of rules aimed at discouraging such tax-inversion deals. Pfizer gained 5%.Meanwhile, oil-field services giants Baker Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton (HAL) outperformed in the S&P 500, jumping 9% and 6%, respectively, after the Justice Department filed a lawsuit to halt their planned merger on concerns that the combined company would stifle competition in the sector.After the close, watch for earnings from retailers Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) and small-cap Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI).

554,CME,"Intercontinental Exchange is lining up financing for a bid for the London Stock Exchange Group, according to people familiar with the matter, as it prepares to go head to head with Deutsche Boerse to win control of the U.K. company.Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which is working with Morgan Stanley (MS) and Moelis & Co. to explore a takeover of LSE, is in discussions with banks to fund a formal offer in the coming weeks, the people said, asking not to be identified as the deliberations are private. Talks are at an early stage, no final decision has been made on the timing or size of the bid, and ICE could still decide against an offer, they said.Deutsche Boerse and LSE on Feb. 23 announced talks to combine and create a global player worth at least 20 billion pounds ($28 billion), which could better compete with ICE as well as CME Group (CME), the world’s largest derivatives market. A formal proposal from ICE or Deutsche Boerse could spark a bidding war between the suitors, which each have until late March to make an official offer for the bourse under the U.K.’s takeover rules.Deutsche Boerse is likely to announce the details of a merger plan with LSE as early as next week, according to a different person familiar with the matter. ICE, which sees the potential to generate more cost savings with LSE than Deutsche Boerse, is likely to wait until after the Germans bid, one of the people said.CME Group is also working with advisors to assess whether it could challenge the deal, people familiar with the matter said last week.Representatives for ICE and LSE declined to comment. An official for Deutsche Boerse didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

As those concerns recede, the Fed has fewer impediments standing in the way of a rate increase.""
"
576,CME,"Now the funny thing is that the FED is clearly split....some say go, while other say no.......and yesterday's statement was supposed to remove any doubt at all about the coming increase.   Remember - the FED remains 'data dependent' so we will get two more months of 'data' before the FED meets again on Dec 16th/17th.....but remember - they may have wanted to send 'that wakeup call' but in the end - yesterday's statement DID NOT commit to a December move.....(they left the door slightly ajar so that they have an exit plan....)

Last night we ended at S&P 2090.....a good 30 pts above support.....earnings are coming to an end and so the focus will return to more broader global macro issues once again....For now - I think we are in the 2060/2100 range...and if the 'data' continues to disappoint then expect the mkt to find its legs and push higher (indicating NO rate increase) ....but if as Janet indicates - the 'data' becomes stronger -then yes....look for the mkt to back off as the reality of an 'increase' hits home....and the mkt re-prices.  Either way - I do not think we get a move in 2015...so I suspect that the mkt churns and attempts to return closer to the yearly highs (2150)  as we approach year end.

As those concerns recede, the Fed has fewer impediments standing in the way of a rate increase.""Now the funny thing is that the FED is clearly split....some say go, while other say no.......and yesterday's statement was supposed to remove any doubt at all about the coming increase.   Remember - the FED remains 'data dependent' so we will get two more months of 'data' before the FED meets again on Dec 16th/17th.....but remember - they may have wanted to send 'that wakeup call' but in the end - yesterday's statement DID NOT commit to a December move.....(they left the door slightly ajar so that they have an exit plan....) And amuse themselves is exactly what they did.....Stocks rallied early on prior to 'the announcement'  - the DOW was up 131 pts at 2 pm.....then the news hits...the mkts stumbles as it dissects the headline...then the algo's hit......sending stocks into a minor tailspin sending the DOW  - down 287 pts - from hi to lo.....in a matter of 13 mins.....only to reverse and surge higher into the close as the 'smart algos' realized that the statement didn't really say anything new...there was NO definitive decision....there was nothing in there that sets the path for a move in December at all.....Yeah - there was a vague reference to a move - but does anyone really believe it to be true?  Not yesterday anyway...as they closed the mkt on its highs  at 2090 on the S&P and 17,779 on the DOW..... You gotta love when the FED speaks out of both ends, no? It is interesting to think that all of a sudden the FED thinks that economy is ready to launch..... Remember!  The Fed hasn’t raised interest rates since 2006 - (they have only lowered them)  and here 9 yrs later  when we have zero interest rates (while some countries have negative rates)  - we also have manufacturing crashing, durable goods and retail sales plunging our national debt approaching $19 trillion, housing still struggling, healthcare costs soaring, wages stagnating,  entitlement programs exploding, Underemployment still in the double digits, weak commodity prices, struggling global economies, half the world in recession and the other half gasping for air and NOW she thinks it's the right time to launch?   Is it me?  Now all this says is that monetary policy alone cannot solve the world's problems....so I once again point the finger at leadership.....or lack of...but hey...that's a conversation for another time I guess.....In the end - The FED made it clear that they won't raise rates until they are 'reasonably confident' that the data supports the move.....and that ain't happening in 60 days.....Technically  - the mkt has enjoyed a surge off the August lows...making everyone 'feel better' but is it really better?   Have we moved too fast and now need to play catch up?  I think that answer is yes....and as the mkt gets used to the latest FED speak and analysts/strategists recalculate the possibilities - I suspect that we see the mkt back and fill..... Last night we ended at S&P 2090.....a good 30 pts above support.....earnings are coming to an end and so the focus will return to more broader global macro issues once again....For now - I think we are in the 2060/2100 range...and if the 'data' continues to disappoint then expect the mkt to find its legs and push higher (indicating NO rate increase) ....but if as Janet indicates - the 'data' becomes stronger -then yes....look for the mkt to back off as the reality of an 'increase' hits home....and the mkt re-prices.  Either way - I do not think we get a move in 2015...so I suspect that the mkt churns and attempts to return closer to the yearly highs (2150)  as we approach year end.Now this morning - US futures are off 8 pts  as we await the first release of 3rd QTR GDP...and it does not have a 3 handle on it, and it does not have a 2 handle on it......we will be lucky if it has a 1 handle on it...as the Atlanta FED suggests it will be 0.9% (vs. the robust 3.9% in the 2nd qtr) and some of the biggest investment banks in the country are looking for 1.2% - 1.4% .  The 'official' (govt) expectation is for a reading of +1.6%.... and if it comes in stronger then I think someone will have 'a lot of 'splainin to do' ......Look for earnings today from MasterCard (MA),Western Union  (WU), CME Group  (CME),Air Products  (APD), Good Year Tires  (GT), Coca Cola  (KO), Pitney Bowes  (PBI),  and Marathon Oil  (MRO).....European mkts are in negative territory.....not big, but a bit softer....earnings are the focus.......DBK reports a loss of $6.5 bil  and said that they will CUT their workforce by some 26k jobs over the next 2 yrs - sending that stock lower.........Barclays also missed on their earnings....sending that stock down 4.5%... Frances Total Oil reports a 69% drop in revenue....(no surprise)  and they take the stock UP......Take good care.

""Income from some equities will still be competitive with fixed income.""
"
683,CME,"And most mutual fund investors and strategists expect dividends in general to rise next year. Taylor expects a repeat of the 10%-15% annual increases in recent years.

""Their average yield is about 1.5%, which is below the S&P 500's 1.9% on trailing earnings,"" he said. ""Retail chains are well built out, so they're not doing a lot of spending, which leaves them more to return to shareholders.""
"
690,CME,"He added, ""Home Depot (HD) is a good example of a consumer discretionary stock that should benefit from (those) tailwinds."" Consumers are increasingly comfortable making home upgrades and repairs because home values are up, the economy is stable and jobs feel more secure, Kirby says.

""Income from some equities will still be competitive with fixed income.""And most mutual fund investors and strategists expect dividends in general to rise next year. Taylor expects a repeat of the 10%-15% annual increases in recent years. Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices, said, ""We should be close to a double-digit gain, and that's conservative.""Ben Kirby, co-manager of $18.8 billion Thornburg Investment Income Builder Fund , expects to find prospects for higher dividends in financials and consumer discretionary.He likes JPMorgan Chase (JPM). He sees its capital adequacy ratio rising. ""At the same time, their litigation expenses should be declining, while their loan growth is anemic,"" Kirby said. ""So they'll have more cash for shareholders.""Their legal costs stem from such missteps as the ""London whale"" trading losses and practices related to mortgage-backed securities.He also likes the prospects of CME Group (CME). Rising interest rates tend to stoke stock market volatility. Money managers often hedge to defend against volatility. ""As a derivatives exchange, they would see more volume,"" he said.Retailers' StocksAnd Kirby sees potential dividend growth of at least 20% for the consumer discretionary sector. ""Their average yield is about 1.5%, which is below the S&P 500's 1.9% on trailing earnings,"" he said. ""Retail chains are well built out, so they're not doing a lot of spending, which leaves them more to return to shareholders.""He added, ""Home Depot (HD) is a good example of a consumer discretionary stock that should benefit from (those) tailwinds."" Consumers are increasingly comfortable making home upgrades and repairs because home values are up, the economy is stable and jobs feel more secure, Kirby says.Kirby dislikes the dividend prospects for smaller U.S. energy exploration-production firms, since low oil prices could hurt their earnings.But he says that large, multinational, integrated majors like Exxon Mobil (XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSB), Total (TOT) and BP (BP) ""will be able to maintain dividends by taking on debt, selling assets and reducing capital expenditures. And Total and Shell don't do share buybacks, which will leave them more for paying dividends.""Taylor likes large-cap tech names with ample dividend yields, such as Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT), IBM (IBM) and Apple (AAPL).And he likes holdings that are likely to echo this year's dividend hikes in 2015. He cites pump maker Pentair (PNR), insurer Erie Indemnity (ERIE), control-device maker Johnson Controls (JCI) and medical-devices maker Stryker (SYK).David Spangler, who runs the equities parts of two Thrivent funds, says that investors should not look for the highest dividends. Instead, seek companies strong enough to raise dividends.

696,CME,"This post is relevant to institutional investors interested in trading exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in significant volume. Individual investors do not always have access to liquidity providers to trade ETFs as referenced below. 
"
697,CME,"As we have highlighted over the last several months, investors can take a variety of approaches to help reduce interest rate risk in their portfolios. In our view, one of the most intuitive ways is to simply hedge the interest rate risk of existing exposures in a bond portfolio. In the same way that exchange-traded fund (ETF) investors have embraced currency-hedged equity strategies, we believe strategies that hedge the interest rate risk of popular fixed income strategies could see similar levels of adoption when rates start to rise. The premise is similar—both approaches enable investors to preserve exposure, yet hedge the risks they don't wish to take. However, hedging of any kind often sparks questions of mechanics and then liquidity and capacity from investors. It is important to remember that currency forwards and U.S. Treasury futures contracts are among the most liquid financial instruments in the world. As we will explain below, the mechanics of trading interest-rate-hedged strategies are generally no different from executing any other fixed income ETF strategy. 
"
698,CME,"One of the key differentiating factors of our approaches to rising rate strategies is based on how they are constructed: Maintain traditional bond exposure but dial down the interest rate risk through hedging. As a result, each of the strategies is constructed in the same way as a long-only bond stategy. However, a second step occurs whereby the strategy seeks to offset the interest rate risk of the bond portfolio by selling U.S. Treasury futures contracts. Given that Treasury futures are among the most liquidly traded futures contracts in the world,1 the additional cost of executing these trades is generally de minimis in most market scenarios. As a result, even though these strategies do not trade as much average trading volume as some other traditional bond ETFs, the underlying liquidity available is usually the same, if not greater, than the underlying securities themselves. 
"
699,CME,"Let's look at a real-life example of a $35 million trade that was executed seamlessly in the WisdomTree Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Zero Duration Fund (AGZD). Essentially, the strategy is long a broad portfolio of U.S. fixed income and short Treasury futures to offset the interest rate risk exposure across the yield curve. This trade happened in two tranches on September 4, 2014. At that time, AGZD was trading, on average, 6,036 shares a day, or about $300,000.2 The customer contacted the WisdomTree capital markets desk to get a better understanding of the underlying liquidity of the strategy in addition to the onscreen ETF volume. 
"
700,CME,"The capital markets team explained that the liquidity available in the marketplace would be the lesser of the long bond portfolio volume and the short Treasury futures that the Fund holds as hedges. In this case, the market value of the outstanding bonds in the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index is $17.4 trillion.3 Given that most fixed income securities tradeover the counter, there is generally less transparency about average daily trading volume in fixed income as compared to equities. However, the Federal Reserve recently reported that U.S. Treasury securities trade, on average, $489 billion a day.4 Given that this represents only 36% of the portfolio, we believe that aggregate bond strategies are among the most liquid in the market.5 For the short portion of the portfolio, U.S. Treasury futures trade $240 billion average daily volume.6 
"
701,CME,"This means that ETF market makers have at least $240 billion of daily liquidity to translate into the AGZD ETF for any customer. ETF market makers can then hedge themselves by replicating the underlying basket of the ETF. In the case of AGZD, if a market maker sold the ETF to a customer, they are short the ETF, and would then look to buy its equivalent positions of the underlying basket. In this case, the market maker would buy bonds in the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index and sell a combination of U.S. Treasury futures. Given the differences in daily traded volume, it is the hedge that determines the available liquidity. 
"
702,CME,"Let's look at how the trade in AGZD worked for this particular customer. As we mentioned, two tranches needed to be done for administrative reasons. The first one was traded at 10:37:12 on September 4, 2014, and the print can be seen below. 
"
703,CME,"The highlighted box shows that 397,502 shares (about $20 million worth) traded at $50.06. The offer on screen at the time was $50.10. So 65x the average daily volume of the ETF traded 4 cents inside the offer. We would interpret this as having no impact on the ETF price. 
"
704,CME,"Just to be sure, let's look at the second print. That same day at 15:29:01, 298,215 shares (about $15 million worth) of AGZD printed at $50.10. 
"
705,CME,"Again, the highlighted yellow box shows the print by the arrow at $50.10, and the offer at the time was $50.10. Again, no price impact to the ETF. 
"
706,CME,"This is an illustration of the theory of liquidity that we explained. This customer wanted to hedge the interest rate risk in the portfolio with an ETF that didn't have much regular daily volume. The customer did due diligence on the Fund and its underlying liquidity by using all the available resources, including the capital markets team at WisdomTree. What the customer discovered is that AGZD fit the investment needs and that $240 billion of liquidity was available in the marketplace. The customer then worked with the trading platform to use the services of a market maker to translate that $240 billion of underlying liquidity into the ETF at the requested size and time. The result was two trades done without price impact. 
"
707,CME,"Additionally, it is worth noting that liquidity is available on both entry and exit to the strategy. Market makers are often agnostic regarding buys or sells and just look to hedge themselves with underlying liquidity. Thus, when the customer intends to sell a position, regardless of AGZD's daily onscreen volume, the volume of the underlying basket will again be available, just as it was on the above examples.

The Fund may engage in ""short sale"" transactions of U.S. Treasuries, where losses may be exaggerated, potentially losing more money than the actual cost of the investment, and the third party to the short sale may fail to honor its contract terms, causing a loss to the Fund. While the Fund attempts to limit credit and counterparty exposure, the value of an investment in the Fund may change quickly and without warning in response to issuer or counterparty defaults and changes in the credit ratings of the Fund's portfolio investments.

758,CME,"Cheniere Energy, Inc. (LNG  -  Free Report) recently agreed to work with CME Group Inc. (CME  -  Free Report), one of the world's most diverse derivatives marketplaces, in order to create a futures contract for supplying liquefied natural gas (""LNG""). The deal, which will enable physical delivery of LNG produced in the United States, is expected to make the LNG market more transparent and liquid.The Sabine Pass terminal of Cheniere in the U.S. Gulf Coast will be the delivery location for the contract. The terminal operates four trains that produce 18 million metric tons of LNG a year, while two more trains are in the pipeline. Addition of the two trains will further increase the terminal’s capacity to 27 million metric tons of LNG a year. Moreover, Cheniere, which has a huge LNG focused business, is currently developing an exporting facility near Corpus Christi, TX.The new product is expected to be traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).Contract RationaleWith surging natural gas production from the U.S. shale revolution, LNG supply increased rapidly, bringing in opportunities as well as price risks for traders. The contract is expected to provide a significant LNG risk management tool for the exporters. Moreover, the deal can reinforce Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures’ role as a benchmark for international gas prices. Additionally, it will benefit United States, a key global LNG exporter, in view of its rapidly growing international demand due to the rising economies in Asia. Global LNG consumption was 39 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in 2017 compared with 29.1 Bcf/d in 2010. The global consumption is expected to further rise in the coming years through 2050 at around 3% per annum. This huge demand can be targeted by the growing gas export capacity in the country. In this context, the Cheniere-CME contract assumes greater significance.Price Performance Houston, TX-based Cheniere has gained 35.2% in the past year compared with the 26.5% rally of its industry.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Cheniere has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

760,CME,"Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (CBOE  -  Free Report) reported average daily volume (ADV) of nearly 7.3 million for June 2018. The company witnessed an improvement in its June ADV, which inched up 1.6% year over year.Total contracts for the month were 153.8 million, slipping 3% year over year. Of this, options contracts declined 2.3% year over year to 148.2 million while futures contracts fell 17.8% to 5.7 million from the year-ago tally. While Options ADV was 7.1 million, Futures’ was 0.3 million.Subsequently, ADV of the U.S. Equities Matched came in at 1.3 million shares last month, down 7.2% year over year whereas the European Equities Matched increased 9.5% year over year to €10.9 billion. The Global FX Matched improved 35.4% to nearly $37.8 billion.Though the June volumes were down compared with the year-ago level, the company witnessed a year-over-year ADV increasing year over year. Rise in trading volumes should consistently drive transaction fees (accounting for 70% of total operating revenues in 2017). As a result, the company has kept the revenue growth momentum up for the past several years.We believe, the company will retain this positive trend in the coming quarters, backed by a strong market position, global reach, prudent acquisitions and a robust portfolio of proprietary products.With respect to revenue per contract (RPC), the company estimates average RPC for Options for second-quarter 2018 to be in line with 24.2 cents reported for the two months ended May 31, 2018. For Futures, the company projects RPC between 3% and 4%, higher than $1.503 reported for the two months ended May 31, 2018. This estimate represents a shift in the mix of trading volume in June.Shares of Cboe Global Markets have lost 17.4% year to date against the industry’s increase of 4.8%. Nonetheless, we expect market volatility lending momentum to trading volumes, a diversified product portfolio as well as benefits derived from Bats Global acquisition to help the stock turn around in the near term.Cboe Global Markets carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

761,CME,"CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) recently announced the pricing of $1.2 billion senior notes. The notes will be issued in two tranches, 3.75% $500 million senior unsecured notes due 2028 and 4.15% $700 million senior unsecured notes due 2048.The company intends to deploy the proceeds from this offering along with cash in hand to finance the cash consideration of NEX Group plc by CME Group and CME London Limited.CNA Financial’s debt-to-equity ratio at first-quarter end was 10.2%, having improved 70 basis points from 2017-end level. With this new issuance, the ratio is expected to deteriorate 530 basis points. Nonetheless, the leverage ratio will still compare favorably with the industry average of 20.6%.However, with the new issuance, interest expense will increase. But we still believe in the company’s strong position to clear debts, banking on operational efficiencies, largely driven by organic growth.Though the interest rate is gradually improving, reflecting the country’s thriving economy, the rate is still low. With the last one-quarter percentage point hike, the interest rate currently stands at 2%. Projections at the June FOMC meeting indicate interest rate to reach 3.4% at 2020 end as GDP grows at 2% and inflation remaining at 2.1% in 2020.It seems a prudent approach on CME Group’s part to capitalize on the persistently low interest rate environment to procure funds. Also, lower interest rate reducing interest burden on borrowings combined with lower tax incidence should facilitate margin expansion.Shares of CME Group have rallied 16.5% year to date, outperforming the industry’s growth of 9.9%. Efforts to expand and cross-sell through strategic alliances, acquisitions, new product initiatives and a consolidated global presence should drive growth for the company, pushing up its shares. CME Group has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).    Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the finance sector are Nasdaq, Inc.

762,CME,"Nasdaq, Inc. (NDAQ  -  Free Report) has reported mixed volumes for second-quarter 2018. While U.S. equity options volume increased 8% year over year to 417 million contracts, European options and futures volumes registered 21.9 million contracts, down 1.4% year over year.However, revenues per contract for U.S. equity options remained flat year over year at 15 cents, although the same for European options and futures expanded 12.8% to 44 cents.Under its cash equities, Nasdaq’s U.S. matched equity volume in the first quarter totaled 83.8 billion shares, up 5.6% from the prior-year quarter. While the European equity volume rose 5.5% year over year to $232 billion. Again, the U.S. Fixed income volume contracted 13% year over year to $4,134 billion. Whereas the European fixed income volume was 7.5 million contracts, up 7.1% year over year.Nasdaq’s strategic initiatives have always accelerated growth. Improvement in non-transaction revenue base including market technology, listing and information revenues has been driving revenues. Management’s medium-term outlook calls for 8-11% growth.Moreover, strategic acquisitions have been helping the company diversify as well as add capabilities to its portfolio. The organization is also intensifying its focus on Nasdaq Private Market Alternatives and the Nasdaq Ventures to ramp up its growth profile over a longer term.In the second quarter, there were 3,632 listed companies on Nasdaq compared with 3,512 in the year-ago period. Total listings grew 4% over the year-earlier quarter to 4,021.Shares of Nasdaq have rallied 18.7% in a year, outperforming the industry's increase of 5%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter bottom line is pegged at $1.18, reflecting a 15.7% year-over-year climb on 2.9% higher revenues. The company is set to report second-quarter 2018 earnings on Jul 25 before the market opens.Our proven model does not conclusively show that the company is likely to beat estimates this to-be-reported quarter. This is because though the stock’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP, its combination with an Earnings ESP of -2.27% leaves surprise prediction inconclusive as the company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Concurrently, Nasdaq reported mixed June volumes.

Increasing electronic trading volume adds scalability and hence leverage to the operating model. Expansion of futures products in the emerging markets plus a rise in non-transaction related opportunities as well as OTC (over the counter) offerings should continue to contribute modestly to top-line growth in the years ahead.

764,CME,"Yesterday I detailed some of the ways an investor could invest in the crypto currency Bitcoin and the Blockchain technology that supports it. Read the article here>>  I then attended a ceremony Monday afternoon at the New York Stock Exchange in which Greg King of REX Shares and Brian Kelly, hedge fund manager and CNBC commentator rang the closing bell to commemorate the launch of their new Blockchain ETF. I’m going to follow up today with an explanation of that investment strategy.Many investors are interested in the concept and technology of Bitcoin, but don’t necessarily want to open a Bitcoin account (called a “wallet”) or trade Bitcoin futures because of uncertainty about price volatility. The price of the crypto currency in U.S. dollar terms has fluctuated significantly over the past year, going from $6,000 to almost $19,000 and recently settling back near $6,000. That’s probably an unacceptable level of volatility for most investment and retirement accounts.One sound way to gain exposure to the concept without direct exposure to the price of the currency itself is to invest in the companies that produce the goods and services that support the decentralized distributed ledger called the Blockchain that underlies Bitcoin and other crypto currencies.Initially developed to facilitate and document transactions in Bitcoin, the Blockchain has enormous promise to change the way information and transactional data are shared and stored. It has obvious applications in the business of financial transactions due to its speed and inherent security as well as its potential to remove the middlemen – and their added fees – from banking transactions and trading in securities like stocks, bonds and derivatives.The legal and medical industries and countless others could also benefit form the speed and security of distributed ledger technology.Proponents believe that the Blockchain will revolutionize our digital lives by reducing transaction times, improving security and reducing errors. True zealots believe it has the potential to be just as disruptive to the ways we transact business as the internet was in the early 1990’s and the rate at which it is being adopted does suggest that widespread acceptance could be just around the corner.Brian Kelly is a CNBC commentator, hedge fund manager and author of the book Blockchain Big Bang.  He is one of Wall Street’s foremost experts on crypto currency trading and the Blockchain. He recently partnered with REX Shares to create a BKC – The Blockchain equity ETF. (BKC  -  Free Report)The concept of the ETF is to offer investors an actively managed basket of stocks in companies that are involved in various aspects of the nascent Blockchain industry. The fund invests in four main categories – Wall Street Disruptors, Crypto Miners and Traders, Enterprise Blockchain Leaders and Decentralized Internet Builders.Just as is the case with index and sector ETFs, shares in BKC can be bought or sold just like any stock.Current holdings in BKC include companies that are invested exclusively in Blockchain, including dedicated crypto stocks in Asia like Global Unichip and GMO Internet, hardware manufacturers like Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report), both the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME  -  Free Report) and CBOE Global Holdings (CBOE  -  Free Report) and the investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report). Kelly will manage the holdings actively, which makes the fund more agile than a passive ETF that holds only the exact components of an index.When asked about the role he sees BKC playing in an individual investor’s portfolio, Kelly responded that investors should treat this as one of their more speculative investments and suggested an allocation of 5% or less of a diversified portfolio, with above average risk, but potentially huge return potential. He also sees this fund as a long-term investment-  rather than a trading vehicle - as success is expected to be achieved over years or even decades as Blockchain gets adopted in a wide range of industries and sectors.For investors who are intrigued by the concepts of crypto currency and Blockchain technology, but who aren’t interested in holding actual Bitcoin or other currencies, the Blockchain ETF is a way to gain exposure in the space with more typical equity investments.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!

765,CME,"Investors would have to be living in a cave to have not noticed the meteoric rise and recent pullback in the price of Bitcoin over the past year. Anyone who trades has to be intrigued by (and possibly skeptical of) any widely held asset that exhibits that kind of price volatility.But is it a fad, a bubble, or a legitimate investment opportunity?Spoiler Alert: It’s all of the above.Bitcoin as a crypto-currency was born out of the ashes of the financial crisis of 2008. Initially a response to the idea of governments “printing money” – expanding the balance sheets of central banks – in order to bail out troubled financial institutions and stimulate the economy. It was an attempt to de-centralize the notion of currency.Invented by a reclusive and mysterious programmer with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, the concept was to separate the control of the supply of money from the government and central banks and hand it to the market participants who use it as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Nakamoto also intended to remove the friction from financial transactions, allowing vendors and customers (or anybody) to transfer money directly to each other instantly and electronically without the participation of middlemen like banks or credit card processors.The actual identity of Nakamoto is not known, and it may in fact not be a single person. This doesn’t really matter as the source code was intentionally made available to anyone and “Nakamoto” has ceased interacting with the public or the bitcoin network.The “Blockchain”The revolutionary aspect of Bitcoin was the establishment of a distributed ledger in which transactions are verified and recorded by multiple parties in a vast peer to peer network. Every participant records and stores every transaction that has ever happened, broken down into manageable chucks of data called “blocks.” Every participant must agree that they have an identical copy of the previous set of transactions and that the new trade belongs at the end of the list.Because all participants must agree on the sequence of transactions, it would be functionally impossible for anyone with nefarious intent to add a fraudulent transaction to the chain (or delete a legitimate one) since the change would have to happen simultaneously in thousands of places. This also means that the network literally gets more secure with every transaction processed - as the list that would have to be altered grows ever larger.“Miners”The participants who process transactions and store the data of the blockchain are called Bitcoin “miners”, so named because their incentive is to be rewarded with new bitcoins for their efforts. The network has them process a very computationally difficult math problem to complete transactions. New bitcoins are awarded to the miners who solve the problem first. The fact that the problem gets continuously more difficult ensures that a large number of participants devotes a massive amount of computing power to the network, making it faster.With the runup in the price of bitcoin over the last 4 years, the incentive to mine coins successfully has spawned huge operations using sophisticated hardware who are competing with each other for the increasingly valuable coins. Initially, mining could be accomplished by an individual with a fast personal computer, but migrated quickly to arrays of graphics cards that could solve the problems faster and then to dedicated mining “rigs” which are commercially available and designed for the singular task of mining bitcoin and other crypto currencies.The electricity to run all of these powerful computers and also the air-conditioning to cool them is the biggest component of the cost structure for miners. As the arms race for the fastest computers continues, mitigating the energy costs associated with mining is the miner’s holy grail.So How Can You Invest in Bitcoin?There are many ways to gain investment exposure to crypto currencies:Buy BitcoinsThere are now numerous online marketplaces that allow you to buy bitcoin (and numerous crypto currencies) fairly easily. You deposit U.S dollars and once the fund transfer is verified, you can buy bitcoin, participate in the price appreciation or depreciation and turn your bitcoin holdings back into dollars whenever you wish.Buy Bitcoin FuturesFutures contracts on Bitcoin are traded on both the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME  -  Free Report) and the CBOE Global Markets (CBOE  -  Free Report). Trading bitcoin futures allows an investor to participate in price appreciation (or depreciation – they can be sold as well) without any risk of interacting with an upstart exchange. Trades on both the CME and CBOE are backed by the assets of extremely well capitalized clearing corporations, so there is no risk of the exchange being hacked and losing crypto currency as has happened in the past – albeit infrequently – with online crypto exchanges.The advent of listed futures contracts also provided traders with the first simple way to short the price of bitcoin, and many have done so. The decline from $19,000 to $7,000 over the past six months is widely attributed to the existence of liquid, shortable bitcoin securities. This is actually healthy for the market since instruments that allow market participants to easily express both long and short sentiment tend to restrain bubble-type price activity.Buy Blockchain CompaniesMany companies now sell equipment and software designed specifically for mining crypto currencies. Recall that only the miners with the fastest and most efficient technology are able to process transactions quickly and efficiently enough to profit from the activity. Miners are constantly in search of processors and peripheral hardware that put them at the front of the line when new coins are minted and issued.From upstart companies producing equipment designed for the sole purpose of mining to more traditional hardware manufacturers like Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) whose existing products are commonly used for mining, a tremendous amount of hardware is being purchased and utilized for blockchain-related activity.Buy the Forward ThinkersIt is commonly believed that the real value in bitcoin is not necessarily the price of the coins themselves (which need to exist to compensate the processors on the network), but in the blockchain itself. Future applications of the distributed ledger technology could be used in any field where data needs to be transmitted electronically and stored securely.Financial transactions, legal documents and medical records are obvious candidates for blockchain processing.Some traditional finance companies including Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Northern Trust (NTRS  -  Free Report) have devoted significant resources to developing systems for blockchain transactions and will be the first to benefit if and when the technology is applied to other areas beyond currencies.Managed ExposureStay tuned to this same space Tuesday for a look at one new ETF that seeks to provide investors a one-stop shop for all of these blockchain investment concepts. I’ll be at the New York Stock Exchange to discuss the product with the founder and manager of the fund and will report back tomorrow.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

766,CME,"The price of bitcoin and most other major cryptocurrencies dropped sharply on Friday after financial regulators in Japan ordered several crypto exchanges to improve their anti-money laundering practices, adding to long-standing fears that government crackdowns could hurt the market.In response to the mandate from Japan’s Financial Services Agency, bitFlyer—the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the country—suspended the creation of new accounts while it improves its practices.“Our management and all employees are united in our understanding of how serious these issues are, as well as how serious we are in responding to them going forward,” bitFlyer said in a statement.Japanese regulators gave the same order to five other exchanges after reportedly noticing weaknesses in how they combatted money laundering.To some, the move might seem like a minor setback that should be expected as users and governments continue to adapt to new technologies. But Friday’s selling stems from a few legitimate concerns about what Japan’s regulatory move could mean in the near- and long-term future.For starters, bitFlyer’s response interrupts the flow of new capital to one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. The Japanese yen accounts for a majority of bitcoin’s daily volume, so it is obvious that any interruption in this market will cause headwinds.Moreover, the regulatory order speaks to a greater concern for crypto enthusiasts—one which threatens the potential long-term impact of digital currencies. Widespread government crackdowns and new laws could very well diminish the overarching point of cryptocurrencies, which—for many users—is to circumvent traditional financial sector barriers.Japan has led the way in terms of regulation so far, although other countries have joined in the effort recently. Just a few weeks back, The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. regulators are investigating potential price manipulation at four major exchanges occurring after CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) launched bitcoin futures.According to CoinMarketCap.com, bitcoin prices have dropped more than 7.7% over the past 24 hours. In that time, Ethereum—the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by way of market cap—has slumped about 9.9%, Ripple has tumbled 6.5%, and Bitcoin Cash has lost more than 11.8%. Litecoin, a popular coin among traders and retail investors, has also dropped about 11.5%.Overall, only two of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have remained in the green in the past day, based on CoinMarketCap’s data. The total capitalization of the global crypto market has shed nearly 9.5%.Shares of crypto-proxy stocks like Riot Blockchain (RIOT  -  Free Report) and the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC  -  Free Report) were also sharply lower on Friday morning.Want more market analysis from this author?

767,CME,"The price of bitcoin and several other major cryptocurrencies has dropped sharply in the past 24 hours after South Korean exchange Coinrail said it was hacked over the weekend. Confirmation of the cyber-attack came through a tweet from Coinrail, which sent bitcoin tumbling to two-month lows shortly thereafter.According to CoinMarketCap.com, the price of bitcoin—the world’s largest cryptocurrency—has fallen more than 6.5% over the last day. Likewise, major coins like Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin have posted substantial losses.Through early morning hours Monday, all but three of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by way of market capitalization tracked by CoinMarketCap were in the red. Shares of crypto-proxy stocks like Riot Blockchain (RIOT  -  Free Report) and the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC  -  Free Report) were also down in morning trading Monday.Coinrail said that its platform was the victim of a “cyber intrusion” on Sunday. The exchange did not quantify the value of the attack, but Yonhap News, a local publication, estimated nearly $33 million worth of virtual coins was compromised.A good chunk of the stolen coin has already been recovered, with Conrail saying that “70% of total coin and token reserves have been confirmed to be safely stored and moved to a cold wallet.”“For the rest, we are looking into it with an investigative agency, related exchanges and coin developers,” the exchange added.According to the Korea Herald, law enforcement agencies have begun an investigation. A police spokesperson reportedly confirmed that investigators are in the process of analyzing Coinrail’s access history.The Coinrail heist is the latest in a growing list of publicized crypto exchange hacks, following a massive $500 million theft on Japan’s Coincheck in January and a pair of attacks that forced South Korea’s Youbit into bankruptcy last year.Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal last week reported that U.S. regulators are investigating potential price manipulation at four major exchanges occurring after CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) launched bitcoin futures. The exchanges in question have been asked to give investigators their trading data related to futures contracts.Security and regulatory concerns have contributed to the months-long slump in the global cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, a bellwether coin for many, has tumbled to about $6,800 after reaching highs of $20,000 earlier this year.Want more market analysis from this author?

769,CME,"Shares of Nasdaq Inc. (NDAQ  -  Free Report) hit a new 52-week high of $91.94 on May 22, banking on solid April volumes as well as strong first-quarter results.  With about 0.9 million shares traded in the last session, the stock closed at $91.51, gaining 0.3%.Solid Q1 ResultsNasdaq's bottom line of $1.24 outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.1% and improved 31% year over year on higher revenues, sturdy volumes, a lower tax incidence and solid market share.Shares of the company have gained 4.2% since it posted strong first-quarter results, outperforming the industry’s decline of 0.06%. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) global exchange company has a decent surprise history, having surpassed consensus estimates for six straight quarters, with an average beat of 4.2%. This trend of consecutive estimate beats underscores the company’s operational excellence.Strong April VolumesNasdaq posted improved volumes for April. While U.S. equity options volume expanded 22.1% year over year to 138 million contracts, European options and futures volumes were 7.7 million contracts in the month, up 30.5% year over year.What Should Help the Stock Keep the Price Momentum Alive?  As a part of its growth strategy, Nasdaq intensified its focus on Market Technology and Information Services businesses, offering biggest growth opportunities. It also  emphasizes core special marketplace platform businesses. Nasdaq intends to lower its capital resources for investment in business, failing to offer considerable growth for the company.Nasdaq’s growth has also been driven by its initiatives to accelerate a non-transaction revenue base including market technology, listing and information revenues. Management estimates medium-term outlook of 8-11% growth.For 2018, Nasdaq projects non-GAAP operating expense in the range of $1.295-$1.335 billion, down from the earlier guided range of $1.375-$1.415 billion. This primarily reflects the closing of the divestitures of the Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses in April. Lower expense will likely aid margin expansion.Nasdaq boasts a healthy balance sheet and a solid cash position along with modest operating cash flow from its diverse business model. This in turn helps the company to engage in effective capital deployment. While Nasdaq has a $627 million share buyback program under its authorization, its five-year dividend growth rate of 38.7% is better than the industry average of 19.5%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 reflects a 20.7% increase on 5.1% higher revenues. The consensus mark for revenues and earnings per share in 2019 translates into a year-over-year improvement of 9.2 % and 3.6%, respectively.Over the last 30 days, the consensus estimate has moved north by 1.4% for 2018 and 0.9% for 2019 as most analysts have raised their estimates.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the finance sector are CME Group (CME  -  Free Report), The Navigators Group, Inc. (NAVG  -  Free Report) and The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report), each carrying Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

770,CME,"Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (CBOE  -  Free Report) reported average daily volume (ADV) of nearly 7 million for May 2018. Though ADV declined 5.3% year over year, shares of the company gained nearly 3.6% in the last couple of trading sessions.Total contracts for the month were 152.9 million, slipping nearly 5.3% year over year. Of this, options contracts declined 4.7% year over year to 147.6 million while futures contracts fell 4.7% to 5.4 million from the year-ago tally. While Options ADV was 6.7 million, Futures’ was 0.2 million.Subsequently, ADV of the U.S. Equities Matched came in at 1.3 million shares last month, down 2.6% year over year whereas the European Equities Matched contracted 2.9% year over year to €10.5 billion. The Global FX Matched improved 45.3% to nearly $40.9 billion.Though the May volumes were down compared with the year-ago level, the company has witnessed a year-to-date ADV increasing year over year. Rise in trading volumes should consistently drive transaction fees (accounting for 70% of total operating revenues in 2017). As a result, the company has kept the revenue growth momentum up for the past several years.We believe the company to retain  this positive trend in the coming quarters, backed by a strong market position, global reach, prudent acquisitions and a robust portfolio of proprietary products.Shares of Cboe Global Markets have lost 17.4% year to date, underperforming the industry’s increase of 10.6%.

773,CME,"Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (ICE  -  Free Report) has agreed to acquire TMC Bonds LLC for $685 million in cash. The transaction, pending regulatory approval, is expected to culminate in the second half of 2017.TMC Bonds, a premier fixed income marketplace, was established in 2000. The trading platform facilitates click-to-trade and request-for-quote in asset classes like Municipals, Corporates, Treasuries, Agencies and Certificates of Deposit.The addition of TMC Bonds will consolidate Intercontinental Exchange’s fixed income market trading. The acquirer will benefit from TMC Bonds’ new and complementary access point to liquidity for customers. Also, the buyout will expand Intercontinental Exchange’s portfolio of diverse solutions in the global fixed income markets across analytics, execution and post-trade.Nonetheless, the acquisition is unlikely to impact results or capital returns in 2018.On the other hand, TMC Bonds will enjoy superior workflow solutions by deploying Intercontinental Exchange’s compelling data and analytics.Carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Intercontinental Exchange as a securities exchange has a solid track of strategic buyouts, including TMX Atrium, National Stock Exchange and VirtuBondPoint among others. Several strategic acquisitions have not only expanded Intercontinental Exchange, but have also resulted in expense synergies. Management is on track to achieve at least $30 million in expense synergies by the end of this year.The most significant of these deals is the acquisition of NYSE in Nov 2013, which cemented Intercontinental Exchange’s position as a premier stock trading platform. The takeover also transformed the company into the second-largest global exchange group, thus allowing over 60% accretion in market capitalization.Per ICE President Benjamin Jackson, “the fixed income markets continue to automate and migrate to electronic trading.” The move to acquire TMC Bonds thus bears a testimony to the diversifying aims of the company to emerge in rapidly growing markets.Shares of Intercontinental Exchange have rallied 17.4% in a year, compared with the industry’s gain of 30%. We expect successful integration of acquisitions, organic growth initiatives, strong operational performance and solid capital position to drive its shares higher.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks from the finance sector are Cardtronics PLC (CATM  -  Free Report), CME Group Inc.

774,CME,"That CME Group Inc. (CME  -  Free Report) stock is favored by investors, is corroborated by its agreeable share price movement. The stock has soared 41.6% in a year, outperforming its industry's increase of 29.5% and the S&P 500 index’s rally of 15.2%. With a market capitalization of $54.5 billion, average volumes of shares traded in the last three months were 1.7 million.  Reasons Behind the RallyThe company delivered a positive earnings surprise in the last four quarters with an average beat of 1.86%.CME Group has been witnessing impressive top-line growth, driven by higher clearing and transaction fees plus access and communication fees. Average daily volume (ADV) expanded at a CAGR of 13% over the last 45 years and increased nearly 30% year over year in the first quarter of 2018 to an all-time high of 22.2 million contracts, backed by higher volumes across all the six product lines.Fundamental growth remains a huge booster for the company’s improving operating leverage.  Growing futures products in the emerging markets, non-transaction related opportunities and OTC offerings will likely continue to contribute modestly to top-line growth in the coming years.

The company’s ROE expanded 80 basis points to 8.5% at first-quarter 2018 end over the level at 2017 end.CME Group’s modest liquidity supports healthy capital deployment via dividend payouts, thereby adding to the company’s financial flexibility as well as investor confidence. The company disburses five dividends per year with the fifth being variable, s based on excess cash flow in that year.Lower tax rate on the back of an overhaul in tax policy, which slashed the rate to 21% from 35%, will lend an additional boost to the bottom line.CME Group continuously banks on strategic initiatives to accelerate growth. Shutting down its European operations will result in annual savings between $10 million and $12 million, which is likely to impact 2018 in a major way. The same will also free up over $150 million in capital. Also, the company plans to exit credit default swap clearing business by mid-2018 in order to focus on over-the-counter clearing services on interest rate swaps and foreign exchange.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings and revenues reflect a year-over-year improvement of 42.4% and 13.5%, respectively.

The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 earnings being raised 1.4% and 0.9% to $4.90 and $5.35, respectively.Nasdaq is a global exchange company, trading and clearing across various asset classes, market data products among others. Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) securities exchange have rallied 17.2% year to date, outperforming the industry’s growth of 5.3%. Let’s focus on the factors that make Nasdaq a stock to hold on to for greater returns.Growth Initiatives: Nasdaq intensified its focus on Market Technology and Information Services businesses, offering biggest growth opportunities. It also lays an emphasis on its core special marketplace platform businesses. Additionally, the company intends to lower its capital resources for investment in business, failing to offer considerable growth for Nasdaq.Nasdaq’s growth has also been driven by its initiatives to accelerate non-transaction revenue base including market technology, listing and information revenues. Management estimates medium-term outlook of 8%-11% growth.Compelling Inorganic Growth Story: Nasdaq has accelerated its growth profile via prudent acquisitions that helped it expand its technology offering, gain a direct access to the Canadian equities market and fortify its Corporate Solutions business. Buyouts continue to enhance the company’s capabilities and have already been accretive to its operational results.Improving Top Line: Driven by both organic and inorganic strategic initiatives, Nasdaq has been witnessing its top line growing over the last several quarters. We hope this trend will continue, given the company’s endeavor to pursue initiatives to ramp up its growth profile.Effective Capital Management: Nasdaq boasts a healthy balance sheet and a solid cash position along with modest operating cash flow from its diverse business model. This in turn aided the company to raise dividends at a four-year CAGR of 35.6%. The company has a $627-million share buyback authorization. Its dividend yield betters the industry average, making the stock an attractive pick for yield-seeking investors.Growth Projections: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings per share is pegged at $4.90, representing a year-over-year increase of 20.7% on 5.1% higher revenues of $2.6 billion.For 2019, the consensus mark for earnings per share is pegged at $5.35 on $2.7 billion revenues, thus depicting a respective 9.2% and 3.6% year-over-year rise.Nasdaq has an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 9.7%.Positive Earnings Surprise History: The company flaunts an encouraging earnings surprise history, having exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing six quarters with an average beat of 4.2%. This trend of consecutive estimate beats underscores the company’s operational excellence.Underpriced: The shares are trading lower than the industry average.

779,CME,"The first quarter of the year was a real roller coaster ride in the U.S. equity markets.  A big run-up in January was followed by an even bigger slide in February.  After peaking at 2782 on January, the S&P 500 index plunged to 2581 on February 8th.  Unfortunately, the nauseating ride wasn’t over and we saw several more large daily moves throughout February and March that helped move the CBOE volatility index (VIX - the market’s “fear gauge”) to a peak of 37 – a multi-year high.Things have settled down considerably recently, with the S&P 500 basically unchanged on the year and the VIX back in the mid-teens – close to its historical average.Clearly a lot of money changes hands during the tumultuous first quarter of 2018, and big banks Q1 results show it.  Both Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) beat Zacks Consensus Sales Estimates, aided by improved trading and brokerage revenue.But what other companies might be the beneficiaries of the wild ride of the past few months?Let’s take a look at an exchange that facilitates the trades that occur during volatile periods.Chicago Trading PowerhouseSince its inception as the Chicago Butter and Egg Board in 1898, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME  -  Free Report) has been a constant innovator in the creation and trading of futures and options products. After a merger with its crosstown rival the Chicago Board of Trade in 2007 and the acquisition of the New York mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the New York Commodities Exchange (COMEX) in 2008, the CME has emerged as the world’s leading marketplace for derivatives on agricultural commodities, equity indexes, interest rates, currencies, oil and precious metals.The CME makes approximately 86% of its revenues from transaction and clearing fees on trades - with the balance coming from access/communication fees and selling market data.During periods of market volatility, market participants of all stripes turn to the CME’s deep and liquid markets to hedge risk and/or speculate on future price movements.  Originally an open outcry exchange where traders and brokers transacted business in person on a trading floor, the CME now does upwards of 90% of its volume on its Globex electronic platform. “The Merc” as it’s known to Chicago locals consistently outpaces similar exchanges CBOE Global Markets (CBOE  -  Free Report) and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE  -  Free Report).The first Quarter of 2018 was no exception.  Growing Volumes Equal Growing RevenuesThanks to huge interest in Interest Rate and Equity futures and options, the CME has increased trading volumes in 2018 by 28% over the same period in 2017.  Because its cost structure is relatively fixed, a big portion of additional trading volumes goes straight to the bottom line.Here are the 2018 YTD volume figures from the CME website:                                                                                                   Zacks consensus Estimates for CME’s revenue from transaction and clearing fees in Q1 is $865M, an increase of 9% from the $792M they reported in Q1 of 2017.                                                                                             A quick look at the volume data shows that 1.35 Billion contracts have traded at the CME so far this year, almost 28% higher than the same period in 2017.  Analysts are taking notice with 4 upgrades in the past 30 days, bringing the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate for 2018 to $6.86/share from $6.22/share 90 days ago and 44% higher than the $4.77/share reported in 2017.                                                                                                       Rising earnings estimates are a bullish indicator for a stock’s price and thanks to these upgrades, CME earns a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

780,CME,"MarketAxess Holdings Inc.’s (MKTX  -  Free Report) revenues have been consistently growing since 2005 (except 2008 when revenues declined just 0.6%). Revenues have witnessed a CAGR of 13% from 2012-2017. This top-line growth was primarily driven by persistent increase in commission (which forms the lion’s share of total revenues) received on trading volumes. The same was up 11.4% in the first quarter of 2018. The company has been successful in increasing its trading volumes by way of inorganic and organic strategies.Its efforts of pursuing international opportunities, a compelling economic market model and a diversified product suite of the coveted U.S. high-grade floating rate and other credit bonds to broaden the scope of volumes growth for MarketAxess, going forward, will further drive commission revenues. The company is also witnessing an uptick in post-trade and services revenues mainly due to MiFID II implementation fees.MarketAxess supplements its organic growth by entering into strategic alliances, or by acquiring businesses or technologies, which enable it to enter new markets, provide new products or services. Some of the notable deals to this end included the acquisition of Xtrakter Limited which provided the company with an expanded set of technology solutions; a strategic alliance with BlackRock, Inc. which improved the range of trading connections available to global credit market participants; agreement with S&P Dow Jones Indices to jointly develop indices that will track the most liquid segments of the U.S. corporate bond market. The company’s inorganic growth which has also aided top-line growth remains impressive.The company has been able to fund its acquisition backed by its strong liquidity position. Notably, it has been generating free cash flow from past several years. Strong liquidity not only mitigates balance-sheet risks, but also paves the way for an accelerated capital deployment in employees, trading platform, new products, geographic expansion and infrastructure.The company remains focused on enhancing shareholders’ value through share buy and dividend hikes. Earlier this year, the company raised dividend by 27%, marking eight consecutive years of dividend hike.While MarketAxess’ growth strategy has led to noticeable increase in the top and bottom line, escalating costs remain a significant headwind. Total expenses increased at 13% on average from 2013-2017, thereby weighing on the company’s margins. In the first quarter of 2018, the same was up 14% year over year. We expect the company’s expenses to rise over the coming quarters given its ongoing investments in several areas including trading platform, new protocols and infrastructure as well as headcount additions. Notably, for 2018, the company anticipates total expenses in the range of $220-$232 million. The midpoint of this range reflects about 15% year-over-year increase in expenses.Year to date, the stock has gained 1.2%, compared with the industry’s growth of 6.9%. Though this performance pales in comparison with the growth of 18.9%, 13.3%, 5.8% for Nasdaq, Inc. (NDAQ  -  Free Report), CME Group Inc. (CME  -  Free Report) and Intercontinental Exchange Inc.

782,CME,"CME Group Inc. (CME  -  Free Report) has agreed to acquire NEX Group plc for £10 per share in a cash-stock deal. The transaction is expected to culminate in the second half of 2019, subject to closing conditions.The buyout could lead the acquirer to emerge as a cross-border trading powerhouse.The Purchase ConsiderationEach shareholder of NEX Group will receive 500 pence in cash and 0.0444 common shares of CME Group.Rationale Behind the TransactionLondon-based NEX Group, formerly known as ICAP plc, focuses on electronic markets and post trade business. Adding NEX Group to CME Group’s portfolio will likely ensure recurring, subscription-based revenues for the company’s transaction-based revenue model.While NEX Group boasts premier OTC (over the counter) post-trade products and services, CME Group aces in derivatives clearing services. The acquisition is a perfect strategic fit for the company.CME Group will leverage NEX Group’s leading electronic FX and fixed income cash execution platforms to improve trading technology and streamline access. The buyout expands the acquirer's forex business besides widening geographies. CME Group can have trading opportunities across spot and futures FX products as well as cash, repo and futures products in U.S. Treasuries.Both companies can leverage strengths to serve clients better. CME Group chairman and CEO Terry Duffy stated that ""At a time when market participants are seeking ways to lower trading costs and manage risk more effectively, this acquisition will allow us to create significant value and efficiencies for our clients globally"".CME Group estimates $200 million in run-rate cost synergies annually by the end of 2021 from this buyout.Post acquisition, NEX Group CEO Michael Spencer will join the CME Group board of directors.Growth InitiativesCME Group continuously focuses on strategic initiatives that will accelerate its growth.The company shuttered its London-based derivatives exchange and clearing house, CME Europe and CME Clearing Europe, citing customers’ preference to trade more via CME Group’s U.S. platform. Terminating operations might lead to annual savings ranging between $10 million and $12 million, which in turn will likely impact the current year in a huge way. The same move is also expected to free up over $150 million in capital.CME Group is concentrating more on over-the-counter clearing services on interest rate swaps and foreign exchange and therefore has plans to exit the credit default swap clearing business by mid-2018.Shares of CME Group have gained 9.2%, outperforming the industry’s 4.6% increase. Efforts to expand and cross-sell through tactical alliances, acquisitions, new product proposals as well as a strong global footprint should further drive growth for the stock in the near term. CME Group carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the finance sector are AllianceBernstein Holding L.P.

But this morning’s 209K is the lowest read we’ve seen since 1969, the year Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon. This marks a precipitous drop of 24K claims from the slightly revised 233K the previous week.Continuing claims also recede to historic lows, last week reaching 1.837 million from the previous read of 1.866 million, also a very low number. In fact, we haven’t seen continuing claims get anywhere near 2 million for a week since last summer’s dual hurricanes hit the mainland.

However, strip out Transportation costs and that March number plummets to 0%, with non-defense, ex-aircraft actually going negative to -0.1%. Core Capital Equipment Orders sank from a healthy 1.4% in February to 0.9% in March, with the shipments vs. orders ratio at -0.7%.

787,CME,"CME Group Inc. (CME  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on Apr 26 before the market opens. Notably, the company delivered a positive surprise in all the last four quarters.Let’s see, what is in store for the company this yet-to-be reported quarter.Factors to be Considered This QuarterCME Group is likely to report top-line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, fueled by higher clearing and transaction fees plus access and communication fees. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for clearing and transaction fees is pegged at $865 million and for access and communication fees stands at $26.03 million, highlighting an increase of 9.2% and 7.1%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, revenues in the first quarter are anticipated to have gained from expansion of futures products in the emerging markets, non-transaction related opportunities, OTC (over the counter) offerings as well as options business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $1.1 billion, translating into a 20.8% rise on a year-over-year basis.Also, the company’s efforts to accelerate organic market data growth might have contributed to its top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for market data and information services is pegged at $101 million, indicating a 4.1% increase from the year-ago quarter.For the first quarter of 2018, average daily volumes (ADV) were 19.2 million contracts, having improved 12.1% year over year as the company witnessed higher volumes across all its product lines.Additionally, the tax cut, which reduced the tax rate to 21% from 35%, will aid the companies’ bottom line, thereby boosting margins directly.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.85 per share, reflecting a rise of 51.6% on a year-over-year basis.However, the company is likely to witness a rise in expenses in the yet-to-be-reported quarter, mainly due to its investments in several strategic initiatives. Management projects adjusted total operating expenses guidance excluding licensing fees to range between $1.10 billion and $1.11 billion in 2018.CME Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  CME Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | CME Group Inc. Quote What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively show that CME Group is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: CME Group has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $1.85. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CME Group carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the finance sector with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around are as follows:Kemper Corporation (KMPR  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter earnings on Apr 30. The stock has an Earnings ESP of +23.79% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

(AFG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.40% and a Zacks Rank of 2. The company is slated to release first-quarter earnings on May 2.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

788,CME,"Per media reports, CME Group Inc. (CME  -  Free Report) is contemplating the acquisition of NEX Group Plc and to that end, the company is in talks with the latter. On a positive note, the buyout could result in the acquirer becoming a cross-border trading powerhouse as sources reported.London-based NEX Group, formerly known as ICAP plc, focuses on electronic markets and post trade business. According to sources, NEX Group with a market value of $3.5 billion facilitates trading currencies, Treasuries and other assets. While CME Group leads with about 90% market share in the global futures trading and clearing services. Its options business too gained traction. The combination if materializes, will likely intensify competition.Patrick Young, an adviser to exchanges, foresees “a huge potential risk to LSE’s clearing house LCH, if the clearing business went to CME”.CME Group is concentrating more on over-the-counter clearing services on interest rate swaps and foreign exchange and therefore has plans to exit the credit default swap clearing business by mid-2018.     Notably, in 2017, CME Group shuttered its London-based derivatives exchange and clearing house, CME Europe and CME Clearing Europe, citing customers’ preference to trade more via CME Group’s U.S. platform. Terminating operations might result in annual savings to range between $10 million and $12 million, which in turn will likely impact 2018 in a huge way. The same is also expected to free up over $150 million in capital.Nonetheless, CME Group will continue to have its considerable operational base in London as the region is integral to the company’s global growth strategy. It is probably this reason that propels the futures giant to mull over investing in London-based NEX Group.CME Group consistently weighs on growth-accelerating strategic initiatives. The company also makes a note of structural shifts in both the crude and natural gas markets as the United States is steadily emerging as the swing producer in these markets. Hence, the company anticipates to capitalize on and benefit from these changes. Also, to cater to the growing demand for evolving cryptocurrency markets, CME Group launched bitcoin futures on Dec 18, 2017.Shares of CME Group have surged 38.4% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s rally of 29.8%. Efforts to expand and cross-sell through strategic alliances, acquisitions, new product initiatives as well as a strong global presence should drive growth in the near term. CME Group carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the finance sector are TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (AMTD  -  Free Report), Federated National Holding Company (FNHC  -  Free Report) and HFF, Inc. (HF  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.     TD Ameritrade Holding provides securities brokerage and related technology-based financial services to retail investors, traders and independent registered investment advisors (RIAs) in the United States. The company came up with an average four-quarter positive surprise of 17.07%.   Federated National engages in insurance underwriting, distribution and claims processing in the United States.

796,CME,"CME Group Inc. (CME  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Feb 1 before the market opens. Notably, the company delivered a positive surprise in all the last four quarters.Let’s see, what is in store for the company this yet-to-be reported quarter.CME Group’s results in the fourth quarter are expected to have benefited from expansion of futures products in the emerging markets, non-transaction related opportunities, OTC offerings and options business. The company launched Bitcoin futures last month.The top line has likely improved on higher clearing and transaction fees as well as access and communication fees. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for clearing and transaction fees is pegged at $755 million while the same for access and communication fees stands at $25.95 million. Also, the company’s initiative to accelerate organic market data growth will drive its top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for market data and information services is pegged at $96 million.For the fourth quarter of 2017, average daily volumes (ADV) were 15.9 million contracts, having declined 2% year over year as three product lines witnessed lower volumes. Interest Rates, Equity Indexes and Energy volumes decreased 4%, 8% and 4%, respectively. However, a respective improvement of 7% in Foreign exchange and Agricultural Commodities volume, plus a 26% rally in Metals volume limited this downside.However, license fees are estimated to have increased on the back of transfer of the Russell products in July 2017 and aggregate changes in licenses. Management estimates the metric to have grown 10-15% year over year in the second half of last year.Management projects adjusted total operating expenses guidance excluding licensing fees to be $1.08 billion in 2017, flat with the 2016-level.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at $1.10 per share on $883.6 million revenues, reflecting a 3.51% decline in the bottom line and a 3.21% top-line decrease, both on a year-over-year basis.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively show that CME Group is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have the right combination of the two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for an earnings beat. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: CME Group has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.CME Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise CME Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | CME Group Inc.

However, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome investment managers worth considering from the finance sector with the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around are as follows:American Financial Group, Inc. (AFG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.21% and a Zacks Rank of 2. The company is slated to report fourth-quarter earnings on Jan 31.Apollo Global Management, LLC (APO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.08% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player. The company is scheduled to announce fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 1.American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (AEL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.99% and is a #2 Ranked player. The company will release fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 7.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more. Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk. Bitcoin sank 25% or more 3 times in 2017.Zacks has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly.See 4 crypto-related stocks now >>

797,CME,"The year 2017 was swamped with a series of events, ranging from rising interest rates to a historical tax reform. Also, rapidly-changing climatic conditions made a substantial impact across the finance sector. But this New Year 2018 buoys fresh hopes, instilling confidence among investors.The Republican tax plan, passed into law on Dec 22, 2017, marked a huge overhaul of the tax system, slashing the corporate tax rate to 21% from the pre-existent 35% effective January 2018. A lower tax rate would aid the companies’ bottom line as well as boost margins. The tax cut is anticipated to make the finance sector more globally competitive.Also, the economic growth is gaining traction. Optimistic employment outlook and improving GDP bear testimony for the same.The Securities and Exchanges industry is of late, characterized by improving trading volumes. This in turn will help improve the clearing and transaction fees. The players in the industry have been witnessing expansion in their average daily volumes.The Securities and Exchanges industry is mainly dependent on its product and service portfolios to churn out revenues. The major services include trade execution, clearing, settlement services for securities and commodity contracts, listing services as well as trading and clearing systems services. With introduction of new products, which not only cater to the derivatives industry’s demand but also complement the core product lines, the market position and global reach of the key players are anticipated to become stronger.Interestingly, the Securities and Exchanges industry has been riding on the wave of bitcoin futures that have created a ripple across the finance sector. With the growing popularity of these bitcoin futures, the individual exchanges are launching the same, as more and more investors are expressing their interest in buying the cryptocurrency. On Dec 18, 2017, CME Group Inc. (CME  -  Free Report) self-certified the initial listing of its Bitcoin futures contract. Although bitcoin has massive growth prospects, investors also need to be careful about investing in the same.With the global economy raising enough optimism, the Securities and Exchanges industry is sure to benefit from the abovementioned positives. Moreover, a thriving economy is likely to provide enough opportunities to this industry to focus on building a strategic economic market model through technological advances and upgrade of diverse service as well as product offerings. This, in turn, will help the industry stay ahead and maintain a competitive streak amid the volatile industry dynamics.The Securities and Exchanges industry is ranked at #6 (in the top 2% of the Zacks Industry Rank for 265+ industries), outperforming the S&P 500 index in a year with a surge of 33.3%. While the elite index has climbed 23.0%.Here we focus on two major players from the Securities and Exchanges industry: Nasdaq, Inc. (NDAQ  -  Free Report) provides trading, clearing, exchange technology, regulatory, securities listing, information and public company services worldwide while Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (CBOE  -  Free Report) operates as an options exchange in the United States.

Here, Cboe Global Markets emerges as a clear winner.VGM ScoreCboe Global Markets carries an unimpressive VGM Score of F, whereas Nasdaq has a VGM Score of D.

The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth of 19.70%.This round goes to Cboe Global Markets.Earnings Surprise HistoryPer the companies’ surprise history, Cboe Global Markets surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 5.50%. Nasdaq also delivered positive surprises in the trailing four quarters with a four-quarter average beat of 4.00%.Nasdaq has an Earnings ESP of 0.08%, whereas Cboe Global Markets has 0.57%. Therefore, per our proven model, both these players are anticipated to beat on earnings based on a bullish rank as well as positive ESP.Here, Cboe Global Markets once more edges past Nasdaq.To ConcludeCboe Global Markets is a better pick than Nasdaq on the back of a bullish Zacks Rank, favorable price performance, strong leverage and return on equity ratios, a robust dividend yield, upward earnings estimate revisions and growth projections plus a solid earnings surprise history.

The digital currency was the hottest trade of 2017, having climbed more than 1300% and witnessed wild swings (read: 10 Hottest ETF Themes for 2018).The strong trend is expected to continue this year as bitcoin is now easily available to individuals and businesses with the launch of futures contracts on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE  -  Free Report) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME  -  Free Report) last month. Additionally, rising institutional investor interest and strong demand from Japan added to the frenzy.While there are some strong critics and fears of bubbles bursting in the digital currency, blockchain technology possesses extraordinary potential to grow in the years to come. This is especially true given the increased adoption of the technology by the largest banking institutions in Asia and the Middle East particularly in payments, as well as cybersecurity firms due to the rise of ransomware attacks.Investing in blockchain technology will likely generate returns as big as today's FAANG stocks. According to a report from Research and Markets, the global blockchain market is expected to witness a CAGR of 61.5% from $210.2 million in 2016 to $2,312.5 million by 2021. Per Gartner, Blockchain is estimated to have delivered $4 billion in business value-add or technology innovation in 2017, and are expected to reach $21 billion by 2020, $176 billion in 2025, and $3.1 trillion by 2030.ETF Competition & Bottom LineThough there aren’t any real competitors to these new products, ETFs offering exposure to the blockchain ecosystem via semiconductor companies that make chips required for bitcoin mining, might pose a threat. The most popular funds include iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) and VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report). Both are soaring on the blockchain craze and have AUM of $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively (read: 5 ETF Ways to Tap Hot Semiconductor Stocks).The new funds offer investors a pure play to the blockchain technology that backs cryptocurrencies and has the potential to change the world. The ETFs will no doubt get a first-mover advantage that could help in garnering immense investor interest.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

What’s the psychology behind wanting to get in? What makes people jump in even when they know there is danger there?And how can investors in cryptocurrencies avoid getting burned? Or can they?A History of ManiasCharles Kindleberger, a PHD economic historian who passed away in 2003 at age 92, wrote what Tracey believes to be “the guide” to manias in the 1970s called Manias, Panics and Crashes, a history of financial crises.Tracey has the 4th edition, which was published in 2000, fittingly, as the dot-com bubble was about to burst.In it, Kindleberger looks at the stages and conditions of manias. Not surprisingly, over the ages, each of the manias have had similar features including speculation and increased liquidity due to monetary expansion.In many cases, there is even governmental or regulatory warning.Remember Chairman Greenspan’s infamous “warning” in 1996 about the “irrational exuberance” in the stock market?Will You Be “Newtoned”?Perhaps one of the most famous victims of a mania was Sir Isaac Newton who invested in shares of the South Sea Company in 1720. As Kindleberger recounts, his first investment did splendidly well. He saw a 100% gain of seven thousand pounds.But as the mania picked up steam, and he was now on the sidelines, it sucked him back in. He reentered the market at the top the second time and ended up losing twenty thousand pounds.He said in the spring of that year, “I can calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.”There are plenty of early Bitcoin investors who have cashed out. But will they jump back in, lured, like Newton, by the momentum of the market?Manias Overshadow Other AssetsOne hallmark of many manias is that other asset classes usually do quite well during the same time period.For instance, during the Tulip Mania in the 1600s, housing prices rose sharply, investors were jumping into plays on the canals, and shares in the Dutch East India Company doubled.And now there are the cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Litecoin, soaring at the same time that the major stock indexes are hitting new all-time highs.But in the public’s mind, stocks are being left in the dust by Bitcoin mania.Yet, many stocks have had extraordinary years as well. Mega-cap Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) is up nearly 90% year-to-date while a company like Exact Sciences (EXAS  -  Free Report), which isn’t even being talked about by the financial press, is up 280% for the year.Infrastructure Build-OutGiven that the cryptocurrencies are a new phenomenon, the back-end, including the infrastructure, is still being built out.As many of us at Zacks have talked about in prior podcasts, investors can play the bitcoin mania by buying into the infrastructure including the CBOE Global Markets (CBOE  -  Free Report) and CME Group (CME  -  Free Report), where the futures will be traded, and even with companies like Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report).Kevin’s Advice for New Bitcoin TradersKevin has been trading some of the cryptocurrencies but trading, in general, isn’t for everyone.What advice does Kevin have for those on the outside looking in?And how does history look on those rushing in for a piece of the pie?Find out on this week’s podcast.[In full disclosure, the author of this article owns TCEHY in her personal portfolio. Kevin Cook also owns NVDA.]Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.See the pot trades we're targeting>>

806,CME,"Investors in CME Group Inc. (CME  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Dec 15, 2017 $80.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for CME Group shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, CME Group is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Securities and Exchanges industry that ranks in the Bottom 24% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.17 per share to $1.14 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about CME Group right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of behavioral economics.And next to the historic stock market rally we are in the midst of, driven by exponential technology innovation, there is no greater economic story of behavior right now than Bitcoin.Last night, the ""OG"" of cryptocurrencies made new highs above $12,000 and has been as high as $12,947 on GDAX, one of the popular trading exchanges.Well, it looks like I need to update this already since I wrote it a few hours ago: just after 2pm ET, Bitcoin grabbed another $1,000 milestone above $13K.The market cap of Bitcoin is now over $200 billion dollars and the average daily transaction volume has been over $6 billion dollars the past 3 days including Sunday. Today, Wednesday December 6, will probably set a new volume high record, or at least come in second vs the all-time high volume of over $11.5 billion dollars on Nov 29.Even this past Saturday traded over $5 billion. Which brings up an interesting dynamic of this new market for an entirely new asset class: Saturday trading in a truly 24/7 market! Something I've never seen in my career as a trader and investor.And this month, two established trading institutions here in Chicago -- CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) and CBOE Holdings (CBOE  -  Free Report), which was formerly known as the Chicago Board Options Exchange before going public -- will be launching their own versions of Bitcoin futures as they respond to market demand from sophisticated, professional trading and investment institutions.As I surf the message boards on Twitter and StockTwits, I see there is a lot of confusion and even fear about what Bitcoin futures will do to Bitcoin.Since I traded futures for many years -- over 2 million currency contracts in my career as an FX market maker -- I have some insights that might help. A Dozen Insights to Get You StartedNow let's jump right into my first 6 things you should know and begin to think about before you trade any Bitcoin or cryptocurrency product. Then we'll go deeper into the dynamics and mechanics of the futures contracts being offered by the two exchanges.Note that I cover all of these in more detail in the podcast, but here's the basic list with a few notes for each... Lesson #1: Bubble in Progress!The ""monetary revolution"" that is Bitcoin has created a zeal for investing in it that can only be compared to the most manic gold rush of the 19th century. Plus, the ease of access on new private trading platforms and the ""gurus galore"" who talk about Bitcoin $50,000 or even $100,000 help fuel the speculation. (See last week's episode Bitcoin or CRISPR: Which is the Bigger Disruptor? where I describe some of those gurus.) Lesson #2: No Charts Allowed!In this mania, technical analysis is not very useful. We have a new asset class + rabid speculation + explosive momentum, volatility, and wild randomness. And all that equals charts out the window. Lesson #3: Futures Are Great!This is one of the topics I'm going to expand on in the second half of today's podcast. I will explain exactly how futures contracts work and why this innovation will be great for Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency space as they offer risk management, leverage, and centralized price discovery to large institutions who need to hedge or trade their exposure to Bitcoin.And I'll dispel many of the worries that people have about the ultimate ""decentralized"" and unregulated digital currency being placed on a centralized, regulated trading venue. Lesson #4: Futures Are a Double-Edged Sword!This is the other topic I will expand on in more detail because if you've never traded futures before, a Bitcoin futures contract is probably not the best one to start with.Of all the great things that Bitcoin futures will bring to this new asset class in terms of market structure, liquidity, risk management, price discovery and stability, it will also be a uniquely volatile product -- as you already know if you've been watching Bitcoin trade for the past month, or even just today!Since futures use leverage and offer a more efficient use of capital, they are ideal for large hedgers (those with real economic risk exposure) and professional trading houses who can withstand the swings.But for the small trader or investor, who might buy Bitcoin at $12K or $13K and still hold it if it goes back to $11K, this may not be possible with futures because of the contract size and leverage. We'll discuss those specific mechanics coming up.By the way, as I type this at 6pm ET, Bitcoin has grabbed another milestone above $14,000! Lesson #5: Coinbase is a Friendly IntroductionI opened a Coinbase account because I trusted their Silicon Valley-backed pedigree. While other exchanges have had problems with getting hacked, I thought maybe these guys had built better security. I consider this exchange a good ""sandlot"" to get your toes sandy.Plus, you can trade very small percentage units like .01 Bitcoin if you wish. You can't do that with the fixed sizes of the coming futures contracts where the CBOE product will be based on 1.0 Bitcoin and the CME version will represent 5.0 Bitcoins.So when you go to an exchange like Coinbase and spend $140 (.01 X $14,000) or even $14 (.001 X $14,000), that little bit of ""skin in the game"" will fuel your interest and due diligence to learn more.As I have found, nothing inspires my due diligence like some real money skin in the game! Lesson #6: Alt-Coins and ICOs Are Risky Business!The cryptocurrency market is a true ""wild west"" of initial coin offerings (ICO), scams, and fancy YouTube ads for products you've never heard of. Two words: be careful. This area of investing requires lots of homework and due diligence. If you don't have several hours a week to put in here, your hard-earned money will probably be better off elsewhere. What Are Futures For?In the podcast, I go over the next 6 lessons about the purpose, dynamics, and mechanics of futures contract markets in detail. Here's the continuing list of topics...Lesson #7: Economic Purpose of Futures MarketsLesson #8: Risk Transfer & Price Discovery at WorkLesson #9: Arbitrage as the Magnetic Force of Honest PricingLesson #10: The Exchange Clearinghouse and FCMs Enforce Financial PerformanceLesson #11: Cash-Settlement Means No Coins to Lose or Get HackedLesson #12: Contract Specs and the Mechanics of Trading with LeverageIn the podcast, I introduce some of the characteristics of the CBOE Holdings and CME Group products, but those links will take you directly to the exchange descriptions where you can learn about their different cash-settlement pricing systems and procedures.For instance, CBOE Holdings is using a daily price auction from the Gemini trading exchange run by the Winklevoss twins whereas CME Group has helped create a real-time price index to track Bitcoin using the data from four exchanges.Also in the podcast, I also offer a ""bonus"" insight from my long career as a trader and a trainer of traders... Lesson #13: The Golden Rule of TradingOne element I don't feel I emphasized enough in the podcast is exactly how Lesson #10 works to protect all traders no matter how small, and thus preserve market integrity.If you think of the Performance Bond required to trade a Bitcoin futures product as similar to a ""security deposit"" conferring the privilege to trade, and the proof you can cover your losses, what the exchange Clearing House does is guarantee all traders' performance on their long or short positions (i.e., you pay your losses or get paid your winnings) by using a ""mark-to-market"" system.That system of continuous accounting throughout the day will make your futures brokerage account fluctuate accordingly. And if your account ever goes below a minimum threshold (called the ""maintenance"" Performance Bond) then your broker or FCM (Futures Commission Merchant) will require you to add funds, or your trades will be liquidated.The FCMs are accountable to the Clearing House and gains/losses are settled every day so that no one ever loses money due to the losses of a counter-party. In this way, the self-regulating futures exchange system of strict accountability has ""teeth"" to enforce fairness and contract performance, no matter whether someone holds a futures contract for 3 minutes or 3 months. Volatility and the Performance BondThe exchanges will determine various initial Performance Bond (PB) requirements for different types of traders like hedgers, individual speculators, and institutional traders/market makers. Hedgers as you might imagine, may receive a lower PB because they actually deal in the underlying asset.But those differences between types of traders are small compared to the real determinant of a privilege to trade Bitcoin -- its volatility. Normally, many futures and commodity markets will have annualized volatility (like the VIX) of 10% to 30%.Bitcoin has daily volatility of 5-10% currently, which translates into annualized volatility of 80% to over 150%!That means the Performance Bond requirement to trade a single contract could be anywhere from 25% (my first estimate last month) to 40%. And the brokers or FCMs get to decide how much higher than the exchange minimum they want on deposit.And since the exchanges don't like to change PBs every week, they will run their volatility calculations to grasp some kind of expected average over the life of the contract, with a bias toward the extreme possible moves -- especially with a monster of volatility like Bitcoin!Finally, here are my guesses for the Performance Bond of the contracts from the two exchanges (the official requirements will likely be released soon and/or are being communicated by the brokers/FCMs).CBOE: 1 Bitcoin per contract should require somewhere between 25% and 40% of the contract value. For a $14,000 contract value, that could be between $3,500 and $5,600.CME: 5 Bitcoins per contract would create a contract value of $70,000 and could require anywhere between $17,500 and $28,000 in initial deposit.It will be very interesting to see how many large trading firms come to the table with their money starting Sunday December 10 with the launch of CBOE Bitcoin futures!My next prediction, and my hope, is that Bitcoin futures trading actually reduces some of the volatility and helps the market mature with more institutions involved.Note on stocks and investment disclosure: In the podcast, I talk about public companies that are and may continue to benefit from Bitcoin's growth as an asset class including NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), and Square (SQ  -  Free Report). I own NVDA shares for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader and Healthcare Innovators services.

808,CME,"Shares of CME Group Inc. (CME  -  Free Report) gained 2.3% in the last trading session after it reported a solid average daily volume (ADV) for 2017. ADV of record of 16.3 million contracts per day improved 4% year over year. Of this, Options volume improved 11% year over year to average 3.5 million contracts per day while electronic options surged 25% year over year and averaged at 2.2 million contracts per day. The company witnessed an increase in ADV in five of six product lines.Metals volume of 0.6 million contracts per day expanded 23% whereas Energy volume of 2.6 million contracts climbed 6%. Interest rate volume of 8.2 million contracts per day rose 6% and Foreign exchange volume improved 7% to about 0.8 million. Agricultural volume of about 1.4 million contracts per day increased 2% year over year. Only Equity index volume of 2.7 million decreased 12%.For the fourth quarter of 2017, ADV were 15.9 million contracts, declining 2% year over year as three product lines witnessed lower volume. Interest Rates, Equity Indexes and Energy volumes decreased 4%, 8% and 4%, respectively. However, an improvement of 7% each in Foreign exchange and Agricultural Commodities volume and a 26% rally in Metals volume limited the downside.Recently, securities exchange MarketAxess Holdings Ltd. (MKTX  -  Free Report) also posted their 2017 volumes. MarketAxess’ trading volume for 2017 was $104.4 billion.Shares of CME Group have outperformed the industry in a year. While the stock has gained 26.9%, the industry has registered 26.7% growth.CME Group’s improving volumes are driven by a solid operating leverage, helping it maintain an enormous market share. The company holds about 90% market share of the global futures trading and clearing services. Expansion of futures products in the emerging markets plus increase in non-transaction related opportunities and OTC offerings should continue to contribute modestly to the top-line growth in years ahead. Efforts to expand and cross-sell through strategic alliances, acquisitions, new product initiatives as well as global presence should also drive growth.CME Group carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other stocks worth considering from the finance sector are Legg Mason, Inc.

810,CME,"Bitcoin — the hottest trade of 2017 — is now easily available to individuals and businesses courtesy of the launch of the first futures contract on Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE  -  Free Report) in the evening of December 10.Bitcoin futures, expiring in January, spiked more than 20% to a record high of $18,000 in just four hours of its debut and triggered a so-called circuit breaker two times. Under CBOE rules, the circuit breaker has been designed to reduce price volatility wherein 10% movement in prices triggers a two-minute trading halt while a 20% move triggers a five-minute halt.On the first full day of trading, bitcoin futures was up 19% at the close of $18,545. The digital currency itself rose more than 14% to $17,261, according to CoinDesk's bitcoin price index (read: Bitcoin on Fire: What Investors Need to Know).This is the first time that investors are getting exposure to the bitcoin market via a large, regulated exchange, leading to increased investment in the booming cryptocurrency with a growing number of retail investors. It provides investors a way to buy and trade in the digital currency, which is otherwise not readily available.A Push to ETFsThis has led to renewed interest to create ETFs tied to the cryptocurrency. This is especially true as two issuers refiled their applications for futures-based bitcoin ETFs with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). REX refiled for two ETFs, namely REX Bitcoin Strategy ETF and REX Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF while VanEck refiled for the VanEck Vectors Bitcoin Strategy ETF. These applications were previously withdrawn by issuers following the rejection by the SEC or lack of regulation of the bitcoin spot market and unavailability of bitcoin futures contracts (read: Bitcoin Skyrockets; Will ETFs Follow Futures?).The CBOE is not the only exchange listing futures contracts. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME  -  Free Report) will begin initial listings of bitcoin futures contracts on Dec 18 while Nasdaq plans to launch bitcoin futures as early as in the second quarter of 2018. CME’s contracts will also be cash-settled and are based on an index from four bitcoin exchanges — Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit and Kraken. The contracts will be available on the CME Globex electronic trading platform, and for submission for clearing via CME ClearPort, effective Dec 17 for a trade date of Dec 18.In the race to bitcoin trading, the Tokyo Financial Exchange is also preparing to launch its own bitcoin derivatives futures products. All these will pave the way for bitcoin ETFs.ETF Industry GrowingThe ETF industry has seen explosive growth in terms of both AUM and launches thanks to unique strategies, creativity, transparency, diversification benefits, enhanced tax competences, low turnover and low cost. According to data from Credit Suisse, inflows for ETPs (including ETNs) topped $424 billion this year through November and have overtaken other investment vehicles like mutual funds, which saw inflows of $91 billion in the same time period.Another report from research firm ETFGI, global ETFs and ETPs assets grew more than a trillion dollars in less than a year to $4.60 trillion by the end of October from $3.396 trillion at the end of 2016. Further, it gathered $600 billion in new assets in the first 11 months of 2017. This is up 53.6% from the net inflows for the whole of 2016 and almost double the inflows of $326 billion seen during the 11 months of last year (read: November ETF Asset Report: U.S. Tops, Treasuries Flop).Given this, the creation of the first bitcoin ETF would be a historic moment for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption and will likely get the first-mover advantage in terms of trading volume.  Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

811,CME," Bitcoin skyrocketed to another new record high above $13,000 today. It is now up more than 1,200% this year while its market cap has risen to over $229 billion.The cryptocurrency has been surging of late thanks mainly to optimism generated by plans for bitcoin futures. Last week, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) granted regulatory approval for listing of bitcoin futures on two of the world’s largest futures exchanges.The CBOE announced it would begin trading bitcoin futures on December 10. The CME would launch bitcoin futures contracts on December 18.Nasdaq has also joined the race and is planning to launch bitcoin futures as early as the second quarter of 2018.Launch of futures would be a major step in the cryptocurrency becoming mainstream, as derivatives will provide much needed liquidity and also legitimacy to it.Many traders and investors have avoided bitcoin due to its extreme volatility. Derivatives will provide them an easy way to bet on the price of cryptocurrency, both up and down, as well as hedge their exposure. Further, many institutional investors are prohibited from investing in bitcoin directly and derivatives would provide them a way to invest in it.Traders love volatility and with stock market volatility so low over the past few months, many of them may embrace bitcoin to make (or lose) money on its wild price swings.Bitcoin price may get further boost as it becomes mainstream. On the other hand, it will also provide an opportunity to skeptics of bitcoin to short it as making negative bets on it are not easily possible as of now.Futures are also expected to pave the way for approval of bitcoin ETFs. ETFs would provide investors a convenient way to get exposure to bitcoin.Earlier this year, the SEC had rejected bitcoin ETF applications including one proposed by Winklevoss twins but they are now reviewing the decision again.There were some filing for ETFs that track bitcoin derivatives.  However, they were withdrawn since the SEC does not review filing for a fund where the underlying instruments are not yet available.Launch of futures would definitely increase the chances of a bitcoin ETF.Four sponsors have recently filed for blockchain technology ETFs. Blockchain is the technology behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Even skeptics of bitcoin believe in the massive potential of this technology.Investors interested in bitcoin should be aware of the risks. Unlike real currencies, cryptocurrencies have no central bank backing. They are illiquid and trading is expensive.Many central banks have warned investors about risks of investing in bitcoin. Some have taken action against cryptocurrency exchanges and initial coin offerings.Further, there have been many instances of hackers stealing bitcoins.To learn more, please watch the short video above.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

812,CME,"More than a month has gone by since the last earnings report for CME Group Inc. (CME  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 4% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.CME Group Q3 Earnings Beat on Higher Trading VolumesCME Group Inc. reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.19, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16. The bottom line also improved 13.3% year over year.Results were primarily driven by higher trading volumes. Options business remained sturdy in the quarter.Including one-time items, the net income was 91 cents per share, down 34.5% year over year.Performance in DetailCME Group’s revenues of $891 million increased 5.8% year over year. This reported figure marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $890 million. Improvement in revenues may be attributable to higher clearing and transaction fees (up 7% year over year), plus access and communication fees (up nearly 8%).Total expenses increased 2.1% year over year to $322.9 million during the reported quarter, attributable to a rise in compensation and benefits, technology support services as well as licensing and other fee agreements.Operating income improved about 8.1% to $567.9 million from the prior-year quarter.Average daily volume (ADV) rose 10% year over year to a record 15.7 million contracts with growth across five of the six product lines. Average rate per contract increased in only one of the six product lines.Financial UpdateAs of Sep 30, 2017, CME Group had $1.7 billion of cash and marketable securities, down 10% from the year-end 2016. As of Sep 30, 2017, long-term debt of $2.2 billion inched up 0.1% from  year-end 2016 figure. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had total assets worth $78.3 billion, up from $69.4 billion at year-end 2016. The company paid dividends worth $224 million in the reported quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision lower for the current quarter. While looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more downward momentum. There have been five moves down in the last two months. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted lower by 5.8% due to these changes.CME Group Inc. Price and Consensus  CME Group Inc. Price and Consensus | CME Group Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresCurrently, CME Group's stock has a subpar Growth Score of D, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with an F. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated also a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the lowest quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate investors will probably be better served looking elsewhere.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of this revision indicates a downward shift. Notably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are expecting an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

813,CME,"With the fervor surrounding the start of the holiday season, cryptocurrencies are scorching hot. This is especially true as the cryptocurrency market hit $303 billion for the first time according to CoinMarketCap, buoyed by an impressive rally in the two largest digital currencies.Bitcoin is now just a few percentages away from reaching the five figure mark of $10,000, jumping to $9,700 at the time of writing while Ethereum spiked to $485, shy of the much-anticipated $500 mark. Notably, bitcoin and Ethereum surged about 27% and 17% from Nov 22.What’s Behind the Surge?The strong rally was sparked by increased investor interest around the Thanksgiving holiday and Black Friday shopping. The leading platform for trading bitcoin and rival Ethereum,  Coinbase, added about 100,000 users from Wednesday to Friday. This has almost tripled the number of accounts to 13.1 million over the past year.A combination of other factors such as soaring demand from institutional investors and the highly anticipated release of bitcoin futures as early as next month added to the strength. The world's largest futures exchange, Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME  -  Free Report), is planning to list bitcoin futures in the second week of December while Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE  -  Free Report) is also seeking to launch it by the end of December.The introduction of bitcoin derivatives will bring a great deal of liquidity and legitimacy to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It would give investors a way to buy and trade in the digital currency market, which is otherwise not readily available. The derivatives would upgrade the bitcoin status to a more-established asset class. A better and mature regulatory environment will be a huge boon to the digital currency, leading to an increased investment in the booming cryptocurrency, with a growing number of retail investors.Further, many market watchers are optimistic about the future of the digital currency. Billionaire investor Mike Novogratz predicts Ethereum to hit $500 by the end of the year, while bitcoin will reach $10,000. According to him, investors are pouring into cryptocurrencies due to lack of trust in financial institutions following the 2008 crash.One of Wall Street's biggest bitcoin bulls, Tom Lee, doubled his price target for the cryptocurrency to $11,500 by mid-2018 from the previous expectation of $600 while Standpoint Research’s Ronnie Moas projects the cryptocurrency to hit $14,000 in 2018.Cryptocurrencies Turning Bigger and BiggerGiven the optimistic outlook, the cryptocurrency market saw exponential growth over the past month with market cap surging from $100 billion in early June to $200 billion in early November and then above $300 billion at present. With this surge, cryptocurrencies have become bigger than the leading financial service provider, Visa (V  -  Free Report), which has a market cap of $230.1 billion. On the other hand, bitcoin is worth more than seven times an ounce of gold, which is traditionally seen as a safe haven in times of turmoil.(We are reissuing this article to correct a mistake.

814,CME,"Bitcoin is steadily gaining popularity, as reflected by its rising user base. Interestingly, the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization of $160.8 billion, per coinmarketcap.com, is nearly double the valuation of Goldman Sachs, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), at a respective $89.2 billion and $88.8 billion.Investors should know that the surge in online retail transactions, especially in the holiday season, is driving bitcoin beyond the $9000 mark. This primarily reflects bitcoin’s growing acceptance in diverse businesses.A Note on BitcoinBitcoin is not a physical coin and no central authority creates the virtual currency. Instead, computers create bitcoin through mining. A special software is being used by the miners for solving critical mathematical problems, and thereby keeps the bitcoin network secure by verifying payments. In exchange, the miners receive a small amount of the digital currency as rewards.Record Customers Open Bitcoin AccountsAround Thanksgiving, the virtual currency market witnessed a record number of accounts for bitcoin traders. From Nov 22 to Nov 24, Coinbase — the United States’ largest bitcoin exchange — added roughly 100,000 new users willing to buy or sell the digital currency.Per Coinbase data and Alistair Milne, the bitcoin exchange currently has as many as 13.1 million users, way higher than the 4.9 million users recorded last November. The digital currency also touched an all-time high of $9,682.10 on Nov 27.It is to be noted that with an increasing number of bitcoin buyers and sellers, we expect more transactions that will need more mining. New businesses associated with mining have emerged and companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) offer digital mining equipment are in high demand. NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Holiday Retail Transaction Drives BitcoinCNBC stated that retail transactions this holiday session supported the cryptocurrency’s year-to-date increase of more than 850%. CME Group Inc.’s (CME  -  Free Report) plan to launch bitcoin futures also supported the rally. CME Group — the operator of the largest options and futures exchange in the world — announced plans to introduce bitcoin futures by the second week of December, media reports claim.Apart from holiday retail-centric growth, many investors prefer bitcoin, given that no more than 21 million of the virtual currency can be mined. The finite resource base of the cryptocurrency could help investors increase their wealth over time.Companies Going the Bitcoin WayMany businesses across countries are opting for bitcoin as a mode of transaction, driving the popularity of the currency. Here we discuss four companies that allow their customers to pay in bitcoin in exchange for goods and services.Headquartered in Bellevue, WA, Expedia, Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) is among the leading online travel players in the world. Per media report, since June 2014, the travel agency has been offering its customers the option to pay in bitcoins for booking hotels.We expect Expedia, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 4.1% in 2017.DISH Network (DISH  -  Free Report), headquartered in Englewood, CO, operates the DISH Network direct broadcast satellite (DBS) subscription television service in the United States. In August 2014, the company received bitcoin payment from customers for the first time.The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 1.3% for the last four quarters. Presently, DISH carries a Zacks Rank #3.Based in Seattle, WA, Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) is the leading roaster and retailer of specialty coffee in the world. The company is accepting payments in bitcoin.We expect this Zacks #3 Ranked company to post year-over-year earnings growth of 12.1% in fiscal 2018.Based in Midvale, UT, Overstock.com, Inc. (OSTK  -  Free Report) is a leading online retail player. Since January 2014, the company has been accepting bitcoin for its wide range of products, including laptops and televisions.Overstock.com carries a Zacks Rank #3.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

815,CME,"JP Morgan has launched a new fund focused on providing exposure to the U.S. equity space. It invests in companies offering high dividends.JPMorgan U.S. Dividend ETF JDIV tracks the JP Morgan US Dividend Index.Fund CharacteristicsThe fund utilizes a rules-based methodology to select stocks based on volatility and yield. It has AUM of $25.2 million and seeks to provide exposure to higher-yielding equities, while minimizing unsystematic risk. It charges 12 basis points as fee per year and has top holdings in Dowdupont Inc DWDP, Hollyfrontier Corp (HFC  -  Free Report) and Digital Realty Trust Inc DLR, with 1.1%, 0.8% and 0.7% exposure, respectively (as of Nov 20, 2017). It bears less concentration risk as all just a little over 7.5% is allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Utilities, Financials and Consumer Goods, with 15.9%, 15.0% and 14.2% exposure, respectively (as of Nov 20, 2017).Market ImpactMoreover, markets anticipate an interest rate hike in the December meeting of the Fed. Per the CME Fed Watch tool, there is a 91.5% chance of a 25 basis point rate hike and 8.5% chance of a 50 basis point rate hike in December. This fund is expected to be significantly impacted because higher interest rates reduce the appeal of dividend-focused funds. However, Janet Yellen has warned that faster rate hikes might cause inflation to go below the Fed’s 2% target. Moreover, newly elected Fed chair, Jerome Powell, is seen as a dovish lead, who will not steer much from the current policy.There is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s tax reform and deregulation plans. This might increase investors’ appeal for safety and in turn make them shift to dividend-focused funds.CompetitionThe fund faces high competition from other funds focused on providing exposure to the same space. Below we discuss a few ETFs that seek to provide exposure to this corner (see all Total Market (U.S.) ETFs here).Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies providing high dividends.It has AUM of $26.1 billion and charges a fee of 8 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposures to Industrials, Health Care and Consumer Services with 33.1%, 13.7% and 13.5% allocation, respectively (as of Oct 31, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) with 4.8%, 4.2% and 3.7% allocation, respectively. The fund has returned 16.8% in a year and 15.6% year to date (as of Nov 21, 2017). It has a dividend yield of 2.0%. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies with a track record of paying dividends for 5 consecutive years.It has AUM of $17.2 billion and charges a fee of 39 basis points a year.

The fund’s top three holdings are Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT  -  Free Report), CME Group Inc Class A CME and MC Donalds Corp (MCD  -  Free Report) with 4.2%, 3.4% and 2.4% allocation, respectively (as of Nov 20, 2017). The fund has returned 11.0% in a year and 8.0% year to date (as of Nov 21, 2017). It has a dividend yield of 3.0%.

From a sector look, the fund has high exposures to Consumer Staples, Industrials and Financials with 15.7%, 14.6% and 14.5% allocation, respectively (as of Nov 20, 2017).

(NNN  -  Free Report) with 2.3%, 2.1% and 2.0% allocation, respectively (as of Nov 20, 2017). The fund has returned 11.2% in a year and 9.3% year to date (as of Nov 21, 2017).

816,CME,"In this shortened trading week of Thanksgiving, much talk and speculation will be on whether or not the Senate can get its tax reform bill passed, and then whether it can be reconciled with the House version that has already won the vote. Because the Senate will not be deciding prior to this Thursday’s holiday, expect to hear plenty of analysis from both pro- and anti-tax cut perspectives, but don’t look for any certainty either way. At least not yet.That said, we’ll still need to fill the columns of our articles, and passage of tax reform — either before calendar 2017 is out or after — stands to help market indexes climb even higher, as windfall corporate tax cuts look to directly help shareholders of publicly traded companies above everyone else, via share buybacks and increases to dividend yields. But deficit hawks continually point to a $1.5 trillion hole being blown through our country’s debt; tax reformers’ essential “trickle down” philosophy that more capital freed up will help companies hire more workers and thereby grow the economy enough to make up for any near-term economic losses are, as always, an article of faith.Expect weaker trading volumes as market participants make plans to visit family and friends this week. But the question will remain once we’ve all returned back to the office: can the stock market get back to its bullish stance without tax reform reconciliation in the U.S. Congress? And if it can, where would that growth come from?Perhaps we’ve seen market trepidation in the past couple weeks because failure of passing tax cuts may result in a market selloff of notable proportion. Also, with 2017 having been such a rampant success for many shareholders, booking profits before the end of the year will continue to provide at least a mild headwind through the end of the year.Bitcoin Ramps Above $8000Meanwhile, the world’s most famous cryptocurrency, bitcoin, is up 650% year to date — +17% last week alone. As its acceptance grows across the globe and with certain key retailers and market exchanges, we now begin to hear the clearing of naysayers’ throats. These include famed derivatives trader Thomas Peterffy, who writes in the Wall Street Journal that a futures exchange focused on the cryptocurrency may lead to a financial crisis down the road.The CME Group (CME  -  Free Report), in particular, is openly discussing a bitcoin platform as early as next month, where trading halts might be implemented to smooth out some of its inherent volatility. Peterffy argues that the lion’s share of bitcoin interest will occur at weaker clearing houses who don’t have much to lose anyway. So the lack of support at some level of bitcoin — which, remember, is up nearly 700% this year alone — might be how unsuspecting investors might be one day left holding the bag.

818,CME,"Welcome back to Mind Over Money. I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of behavioral economics.Last week we dove into the brave new world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. I read some good passages from a prescient 2014 essay by venture capitalist Marc Andreessen who explained and validated many of the amazing accomplishments we've come to see from ""fintech"" and Bitcoin, nearly four years later.In this episode of the podcast, I read a few more important ideas that Andreessen shared back then, including his explanation of Bitcoin as ""a classic network effect, a positive feedback loop"" of at least four constituencies: consumers, merchants, miners, and developers.Andreessen believed that all four players were important but that developers played a special role. Here's what he said...All over Silicon Valley and around the world, many thousands of programmers are using Bitcoin as a building block for a kaleidoscope of new product and service ideas that were not possible before. And at our venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, we are seeing a rapidly increasing number of outstanding entrepreneurs – not a few with highly respected track records in the financial industry – building companies on top of Bitcoin.For this reason alone, new challengers to Bitcoin face a hard uphill battle. If something is to displace Bitcoin now, it will have to have sizable improvements and it will have to happen quickly. Otherwise, this network effect will carry Bitcoin to dominance.What Andreessen got right was the success of Bitcoin. What he may not have seen is that other platforms could evolve with new features.As we discussed last week, while Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan calls Bitcoin ""a fraud,"" he built a new blockchain banking technology called Quorum on the Ethereum cryptocurrency protocol.""Bitcoin Surges Back Above $7200 As Square Tests Crypto Payments""That was the headline this morning from ZeroHedge. Recall in last week's podcast Blockchain 101: If Bitcoin's a Fraud, How is Ethereum Different? we talked about Bitcoin surging to new highs above $7,000 after CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) announced they would be launching a futures contract on Bitcoin.That further validated Bitcoin as a legitimate member of an asset class -- or, more likely, a new asset class of its own as Marc Andreessen would probably suggest.But the day after my podcast, a big decision event for Bitcoin miners and developers transpired, sending share flying first higher, then over $1,500 lower. That potential event, known as a ""hard fork,"" is a radical change to the protocol that makes previously invalid blocks and transactions valid, and as such requires all nodes to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol.This is why I asked my colleague and Bitcoin fanatic Dave Bartosiak to be a guest on my podcast and help me break it all down. He explains the ""hard fork"" and why it didn't happen. He also explains how to avoid losing your hard-earned cryptocurrency with the right kind of crypto ""wallet.""One thing Dave explained is that Bitcoin started surging on Monday from below $6,000 up over $6,500 as word got out that a hedge fund master named Novogratz bought between $15 and $20 million worth over the weekend. More on him coming up.Back to SquareThe ZeroHedge story was actually broke by Forbes on Tuesday night as Laura Shin reported “Some customers of Square's Cash app have gotten a surprise in the past week. The app, which is used for payments between friends and is a competitor to Venmo, has also given them the option to buy or sell Bitcoin.”Not-so-ironically, word started spreading on Twitter, as Jack Dorsey was a founder of both companies. Early Wednesday morning, Bitcoin was in surge mode, up over $700 to $7,300 because the Square experiment added further validity from a leader in ""liberated"" payments processing.Square (SQ  -  Free Report), the peer-to-peer payments provider which just hit a $15 billion market capitalization today above $40 per share, is apparently testing integration of cryptocurrency payments in its cash app.According to CoinTelegraph, Square has issued a rollout to a limited number of customers, using pooled wallets to allow Bitcoin payments without the current high fees.""We’ve found that customers are interested in using the Cash App to buy Bitcoin,” the company said in a statement.“We're exploring how Square can make this experience faster and easier, and have rolled out this feature to a small number of Cash App customers. We believe cryptocurrency can greatly impact the ability of individuals to participate in the global financial system and we're excited to learn more here.”Banks and Hedge Funds Are Getting Ready for Bitcoin AdventuresIn addition to JPMorgan's entrance in October into the Blockchain realm with Quorum, in September there was chatter about Goldman Sachs launching a trading desk to facilitate liquidity and hedging for their institutional clients. They probably knew that CME was researching a Bitcoin futures contract.Well on Monday, Reuters talked to Mike Novogratz, the former macro hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group who now runs Galaxy Investment Partners, a firm that bets on cryptocurrencies and related businesses. He believes that mainstream institutional investors are about six to eight months from adopting bitcoin.In the article Big money is coming to bitcoin, Novogratz is quoted talking about a ""turning-point product"" from a big financial firm that could make buying Bitcoin as easy as picking up the phone. There is also a video interview in that link.“When it’s that easy, the price of bitcoin or ethereum is going to go much higher. And that is a lot closer than people think,” said Novogratz, who spoke at the Reuters Global 2018 Investment Outlook Summit in New York.Novogratz also told Reuters that he bought $15 to $20 million worth of Bitcoin over the weekend in that recent pullback.And on Tuesday, Reuters spoke with Luke Ellis, CEO of hedge fund firm Man Group, with $100 billion AUM. Ellis said the firm will add Bitcoin to its 'investment universe' if CME launches a futures contract as planned. So there is a case of an established trading institution like CME attracting other entrants.But maybe the Square news is what Novogratz was talking about. He did tweet this on Wednesday: ""Big news -- looks like Square is adding a function to buy and sell BTC... the herd is coming #bitcoin.""Note: in the podcast, I mistakenly referred to Novogratz as the CEO of Man Group.CME Group to Provide Regulated Price Discovery… and ArbitrageWhile there has been concern about CME entering the Bitcoin market, I am a firm believer that it's a fantastic move for all participants. I used to work for the exchange and came to understand its economic functions of risk transfer and price discovery quite well across all asset classes.The CME Bitcoin futures will bring a new level of transparency and access to big institutions, small hedgers, and private speculators. And obviously, a new ability to ""go short"" Bitcoin will provide its own brand of fun to those who believe that the cryptocurrency is a bubble waiting to burst.In the podcast, Dave said he's getting the popcorn ready for mid-December when the contract launches. We also discuss the pros and cons of the newest CME initiative. You can learn more about the CME contract here.On the pro side, I really like the fact that exchange officials and quants did their homework for the past year to track and create reliable Bitcoin cash market price information. This is extremely important since the futures contract will be cash-settled in some rule-based relationship to these prices.This brings in a vital market function that links various related cash markets and their derivatives: arbitrage. In short, if a price isn’t “fair” in one location, a bank or large trading institution should be able to buy the cheaper version and sell the pricier one.According to the CME website, ""CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR) and CME CF Bitcoin Real Time Index (BRTI), a standardized reference rate and spot price index with independent oversight are accelerating the professionalization of bitcoin trading and further establishing digital assets as a new asset class.""The BRR and BRTI launched November 14, 2016 and CME notes that ""Several bitcoin exchanges and trading platforms will provide pricing data, including Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit and Kraken.I'm really looking forward to the launch of this futures contract and all the other financial, trading, and payment institutions that will step out before year's end with their own Bitcoin initiatives.This week's past news and research has really opened my eyes and I now have a ""sure thing"" prediction of my own: Bitcoin will reach $20,000 sometime in the next year, well before it ever fails and collapses to zero as the naysayers believe.What's a Teraflop and Why Does the New Xbox Have 6?Dave is also a ""gamer"" and so while I had him on the show, I had to ask about the exciting new launch of the Xbox OneX. I heard that sales in the UK were trouncing the new PS4 Pro and that it is now the fastest console on the planet with 6 teraflops of processing power.A teraflop is the capability to handle one trillion ""floating point operations per second"" (FLOP).Dave explained that the One X also has the capability to be upgraded, thus eliminating hesitation and preventing buyer's remorse over obsolescent consoles.Check out the full podcast for his views on the console wars between Sony and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and the GPU chip wars between Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) -- both of who also make the chips that power cryptocurrency mining.Finally, I asked Dave -- a car fanatic like none I've ever met -- what we should expect from Tesla's big announcement Thursday about their new electric truck. While we can be pretty sure one reveal will be that the truck is autonomous too, Musk usually has more surprises too.And a tweet on Sunday was already prepping the hype...“Tesla Semi Truck unveil to be webcast live on Thursday at 8pm! This will blow your mind clear out of your skull and into an alternate dimension. Just need to find my portal gun.”Be sure to tune into the Mind Over Money podcast to hear my favorite car expert's wild prediction about what Elon could have in store for us.The one burning question I forgot to ask Dave was this: ""Why didn't you tell me to buy Ethereum at $10 earlier this year?""Disclosure: I own shares of NVDA and AMD for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader service.

819,CME,"On this first day of November — following a robust October, which was the best trading month since February — the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private-sector payroll wastes no time shedding light from the month of October from labor market activity. This also means Friday will bring us the non-farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) which together bring us more or less up to date on the health of the domestic jobs market.The latest ADP headline number was well out in front of expectations: 235K new private-sector jobs filled well surpassed the 190K analysts had expected. However, September’s total was revised downward by 25K new jobs to 110K overall. Averaging the two months — which may be useful in helping comb-out anomalies related to the two major hurricanes that struck the continental U.S. shores several weeks ago — we come up with 170K. This is still far stronger than what the economy “needs” to continue strengthening the U.S. labor market.Pointing toward the post-hurricane rebuild, the sector breakdown shows 62K Construction jobs having been created in the month, the top job-creating industry last month, followed by the steadily growing Leisure/Hospitality and Education/Healthcare results of 45K and 39K, respectively. Goods-producing jobs reached 85K while Services maintained its strong advantage at 150K jobs in October.The estimate for Friday’s BLS report is 315K. This is an impressive headline, but also may be susceptible to the same hurricane-related affects, including downward revisions. Somewhere in the high 100Ks is where analysts are looking for that two-month average to wind up.Bitcoin’s Record HighThe CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) announced it will launch a futures trading platform on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency sometime before year’s end. Bitcoin has been hard to ignore in 2017, trading up nearly 500% year to date, and currently trades at an all-time high near 6500. Not too shabby for a product without any federal government backing anywhere in the word, and with plenty of high-powered naysayers like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.Huge Day for Q3 EarningsAfter the closing bell today, we will see earnings results from a metric ton of notable companies in big tech and elsewhere. Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) and the two marquee names, but this afternoon also includes Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), Kraft-Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report), Shake Shack (SHAK  -  Free Report) and dozens of others. Q3 earnings season is again bearing out market strength, even among small-cap stocks, as this interview with Tracey Ryniec and Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian illustrates: Is This a Buying Opportunity in Small-Cap Stocks?Ahead of today’s opening bell, specialty retailer Estee Lauder (EL  -  Free Report) is up 7% on a strong fiscal Q1 2018 quarter which saw earnings rise 42% year over year and revenues up 14%. $1.21 per share topped the 98 cents in the Zacks consensus, and sales of $3,274 million outperformed our estimate of $3,164 million. Estee Lauder also raised its earnings guidance for both Q2 and full-year 2018.Consumer discretionary giant Clorox Group (CLX  -  Free Report) also outperformed its fiscal Q1 2018 expectations during today’s pre-market, posting $1.46 per share for a 5-cent beat on $1.50 billion in quarterly sales, ahead of the $1.48 billion anticipated. However, the company shaved down full-year estimates for both sales and earnings. Shares are up 1% ahead of the opening bell.Specialty tech products firm Garmin (GRMN  -  Free Report) also beat estimates on its top and bottom lines this morning: 75 cents per share topped the 66 cents expected, and revenues of $743 million outpaced the $718 in the Zacks consensus. The company also raised guidance, and we see shares up 4.7% in today’s pre-market.

821,CME,"Despite huge volatility, bitcoin is the hottest trade this year. After wild swings last week, the digital currency hit another record high of above $11,800, representing more than 30% surge from a low of $9,021.85 hit on Nov 30.The cryptocurrency topped the five-figure mark of 10,000 on Nov 28 and climbed another $1,000 in 24 hours. Then it dropped more than $1,000 in just a few hours.Bitcoin Futures Coming UpThe latest surge came as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the listing of bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME  -  Free Report) and Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE  -  Free Report). CME will begin initial listings of bitcoin futures contracts on Dec 18, while CBOE will be the first to begin bitcoin futures trading on Dec 10.The introduction of bitcoin derivatives will bring a great deal of liquidity and legitimacy to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It would give investors a way to buy and trade in the digital currency market, which is otherwise not readily available. The derivatives would upgrade the bitcoin status to a more-established asset class. A better and mature regulatory environment will be a huge boon to the digital currency, leading to increased investment in the booming cryptocurrency, with a growing number of retail investors.Further, Nasdaq plans to launch bitcoin futures as early as in the second quarter of 2018. In the race to bitcoin trading, the Tokyo Financial Exchange is also preparing to launch its own bitcoin derivatives futures product. All these will pave the way for further rally.Venezuela Cryptocurrency On the wayThe digital currency also got a boost from Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro’s announcement of starting the country’s own cryptocurrency called the “petro” to shore up its economy. The currency was backed by commodity reserves, including oil, gold, gas and diamonds.Bullish ViewsMany market watchers are optimistic about the future of the digital currency. Billionaire investor Mike Novogratz predicts bitcoin to hit $40,000 at the end of 2018. According to him, investors are pouring into cryptocurrencies due to lack of trust in financial institutions following the 2008 crash. Standpoint Research’s Ronnie Moas projects the cryptocurrency to hit $14,000 in 2018.A combination of other factors such as soaring demand and rising institutional investor interest are pushing up the cryptocurrency.Bitcoin Turning Bigger and BetterWith the latest surge, the digital currency is just a few percentages away from $12,000 and has become the world’s sixth most valuable circulating currency in the world, within eight years of its launch. Total value of all bitcoins in circulation has reached $190 billion.  The astronomical surge of more than 1000% this year has made bitcoin more valuable than some of the largest companies, namely PespsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Boeing Co.’s (BA  -  Free Report) and Mc Donald (MCD  -  Free Report), with a market cap of $166.1 billion, $161.6 billion and $137.8 billion, respectively. The cryptocurrency is even more valuable than the combined world’s most influential banks Goldman (GS  -  Free Report) and UBS Group (UBS  -  Free Report). Goldman has a market cap of $94.4 billion while UBS has $66.2 billion.If these weren’t enough, the cryptocurrency surpassed the estimated worth of some of the world’s top billionaires like $90 billion for Gates and $83 billion for Warren Buffet. Further, bitcoin is worth more than seven times an ounce of gold, which is traditionally seen as a safe haven amid turmoil.Moreover, bitcoin has been firing all cylinders, as Google searches for bitcoin have surpassed searches for President Donald Trump as well as stocks in the last few weeks. Google searches are indicative of mainstream investor interest in bitcoin.Bitcoin ETFs NextThe bitcoin futures would pave the way for bitcoin ETFs, some of which were already rejected by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), citing lack of regulation of the bitcoin spot market and unavailability of bitcoin futures contracts.Earlier this year, the SEC denied various requests for the first proposed bitcoin ETF — Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust (COIN). The bitcoin ETF, proposed by SolidX Management, was also rejected in March. VanEck filed for an ETF that invests in bitcoin derivatives in mid-August but withdrew its application. REX also filed for two ETFs, namely REX Bitcoin Strategy ETF and REX Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which will also invest in bitcoin-based derivatives.In late September, ProShares filed for two ETFs, ProShares Bitcoin ETF and ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF. These funds also intend to purchase derivative contracts for exposure, rather than actual bitcoins.As such, with the launch of bitcoin futures this month, bitcoin ETFs is not far from entering the market. Many analysts believe that the SEC will approve ETFs that trade bitcoin futures contracts in the near future.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

The transaction will free up $650 million as clearing member capital.CME Group also announced to shut down its London-based derivatives exchange and clearing house, CME Europe and CME Clearing Europe that will result in annual savings between $10 million and $12 million.

824,CME,"Welcome back to Mind Over Money. I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of behavioral economics.Last week, the price of Bitcoin -- that invisible cryptographic currency which exists only in the cyber space of computer networks -- crossed an amazing threshold of $7,000. Given predictions over the past year that it could go to $100,000 and higher, this fact may not seem all that amazing.But a year ago, it was trading under $1,000 and just 4 months ago it was at $2,000.That pace of roughly doubling every quarter is pretty amazing -- and downright scary to those who are afraid of missing out.Speaking of scary, the impetus for the surge from $6000 to $7500 this month was an event that took place on Halloween: the world's largest regulated derivatives exchange, CME Group (CME  -  Free Report), announced that they would be launching a Bitcoin futures contract before year's end.This powerful, bluechip entrant into the wild west markets of Bitcoin instantly gave that market a new legitimacy and a brighter future. Because one thing that Bitcoin markets had constantly dealt with for the past 5 or 6 years was unreliable exchanges getting hacked and people losing their money.Creating a Bitcoin futures contract on a centralized exchange where the CME would act as the intermediary to guarantee transactions and settlement would add new levels of security, transparency, liquidity and price discovery that the scattered network of small, unregulated exchanges could never achieve.Bitcoin… a Fraud?But some observers are still skeptical. While CME Group is simply doing what Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) had been thinking about for a few months when that bluechip bank pondered a trading desk to provide Bitcoin liquidity, hedging and derivatives for their institutional clients -- and what LedgerX is doing with Bitcoin options -- some see it as a trap for the small investor.Not an intentional trap. But one of their own making where, lured by the promises of riches, and never having traded a futures contract before, the small investor will suddenly be allowed to gamble on an asset they probably don't understand.The skeptics look at what's going on as wild speculation, a mania, a bubble in the making. And they don't want to see it take the hard-earned money of hopeful investors with lottery tickets in their eyes.The CEO of a top global bank probably agrees. In September and October, when Bitcoin was bouncing between $3500 and $5000, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) called it ""a fraud.""Speaking at the Delivering Alpha conference presented by CNBC and Institutional Investor on September 12, Dimon said ""It's just not a real thing, eventually it will be closed.""Dimon also said he'd ""fire in a second"" any JPMorgan trader who was trading bitcoin, noting two reasons: ""It's against our rules and they are stupid.""To hear more about where I think Dimon is right and wrong, be sure to listen to the podcast attached to the is article.Quorum: A Blockchain Innovation Jamie Dimon Does Approve OfWhat's interesting about the straight-shooting talk from Dimon on Bitcoin is that also in the month of October his firm launched a Blockchain platform called Quorum, based on the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) architecture of another crypto-currency called Ethereum.I think this added enormous legitimacy for that cryptocurrency and I am trying to get some experts on the show to talk about Quorum.And while you may have never heard of Quorum, nor understand what it is designed to accomplish, know that Dimon and his team had been thinking about it for some time.In a January 2016 article, Ben McLannahan, writing in the Financial Times, described the bank's trial project using Blockchain...The move is among the clearest statements yet of banks’ determination to explore the potential of blockchain, the computer network on which bitcoin sits. Blockchain has caught the imagination of the financial services industry within the past year, with a host of companies vowing to find ways to use it to reshape many of their daily operations, from upgrading old back-office systems to automatic execution of contracts.The technology is essentially a digital public database of events that is continuously maintained and verified in “blocks” of records and shared among various parties. This means payment ledgers can be instantly updated in multiple locations without a single, centralised authority.I should note that Nasdaq began a Blockchain project back in 2015 called Linq and this May, Citigroup joined them as a partner to facilitate settlements.Who Put the Block in the Chain?To get at where the ""block"" in blockchain comes from, this brief description from Investopedia should help...A blockchain is a public ledger of all transactions in a given system that have ever been executed. It is constantly growing as completed blocks are added to it. The blocks are added to the blockchain in linear, chronological order through cryptography, ensuring they remain beyond the power of manipulators. The blockchain thus stands as a tamper-proof record of all transactions on the network, accessible to all participants. The blockchain offers a chance to work at lower costs with greater regulatory compliance, reduced risk, and enhanced efficiency.So what's the difference between Bitcoin (which Jamie Dimon hates) and Ethereum, which he loves?Basically, think of ethereum as a robust programming language and architecture that has multiple, maybe unlimited, use-cases. I made up a simple analogy that may be oversimplifying it, but I when it comes to abstract technology, simple analogies work:Bitcoin is like a an average piece of software with limited applications and Ethereum is like an operating system from Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) or Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), something a developer can build off of.Behold Smart ContractsLet's hear from a self-described Blockchain evangelist, Ameer Rosic from his Huffington Post article of December 2016 Ethereum Vs Bitcoin: What’s The Main Difference?The first thing about Ethereum is that it is not just a digital currency. It is a blockchain-based platform with many aspects. It features smart contracts, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and it uses its currency called ether for peer-to-peer contracts.Ethereum’s smart contracts use blockchain stored applications for contract negotiation and facilitation. The benefit of these contracts is that the blockchain provides a decentralized way to verify and enforce them. The decentralized aspect makes it incredibly difficult for fraud or censorship. Ethereum’s smart contracts aim to provide greater security than traditional contracts and bring down the associated costs.Curious, or Just Bored?Now that I have shared some basic ideas about Blockchain and cryptocurrencies, I have a question for you: Does this technology interest and excite you, or do you find it boring?If you find it boring, stay with me. I didn't want to hype this technology before I gave a basic explanation.Now I will hype it a bit, in my own words... or at least try to give you a vision of what's coming and inspire your imagination a little bit.Blockchain is going to revolutionize finance, law, medicine, and definitely some aspects of your career will be completely transformed.Think of it this way: everything valuable is digitized on some way and it's all instantly available to be transferred to someone else, for virtually nothing, in private transactions, with no middle-man.Think about how this changes money, medical records, and legal contracts. How does no more physical passports or real estate deeds and paper-based mortgages sound?What if voting in an election could be electronic and secure? What if your ideas, inventions, and other creative assets could be stored securely and verified by immutable records? This is what Blockchain does and how it could conceivably work for all kinds of things that we value and can track digitally.Honestly, a few months ago I didn't really imagine or think about any of this. I was too wrapped up AI stuff.But it was my AI quests that helped me stumble upon a group of blockchain-crypto ninjas who run another podcast you must listen to.Just listen to my podcast and I'll tell you all about them!And if that doesn't get you excited, maybe this will: IBM's (IBM  -  Free Report) Blockchain Business Solutions division is trying to help British Columbia track and regulate their marijuana industry ""from seed to sale."" The pot supply chain will surely never be the same.Disclosure: I own AAPL shares for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader service.

825,CME,"Welcome to Episode #106 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.In this episode, Tracey is joined by Dave Bartosiak, the Editor of Zacks Momentum Trader and Surprise Trader portfolios, to discuss one of the hottest topics in investing: blockchain and cryptocurrencies.Blockchain is the technology that allows cryptocurrencies to exist as it tracks transactions relating to digital assets. But it can also track documents which makes it especially attractive to those in the banking, finance and insurance industries.Some believe that the blockchain market could be over $2 billion by 2021.Who’s Providing the Back-End Infrastructure for Blockchain?A way to invest in blockchain growth, is to invest in the companies that are the back-end leaders.Several of the big technology companies have already moved into this area, including Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) with the Azure cloud platform, IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) with IBM Blockchain, its public cloud service, and Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) AWS, who has partnered with the Digital Currency Group.Do You Own Bitcoin?On the cryptocurrency side, investors have mostly been buying some of the cryptocurrencies themselves, especially Bitcoin, which has soared.But, just like the blockchain part of the technology, others are building the infrastructure for this business on the other end.The CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) recently announced it intended to launch bitcoin futures in the fourth quarter of 2017, pending relevant regulatory review. This is an important development because it paves the way for possible Bitcoin ETFs.CME Group estimates that the cryptocurrency market has grown to $172 billion in recent years, with bitcoin about 54% of that total, or $94 billion. The bitcoin spot market has also grown to trade about $1.5 billion in notional value every day.A Prepaid Visa CardAnother way to invest in the cryptocurrency phenomena is through the mainstream payment companies. They’re very aware of the growth in this area and they’re unlikely to remain on the sidelines.Along those lines, it’s not surprising that on Nov 1, Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) announced it had approved a prepaid card backed by the cryptocurrency Monaco for issuance to Singaporean residents.Monaco said that the demand was strong, with over 17,000 cards reserved.This card allows cryptocurrency Monaco to be converted into fiat money. It would then be accepted at Visa’s 44 million merchant locations in its network, which is key to future growth.What else should you know about investing in blockchain and the cryptocurrency growth story?Find out on this week’s podcast.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.See the pot trades we're targeting>>

826,CME,"Bitcoin, the most sought-after digital currency this year, is soon expected to be easily available to individuals and businesses. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME  -  Free Report) plans to introduce bitcoin futures contracts by the end of this year given soaring demand and rising institutional investor interest.The new contract will be cash-settled and based on the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR), which serves as a once-a-day reference rate of the U.S. dollar price of bitcoin. Bitcoin futures will be listed on and subject to the rules of CME (read: Bitcoin Soars to Record High: Fork, Futures and ETFs Explained).The introduction of bitcoin derivatives will bring a great deal of liquidity and legitimacy to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It would give investors a way to buy and trade into the digital currency market, which otherwise is not readily available. The derivatives would upgrade the bitcoin status to more established asset class. A better and mature regulatory environment will be a huge boon to the digital currency, leading to an increased investment in the booming cryptocurrency with a growing number of retail investors.The news sent cryptocurrency to new highs at above $7,600 from around $6,300 at the start of last week. With this, the digital currency is up 650% so far this year and total market capitalization has reached $125 billion (read: ETFs Riding High On Bitcoin Surge).Are Bitcoin ETFs Next?The CME move would pave the way for bitcoin ETFs, some of which were already rejected by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) citing lack of regulation of the bitcoin spot market and unavailability of bitcoin futures contracts.Earlier in the year, the SEC denied various requests for the first proposed bitcoin ETF — Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust (COIN). The bitcoin ETF, proposed by SolidX Management, was also rejected in March. VanEck filed for an ETF, which invests in bitcoin derivatives, in mid-August but withdrew its application. REX also filed for two ETFs, namely REX Bitcoin Strategy ETF and REX Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which will also invest in bitcoin-based derivatives.In late September, ProShares filed for two ETFs, ProShares Bitcoin ETF and ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF. These funds also intend to purchase derivative contracts for exposure, rather than actual purchase of bitcoins (read: Bitcoin ETFs: More Issuers Join the Race).As such, with the launch of bitcoin futures sometime in eight weeks, bitcoin ETFs is not far from entering into market. Many analysts believe that the SEC will approve ETFs that trade bitcoin futures contracts within the near future.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

828,CME,"Wednesday, November 1, 2017On this first day of November — following a robust October, which was the best trading month since February — the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private-sector payroll wastes no time shedding light from the month of October from labor market activity. This also means Friday will bring us the non-farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) which together bring us more or less up to date on the health of the domestic jobs market.The latest ADP headline number was well out in front of expectations: 235K new private-sector jobs filled well surpassed the 190K analysts had expected. However, September’s total was revised downward by 25K new jobs to 110K overall. Averaging the two months — which may be useful in helping comb-out anomalies related to the two major hurricanes that struck the continental U.S. shores several weeks ago — we come up with 170K. This is still far stronger than what the economy “needs” to continue strengthening the U.S. labor market.Pointing toward the post-hurricane rebuild, the sector breakdown shows 62K Construction jobs having been created in the month, the top job-creating industry last month, followed by the steadily growing Leisure/Hospitality and Education/Healthcare results of 45K and 39K, respectively. Goods-producing jobs reached 85K while Services maintained its strong advantage at 150K jobs in October.The estimate for Friday’s BLS report is 315K. This is an impressive headline, but also may be susceptible to the same hurricane-related affects, including downward revisions. Somewhere in the high 100Ks is where analysts are looking for that two-month average to wind up.Bitcoin’s Record HighThe CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) announced it will launch a futures trading platform on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency sometime before year’s end. Bitcoin has been hard to ignore in 2017, trading up nearly 500% year to date, and currently trades at an all-time high near 6500. Not too shabby for a product without any federal government backing anywhere in the word, and with plenty of high-powered naysayers like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.Huge Day for Q3 EarningsAfter the closing bell today, we will see earnings results from a metric ton of notable companies in big tech and elsewhere. Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) and the two marquee names, but this afternoon also includes Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), Kraft-Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report), Shake Shack (SHAK  -  Free Report) and dozens of others. Q3 earnings season is again bearing out market strength, even among small-cap stocks, as this interview with Tracey Ryniec and Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian illustrates: Is This a Buying Opportunity in Small-Cap Stocks?Ahead of today’s opening bell, specialty retailer Estee Lauder (EL  -  Free Report) is up 7% on a strong fiscal Q1 2018 quarter which saw earnings rise 42% year over year and revenues up 14%. $1.21 per share topped the 98 cents in the Zacks consensus, and sales of $3,274 million outperformed our estimate of $3,164 million. Estee Lauder also raised its earnings guidance for both Q2 and full-year 2018.Consumer discretionary giant Clorox Group (CLX  -  Free Report) also outperformed its fiscal Q1 2018 expectations during today’s pre-market, posting $1.46 per share for a 5-cent beat on $1.50 billion in quarterly sales, ahead of the $1.48 billion anticipated. However, the company shaved down full-year estimates for both sales and earnings. Shares are up 1% ahead of the opening bell.Specialty tech products firm Garmin (GRMN  -  Free Report) also beat estimates on its top and bottom lines this morning: 75 cents per share topped the 66 cents expected, and revenues of $743 million outpaced the $718 in the Zacks consensus.

830,CME,"CME Group Inc. (CME  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter earnings on Oct 26 before the market opens. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in the last two quarters. Let’s see what it has in store for this yet-to-be reported quarter.CME Group’s top line has likely improved owing to higher clearing and transaction fees. The company’s efforts to ramp up organic market data growth will add to the top line. The Zacks Consensus estimate for market data and information services are pegged at $96 million.CME Group’s average daily volume (ADV) for the third quarter stood at 15.7 million contracts, up 10% year over year. Five of its six product lines delivered growth in ADV in the third quarter.About 74% of CME Group’s metal options currently trade electronically. Metals’ ADV in the third quarter increased 42%, the highest across its six product lines.However, license fees likely have increased on the back of transfer of the Russell products in July and aggregate changes in licenses.The tax rate likely has increased in the third quarter, given an increase in the Illinois state income tax.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at $1.16 per share on $889.9 million revenues. The bottom line reflects a 10.6% rise, while the top line translates to an increase of 5.7%, both on a year-over-year basis.What our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively show that CME Group is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for an earnings beat. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: CME Group has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

Quote Zacks Rank: CME Group carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the finance sector with the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this quarter are as follows:Prudential Financial (PRU  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter earnings on Nov 1 with an Earnings ESP of +0.07% and a Zacks Rank #2.

831,CME,"American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 18 after market close.Last quarter, this company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.7%. However, earnings declined 30% year over year as the year-ago earnings reflected the $1.1 billion gain, recorded from the sale of Costco Wholesale Corp. brand portfolio.Revenues came in at $8.3 billion, slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.2 billion and up 1% year over year.The company boasts an impressive surprise history, exceeding estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 6.9%. This is depicted in the graph below:American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise | American Express Company QuoteQ3 FlashbackAmerican Express’ earnings results for the third quarter will likely reflect a solid progress graph, driven by the company’s current priorities of accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and resetting the cost base.Earnings will also benefit from efforts to continue to return significant capital reserves to shareholders through dividend and share buyback programs.We expect to see an increase in net card fees, banking on a continued strength in the U.S. Platinum and Delta portfolio as well as growth in Mexico and Japan.The company’s operating expense is expected to decline owing to cost-reduction initiatives undertaken by the company.The tax is likely to have declined due to higher earnings from a lower tax rate in the international market than in the previous year. This upside is also expected to aid the bottom line.Card Member loan and receivable growth should be strong in the third quarter since the company continues to build upon loans from existing customers as well as via the acquisition of new Card Members. Provisions for losses should consequently rise as a result of higher Card Member loans and receivables as well as a slight ascent in delinquencies and higher net write-off rate.On the contrary, we expect improvement in reward expense, reflecting the company’s enhanced U.S. Platinum products, implemented at the beginning of fourth-quarter 2016, besides continued strong growth and its Delta co-brand portfolio.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that American Express is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: American Express has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

835,CME,"Despite a cloud of uncertainty looming over the global market environment due to rapidly changing climatic conditions — storming the industrial space with consecutive catastrophic disasters Hurricanes Harvey and Irma — and the palpable disagreement among the Fed officials over how quickly to raise interest rates, the performance of some pivotal players in the Securities and Exchanges industry has shown a ray of hope.Some major players of Securities and Exchanges industry have been successfully recording robust trading volumes and August was no exception.  We expect to see these key players generating solid trading volumes in the near term as well.Momentum to Continue?The key players in the Securities and Exchanges industry are largely dependent on their product and service portfolios to churn out revenues. The major services include trade execution, clearing, settlement services for securities and commodity contracts, listing services as well as trading and clearing systems services. There are other sources of revenues that might include data products, financial indexes, along with information and public company services.In a highly competitive industry, demand is fueled by investor-confidence, dependent on the overall growth of the industry itself. Interestingly, the individual exchanges’ profitability rests on maximization of transaction and clearing fees while keeping transaction-based expenses low. Such organic growth will help the individual exchanges drive their revenues, which in turn will continue to fuel increasing trading volumes. This makes us hopeful for the future, which has a high possibility to see major players in the industry generating substantially high trading volumes.This apart, the individual exchanges rely heavily on their diverse product offerings to drive their overall growth. With introduction of new products, which not only cater to the demands of the derivatives industry but also complement the core product lines, the key players are expected to strengthen their market position and global reach. To that end, the companies remain committed toward investing in new product extensions and offerings to boost overall growth, thereby creating an opportunity for trading volumes to thrive.The individual exchanges are focused on building a strategic economic market model through technological advances and upgrade of diverse service and product offerings to help them stay ahead and maintain the competitive streak amid the changing industry dynamics.Interestingly, some leading players in the industry have been making substantial efforts to expand product portfolio via prudent acquisitions, which in turn will aid them to retain their market share, expand product lines as well as widen global footprint. For instance, the acquisition of Bats Global Markets by CBOE Holdings on Feb 28, 2017, has enabled the latter to broaden and diversify its product portfolio.Also, on Jul 5, 2017, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE  -  Free Report) has purchased the remaining 20% stake in ICE Endex shares from N.V. Nederlandse Gasunie. The buyout adds capabilities to Intercontinental Exchange’s European gas and power portfolio.We wait to see if new product initiatives and global presence help these major players in the Securities and Exchanges industry to post high trading volumes in the future.The Zacks Securities and Exchanges industry is currently ranked at #105 (which lies in the upper half of the Zacks Industry Rank for 252 plus industries).

840,CME,"MetLife Inc. (MET  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2, after market close.Last quarter, MetLife surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15%. Earnings benefited from volume growth, continued expense discipline and higher fees from improved equity markets.The company, however, does not have an impressive surprise history. Although it beat estimates in three of the last four quarters and missed in one, it witnessed an average negative surprise of 1.55%. This is depicted in the graph below:MetLife, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise MetLife, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | MetLife, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 FlashbackMetLife has a leading position in group benefits with a market share of 25% among the large employers. It is experiencing strong growth in the mid-market segment in this business. The company witnessed continued strong persistency and solid sales across all market segments, as well as in both core and voluntary products in the first quarter. We expect strong performance from this segment in the second quarter too as the company continues to invest in this space to create differentiated customer experiences, supported by strong enabling technology and leading data protection capabilities.The company incurred derivate related losses of $602 million in the first quarter on account of low interest rates and strong equity markets. These macroeconomic factors remained largely unchanged in the second quarter, thus leading to expectations of derivate losses once again.We expect the company’s Property and Casualty (P&C) segment to suffer from the underperforming auto insurance business. The company has been making targeted rate increases in auto insurance over the last past one year and will continue doing so in 2017. These price increases, along with other management actions, will push the combined ratio higher. Overall, P&C sales may also suffer due to price increases and management actions to drive value. Weather-related destruction in the months of April and May might also dent earnings from this segment, in the form of catastrophe loss.  We also expect to see an increase in variable investment income driven by favorable hedge fund performance and strong private equity. The company’s bottom line will be aided by its expense management initiatives.MetLife has been generating enough free cash flow which it uses for investment purposes and buying back shares. Repurchases made by the company in the second quarter will aid its bottom line.Currency fluctuation will likely impart volatility to earnings.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that MetLife is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: MetLife has an Earning ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.28 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Though MetLife carries a Zacks Rank #3, its 0.00% ESP makes our surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Fiserv, Inc.

The first quarter bore the brunt of cat losses and the same is expected in the second quarter. The company has provided preliminary estimates of cat loss of $638 million on a pre-tax basis, owing to weather-related destruction in April and May.In the first quarter, the company closed the acquisition of SquareTrade, a protection plan provider for consumer electronics and connected devices. Allstate previously said that the deal would dilute earnings for three years. Therefore, the effect of the same will be felt in second-quarter results.The company’s customer-focused strategy, and a wide variety of products and services sold through an extensive distribution network, will likely result in higher policies issued thus aiding top-line growth.Allstate took profit improvement initiatives, over the last two years, in its Auto insurance business.

842,CME,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and CME Group Inc. (CME  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because CME Group is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CME in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.21 per share for CME, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CME, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.83% heading into earnings season.CME Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise CME Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | CME Group Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

843,CME,"Affiliated Managers Group Inc. (AMG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 31. Its earnings and revenues are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Assets under management (AUM) witnessed growth. However, marginally lower revenues along with elevated expenses were the headwinds.Affiliated Managers boasts an impressive earning surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.6%.The positive earnings surprises have supported a 23.1% year-to-date rally of the stock versus the 21.9% growth of the industry it belongs to.Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. QuoteWill the rally in stock price continue post Q2 earnings? It depends on the company’s ability to impress the market with an earnings beat and improved financials.According to our proven model, chances of Affiliated Managers beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Affiliated Managers is -0.31%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $3.23 is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.24.Zacks Rank: Affiliated Managers has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a positive ESP is needed to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsAffiliated Managers holds an almost unbeaten track record of buying equity interests in asset management companies with strong performance-oriented products. The past equity investments should continue boosting the company’s top line, driven by the excellent long-term performance of its affiliates.Management expects the ratio of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to average AUM in the range of 12.8–13.1 basis points (bps) for the quarter. Further, other economic items are projected to be around $1 million per quarter.On the cost front, management projects total interest expenses of around $22 million in the second quarter, almost unchanged sequentially. Also, amortization expenses are projected to be $38 million, almost in line on a sequential basis.However, activities of the company in the second quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained stable over the last seven days.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.Boston Properties, Inc.

This was mainly due to higher operating expenses related to the acquisitions closed in 2016. As of Jun 30, 2017, Nasdaq achieved $60 million in annualized run-rate cost synergies. Besides, the company estimated $10-$20 million in additional synergies to be realized post completion of other platform consolidations.Notably, the company tightened the upper end of its 2017 non-GAAP operating expense to the range of $1.26–$1.29 billion from $1.26–$1.30 billion guided earlier.Segment wise, net revenue at Market Services jumped 14.4% from the year-ago quarter to $222 million. The upside was driven by higher revenues from the ISE and higher European cash equities revenues.Revenues at Corporate Services increased 1.2% year over year to $164 million.

852,CME,"American International Group, Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2, after market close.Helped by a reduction in operating costs, AIG surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate last quarter by 22.5%. Results reflected strong operating performance at both its Consumer and Commercial Insurance segments, favorable alternative investment return and lower-than-expected catastrophe losses.The company, however, does not have an impressive surprise history. Although it beat estimates in two of the last four quarters and missed in two, it witnessed an average negative surprise of 4.85%. This is depicted in the graph below:American International Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise American International Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | American International Group, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 FlashbackWe expect performance at its Commercial Lines segment to remain stressed. Net premium written in the segment decreased 25% in 2016 and the decline continued in the first quarter. Given that the company has exited some of its casualty lines business, we expect the top line to remain under pressure over the coming quarters. The effect of the same will be seen in the to-be reported quarter.The company’s Individual Retirement business is weighed down by uncertainty stemming from the Department Of Labor’s fiduciary rule and lower fixed annuity sales due to the prevailing low interest rate environment. This resulted in lower sales in the past several quarters. Though the company has undertaken remedial measures such as making changes to product pricing, product features and asset quality, we don’t expect much improvement in sales in the upcoming release.In its Life Insurance business, recently, the company introduced a new administrative platform and digital capabilities, revamped its product suite, and substantially exited its U.S. life career distribution channel, service agent channel, and subscale group benefits business. These steps were undertaken to enhance ROE from this line of business. The efforts paid off as evident by an increase in life insurance sales in the first quarter as we expect to see further sales growth in the second quarter.Management’s efforts toward saving costs will accrue to its bottom line. In 2016, the company was ahead of its expense reduction target of $1.4 billion and decreased the same by over $1 billion or 10%. In the first quarter, its general operating and other expenses declined 18.6%. We expect to see a moderation in expenses in the to-be reported quarter.The company is also aggressively buying back shares in sync with its capital return target of $25 billion. In the first quarter, the company committed $7 billion of capital for share buyback and dividend for rest of the year. We believe substantial repurchase of shares will aid the company’s bottom line.We also expect to see an improvement in return on equity driven by the company’s continued active capital management and operating improvement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AIG is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: AIG has an Earning ESP of -0.83%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.19 per share is a penny below the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AIG carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Fiserv, Inc. (FISV  -  Free Report) will report second-quarter 2017 earnings results on Aug 1. The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.63% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

853,CME,"We expect securities exchange CME Group Inc (CME  -  Free Report) to beat expectations, when it reports second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the market opens.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Progressive has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.83%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.21 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20 per share. The positive ESP is a leading indicator of a likely earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CME Group carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating on earnings.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?Diverse derivative product lines and global reach likely have induced an improved top line in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.CME Group’s average daily volume (ADV) for its second quarter stood at 16.5 million contracts, up 7% year over year. The company experienced an improvement of 21% year over year in Options volume, which averaged 3.6 million contracts per day. Interest rate volume jumped 19% year over year in the second quarter, with 8.2 million contracts per day.Total Options average revenue per contract (RPC) is expected to be 22.9 cents for the second quarter of 2017. RPC for Futures is expected to be slightly lower than the RPC of Options.Given strategic investments in several areas, the organic market data revenue has likely improved.However, expenses are expected to have increased, owing to several ongoing investments in strategic initiatives and have also possibly weighed on margin expansion.With respect to earnings trend, the company delivered positive surprises in the last four quarters, with an average beat of 2.24%.  The company’s share price has been fluctuating over the last few days and is currently trading at $121.00. We wait to see how the stock performs post the earnings release.CME Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise CME Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | CME Group Inc.

854,CME,"(0:25) - Nothing Changes Economics and Behavior Like New Technology(4:00) - The ""Fear Of Missing Out"" On Bitcoin Pushes it Over $10,000(11:10) - 4 Thinkers Who Influence Bitcoin Mania(18:30) - Genetic Disruption: CRISPR-Cas9(23:00) - CRISPR Creator Becomes Its Cassandra(28:30) - The Brave New World of Gene Editing(32:40) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comWelcome back to Mind Over Money. I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of behavioral economics.Last week we explored the hyper speed of change coming from exponential technologies (ET). Even though I've been talking and writing about these ET for a year now since we started the podcast last November, I feel in many ways that we've barely scratched the surface.If you had asked me a year ago what the biggest disruptor was going to be, I would have said artificial intelligence (AI).But I've spent the last 2 months learning as much as I can about two other fields that weren't even on my radar 2 years ago: bitcoin and gene editing.Now before you think I've turned a podcast about behavioral economics into the exponential technologies podcast, let me assure you we are still talking about both economics and behavior.Because nothing changes both of those like disruptive technology.So my theme today is to take these two disruptive fields and explore just what they could change in the next 5 to 10 years that will make the world almost unrecognizable to your grandparents', or even your parents' generation.We'll start with bitcoin and blockchain, as the price of the so-called ""digital gold"" surged above $10,000 last night. The Edge of TomorrowBut first, a hot-off-the-press AI resource for you. I've spoken much about the historical insight and prophetic warnings of Yuval Noah Harari via his book Homo Deus.Today, Dr. Harari posted a new documentary on his website titled Talking About a Revolution: Life in the Age of Artificial Intelligence. Here's how it's described...What impact will the artificial intelligence revolution have on our society, culture and economy? In this video, produced for the JD Discovery conference, Prof. Yuval Noah Harari considers one of the greatest shifts since life began on Earth: natural selection being replaced by intelligent design as the principle force of evolution.I posted the link on Twitter this morning @KevinBCook and I'm thrilled that I can share it again with you here in the midst of our timely discussions of world-changing technologies. Bitcoin and the Madness of CrowdsNow, let's talk about this crazy mania going on in bitcoin. Why is it surging above $10,000, more than doubling in a few weeks?Hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz would sum it up in just four words: the herd is coming.He's been saying that for at least a few months and what he means is that people, and bankers, are starting to catch on that there is something real and significant about these technologies.We've covered bitcoin and blockchain twice here this month and I speculated it could go to $20,000 next year as more financial institutions adopt different aspects of this new asset class.Headlines about JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) creating a blockchain platform around the ethereum protocol, CME Group (CME  -  Free Report)planning to launch a futures contract on bitcoin, and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) buying three domain names for cryptocurrency-related businesses certainly have thrown some gasoline on the crypto bonfire.But I didn't understand blockchain and bitcoin well enough to invest in it even a month ago. Then I did some more homework and began to dabble. And whenever I do that, my learning curve really ramps up.As I prepared my notes for this podcast, I had in mind a goal to warn anyone considering a bitcoin or other cryptocurrency investment to pay attention to the volatility. This new asset class is inviting all kinds of wild speculation, both in terms of what is theoretically possible and in terms of what price the other guy will pay for it.In the hour before I just walked into to record this on Wednesday November 29, the price of bitcoin plunged from $10,400 to $8,600 between 2pm and 3pm ET. As I type at 5pm, the majordomo crypto is trying to get a solid foothold back above $10K. What’s FOMO Got to Do With It?That's what can happen when lots of new money rushes in and old holders take their profits. You can imagine the newly-minted and overly-exuberant crypto investors who scrambled to buy on the move above $10K, believing that it could only go higher, only to sell in a panic below $9K.This is the euphoric crowd behavior that goes beyond greed to feeling as if you are part of a revolution.In the stock market we call that FOMO, for the ""fear of missing out.""Recall in last week's podcast Don't Fight the Gravity of Exponential Change I joked about bitcoin being the number one conversation topic at Thanksgiving family get-togethers.Well, as a matter of fact, lots of new crypto-currency accounts were opened this week at ""exchanges"" like the San Francisco venture capital-backed Coinbase.But where is this wild speculation coming from? What is it that people think is possible and probable with bitcoin that would make them invest thousands of dollars without any fundamental analysis or due diligence?Hey, that sounds a lot like what investors do in the stock market every week! Crypto Mania and the Death of Banking... and TaxesIn just the past few months, a lot of legitimacy has been granted to blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT) through ventures like JPMorgan's Quorum platform which will utilize the ethereum protocol (i.e., a programming language) to create smart contracts for their clients and partners.But there is a sense of bigger revolution among the bitcoin intelligentsia and many of them want nothing less than the destruction of the commercial and federal fiat-money banking systems.These global libertarians value privacy, freedom, security and transparency more than loyalty to any state.I highlight three of those radical rogues in the podcast, including that rascal genius of cyber-security, John Mcafee. And I also share the fundamental views of Tom Lee of Fundstrat who has helped fuel this week's price action in bitcoin with his upped price target of $11,500 a couple of weeks ago.Incidentally, in the thick of this ""gold rush"" for bitcoin, Mcafee runs a public company called MGT Capital Investments  which does the ""mining"" of cryptocurrency using high-powered computers with NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) GPU semiconductors.I checked their website and found a stunning comment by CEO Robert Ladd: ""While power availability (in large part caused by unprecedented demand from the emergent Ethereum market) has delayed our deployment, we have sourced sufficient power to accommodate the 170 rigs not yet deployed, as well as the 3,650 rigs to be delivered over the next several weeks.""Bitcoin miners like MGT apply the term ""rig"" to describe the specialized computer configurations used to crunch cryptographic codes and ""mine"" for bitcoins. MGT already had nearly 900 rigs running and from the above it sounds like they expect to have over 4,700 rigs in operation in the first half of 2018 -- a 5-fold increase in their current deployment of digital artillery!One element I forgot to share in the podcast was the logic of cryptos also disrupting taxes. If more money and digital stores of value can be transacted through semi-private peer-to-peer networks, governments will soon find themselves in a very difficult position to track and collect the taxes they are accustomed to. CRISPR Creator Becomes Its CassandraIn the second half of the podcast, I review some of the patent disputes over CRISPR gene editing technology between research institutions and companies like Editas Medicine (EDIT  -  Free Report) and CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP  -  Free Report).But I also try to better explain the position of Dr. Jennifer Doudna, the co-discoverer of CRISPR-Cas9 who has been vocal in the past 2 years about its risks and dangers.Doudna had just published a book in June chronicling her journey of discovery and decision titled A Crack in Creation: Gene Editing and the Unthinkable Power to Control Evolution.There's a lot to learn here and whether or not you are inspired to read her book, you may be interested to see her speak in several presentations that are on YouTube. Here are three that highlight her ""evolution"" of thought from passionate discoverer to more somber Cassandra...Genome Engineering with CRISPR-Cas9How CRISPR Let's Us Edit Our DNAA Crack In Creation: Interview at the Aspen InstituteIt must be at once amazing and daunting to be Jennifer Doudna. At 12 you read James Watson's The Double Helix about the discovery of DNA that inspires your career in biological research. And then you go on to discover an application of that science so powerful that you sometimes wonder if you should have.I can't wait to get my hands on that book.And while it is definitely Dr. Doudna's right and responsibility to warn us of the dangers of gene editing, especially if misused, we must take a different approach to all the tidal waves of technology innovation which we cannot stop nor control, and which are only accelerating change.We must embrace learning about them, or we will be none the wiser when companies, politicians, or criminals try to use our ignorance against us.Disclosure: I own shares of NVDA for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio and shares of EDIT in Zacks Healthcare Innovators.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader and Healthcare Innovators services.
