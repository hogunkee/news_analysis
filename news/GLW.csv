4,GLW,"Verizon Communications (VZ) announced Tuesday it will purchase at least $1 billion in optical fiber wiring from Corning (GLW) during the 2018-20 time frame as it deploys 5G wireless services in 11 U.S. markets.But the company's chief executive played down a possible cable TV company acquisition as part of its 5G strategy.Verizon, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, says it'll buy a minimum of $1.05 billion in optical fiber from Corning for use in Boston and other U.S. markets. Corning, meanwhile, said it'll invest $250 million in a North Carolina manufacturing plant to increase production.Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam, who in January said acquiring a cable TV firm such as Charter Communications (CHTR) could also be part of its 5G strategy, played down the possibility in a CNBC interview. Analysts say the local networks of cable TV companies could speed the roll out of 5G networks.""I think our shareholders expect us to look at every option, but I would tell you that right now we haven't seen the architectural fit and we haven't seen a willing seller and buyer that have a meeting of the minds,"" McAdam said. He said Verizon may reassess its options as 5G network rollouts proceed.Corning stock rose 1.3% to 26.89 in the stock market today. Shares in Verizon rose 0.8% to 49.22 ahead of the telecom's Q1 earnings report Thursday.In each 5G market, Verizon plans to deploy thousands of ""small cell"" radio antennas hung on utility poles or building rooftops to build networks. The networks will require fiber-optic connections to local hubs, which  link to ""long haul"" internet infrastructure. Verizon expects to provide data speeds 100 times faster than its current wireless network.IBD'S TAKE: Shares in Corning, which also makes display technology for Apple and other smartphone makers, have gained 9% in 2017. Corning stock has been consolidating with a buy point of 28.46. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.Verizon initially has focused on 5G as a way to provide wireless broadband services to homes, which could provide new competition to cable TV firms. Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter are the biggest providers of high-speed internet services to consumers.Verizon and AT&T (T) are expected to use midband and high-frequency radio spectrum to deploy 5G services. AT&T on April 10 acquired Straight Path Communications, which owns high-frequency airwaves.Improved radio antennas and more complex semiconductors are expected to make higher frequencies usable for 5G.Wireless companies aim to build  flexible 5G networks that provide both the high-bandwidth connections required by fast-moving, self-driving cars in urban areas and always-on, reliable, low-data-rate connections needed by parking meters, oil rig sensors or other devices. Highflying drones are another potential market.Meanwhile, shares in Dycom Industries (DY) leapt 5.8% to 103.15, clearing a 98.57 cup-base entry and hitting a record high. Dycom has told analysts that 5G buildouts could create more business rather than cannibalize its existing services to AT&T, Verizon and cable TV firms. Dycom digs small trenches where fiber-optic wiring is buried. It also strings fiber wiring aerially to homes and businesses via utility poles.""We see (the Corning deal)  as a significant positive for Dycom, as Verizon is its 4th largest customer,"" Jennifer Fritzsche, a Wells Fargo analyst, said in a note to clients. ""As Verizon builds more outside of its (landline) territory, it will have more opportunity to use third-party labor. With Dycom's fiber construction business five times larger than its next largest competitor, we see it as well-positioned to capture much of this converged wireline-wireless spend from Verizon.""RELATED:Straight Path Stock Jumps; Will Verizon Top AT&T's Big Premium?Verizon, Charter Talks Heating Up?

5,GLW,"Consumer electronics giant Apple (AAPL) waved the American flag on Wednesday, pledging to contribute more than $350 billion to the U.S. economy over the next five years.X In a press release Wednesday, the Cupertino, Calif.-based company announced a new set of investments to build on its commitment to support the U.S. economy and its workforce. Last year, Apple set up a $1 billion Advanced Manufacturing Fund to make component purchases from U.S. companies. Recipients of that funding have included Corning (GLW) and Finisar (FNSR).Apple is expanding its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to $5 billion and plans to create 20,000 new jobs at Apple over the next five years, the company said. Apple already employs 84,000 people in all 50 states.The tech icon also expects to invest over $30 billion in capital expenditures in the U.S. over the next five years, including the establishment of an Apple campus in a new location. The new campus will initially house technical support for customers. The location for the facility will be announced later this year.""We believe deeply in the power of American ingenuity, and we are focusing our investments in areas where we can have a direct impact on job creation and job preparedness,"" Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said in a written statement. ""We have a deep sense of responsibility to give back to our country and the people who help make our success possible.""Apple's new investments add to the company's current pace of spending with domestic suppliers and manufacturers, estimated at $55 billion in 2018. Apple's spending will be aided by the repatriation of billions of dollars in foreign profits, thanks to recent U.S. tax reform.Apple anticipates making repatriation tax payments of about $38 billion. That implies that Apple will be bringing to the U.S. most of its $252 billion of overseas cash, Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers said in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 90 out of a best-possible 99. For more analysis on Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Under legislation approved by U.S. lawmakers in December, U.S. companies may repatriate overseas cash at a 15.5% tax rate compared with the standard 35% rate.Apple is likely to use some of the repatriated cash to boost its returns to shareholders through increased buybacks and dividends, Rakers said.""We believe this sets the table for a capital allocation update on the company's upcoming fiscal first-quarter earnings call,"" scheduled for Feb. 1, he said.Apple's investments will be focused on three areas: direct employment by Apple, spending and investment with Apple's domestic suppliers and manufacturers, and fueling the app economy which Apple created with iPhone and the App Store.Over $10 billion of Apple's expanded capital expenditures will be for investments in data centers across the country, the company said. It currently has data centers and co-located facilities in seven states.Apple shares rose 1.7% to close at 179.10 on the stock market today.RELATED:Apple To Invest $390 Million In Laser Sensor Supplier Finisar

6,GLW,"Archrivals Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Arista Networks (ANET) both won price target hikes from Morgan Stanley on Thursday, with Cisco expected to ramp up share repurchases in light of President Trump's tax reform package.X James Faucette, a Morgan Stanley analyst, hiked Cisco's price target to 42 from 39 and Arista's to 260 from 210. The analyst also hiked Corning's (GLW) price target to 33 from 30 and raised his target on Commscope Holdings (COMM) to 41 from 38.U.S. companies will be able to bring back cash held overseas at a lower tax rate as part of the Trump tax package.""We estimate that cash repatriation and share reduction could increase Cisco's annual (earnings per share) by 10%,"" said Faucette. He also is upbeat about the computer networking giant's business.""We are seeing anecdotal evidence that Cisco will build leadership and market share as enterprises converge networking and security strategies,"" said Faucette.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Arista has been taking share from Cisco in the data center-switching market.""We think Arista's long-term software development will continue to drive share gains as already demonstrated by the current 100 gigabit cycle and recent switch-router traction,"" Faucette said.Cisco has stepped up acquisitions to speed up its shift to software and services from its core business of selling network switches and routers.Cisco edged down 0.5% to close at 38.53 in the stock market today. Arista rose 0.8% to finish the regular trading day at 235.96. Corning dipped 0.4% to close at 32.30.

7,GLW,"Consumer electronics giant Apple (AAPL) on Wednesday announced a $390 million investment in Finisar (FNSR), the second company to receive funding from Apple's $1 billion Advanced Manufacturing Fund.Apple said the deal with Finisar, a maker of optical communications components, is part of its commitment to support U.S. manufacturing jobs and innovation. In May, Apple awarded $200 million to Corning (GLW) to support that company's state-of-the-art glass processing and research and development.The Apple funding is not a debt or equity investment in Finisar, but is advanced payment for future components from the company.Finisar makes vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), which are used in the iPhone X smartphone to power Apple's Face ID facial identity software and other apps with Apple's TrueDepth camera and in its AirPods wireless earbuds for proximity sensing.The Apple funding will allow Finisar ""to exponentially increase its R&D spending and high-volume production"" of VCSELS, Apple said in a press release.Because of Apple's funding, Finisar will transform a long-dormant, 700,000-square-foot manufacturing plant in Sherman, Texas, into a VCSEL factory. Apple's award will create more than 500 high-skill jobs at the facility.Apple has rapidly adopted depth-sensing technology in recent years, leading to the development and production of advanced VCSELs. In the fourth quarter, Apple will purchase 10 times more VCSEL wafers than were previously manufactured worldwide over a similar time period, Apple said.Finisar stock jumped on the news. Shares catapulted 22.8% to close at 23.71 on the stock market today. Apple was up 0.3% to close at 173.IBD'S TAKE: To find stocks for your watch list, check out the screener tools at MarketSmith. You can filter recent breakouts, stocks hitting new highs, tight trading action and more.Among Finisar's peers, Lumentum (LITE) was down 2.9% to close at 50.28 and II-VI (IIVI) slid 3.2% to finish at 44.75.Piper Jaffray analyst Troy Jensen raised his price target on Finisar to 28 from 22 and reiterated his overweight rating.""The biggest take-away from this announcement is Finisar's share opportunity at Apple,"" Jensen said in a report. ""Up until now, we had assumed Finisar only had 25% of the high-powered VCSEL for the iPhone X and Lumentum had 75% of the high-power and 100% of the low-power VCSEL. Given Lumentum's initial success, we assumed Lumentum would maintain its primary supplier status at Apple for several years to come, but given Apple's cash commitment to Finisar, we believe Finisar could capture significantly more share than previously expected.""In addition to gaining share in high-power VCSELs, Finisar could ramp production capacity for low-power VCSELs for Apple as well, he said.RELATED:Apple Invests $200 Million In Corning Manufacturing From New Fund

The Federal Reserve offered few surprises. Media stocks were in focus with Disney buying most of 21st Century Fox and the GOP-led FCC rolling back net neutrality.Bitcoin futures on the Cboe (CBOE) got off to a strong start, trading at their best levels on Friday amid typically volatile moves for the cryptocurrency. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said that Bitcoin played a very small role in the payments landscape, but that it was ""not a stable store of value"" and ""highly speculative."" Her remarks add to the chorus of banking officials weighing in on the much-hyped cryptocurrency. They echo those of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and others who believe Bitcoin, which can gain or lose thousands of dollars in a day, can't be depended on to retain consistent value.CME Group (CME) will launch its Bitcoin futures on Dec. 18.The megadeal is a reality: Disney is buying Fox's entertainment assets for an enterprise value of $66.1 billion. It includes 20th Century Fox's movie and TV studios, National Geographic, FX, 22 Fox regional sports networks, and certain international assets. Disney CEO Bob Iger, who is extending his contract past 2019 to 2021 because of the merger, expressed enthusiasm about the deal's ability to boost the media giant's direct-to-consumer strategy and spread the ESPN brand internationally. It's not clear how regulators feel about the transaction, and Disney has promised a $2.5 billion breakup fee. Fox will keep its broadcast, news as well sports networks FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network. Disney and Fox shares soared.Separately, Disney should expect a windfall from its latest entrant to the ""Star Wars"" franchise, ""The Last Jedi,"" which has already garnered largely positive reviews from critics and early viewers.

FCC chairman Ajit Pai  said the new rules will ""return regulatory parity to the internet economy."" He said some giant internet companies engage in anti-consumer behavior, while ISPs have been unfairly targeted by regulators. State regulators, Comcast and others said Congress should step in and pass internet legislation. One analyst put the chances of that at less than 30%.The Federal Reserve raised rates at its final meeting of the year, as expected. Policymakers also still expect to raise interest rates three times next year and didn't seem concerned about Trump tax cuts overheating the economy. Economic data backed a Goldilocks scenario.

Bluebird Bio (BLUE) soared Monday after it reported improvement in patients using its LentiGlobin therapy to treat sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia.

On Tuesday, GlycoMimetics (GLYC) rocketed on data from its drug in acute myeloid leukemia, but Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT) sank following its presentation of its sickle cell disease drug. Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) crashed on its hemophilia A drug data, suggesting a later approval than a rival treatment from Biomarin (BMRN).

11,GLW,"Trimble Navigation (TRMB) may well face head winds in its key agriculture business this year as low commodity prices threaten to eat into farmers' spending power.
"
12,GLW,"That shouldn't stop the maker of Global Positioning System gear and other location technologies from reaping the benefits of a strong market position and generating solid gains in its engineering and construction business, analysts say.

"
14,GLW,"Its lineup includes products that automate large industrial machines such as tractors and bulldozers, surveying instruments, integrated systems that track fleets of vehicles and workers while providing real-time analytics to the back office, and software solutions that connect all aspects of a construction site or farm.

21,GLW,"Trimble has capitalized on a trend called precision farming, which is the use of GPS-enabled devices and software to improve farm efficiency and productivity.
"
22,GLW,"Through its offerings in this area, the company helps farmers with every step of the farming process, including land preparation, then the planting, nutrient and pest management, and harvesting phases of a crop cycle.

"
23,GLW,"The company offers operations management tools with its Connected Farm platform, which allows information exchange across an entire farm.
"
24,GLW,"Trimble's ability to integrate GPS or other location technologies with application software that boosts productivity has helped the company's advantage, analysts say.
"
25,GLW,"That advantage is reflected in its track record: Trimble has posted double-digit profit gains in all but two of the past 15 quarters. It is expected to keep up that growth level. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect first-quarter earnings, to be reported on May 6, to rise 11% to 42 cents a share.
"
26,GLW,"That would follow a solid showing in the fourth quarter. Trimble reported EPS minus items of 43 cents, up 48% from a year earlier and 6 cents above analyst forecasts. Revenue rose 16% to $599.2 million, ahead of views for $567.4 million.

30,GLW,"""Construction is starting to move into an up cycle, particularly nonresidential, which is getting set to hit its stride,"" he said. ""So where it has a head wind in agriculture, I believe it has a very nice tailwind in construction, which is coming off a bottom of a cycle.""

31,GLW,"And, he adds, ""just like in agriculture, there's also an adoption of technology taking place"" on the part of construction companies.

48,GLW,"President Trump summoned some of America's most prominent corporate executives to the White House Thursday and told them he intends to put them to work restoring manufacturing jobs and U.S. dominance in trade.""They share our commitment to bring manufacturing back and to create jobs in this country,"" Trump said as he sat with the 24 business leaders, who included Dow Chemical (DOW) Chief Executive Officer Andrew Liveris, General Electric (GE) CEO Jeffrey Immelt, Lockheed Martin (LMT) CEO Marillyn Hewson, and Caterpillar (CAT) Chairman Doug Oberhelman.Trump used the public portion of the meeting to reiterate some of his campaign themes, blasting what he called ""unbelievably bad"" trade deals and singling out trade deficits with Mexico and China. He vowed to punish companies that move jobs outside the U.S. and promised to squeeze more money out of government contracts, citing his talks with Hewson, which he said cut the cost of Lockheed's F-35 fighter jet by more than $700 million.""She's tough, but it worked out well I think for everybody,"" Trump said of Hewson.Before meeting with Trump, the executives split into working groups to explore policy changes on topics such as taxes and trade, regulation, infrastructure and the future workforce. Joining them in the breakout sessions were administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence; Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council; Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin; and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.Campbell Soup (CPB) CEO Denise Morrison, Harris Corp. (HRS) CEO Bill Brown, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) CEO Alex Gorsky and David Farr, CEO of Emerson Electric (EMR), were among those who took part in the working group sessions with administration officials, who also included budget director Mick Mulvaney.  In a meeting with Cohn and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, business leaders including Corning (GLW) CEO Wendell Weeks and Nucor (NUE) President John Ferriola discussed indexing gasoline taxes to provide more money for transportation projects.Thursday's meeting grew out of Trump's December announcement of an advisory panel on manufacturing.Dow Chemical's Liveris, who is leading the panel, said afterward that he and the other executives were ""very encouraged"" by the pro-business approach being taken by the administration.Taking part in a session on the workforce of the future, Liveris said there must be a ""systemic fix"" to address the shortage of workers prepared for jobs requiring skills in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.""We have supply-side issues today,"" he said, ""half a million open STEM jobs that we can't fill. We need to fill them with Americans.""He also said community colleges need to provide more vocational training for ""the noble trades,"" which had been a priority of the Obama administration.Lockheed's Hewson told reporters that Trump is ready to take quick action on streamlining rules for businesses. ""It's very important that we reduce regulations, that we eliminate those that are burdensome that are unnecessary,"" she said.Ahead of the meeting, Business Roundtable, the lobbying group for U.S. corporate executives, sent a letter to Cohn laying out 16 regulations of top concern to its members. The letter touches on everything from the Affordable Care Act to net neutrality to environmental regulations — but also hints at CEO concerns about the economic impacts of Trump immigration and trade policy.Topping the Business Roundtable list is a 2015 move by the Environmental Protection Agency to tighten national ambient air quality standards for ground-level ozone, as well as EPA limits on new coal-fired power plants and expanded jurisdiction over state waters. The list also includes overtime regulations; Dodd-Frank provisions including CEO pay ratio disclosure, conflict minerals disclosure rules and margin requirements for uncleared swaps; and employer reporting and tax requirements under the Affordable Care Act. In addition, the group is seeking expedited export controls and tightening eligibility and increasing exclusions for shareholder proposals.""While some of the listed regulations in isolation may not appear significant to growth, their cumulative effect has drained resources from innovation and job creation and directed them to non-value adding administrative and bureaucratic activities,"" said the letter, signed by Mark Costa, the chairman and CEO for Eastman Chemical (EMN) who leads Business Roundtable's smart regulation committee.At the same time, the letter said that as the administration ""considers new policies with regard to immigration or the expansion of 'Buy America' requirements, Business Roundtable stands ready to assist to prevent unintended consequences that would inhibit the ability for U.S. companies to drive economic growth and be globally competitive.""Trump has used previous meetings with companies to encourage corporate leaders to build their products in the U.S., offering tax breaks and lower regulation to bring down costs — and warning that he wants to raise tariffs on products produced overseas. The heads of labor organizations, automotive firms, national retail chains, drug companies, and airlines are all among the groups who have met with Trump in the West Wing in recent weeks.Neither Trump nor the CEOs indicated they had a detailed discussion of his plans to overhaul the tax code, which he has said he will deliver within weeks, or a border-adjustment tax proposal under consideration by House Republicans, which would shift the tax burden from exporters to importers.Republican leaders in the House, including Speaker Paul Ryan, argue a border-adjustment tax would benefit American manufacturing while providing revenue to make up for losses from reducing corporate tax rates. Several manufacturers, including Dow Chemical, are actively lobbying for the plan, which Trump has called ""too complicated."" Opponents, including net importers like Wal-Mart (WMT), oppose it and warn it will raise taxes on American consumers.

Advancers and decliners were about evenly split on the NYSE and Nasdaq. Automakers, utilities and homebuilders, one of the hottest industry groups, were leading today's market.Corning (GLW) broke out of a cup with handle. But volume was running at only about half its usual pace and the price increase also lacked power.

The stock is finding support in a pullback to the 50-day moving average.Among stocks down in unusual volume, the two leading RV stocks slid as they cool off from rapid gains. Thor Industries (THO) fell nearly 2%, on track to end a seven-day win streak, and Winnebago Industries (WGO) gapped down to a loss of more than 6%. Stifel Nicolaus downgraded Winnebago to a hold rating, citing concerns that the stock has gotten overheated, reports said.Both stocks remain well-extended from their breakouts several weeks ago, but the abrupt break in their price uptrends warrants attention.RELATED:Thor Beats Fiscal Q4 Forecasts, Sees More Production Capacity GrowthTop RV Maker In Buy Range, But Will Hurricanes Help Sales?FANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google

63,GLW,"Dow Chemical (DOW) plans to eliminate about 2,500 jobs and shut plants in North Carolina and Japan to achieve $500 million in cost savings and more revenue from taking full control of its Dow Corning silicone venture.The company will take a charge of about $410 million to $460 million in the second quarter for asset impairments, employee severance and other costs related to the revamp, Dow said Tuesday in a statement.Dow paid $4.8 billion to buy partner Corning's (GLW) 50% stake in the 72-year-old joint venture in a deal completed at the beginning of June. The takeover is part of Dow Chemical Chief Executive Officer Andrew Liveris' effort to focus on higher-value products. The company is also seeking to merge with DuPont (DD), a combination that's now under antitrust scrutiny.""We are moving quickly and effectively to integrate Dow Corning and deliver the synergies that will drive new levels of value creation for our customers and generate even greater returns for our shareholders,"" Liveris said in the statement.Dow will shut silicone factories in Greensboro, N.C., and Yamakita, Japan, as well as some offices and production lines in other unspecified locations, according to the statement.Annual cost savings from taking over Dow Corning will total $400 million, a 33% increase from a previous estimate, and the deal will bring in $100 million in additional growth, the company said. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization will be boosted by $1 billion, it said. These goals were previously stated except for the lifting of the cost savings target by $100 million.

64,GLW,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 8 could see Synaptics (SYNA) bounced off the list of suppliers for the handset-- but it's unlikely, Rosenblatt analyst Jun Zhang said Wednesday.The iPhone maker has reportedly developed its own touch-chip for display screens, a role Synaptics had filled, but it will nonetheless still need Synaptics' OLED driver, Zhang said in a research note Wednesday.OLEDs (organic light-emitting diodes) allow for thinner and flexible smartphone and TV screens. It's widely expected that Apple will replace its LCD (light-crystal displays) iPhone screens for OLED displays with next year's iPhone update, expected to be called the iPhone 8. In September, Apple is expected to unveil its next iPhone, the 7, which is expected to continue using LCD screens.Despite the Rosenblatt report, Synaptics stock fell 2.2% to 64.01 on the stock market today. Shares are down nearly 20% so far this year, while the U.S.-listed stock of rival LG Display (LPL) is up 3%.  (LPL Display fell 1.5% Wednesday). Synaptics' potential Apple loss is baked into its current stock price, Zhang says.He doubts Apple's touch-chip will be ready for OLEDs by next year. ""Therefore, we believe even Synaptics has the risk to lose Apple's panel driver (chip) business, but they still have a chance to remain as their OLED driver (chip) supplier,"" he wrote.Smartphone and TV panel prices zipped up in May and June, Zhang says. In the second half of May, 32-inch to 43-inch TV panel pricing was up $1, and an aggressive smartphone build ahead of the iPhone 7 launch tightened supply in June.The panel refresh should help AU Optronics (AUO), LG, Corning (GLW), Universal Display (OLED) and Synaptics, he said.  AU Optronics fell 0.35%, Corning 0.5%. Universal Display climbed 0.3%, setting another record close.And potential Synaptics suitors will take notice, Zhang said, reiterating his buy rating and 106 price target on Synaptics stock. On April 14, shares soared 7.3% on renewed reports that a Chinese investment group was looking to acquire the company for about $110 per share.Those talks petered out two weeks later, when Synaptics reported fiscal Q3 sales and earnings per share ex items that missed by $50 million and 30 cents, respectively. Synaptics stock fell 5.6% in response.Rumored acquirers ""would prefer to monitor whether the business will recover or continue deteriorating in the second half (of 2016),"" Zhang wrote, though he said that Chinese investors remained interested.

65,GLW,"Stocks struggled a bit and moved lower yesterday - while remaining in the range that I pointed out in yesterday's note....2080/2100 - Late morning we tested the 2080 level before finding some support and rally into the closing bell.... Trading was light as investors/traders appeared unwilling to commit to the market ahead of the onslaught of earnings today - think Apple (AAPL),  Facebook (FB),  Procter & Gamble (PG), EXXON Mobil (XOM), BAXTER (BAX), 3M (MMM), Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), Corning (GLW), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Eli Lilly (LLY) (Revenues beat, but EPS missed by 0.02 cts) & Whirlpool (WHR) (missed on the top line - revenues - and missed on the bottom line. reported $2.63 vs. exp of $2.68) that are all announcing today and ahead of tomorrow's FOMC announcement.Remember - today begins the two day FED meeting and there is a lot of anticipation and paralysis about what they will say tomorrow. Again - the mkt does not expect a change in rates at all...but it does expect some clarification in terminology concerning June and the next expected hike......Recall that the last hike in December, sent the mkts into a tailspin.....causing the FED to become a bit more 'dovish' as she searched for a reason to calm the mkts.....this time citing unstable global mkts as the culprit...but since then - the mkts have come roaring back - with the S&P now up 2.1% and the Dow up 3.74% - off of what looked like a disastrous year.....As a result of the strength - expect Janet to intimate a return to a path to higher rates......not necessarily faster, just a bit higher.....Expect every word to be parsed and every sentence to be deconstructed as everyone looks for the next 'clue'.Now why the low volumes? Well there are a number of reasons really - never mind the current regulatory environment, and the abuse suffered by so many managers during the 1Q - but yesterday - there was no 'news', right? No eco reports, no significant earnings, no speeches, no big international events, no nothing.....so why do anything? The mkt held in tight - giving no reason to deviate from the plan.....and so the only ones really playing yesterday were the HFT guys and - and asset managers that were tweaking core positions....but tweaking does not mean a change of investment strategy at all...it just means tweaking.....Now oil did come under a bit of pressure yesterday - falling by 2.4% to end the day at $$42.64- but all that tells me is that the recent run up in oil was a bit premature given the current glut and lack of a deal between the OPEC nations etc. So if oil trades within the current band - $39.50/$44 - it's all good.....Why should it break down or surge higher just yet? This morning we see oil up small as the dollar appears a bit weaker......(think no rate hike). Remember - we will get the weekly API (American Petroleum Institute) report this afternoon.Now yesterday we did get a broad measure of the housing mkt.....- but again - these stats are no longer the mkt moving events that they were......although - that could change...you see - yesterday was NEW HOME SALES....and typically this is good barometer of the state of the broader US economy...and guess what? Another disappointment.....New Home Sales FELL 1.5% vs. the exp of a rise of 1.6%.......and why should we be a bit concerned?Well - This is the time of the year when new home sales should be strong....so is this disappointment just another barometer of a weakening economic picture? What is really mind boggling is that we are now a decade into the housing collapse....a decade - that is 10 yrs of an incomplete recovery...as pockets of single family housing continue to stall..... New Home Sales on a total unit basis came in at 511k units - significantly below the 50 yr average of more than 650,000 units. During the Greenspan era - Subprime loans/mortgages propelled sales of New Homes into the stratosphere - sending them as high as 1.28 million units in 2005, - the yr before the beginning of the crash.......a crash created by the adjustable rate mortgages that managed to destroy so many people - triggering waves of foreclosures that then ignited the Great Financial Crisis of 2007 - 2010 (some say the crisis is still ongoing.....I'll leave that up to you...).US futures are up 2 pts in early trading...as the mkt gets ready to react to the slew of those earnings reports noted above. Whirlpool - which we noted missed the numbers is quoted down about $10 bucks in pre-mkt trading....quoted NOT trading just yet....so let's see what investors/traders think about that.....Today is also a big economic day...lots of macro data to consider....Durable Goods exp of +1.9%, ex trans of 0.5%, Cap Good Orders of +0.6%, Cap Goods Shipped of +0.9%, Markit US PMI of 52 and the Richmond Fed Survey of 12. The earnings will all be happening prior to the open while the macro data begins at 8:30 and goes until 10 am. This will create a lot of noise in early trading...but once it settles in after 11 am....then expect the discussion to revolve around the FED once analysts consider the implications of whatever today's macro data reveals.Again - I expect the broader mkt to hold tight within the 2080/2100 range until tomorrow. (Think FED paralysis). Individual names today will get rewarded or punished depending on what they reported and what they say about the future....All in a day's work.....Take Good Care

67,GLW,"Competing in the shadow of Cisco Systems (CSCO) can be a tough place for Ciena (CIEN), the specialty fiber optics developer for telecom and cable service providers: Perform inadequately and you're dust. Perform well and get picked off.In fact, perform so-so and get picked off, like Alliance Fiber Optic Products (AFOP) getting bought out by Corning (GLW) in a $305 million deal disclosed Thursday.""Ciena is quick to recognize its financial performance has fallen short of investor hopes, and its own,"" said Nomura analyst Jeffrey Kvaal in a research note Friday, after spending time with Ciena Chief Technology Officer Steve Alexander and investor relations executive Gregg Lampf.Ciena is ""taking steps to improve financial performance,"" Kvaal said. ""Ciena has suffered from high investor expectations (Verizon (VZ) metro timing), macro factors (foreign exchange, mergers), and its own execution. To address these issues, Ciena has cleaned up its execution, widened the guidance range and added conservatism to its European guidance.""We would have preferred the guidance conservatism to apply more broadly. We believe many investors will only consider the stock following several quarters of outperformance, despite Ciena’s steady annual progress.""With such ambivalence, Kvaal reaffirmed Nomura's buy rating and 24 price target on Ciena stock, which was up 2.5%, above 18, in afternoon trading in the stock market today. That's still 32% below a nearly 16-month high of 26.50 touched last July. Shares fell below their 50-day moving average this week.Alliance Fiber Optic stock was up 19% Friday afternoon, at a six-month high near 18.50. That's the price Corning agreed to pay for Alliance, an agreement  disclosed after Thursday's market close. Corning was down a fraction Friday afternoon, near 20.50, near a nine-month high at 21.07 reached March 30.Shares of networking king Cisco were up a fraction, near 28.Alliance and Corning both earn middling 63 IBD Composite Ratings, while Ciena has an 81 CR. Composite Ratings rank companies by major metrics such as sales and earnings growth over the past 12 months.""Beneath the headlines,"" Nomura's Kvaal said, Ciena offers ""a solid growth story with rising margins.""Kvaal notes that Ciena works in the crosstown and long-haul markets beyond 50 miles, not inside the data center or campus markets. ""It thus does not see the intra-data-center strength the component vendors are seeing and is not affected by Microsoft’s (MFST) Colorz launch (announced in March). ""For Ciena's fiscal Q1, ended Jan. 31, the company earned 18 cents per share minus items, up 50% from the year-earlier quarter, beating analysts' 14-cent estimate. Revenue rose 8% to $573 million but missed analysts' $576 million expectation.For Q2, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS ex items to fall 23% to 27 cents, on revenue up 1.5% to $631 million.

96,GLW,"A simple malfunction led to a spectacular breakthrough for glass chemist S. Donald Stookey. The furnace he'd set to 600 degrees Celsius inexplicably soared to 900. Stookey expected the substance inside to be a molten mess, the furnace toast.Instead, he discovered a solid white plate that slipped when Stookey (1915-2014) grasped it with tongs.As it clanged on the ground, intact instead of shattered, the Corning (GLW) researcher realized something special had taken shape.""It crystallized so completely that it could not flow and was obviously much stronger than ordinary glass,"" Stookey wrote in his autobiography, ""Explorations in Glass.""This first-known piece of glass ceramic, dubbed Pyroceram, would be further developed at glass manufacturer Corning into cookware — the ubiquitous cornflower-decorated white casserole containers beloved by cooks for going from refrigerator to oven without a crack.Sweet ProductionCorningWare sold like hotcakes in the late 1950s, resulting in 10,000 jobs and $500 million in annual sales for Corning.""One of the things that makes me proud is that fairly often someone I don't know — one of the workers in the factory — will stop me on the street and actually thank me for his job,"" Stookey told the Associated Press in 1986.Stookey's Pyroceram, which made cookware durable enough to survive house fires, also covered the nosecones of guided missiles.On top of that, the researcher invented transition sunglasses — which darken in sunlight and become clear indoors — and the glass used in TV screens.Another Stookey original adorns the north face of New York City's United Nations building: photosensitive opal glass that resembles marble when viewed in sunlight.President Reagan awarded the scientist a National Medal of Technology in 1986, and Stookey entered the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2010.Corning, the upstate New York giant, annually gives its Stookey Award ""in honor of Dr. Stookey and his legendary commitment to exploratory research and innovation,"" David Morse, executive vice president and chief technology officer, told IBD. ""Dr. Stookey was fearless — the unknown never daunted him. He was an unassuming and quiet but tough person with an extensive depth of knowledge.""The intrepid researcher's influence extended beyond Corning's walls. ""Don's inventions and his mentoring of the present generations of scientists have had a global impact that few other individuals can claim,"" said John Ballato, a researcher and vice president for economic development at Clemson University. ""He was diligent and fully understood the fundamentals, which is especially important when one is truly inventing something new — not just innovating to improve something that already exists, though he did that too.""Stookey relished the adventure of studying glass. The ancient substance still retained much of its mystery in the 1940s.""Like an explorer in a newly discovered land, I have pioneered a new field of science, the chemistry of glass, and found previously unknown treasures both useful and beautiful,"" he wrote.Born in Hay Springs, Neb., Stookey was the oldest of four children.His father, Stanley, was a teacher, bank clerk and outdoorsman; his mother, Hermie, was a housewife and teacher.The family moved to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, when Don was 6.The youngster grew up on outdoor adventures. Grandfather Stephen Stookey, a botany and geology professor at Cedar Rapids' Coe College, insisted that he pursue higher education. With a $100-per-semester scholarship, Donald sailed through four years at Coe, graduating magna cum laude in 1936 with a major in chemistry.Clear View""As do most young people, I had formulated a long-range goal — to explore far beyond the known fields of science and to discover or create useful new things that no one had ever seen before,"" he wrote.Stookey next earned a master's in chemistry from Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., in 1938, and a chemistry doctorate from MIT in Cambridge, Mass., in 1940.Choosing between job offers from Nabisco and Corning, then known as Corning Glass Works, was easy. Stookey had no interest in baking, and a job opening at Corning involved researching opal glass — a mysteriously enticing prospect to him.""Glass was an unknown field as far as I was concerned,"" he wrote.Stookey started at Corning in July 1940 in a dusty attic lab. That winter, he drove home to Iowa to marry Coe College sweetheart Ruth Watterson, with whom he'd have three children. Back at Corning, researchers tutored Stookey in the science of glass and urged him to explore how crystals form in white — opal — glass.Stookey's first goal: to use light and heat to create opaque patterns on clear glass.""My reasoning was that, win or lose, I'd learn some interesting glass chemistry, and technical success might produce a new process for decorating glass,"" he wrote.His advances in photosensitive glass were often visually striking, but not particularly marketable.""For almost 10 years, the products of my labors were mainly discoveries in the chemistry of glass and the photosensitive glasses which were regarded as interesting and beautiful, but not utilitarian or profitable,"" he wrote.Company President W.C. Decker needed practical applications, and lab discoveries served as building blocks for business breakthroughs.Boosting TelevisionFotoform, a substance used for TV screens in the 1950s, was one such advance. Stookey created it by using chemicals to punch minuscule holes in glass.""Fortunately, the Fotoform discovery, with its breakthroughs in color television, came just in time to restore us to Mr. Decker's good graces,"" Stookey wrote.It was Fotoform glass that overheated in that malfunctioning oven and ultimately became the Pyroceram of CorningWare.Such serendipity favors a methodical researcher like Stookey.""He placed a high value on exploratory research and investing the appropriate amount of time on a project,"" said Morse. ""For example, while he called his 1952 discovery of glass ceramics 'a lucky accident,' he followed up with years of rigorous research.""Stookey's transition lenses, likewise, took time.William Armistead, vice president and director of research at the time, had made opal glasses change color in light and fade in darkness.""But these impermanent photo effects had not appeared to be useful,"" Stookey said.When an ophthalmic customer wanted spectacles that turned into shades, Armistead asked if Stookey could see it through.""Being a confirmed optimist, I jumped at the chance,"" he said.Stookey ultimately achieved the feat, and the subsequent patent would be one of more than 60.He retired in 1987 and shared his take on Corning's unbridled research: ""In many ways I have felt akin to the alchemists, artists and sculptors of the Middle Ages, whose material welfare was taken care of by wealthy patrons so they could devote all their energies to their work.""

97,GLW,"Corning (GLW) topped fourth-quarter estimates on strong sales of rugged Gorilla Glass and of LCD glass for large screen TVs and other consumer electronics. It projected continued strong sales this quarter.Earnings per share climbed 55% to 45 cents in Q4, beating forecasts by 7 cents a share. It was the company's fourth quarter of accelerating earnings growth.Revenue hiked 30% to $2.6 billion vs. analyst consensus for $2.5 billion.""We are entering 2015 with momentum,"" CFO James Flaws said in a statement.Corning anticipates that strong demand for Gorilla Glass will drive 10% growth in the Specialty Materials segment, and deployment of fiber optics for broadband access will push sales in its Optical Communications group up 10% in Q1 too. However, LCD glass volume will likely fall, in line with normal seasonality, the company said.In mid-December, Corning stock broke out from a five-month cup-with-handle base with a 22.36 buy point.It accelerated from there, and shares were up 1.7% at 24.31 in Tuesday morning trading in the stock market today, at a 6-1/2-year high.The glass and ceramics maker, which supplies glass for Sony (SNE) big screen TVs, Apple (AAPL) iPhones and iPads and others, has pulled away from its 50-day and 200-day lines and carries a 90 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 90% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters.By segment, Corning's Q4 Display Technologies sales jumped 69% to $1.1 billion, driven by added revenue from its Corning Precision Materials acquisition last year for $1.9 billion in stock.Sustained retail demand for larger LCD television sizes drove stronger-than-expected glass volume in the quarter, while glass pricing declined less than in the third quarter, continuing a trend of moderating declines, Corning says.Optical Communications sales were $676 million, a 12% increase from last year's fourth quarter. Q4 performance was better than expected, Corning says, as North American fiber-to-the-home sales grew 64%.In December, Corning announced it would buy TR Manufacturing, a Fremont, Calif., maker of fiber-optic and copper cable components, for an undisclosed sum. TR Manufacturing will become a wholly owned subsidiary, Corning says.Corning anticipates capital spending will be in the $1.3 billion-$1.4 billion range this year, up from $1.1 billion in 2014. It has also begun buying back shares under its new $1.5 billion program.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

99,GLW,"The saga of disgruntled, and bankrupt, Apple supplier GT Advanced Technologies will go on at least a little longer than planned, after a court hearing to discuss a bankruptcy settlement between GT and Apple was postponed to Dec. 10 from Nov. 25.Unsecured creditors of GT Advanced sought the postponement to give them more time to investigate possible objections to the settlement. GT itself has agreed to the proposed settlement after offering some harsh words for the world's most valuable company.Bankruptcy court documents that GT had filed over the past month shine a light on the otherwise secretive relationship of Apple with its suppliers, or at least one supplier, though Apple (AAPL) denies most GT allegations.GT claims that its contract as an Apple supplier was ""oppressive,"" driving it to declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy.GT says that it had to sign a nondisclosure agreement calling for a $50 million penalty for leaking information. GT made scratch-resistant sapphire glass display covers to be used for high-end versions of the Apple Watch, slated for release early next year. The sapphire displays had been expected to be used for the new iPhone 6, but so far Apple has stuck with Corning 's (GLW) Gorilla Glass for its iPhones.Apple has a very different perspective. It claims to have ""bent over backwards"" to work with GT Advanced, making payments even though the supplier ""failed to meet performance milestones.""Apple calls itself flexible in negotiations. The firm adds that many allegations by GT Advanced are false and defamatory, and ""portray Apple as a coercive bully,"" according to court documents obtained by IBD.These details came to light after District of New Hampshire U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Henry Boroff unsealed the Apple supplier's court documents on Nov. 6, as the two companies were hashing out a settlement.Sought To Unseal DocumentsGT Advanced said that it had petitioned the court to allow it to reveal the nondisclosure details in the interest of creditors, equity holders and other stakeholders. It said that unsealing the details would ensure an ""open, transparent and fair process.""Apple is reputed to be a tough negotiator with great leverage in dealing with suppliers, and finding out specifics about its contracts can be impossible, says Srini Sundararajan, an analyst with Summit Research Partners.""Often, the best way is to look at 10-Qs and 10-Ks of Apple's current and prior vendors, a laborious process,"" Sundararajan said. Even then, the documents aren't likely to include much information, he says.GT Advanced claims that Apple's nondisclosure agreements ""provide that each breach of the confidentiality obligations will require (GT Advanced) to pay liquidated damages to Apple in an amount of $50 million per occurrence,"" according to the court documents.GT Advanced Chief Operating Officer Daniel Squiller said in an affidavit that his company had become a ""captive supplier"" of Apple, enduring ""constant interference"" and arbitrary changes in product specifications.GT Advanced said that it sold ""every unit of sapphire material at a substantial loss,"" racked up as much as $900 million in expenses and had to lay off 1,300 workers.GT Advanced stock plummeted from 19.77 on June 28 to 80 cents when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Oct. 6. It's now trading near 50 cents over-the-counter.Apple said in court documents that it will ""continue evaluating GTAT's progress on larger sapphire boule development,"" and will help bankruptcy-affected employees find new jobs.GT Advanced claims that Apple told it to ""put on your big boys pants and accept the agreement"" when GT pressed its concerns about terms of its sapphire agreement, which it says was ""strategically structured"" to benefit Apple.GT Advanced also said that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating its sapphire business and that it is cooperating with authorities.Apple said in its own filing that GT Advanced's allegations made by contain ""extensive, unnecessary, scandalous and defamatory statements about Apple's alleged intent, motives and business tactics."" The document says that many of GT Advanced's statements are ""gratuitous, false and wholly irrelevant.""""These statements are intended to vilify Apple and portray Apple as a coercive bully,"" Apple stated in court documents.Despite the harsh words, on Nov. 4 GT Advanced said in an SEC filing that it has signed an amended settlement agreement with Apple and is seeking bankruptcy court approval.""We have been working diligently to develop a restructuring plan that will allow us to emerge from Chapter 11 as quickly as possible and with the operating flexibility and resources to position GT for long-term success,"" GT said in an Oct. 23 statement announcing the original settlement , which was amended on Nov. 5.GT Advanced plans to wind down its sapphire production and exit the market as a producer of sapphire materials to refocus as an equipment supplier and maker of products used to manufacturer sapphire as well as photovoltaic and polysilicon solar products. Apple will be able to recover $439 million in prepayments that it made to GT Advanced, say the documents.GT Advanced claims that it had to file for bankruptcy after the deal to provide sapphire for Apple's iPhones ""collapsed.""GT Advanced, which said that it has more than 40 years of experience developing ""technological innovations in connection with the manufacturing of furnaces to grow sapphire for industrial use,"" added that it had signed a contract in October 2013 to install more than 2,000 sapphire-growing furnaces to be operated in a facility that Apple would provide. GT said that the transaction had the potential to be ""revolutionary"" for its business and a ""significant achievement for Apple.""Time And Money IssuesGT Advanced added that Apple had negotiated over price and terms, and agreed not to buy the furnaces. Instead, GT Advanced would borrow money from Apple to purchase furnace components and assemble furnaces that would grow sapphire for Apple, court documents said. Under the deal's terms, GT Advanced said that it was to acquire 2,036 sapphire furnaces using $578 million ($439 million were fully paid) in total prepayments from Apple.But GT Advanced said it could not produce the volume of sapphire ""within the time frames the parties had agreed, and was more expensive than anticipated.""Apple said that it had paid GT Advanced $439 million in prepayments and spent another $700 million-plus in connection with the transaction despite receiving ""only a small fraction"" of the original commitment of GT Advanced.""Far from the villain in these Chapter 11 cases, Apple is the largest victim of the debtor's failure to perform under the agreements it negotiated at arms' length and with the advice of counsel,"" Apple stated in court documents.GT Advanced, however, claims that it could not modify its equipment, manufacturing processes or much of anything else without Apple's approval. GT also said that it had to offer Apple prices at least 5% below what it charged anyone else.Apple's contract instructed GT Advanced employees to refer to the sapphire display contract by the code name ""Onyx,"" court documents said.Apple noted that the impact of its deal with GT Advanced included a stock price hike for GT.""The price of a share of common stock of GT Advanced rose more than 20% upon the announcement by the debtors that they had entered into an agreement with Apple to supply sapphire,"" Apple said.

126,GLW,"Verizon Communications Inc (VZ  -  Free Report) recently completed the $225-million purchase of fiber-optic network assets from WideOpenWest, Inc. (WOW  -  Free Report) in the Chicago area. Per the terms of the deal, Verizon will pay WideOpenWest an additional $50 million to complete Chicago network build in second-half 2018. The amount will increase to $275 million at the time of completion.The deal secures fiber to more than 500 macro-cell and small-cell wireless sites in the Chicago area. The high-capacity network is designed to support multiple services and connects Verizon Wireless macro towers and small cells. This will lower future leasing costs. The buyout will accelerate Verizon’s network densification and enhance its industry-leading 4G LTE network, upcoming 5G wireless standards and wireline connections. The deal will also boost the deployment of next-generation broadband services.Accumulation of dark fiber will bolster Verizon’s cell network density, which will consequently boost mobile backhaul network. Dark fiber provides abundant bandwidth and is of utmost necessity for the smooth functioning of super-fast wireless networks like 4G and 5G. Dark fiber-based backhaul provides scalability and efficiency to bandwidth management. This will eventually help the company to significantly reduce backhaul costs.Acquiring the Chicago fiber assets is just one of Verizon’s several moves in solidifying fiber network holdings. The service provider is pursuing a series of acquisitions of regional fiber assets and internal fiber expansions.Verizon’s Toil on Fiber-OpticsVerizon acquired dark fiber through the acquisition of MCI in 2006. In February 2017, the company acquired XO Communications’ dark-fiber optic network for $1.8 billion. Verizon will also lease XO’s LMDS (Local Multipoint Distribution Service) wireless spectrum with an option to buy them by the end of 2018. XO Communication has a portfolio of 102 LMDS licenses in 28 GHz and 39 GHz bands.In April 2017, Verizon entered into a three-year purchase agreement with Corning Inc. (GLW  -  Free Report) to buy fiber optic cables and associated hardware for nationwide wireless broadband network. Per the deal, Verizon will acquire around 20 million kilometers (12.4 million miles) of optical fiber each year from 2018 through 2020 from Corning, with a minimum purchase commitment of $1.05 billion.In May 2017, Verizon acquired Straight Path Communications Inc., a leading provider of fixed wireless spectrum licenses. The company agreed to pay $3.1 billion for Straight Path, significantly more than AT&T Inc.’s (T  -  Free Report) offer of $1.6 billion. Notably, Straight Path has a strong portfolio of 868 spectrum licenses in the high-frequency 28 GHz and 39 GHz bands, which are included in the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) designation for the next generation of wireless broadband services.Verizon also signed a $300-million agreement with Prysmian. which will be an additional supplier of fiber cable to support 4G and 5G wireless and wireline broadband plans. Prysmian will supply Verizon with more than 17 million kilometers (10.6 million miles) of ribbon and loose tube cables.In September 2017, Verizon sought permission from the FCC, to retire copper networks in eight northeast markets, effective from Feb 28, 2018. The U.S. telecom behemoth wants to upgrade s obsolete copper network infrastructure with fiber and wireless network to support high-end mobile and wireline services for smart city, residential and business applications.Zacks Rank & Price Performance Currently, Verizon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

127,GLW,"Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) announced that it has awarded $390 million to one of its chip suppliers, Finisar, for the production of advanced semiconductor lasers used in iPhone X's True Depth facial recognition camera.The award (and not any debt/equity investment as clarified by Finisar) was made from Apple’s $1 billion advanced manufacturing fund.The fund was announced after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the company for not creating enough manufacturing jobs in the United States and instead focusing on other nations. In May, in an interview with CNBC, CEO Tim Cook had mentioned that the company is setting up the fund to boost employment in advanced manufacturing in the home country.Reportedly, the funding in Finisar is expected to increase its R&D spending. It will also increase production of the vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) required in True Depth camera’s latest features such as Face ID, Animoji and Portrait mode selfies.Per the latest blog post, “In the fourth quarter of 2017, Apple will purchase 10 times more VCSEL wafers than were previously manufactured worldwide over a similar time period.”Apple’s award is also anticipated to create over 500 high skill jobs at Finisar’s newly acquired factory located in Sherman, TX. The factory is expected to start functioning in the second half of 2018.This is the second award made by the company from this fund. Prior to this, it had invested $200 million in Corning Inc. (GLW  -  Free Report).Notably, shares of Apple have gained 48.8% year to date, slightly outperforming the industry’s 47.6% rally. Shares of Finisar also surged post the announcement.Further Push in ARApple is riding on its Augmented Reality (AR) initiatives. The company has bought several smaller firms with expertise in AR hardware, 3D gaming and virtual reality (VR) software. Apple also unveiled the ARKit at WWDC this year that will help third-party developers to work on creating AR experiences for the iOS platform.On the last earnings call, Cook mentioned, “we believe AR is going to change the way we use technology forever.”Per analyst Gene Munster as quoted by Bloomberg, “This investment shows the company is doubling down on AR again, and locks down the VCSEL market, which will make it tough for other smartphone players to compete in AR.""The limited supply of VCSEL is a major headwind for smartphone makers. The analysts believe that the funding will ensure smooth supply of the technology for Apple while creating a bottleneck for other players in the market like Samsung and Huawei, thereby giving Apple a competitive edge in this regard.According to market research firm IDC’s August report, quoted by Business Insider, total spending on AR/VR is expected to soar from $11.4 billion in 2017 to nearly $215 billion 2021 at a CAGR of 113.2%. This provides significant growth opportunity for technology giants like Apple.Moreover, we note that Apple has been subject to intense scrutiny by Donald Trump regarding the “manufacturing” issue. These initiatives will help it to gain the confidence of the government, in our view.Apple Inc. Price Apple Inc. Price | Apple Inc.

128,GLW,"Corning Incorporated (GLW  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has agreed to take over 3M Company’s (MMM  -  Free Report) Communication Markets Division completely in an all-cash deal for approximately $900 million. The acquisition is expected to be completed during 2018, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.Headquartered in Austin, TX, 3M’s Communication Markets Division provides optical fiber products and high bandwidth connectivity solutions for the telecommunications industry. The company has annual worldwide sales of approximately $400 million.This strategic move is in line with Corning's plan to invest $1-$3 billion in acquisitions. Moreover, the company expects the deal to add 7-9 cents to 2019 earnings.Post the deal, 3M’s unit will be a part of Corning`s Optical Communications segment. The acquisition will result in adding around 500 3M’s employees to Corning.This acquisition will strengthen Corning’s Optical Communications worldwide market access. We believe that 3M’s high bandwidth and optical fiber products combined with Corning’s global optical passive components and solutions will enable the latter to expand its broad portfolio of high-bandwidth optical solutions. This in turn will enhance customer experience resulting in additional revenues for Corning.Considering growth witnessed by the Optical Communications market in the last few years, this deal will boost Corning’s revenues and increase overall market share. In the recently reported third-quarter 2017 results, Optical Communications segment generated 35.3% of total revenues. Reported segment revenues increased 15.3% year over year and 4% on a sequential basis to $917 million on the back of strong demand for both enterprise and carrier products.Share Price Momentum to ContinueCorning has outperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. While the industry gained 21.4%, the stock returned 37.1%.Last WordCorning is a worldwide provider of connectivity solutions. The company has been supplementing its portfolio with various acquisitions.We believe that growing demand for Corning’s fiber optics products, as reflected by the Verizon Communications Inc (VZ  -  Free Report) deal, which was signed in April.  Moreover, strong demand for Gorilla Glass 5 (GG5) is a key catalyst.These along with strategic acquisitions like SpiderCloud, Gerresheimer’s Pharmaceutical Glass Tubing Business, Alliance Fiber Optic Products and STRAN Technologies will aid the stock sustain its momentum in the rest of 2017.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderCurrently, Corning carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the technology sector is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

129,GLW,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Corning Incorporated (GLW  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Corning Incorporated has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.2, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.6. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Corning Incorporated’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 15.1 over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 22.7. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Corning Incorporated’s forward PE is roughly same as its trailing twelve months value, so we might say that the forward earnings estimates are incorporated in the company’s share price as of now. We define forward PE as current price relative to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Corning Incorporated has a P/S ratio of about 3.2. This is almost in line with the S&P 500 average. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this stand slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Corning Incorporated currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Corning Incorporated a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) for Corning Incorporated is 10.1, a level that is lower than the industry average of 13.1. Clearly, GLW is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Corning Incorporated might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of f and a Momentum Score of b. This gives GLW a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of D. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past thirty days compared to one downward revision, while the full year estimate has seen five upward and no downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 4.1% in the past month, while the full year estimate has inched higher by 1.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Corning Incorporated Price and Consensus  Corning Incorporated Price and Consensus | Corning Incorporated QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineCorning Incorporated is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Despite having a Zacks Rank #3, the stock belongs to an industry which is ranked among the Top 32%, which indicates that broader factors are favorable for the company. Over the past two years, the industry’s performance has surpassed the broader market, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius. Click for details >>

130,GLW,"Highlighted stocks include Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report), Conn's, Inc. (CONN  -  Free Report), GameStop Corp. (GME  -  Free Report) and Corning Incorporated (GLW  -  Free Report).
"
131,GLW,"Profit forecasts for electronics retailers are rising in a significant manner. During just the past 2 weeks, more than 40% of all earnings estimates for Retail-Consumer Electronics have been revised upwards - a very bullish sign.
"
132,GLW,"The biggest beneficiary of the optimism has been Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report).
"
133,GLW,"A couple of weeks ago, BBY shocked analysts with better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $1.61 per share. Though same-store sales were down, the dollar amount of the average purchase rose. More importantly, gross margins widened by 90 basis points.
"
134,GLW,"BBY also provided upbeat guidance. The company expects fiscal 2010 profits to total between $2.50 and $2.90 per share; the consensus had called for earnings of $2.36 per share.
"
135,GLW,"Nearly all of the covering analysts adjusted their projections to be inline with BBY's guidance. The consensus estimate is now at $2.77 per share.
"
136,GLW,"It's not just Best Buy that is responsible for the overall improvement in the industry group's outlook, however.
"
137,GLW,"Competitor Conn's, Inc. (CONN  -  Free Report) also beat estimates and said that gross margins improved. Video game retailer GameStop Corp. (GME  -  Free Report) generated same-store sales growth of 9.6%. Both companies provided an upbeat outlook.
"
138,GLW,"Without a doubt, the demise of Circuit City is helping all 3 companies.
"
139,GLW,"Another trend helping BBY and CONN is that consumers are still buying LCD TVs. Some of this might be attributable to the digital conversion, though declining prices and aging analog sets are also playing a role.
"
140,GLW,"Corning Incorporated (GLW  -  Free Report) recently said that it has been ""experiencing increasing glass orders."" As a result, the company is now guiding for first-quarter glass volume of flat to down 5%, versus previous guidance for a 20% to 25% drop. (GLW is a major manufacturer of glass for flat panel displays.)
"
141,GLW,"Finally, tough economic conditions are causing more consumers to stay at home then go out. A DVD or a video game can cost less than taking a family of four out for a night. This trend favors companies like BBY, CONN and GME.
"
142,GLW,"Finally, as I discussed last month, retail earnings in general have not been as bad as feared. This has led to multiple positive revisions across the retail sector.
"
143,GLW,"CONN is a Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy"") stock. BBY and GME are Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stocks. All 3 are classified in Retail-Consumer Electronics. GLW is a Zacks #2 Rank stock classified in Fiber Optics.

145,GLW,"There are a few exchange-traded funds that focus on retailers. SPDR S&P Retail (XRT  -  Free Report) provides good overall coverage of the sector. Furthermore, Best Buy is the fund's fourth-largest holding, though no single position accounts for more than 2.5% of XRT's portfolio.

"
149,GLW,"The lack of fear in the markets continues to be puzzling.
"
150,GLW,"Take Thursday for instance. Former St. Louis Fed President William Poole told Bloomberg that Fannie Mae (FNM) and Freddie Mac (FRE) were """"insolvent"". Rising retail sales at Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) were offset by lower spending at J.C. Penny (JCP  -  Free Report), Limited (LTD) and Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report).  Oil rebounded back above $141.
"
151,GLW,"So what did stocks do? Close higher on strong volume.
"
152,GLW,"It could well be that investors were trying to pick a bottom before earnings season heats up next week. Remember April? Stocks rallied in spite of bad news from the financial sector. Possibly some traders are hoping for a repeat.
"
153,GLW,"As much as I want to be optimistic and call for a market rebound, I have to be pragmatic.
"
154,GLW,"Excluding energy and financials, negative revisions to full-year earnings estimates are outnumbering positive revisions by a ratio of 1.2:1. This could change in the next few weeks, if guidance is good, but we'll need more than good numbers from Alcoa (AA) and flat earnings from General Electric (GE  -  Free Report).
"
155,GLW,"The housing slump appears likely to get worse. The Fed wants to tighten regulations on mortgages. (A step that is long overdue.) Meanwhile, Freddie and Fannie are in trouble (though the Fed might help). Combined, these two events suggest that mortgages will be harder to get. At a time when pending home sales are falling, this is not welcome news.
"
156,GLW,"Crude's bubble got bigger, and now it's hurricane season. Bertha didn't do much, fortunately, but it's just July.
"
157,GLW,"Consumers are tightening their wallets. With gas averaging $4.10 a gallon and the job market tight, who could blame them? $1200 does not go very far when you're driving a SUV.
"
158,GLW,"Despite all of this, the VIX has been at historically tame levels and gold remains far below its recent highs. These are signs of complacency. (Both rose notably on Friday, however.)
"
159,GLW,"Adding to the befuddlement is the indiscriminate selling. Video game sales are setting records this year and GameStop's (GME  -  Free Report) valuation keeps getting compressed. EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) got knocked down even though profit forecasts have risen by 50 cents in just the past 30 days.
"
160,GLW,"Good stocks with strong fundamentals are being taken out to the woodshed. If there were signs of fear, this would make sense, but there aren't any.
"
161,GLW,"The markets can and do act in random ways. This is certainly the case right now.
"
162,GLW,"More Volatility Ahead
"
163,GLW,"Next week will bring more volatility. There will be earnings announcements from 6 Dow components, inflation data, Fed minutes, option expiration and Congressional testimony from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. In addition, about 70 financial firms will report second-quarter results.
"
164,GLW,"The light at the end of the tunnel could start appearing in about 10 days, however.
"
165,GLW,"Earnings season will shift towards energy and tech companies. Oil companies will have strong profits. If the tech companies can reaffirm full-year guidance, we could get a rebound. Unfortunately, there are concerns about IT spending weakening in the second-half of the year, so don't bet the farm yet.
"
166,GLW,"Keep Looking At Stocks
"
167,GLW,"When things get messy in the markets, the temptation for investors is to stop looking at the stocks. This is the exact opposite of what you should do. Risky environments bring opportunities.
"
168,GLW,"I learned this early in my career by analyzing oilfield companies in Houston. I heard multiple stories of investors who greatly increased their wealth by buying assets when Houston's economy went bust in the 1980s.
"
169,GLW,"Rather than shy away, they created a shopping list and looked for bargains.
"
170,GLW,"Investing in stocks is no different. This is why we are looking at potential names to add to the Focus List if prices keep dropping.
"
171,GLW,"For those of you who are nervous, consider dollar-cost averaging. Given the low cost of commissions, you can easily get your toes wet and still sleep comfortably at night.
"
172,GLW,"And if you don't feel comfortable at investing, don't. But keep looking, because when the rebound finally occurs, stocks could rise very quickly.
"
173,GLW,"Focus List Update
"
174,GLW,"The Zacks Rank for Corning (GLW  -  Free Report) fell to 4 due to a lack of agreement among analysts and a most accurate consensus estimate that was below the current estimate. Consequently, the stock was removed from the portfolio. If GLW provides good guidance and brokerage analysts raise their forecasts, we will consider adding the stock back to the portfolio.
"
175,GLW,"Kirby (KEX  -  Free Report) was removed from the portfolio because full-year forecasts were cut within the past 30 days.
"
176,GLW,"Silicon Motion (SIMO  -  Free Report) was removed from the Focus List because of unfavorable market conditions. We remain optimistic about the company's prospects, however, and will consider adding it back to the Focus List in the future.

178,GLW,"The third-quarter reporting cycle will be seeing releases from 722 companies, including 180 S&P 500 members, this week (Oct 23-27).Corning Inc (GLW  -  Free Report) and Juniper Networks Inc (JNPR  -  Free Report) are set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24.Let’s find out what these companies have to offer investors in this quarter.Corning is well known for the Gorilla Glass that has gained significant traction from increasing usage in smartphones.We expect strong demand for fiber products to primarily drive growth, which will boost Optical Communications revenues.Additionally, Gorilla Glass 5 is also anticipated to contribute significantly. We believe that a likely increase in dollar content from Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) newly launched iPhones will benefit Corning’s top-line growth in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Optical Communications and Specialty Materials (Gorilla Glass is reported under this segment) revenues are currently pegged at $878 million and $340 million, respectively.However, weakness in the Display Technologies segment is a headwind. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment is currently pegged at $752 million.Shares of Corning have returned 23.9% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 21% rally.On the other hand, Juniper is expected to disappoint investors due to sluggish sales in its cloud computing segment. The weakness is likely to hurt switching business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the Switching segment is currently pegged at $276 million.Moreover, Juniper is facing significant pricing pressure amid intense competition in the network equipment market from the likes of Arista Networks Inc, Cisco Systems Inc and others including white-box vendors. This has hurt the company’s competitive position in the router market. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the Routing segment is currently pegged at $589 million.Additionally, Juniper’s expansion into low-margin Asia-Pacific market adversely impacted customer mix. Further, growing proportion of low-margin switch business in the product mix as compared with high-margin router business is a headwind for gross margin expansion. Additionally, higher DRAM memory prices are expected to hurt gross margin in the quarter.Juniper’s shares have lost 7.9% of its value year to date compared with the 3.1% decline of its industry.Unfavorable Rank, Negative ESPWe believe both Corning and Juniper are unlikely to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the third quarter due to an unfavorable combination of Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and negative Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.We don’t recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.A Stock to ConsiderHere is a stock you may consider as our proven model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.07% and has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Texas Instruments is also scheduled to report on Oct 24.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

179,GLW,"Corning Inc (GLW  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24.Notably, the Gorilla Glass maker has a positive record of earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 10.15%. In the last quarter, Corning delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5%.We expect Corning’s results to be driven by strength in the optical communications segment, primarily due to strong demand for fiber products. Moreover, solid demand for Gorilla Glass 5, expanding footprint in the automotive market and the launch of Valor Glass are other catalysts.However, weakness in the Display segment remains a headwind, which can dent results. For third-quarter 2017, Corning expects glass volume to increase by low-single digit percentage, sequentially. The company expects sequential LCD glass price declines to be similar to the decline reported in second-quarter 2017.Shares of Corning have returned 23.9% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 19.1% rally.  Fiber Product Demand Drives Optical Communication We expect sales to benefit from strong demand for fiber products, as reflected by the Verizon Communications Inc VZ deal, which was signed in April. The company recently delivered its 1 billionth kilometer of optical fiber.Corning Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Corning Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Corning Incorporated Quote The strong fiber demand is primarily driven by the U.S.-based telecommunications service providers’ intent to overhaul networks to improve 4G LTE coverage and accelerate 5G deployments.Management anticipates Optical Communications sales to increase more than 10% from the year-ago period in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Optical Communications revenues is currently pegged at $878 million.Strong Gorilla Glass 5 Demand: Key CatalystGorilla Glass, which falls under the Specialty Materials segment, is expected to benefit from strong demand. Reportedly, Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) has used Gorilla Glass 5 in its upcoming iPhone X.Moreover, the company remains focused on expanding footprint in the automotive market driven by gas particulate filters (GPFs) and a Gorilla-sized automotive glass business.Corning expects Specialty Materials sales to increase by low-to-mid teen percentage range in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Optical Communications revenues is currently pegged at $340 million.Valor Glass Launch to Drive Sales Corning in collaboration with Pfizer and Merck launched Valor Glass, apharmaceutical glass packaging solution. The company has partnered with the likes of Stevanato Group and Gerresheimer AG to accelerate the supply of Valor Glass to the pharmaceutical package market.We believe that Valor glass is likely to gain rapid traction, which will benefit the Life Sciences business. Management projects the business to grow low-single digit percentage from the year-ago quarter.Unfavorable Rank, Negative ESPWe believe Corning is unlikely to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the third-quarter due to an unfavorable combination of Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and Earnings ESPof -6.43%.

180,GLW,"Apple Inc’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) much awaited event on Sep 12, 2017 turned out to be as expected. There was hardly any surprise element, thanks to the massive leaks just a couple of days before the event. However, Apple’s much awaited mega tenth anniversary iPhone X was widely appreciated.The New iPhone XThough the $999 price tag has been considered by many as a sales deterrent, we believe Apple is likely to see a boost in its revenues with the new iPhone. The iPhone X is completely revamped. It now boasts end-to-end curved OLED display with a facial recognition technology that unlocks the phone as well as helps to make secure payments via Apple Pay.The Face ID technology is powered by the TrueDepth camera that is equipped witha flood illuminator, infrared camera, dot projector, front camera and ambient light sensors. Machine learning enables Face ID to adjust with physical changes in facial appearance over time.Computer and Technology Sector 5YR % Return Computer and Technology Sector 5YR % ReturnIt supports wireless charging and is resistant to microscopic dust and water. It also has the A11 bionic chip. Apple added that with the new A11 bionic chip, augmented reality games and apps “reach a new level of fluidity and realism.” The Home button has been done away with. Users will just have to swipe up to access the home screen.Pre-orders begin Oct 27 and the phones will be available from Nov 3.3 Stocks in Spotlight Post Apple EventWith iPhone X launch, Apple isn’t the only company grabbing headlines. The much awaited phone like always has put the spotlight on its suppliers. However, another name that was mentioned at the event, much to everyone’s surprise, was Snap Inc. (SNAP  -  Free Report). Snap is the parent company of the popular social media platform, Snapchat.While demonstrating Face ID powered by True Depth camera, which allows Animoji to function, Apple announced that it was working with Snap to create hyper realistic filters that track one’s facial movements and help imprint the same on an emojis. Apple also spoke about its intention to strengthen augmented technology efforts in its iMessage application.Notably, Snapchat’s acquisition of Looksery helped it popularize AR through its lenses and filters. Lenses are powered by AR technology help to superimpose graphics on to the face using the phone’s front camera.Reportedly, Snapchat lenses for Animoji are advanced because these are “personalized for unique facial contours and can reflect and react to ambient light in the room.” This feature has been copied by many social media platforms. Many analysts observe that Apple’s push to take AR mainstream will help Snapchat to bring AR to Maps and other features. This is likely to increase the popularity of the social media platform and help it fend off competition from its rival, Instagram.Let’s move to the next company, Intel Corp (INTC  -  Free Report). Undoubtedly, the biggest beneficiary of the Apple-QUALCOMM fallout is Intel. Apple started to procure cellular LTE (long-term evolution) modems XMM 7480 for iPhone8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X. Last year, it had started using XMM 7360 cellular modems in addition to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X12 LTE modem for its iPhone 7 series.Now, XMM 7480 is the fourth generation LTE modem with speed of up to 600 Mbps download and 150 Mbps upload. It also supports 4x Carrier Aggregation.The latest XMM 7480 modem chips use about 15% less power than its predecessor. Apple’s contract win is a huge thing for Intel given that its modems are widely considered to be relatively “inferior” compared to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon variety. In January this year, Apple and QUALCOMM fought over royalty payments. As a result, Intel is expected to have gained the majority of modem orders with many media reports claiming the percentage to be as high as 50% of the entire baseband order. There are various claims that Apple might move completely to Intel for its modem needs for iPhones.Then there is Corning Inc. (GLW  -  Free Report). Corning has been a leading innovator in the glass substrate industry. The tough Gorilla Glass, now widely used in smartphones, was developed by Corning. Apple and Corning share solid decade old collaboration.Corning put the Gorilla Glass on the first iPhone in 2007 and has been the biggest supplier of glasses for both iPad and iPhones. Apple’s COO Jeff Williams was quoted as saying, “This partnership started 10 years ago with the very first iPhone, and today every customer that buys an iPhone or iPad anywhere in the world touches glass that was developed in America.”At its event, Apple stated that all three of the latest edition phones have an all-glass design. The glass has been made more durable by putting a steel base for proper reinforcement.One analyst observes that though Apple has talked about this “new kind of glass” but has refrained from mentioning the name. He adds that there are high chances that this could be Gorilla Glass 5. Glass 5 reportedly is an extremely toughened glass that can withstand “drops up to 1.6 meters up to 80% of the time.” Just like Apple, its supplier also remains tightlipped. But given Apple-Corning’s long partnership, it is highly unlikely that Apple made an exception for iPhone X, adds the analyst.Apple along with the other three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

202,GLW,"On Jul 10, we issued an updated research report on Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET  -  Free Report), one of the leading cloud networking solutions providers in the United States.Arista is benefiting from the expanding cloud networking market primarily driven by strong demand for scalable infrastructure, which has become a necessity to support new applications and services. Apart from delivering high capacity and availability, cloud networking promises predictable performance along with programmability that enable integration with third-party applications for network, management, automation, orchestration and network services. According to a research firm, Gartner, the company’s product portfolio with different form factors facilitates the implementation of high-performance, highly scalable and appropriate solutions for every environment.We believe that Arista is well poised to benefit from strong demand for its data center switches. Per Transparency Market Research, the data center networking market is likely to witness a CAGR of 15.5% between 2017 and 2025. At this pace, the market’s valuation is forecasted to reach $228.40 billion by the end of 2025 from $63.05 billion in 2016. Moreover, continued spending on IT infrastructure products (server, enterprise storage, and Ethernet switches) for deployment in cloud environments is a positive. The company’s switches and routers support the high-end cloud networking market that requires fast throughput at low cost. Arista is targeting a large and growing market, which was worth more than $10 billion in 2017. The robust product portfolio is aiding the company win customers on a regular basis, consequently boosting top-line growth. Notably, revenues have recorded a CAGR of 35.5% in the 2013-2017 period to reach $1.6 billion.Arista’s strategy of leveraging merchant silicon (“off the shelf”) from multiple suppliers has expanded product portfolio and increased its ability to offer products at cheaper prices. This has also helped it to focus on developing software like EOS and CloudVision. In addition, EOS’ fully programmable and highly modular architecture has been the key differentiator. We believe that new products like containerized EOS (cEOS) and DANZ Hybrid Cloud containerization will further expand its market share in 2018 and beyond.With a diligent execution of operational plans, Arista has gained 76.6% in the past year on an average compared with a rise of 0.4% for the industry.However, continued lawsuits have been a distraction for Arista. It has been forced to bring much of manufacturing in the United States, which along with redesigning of products have lead to loss of time as well as hurt its profitability.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. Some other top-ranked stocks in the industry are Corning Incorporated (GLW  -  Free Report) and SeaChange International, Inc. (SEAC  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 and Plantronics, Inc. (PLT  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

It topped estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 282.8%.Plantronics topped estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 18.7%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

203,GLW,"Harmonic Inc. (HLIT  -  Free Report) recently announced that TF1 — a major French TV channel — has selected its Ultra HD (UHD) contribution and distribution solution for broadcasting purpose. Harmonic's platform will enable TF1 to deliver live UHD coverage of popular sports events directly to French service providers.Harmonic’s UHD solution enables operators to deliver high-quality video with greater bandwidth efficiency. Notably, the company’s ViBE CP9000 HD/UHD contribution solution is deployed at the front end of the TF1 broadcast chain. This helps in the creation of pristine compressed video besides saving bandwidth capacity.Whether simplifying OTT video delivery via innovative cloud and software-as-a-service (SaaS) technologies or powering the delivery of gigabit internet cable services, Harmonic seems to be changing the way media companies and service providers monetize live and VOD content on every screen. We believe the company’s strong focus in developing innovative products and solutions for media companies and service providers along with its market diversity bodes well for future growth.Generally, operator's ability to deliver more HD services leads to an improvement in the company’s position within the marketplace and increases revenues. Harmonic looks promising on this front as well. In the past six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has gained 2.4% against the industry’s 6.3% decline.However, the company’s recent earnings streak has failed to impress investors. Harmonic has a choppy earnings surprise history with only two beats over the trailing four quarters.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (CMTL  -  Free Report), Corning Incorporated (GLW  -  Free Report) and Avnet, Inc. (AVT  -  Free Report).

But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

204,GLW,"Since the beginning of 2018, shares of Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) have recorded an uptrend buoyed by healthy growth dynamics.

The company has a global sales footprint in more than 100 countries based on its industry leading innovation and a deep portfolio of products and services.

The transaction has boosted Motorola’s command center software portfolio and its software enterprise. It has also completed the acquisition of Avigilon, in an all-cash transaction to expand its mission-critical communications technologies portfolio.The earnings outlook of the company appears solid as estimates for the current year have been revised 19.1% upward since the beginning of 2018 to $6.80 per share at present. During the same time frame, Motorola has outperformed the industry with an average return of 27.8% compared with a rise of 2.4% for the latter.With solid quarterly results and continued strength in order trajectory, management has raised the earlier guidance for 2018.

271,GLW,"U.S. telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) has decided to aggressively cooperate with major U.S. cities in order to expand its fiber optics networks to support 4G LTE and upcoming 5G wireless standards as well as wireline connections.At the recently concluded Goldman Sachs 26th Annual Communacopia Conference, Verizon’s chairman and CEO Lowell McAdam stated that the company is no longer interested in acquiring big cable MSOs (multi-service operators). Instead, it will strengthen its fiber-based networks. In the cities of Boston and Sacramento, Verizon has already started upgrading the city’s aging copper network infrastructure with fiber and wireless network to support high-end mobile and wireline services for smart city, residential and business applications.Dark fiber provides abundant bandwidth which is of utmost necessity for the smooth functioning of super-fast wireless networks such as 4G and 5G. Dark fiber based backhaul provides scalability and efficiency to bandwidth management. This will eventually help the company to significantly reduce its backhaul costs.Verizon acquired dark fiber through its acquisition of MCI in 2006. In February 2017, the company acquired XO Communications Inc.’s dark-fiber optic network. The deal was valued at $1.8 billion. Verizon will also lease XO’s LMDS (Local Multipoint Distribution Service) wireless spectrum with an option to buy them by the end of 2018. XO has a portfolio of 102 LMDS licenses in 28 GHz and 39 GHz bands.In April 2017, Verizon entered into a three-year minimum purchase agreement with Corning Inc. (GLW  -  Free Report) to buy fiber optic cables and associated hardware for its nationwide wireless broadband network. Per the deal, Verizon will acquire up to 20 million kilometers (12.4 million miles) of optical fiber each year from 2018 through 2020 from Corning, with a minimum purchase commitment of $1.05 billion.In May 2017, Verizon acquired Straight Path Communications Inc., a leading provider of fixed wireless spectrum licenses. The company agreed to pay $3.1 billion for Straight Path, significantly more than its rival AT&T Inc.’s (T  -  Free Report) offer of $1.6 billion. Importantly, Straight Path has a strong portfolio of 868 spectrum licenses in the high-frequency 28 GHz and 39 GHz bands, which are included in the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) designation for the next generation of wireless broadband services.Meanwhile, in August 2017, Verizon stated that it would spend $225 million to acquire a high-capacity fiber network in the Chicago area belonging to WideOpenWest Inc. (WOW  -  Free Report). Verizon has been leasing this fiber network, which provides connectivity to more than 1,000 cell sites of different scales.Accumulation of dark fiber will bolster Verizon’s cell network density consequently boosting its mobile backhaul network. The densification of cell network will help the company install and build its upcoming 5G network. Adoption of small cells has increased due to the inconvenience of installing large towers in inaccessible areas.Verizon stated that small cells will be used to augment its existing 4G LTE and upcoming 5G network and will primarily concentrate on high traffic locations like a business district or a shopping mall. The company anticipated these to increase voice capacity and data speeds and to complement current 4G LTE infrastructure. The networks will require fiber-optic connections to local hubs, which link to ""long haul"" Internet infrastructure.Price Performance of VerizonVerizon’s shares have increased 2.77%, outperforming the industry’s decline of 1.46% in the last three months. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Shares have lost about 5.5% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsCorning reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $0.42 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.02. Earnings surged 13.5% on a year-over-year basis and 7.7% sequentially in the reported quarter.The year-over-year growth was driven by improvement in revenues.

Reported revenues were up 2.8% from the year-ago quarter and 5.2% sequentially to $221 million.Operating DetailsAdjusted gross margin contracted 70 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter but expanded 10 bps from the previous quarter to 42.4%.Adjusted selling, general & administrative expenses (SG&A), as a percentage of revenues, decreased 20 bps from the year-ago quarter and 50 bps from the previous quarter to 13.8%.Moreover, research & development expenses (R&D), as a percentage of revenues, increased 20 bps on a year-over-year basis but decreased 10 bps sequentially.Operating margin (excluding amortization of purchased intangibles and restructuring, impairment & other charges) contracted 60 bps on a year-over-year basis and 90 bps from the previous quarter to 20.5%.GuidanceFor the third-quarter 2017, Corning expects glass volume to increase by low-single digit percentage sequentially. The company expects sequential LCD glass price declines to be similar to the sequential decline reported in the second-quarter 2017.Optical Communications sales are anticipated to increase more than 10% from the year-ago period in the third quarter.Environmental Technologies sales are expected to increase by low single-digit percentage, while Specialty Materials sales are anticipated to increase by low-to-mid teen percentage range. The Life Sciences business will grow low-single digit percentage from the year-ago quarter.For full-year 2017, Corning still expects mid-single digit percentage growth in glass volume, in line with the overall LCD glass market. Price is now anticipated to decline approximately 10% or lower.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Analysts were quiet during the last one month period as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions.Corning Incorporated Price and Consensus  Corning Incorporated Price and Consensus | Corning Incorporated QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, Corning's stock has a subpar Growth Score of D, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with an F.

273,GLW,"U.S. telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) has decided to acquire and install dark fiber based network throughout its footprint.

Nevertheless, the company has a very powerful diversified business model. On the wireless front, it will start initial deployment of the upcoming 5G network in 2018. Meanwhile, it is aggressively expanding its fiber-based footprint on the wireline front. In the digital media front, Verizon has become a major contender for the lucrative online advertisement business.

287,GLW,"Total Net Income GrowthEarly results bad absolutely, but better than expected based on 70 early reports

291,GLW,"Staples expected to lead with small increase, followed by small declines in Health Care and Utilities
"
292,GLW,"Materials and Energy expected to see massive year over year declines
"
293,GLW,"Earnings are coming in much better than expected in the early going. While in this report we have not tracked revenues, there seems to be a general pattern where the source of the positive surprises is coming from much better than expected margins (both operating and net) rather than from better than expected revenue growth.
"
294,GLW,"In other words companies are succeeding in cost cutting their way, if not to prosperity, then at least much better than feared results. While at the individual company level, this is almost always a positive, it is not necessarily so at the macro level. Cutting costs by reducing head count means that there are fewer jobs and less overall demand in the economy.
"
295,GLW,"Still given the weak state of the economy, I suspect most investors will not be too picky about the source of the earnings improvements. The one exception to this might be in the financials where the earnings quality is weak due to FASB caving to political pressure and doing away with mark-to-market accounting. On the other hand, I have not seen any situations of massive mark-to-market of the liabilities but not the assets, like we saw in the first quarter.
"
296,GLW,"The total earnings reported so far of the 70 firms that had reported by the Jul 20 close were $29.5 billion, a decline of 14.7% from the $34.6 billion those same 70 firms reported a year ago. There are only 2 sectors where the actual results that are in are worse than the remaining firms are expected to show, Staples and Industrials.
"
297,GLW,"There are 2 ways of looking at this. The pessimist would say that the good news is getting out of the way early and that results will start to deteriorate. The optimist would say that there is a trend towards better than expected earnings. I lean towards the second explanation. Still, actual earnings growth has been a pretty rare commodity with only 23 of the 70 reporting firms actually posting higher net income than a year ago. I would note that it is still a pretty thin sample and that some sectors have many more reports in than others.

He called me, and he said they are going forward.”Throughout his campaign, Trump has opposed Apple’s decision to manufacture goods overseas and even promised that he will urge the company to bring manufacturing jobs back to the country.Trump was quoted speaking to The New York Times in Nov 2016, ""One of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.""Ever since the Trump administration took over the White House, there have been numerous developments as far as Apple’s domestic manufacturing is concerned.

370,GLW,"Corning Incorporated (GLW  -  Free Report) recently announced that its manufacturing facility in Kaiserslautern, Germany has produced its millionth Corning DuraTrap GC gasoline particulate filter (GPF) for automotive emissions control, marking an important milestone for its Environmental Technologies business. The engineering of these ceramic particulate filters was initiated to help automobile manufacturers meet the Euro 6d emissions standard and capture the growing European market demand for emission controlled automobiles.What is Euro 6d Emissions Standard?Euro emissions standards are set to maintain a certain permisible limit of toxic automobile emissions. Euro 6d is one of the many types of standards, which will be implemented for petrol and diesel automobiles by September this year. These standards aim to significantly reduce fine particulate emissions from gasoline-direct-injection engine vehicles under new real-driving emissions testing. These regulations created high demand for emission control technology, which gave Corning the opportunity to design the Corning DuraTrap GC GPF and supply them to automakers in Europe.Corning DuraTrap GC GPF: The Nitty-GrittyThe filters, specially designed for gasoline engines, have a cordierite-based ceramic microstructure that clears fine particles efficiently while maintaining engine performance. These filters enable high washcoat loading at a superior pressure drop for excellent catalytic performance to address tighter standards for gas emissions as well.Taking Advantage of Regulation Driven DemandCorning’s Kaiserslautern facility, which has been producing diesel particulate filters since 2011, began its mission to increase the production capacity of the DuraTrap filters toward the end of 2016 with an investment of $100 million, part of which was used to increase production in the company’s manufacturing facility in China as well. The strategic step was taken in anticipation of higher demand of products due to the growing need for automakers to abide by new pollution standards. This investment was a huge step forward for the company and made it the most trusted filter supplier to assist automobile manufacturers produce their cleanest gasoline engines and comply with the regulations.Price PerformanceEven though in the past six months the stock has underperformed the industry’s 5% decline with an average loss of 14.2%, the increasing demand for Corning’s products in the automobile market is expected to boost its revenues in future. Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderCorning currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other top-ranked stocks in the space include Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR  -  Free Report) and Cypress Semiconductor Corporation (CY  -  Free Report) sporting Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Marvell Technology Group Ltd.

382,GLW,"Corning Inc (GLW  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr24. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 6.39%.In fourth-quarter 2017, earnings of 49 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents. Core revenues increased 7% year over year to $2.74 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.63 billion.For the first quarter 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share and revenues are projected to be 30 cents and $2.51 billion, respectively.We believe strength in the company’s Optical Communications, Environmental Technologies and Specialty Materials business lines to drive top-line growth.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderCorning’s results are likely to benefit from its optical communications segment, primarily owing to strong demand for fiber products. The company’s initiative to strengthen the segment is evident from the announced acquisition of 3M’s communication (MMM  -  Free Report) market division which will not only expand worldwide market access but also enhance its product portfolio.Management remains positive about TV screen size growth and ramping production of BOEs Gen 10.5 in Hefei.Moreover, robust adoption of Gorilla Glass 5 bodes well for its specialty materialssegment. The trending glass backs on devices and smart watches leveraging Gorilla Glass for its cover material is a tailwind.Additionally, the company’s focus on expanding its footprint in the automotive market driven by gas particulate filters (“GPFs”) and a Gorilla-sized automotive glass business is a positive.Furthermore, Corning collaborated with AU Optronics Corporation (“AUO”) to launch a solar panel project in Taiwan to provide sufficient electricity to address the power needs of roughly 300 U.S. households a year. The rooftop solar power equipment installed at Corning’s two manufacturing facilities will help the company reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by more than 2,375 metric tons per year.However, weakness in the Display segment remains a headwind. Management anticipates LCD glass market to grow low-single digits on account of seasonality.What Does Our Model SayAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

383,GLW,"Investors in Corning Incorporated (GLW  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Mar 23rd, 2018, $26.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Corning shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Corning is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Communication - Components industry that ranks in the Bottom 20% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, none of the analysts has increased the earnings estimate for the current quarter, while four have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 37 cents per shareto 30 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Corning right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

"
451,GLW,"At the end of the second quarter, GLW had $3.2 billion in cash and short-term investments, versus $2.9 billion at the end of the first quarter.

454,GLW,"Corning Inc (GLW  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on July 26. Notably, the Gorilla Glass (GG) maker has a positive record of earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 12.81%.In the last quarter, Corning delivered a positive earnings surprise of 13.64%. Earnings of 39 cents per share surged 39.3% on a year-over-year basis but declined 22% sequentially in the reported quarter.Adjusted revenues increased 14.5% year over year to $2.49 billion, which comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 billion. However, revenues declined 2.6% on a sequential basis.Corning’s second-quarter 2017 guidance is fairly good. Management expects year-over-year growth in revenues and earnings per share (EPS). Glass volume is expected to increase by mid-single digit percentage on a year-over-year basis and low-single digit percentage sequentially. The company expects sequential LCD glass price declines to be substantially less than first-quarter 2017. Corning Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Corning Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Corning Incorporated QuoteIn the quarter under review, Optical Communications sales are anticipated to increase 10% from the year-ago period. Further, Environmental Technologies sales are expected to be in line with the year-ago quarter, while Specialty Materials sales are anticipated to increase by a high-teen percentage range. The Life Sciences business will grow low-single digit percentage from the prior-year quarter.Factors at PlayCorning’s shares have outperformed the S&P 500 index on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 10.7%, the stock increased 31.3%. The outperformance reflects consistent execution and strong demand for the company’s optical communications as well as Gorilla Glass products.We believe that strength in the optical communications segment is a key catalyst. Segment sales are expected to grow more rapidly owing to strong demand for fiber products, both from the North American network providers and hyperscale data centers.The Verizon deal reflects the strength in fiber demand, as U.S.-based service providers overhaul networks to improve 4G coverage and accelerate 5G deployments.Moreover, the company remains focused on expanding its footprint in the automotive market driven by gas particulate filters (GPFs) and a Gorilla-sized automotive glass business. In fact, Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) decision to invest $200 million in Corning – to create better products – validates the company’s position as a prime manufacturer of glass products for smartphones.Further, aggressive share buyback in accordance with the strategy & capital allocation framework will also boost bottom-line growth.However, weakness in the Display segment remains a headwind, which can dent results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Corning will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Corning’s Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 40 cents.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Corning has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank #1.

455,GLW,"Corning Inc. (GLW  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has completed the acquisition of scalable small cell systems provider SpiderCloud Wireless. The company will be integrated into Corning’s Optical Solutions business.However, the terms of the deal were not disclosed. According to a recent article by RCR Wireless News, SpiderCloud was worth approximately $200–$250 million or 2.0-2.5 times of 12-month forward revenues.Small cells are effective in supplementing macro networks to provide superior coverage and capacity indoors as well as outdoors. SpiderCloud’s Enterprise Radio Access Network (E-RAN) system uses high capacity enterprise small cells (Radio Nodes) and small cell controller (Services Nodes) to provide reliable coverage as well as massive capacity in indoor environments.Notably, telecom operators like Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report) and Vodafone (VOD  -  Free Report) recognize E-RAN’s expertise in delivering high indoor capacity. SpiderCloud notes that a dual-carrier LTE system with just 24 radio nodes can offer more than 2.5 Gbps of throughput, enough to stream 500 HD video streams. An E-RAN system with 100 radio nodes can do four times as much.We note that the addition of SpiderCloud will help Corning to offer indoor cellular solutions. The expansion of the company’s product portfolio will help it to rapidly penetrate the wireless network equipment market going forward.Share Price Momentum to ContinueCorning has outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 12.1%, the stock returned 32.2% over the same time frame.We believe that growing demand for Corning’s fiber optics products, as evident from the recent deal with Verizon, is a major positive. Moreover, strong demand for Gorilla Glass 5 (GG5) is a key catalyst.These along with strategic acquisitions like SpiderCloud, Gerresheimer’s Pharmaceutical Glass Tubing Business, Alliance Fiber Optic Products and STRAN Technologies will help the stock continue its momentum in the rest of 2017.Corning Incorporated Revenue (TTM) Corning Incorporated Revenue (TTM) | Corning Incorporated QuoteCorning now anticipates sales to grow from $3 billion in 2016 to $5 billion in 2020 through product innovation as well as acquisitions.

458,GLW,"Corning Inc (GLW  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Nov 30.Notably, the Gorilla Glass maker has a positive record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 8.7%. In the last quarter, Corning delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.9%.We expect Corning’s results to be driven by strength in the optical communications segment, primarily owing to strong demand for fiber products. Moreover, solid demand for Gorilla Glass 5, expanding footprint in the automotive market and acquisition of 3M’s communication market division are other catalysts.Corning reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 43 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. Earnings increased 2.4%, year over year and sequentially.Growth was driven by improvement in revenues. Core revenues increased 6% year over year to $2.70 billion, which comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.58 billion. Revenues increased 4.2% on a sequential basis.The results reflect strength in the company’s Optical Communications and Specialty Materials business lines.Corning’s shares have returned 7.7% over the past year, outperforming the industry’s 6.3% rally.Expect What?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 47 cent, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 6%. Notably, the earnings estimate has moved north over the last 30 days. Further, Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.63 billion, up roughly 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Acquisitions and Product Adoptions: Key CatalystsCorning recently announced that it has agreed to take over 3M Company’s (MMM  -  Free Report) Communication Markets Division completely in an all-cash deal for approximately $900 million. Acquisition of 3M’s communication market division will not only strengthen the company’s Optical Communications worldwide market access but also expand Corning’s product portfolio. Moreover, it expects the deal to add 7-9 cents to 2019 earnings.Considering growth witnessed by the Optical Communications market in the last few years, this deal will boost Corning’s revenues and increase overall market share.Further, Ford’s use of Corning Gorilla Glass for its Ford GT is aiding the company to successfully penetrate the 6 billion-square-foot auto glazing market. Corning has also announced a joint venture with Saint-Gobain Sekurit to manufacture, develop and sell lightweight automotive glazing solutions. This venture has allowed the company to move forward in the value chain beyond glass to manufacture and sell glazing solutions with a leading producer.We expect sales to benefit from strong demand for fiber products, as reflected by the Verizon Communications Inc (VZ) deal, which was signed in April.Moreover, the company remains focused on expanding footprint in the automotive market driven by gas particulate filters (GPFs) and a Gorilla-sized automotive glass business.Optical Communications sales are anticipated to increase high-single digit percentage on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter.Environmental Technologies sales are projected to increase by low-teens percentage, while Specialty Materials sales are anticipated to increase by low-to-mid teens percentage range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Environmental Technologies and Specialty Materials are currently pegged at $275 million and $389 million, respectively.The Life Sciences business will grow mid-single digit percentage from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Life Sciences revenues is currently pegged at $217 million.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.

459,GLW,"Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) will pump in $350 billion into the U.S. economy over the next five years, which includes $55 billion for 2018. The iPhone-maker recently announced that it will directly contribute $75 billion in capital expenditures related to manufacturing and tax payment on repatriation of overseas profits.Apple expects to pay roughly $38 million as repatriation tax (highest by any company) under the new tax law.Per Bloomberg, Apple will also award Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) worth $2,500 as bonuses to global employees in the coming months.Apple’s Move In-line With President’s GoalApple’s latest announcement is in line with President Trump’s goal of increasing investment in the country’s manufacturing sector. The company has been subject to criticism from Donald Trump for not creating enough manufacturing jobs in the United States and focusing on other nations.Apple now expects to spend $30 billion in capital expenditure in the country over the next five years. The investment is likely to create 20K jobs. The company employs 84K people in all 50 states.Moreover, the company plans to build a new campus in a different location that will initially house technical support for customers. The campus will be fully powered by green energy. Apple Inc. Price and Consensus  Apple Inc. Price and Consensus | Apple Inc. Quote Apple’s decision to increase investments in the United States was lauded by President Trump through a recent tweet, as reported by MarketWatch.Advanced Manufacturing Fund Size IncreasedApple also announced that it is widening the size of the Advanced Manufacturing Fund from $1 billion to $5 billion. The fund was established to support innovation among U.S. manufacturers. The company used the fund to support projects from the likes of Gorilla-Glass maker Corning (GLW  -  Free Report) and Finisar (FNSR  -  Free Report).Apple invested $200 million in Corning to help create better products. Notably, Gorilla Glass, a staple in every smartphone nowadays, was an outcome of the Apple-Corning collaboration.Moreover, Apple awarded $390 million to Finisar for the production of advanced semiconductor lasers used in iPhone X's True Depth facial recognition camera. The award is also anticipated to create over 500 high skill jobs at Finisar’s newly-acquired factory located in Sherman, TX.
