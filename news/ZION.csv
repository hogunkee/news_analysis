2,ZION,"Stocks diverged sharply Wednesday, with small caps and the Dow Jones industrial average closing higher while the Nasdaq composite and much of the technology sector was routed.XThe Nasdaq tumbled 1.3%, its largest one-day loss since Aug. 17, as investors took profits on the technology winners that have fueled much of the year's market gains. Semiconductor, data storage, software, internet and networking industry groups slid 3% to 7% and were among the 20 worst-performing industry groups.The S&P 500 was off a fraction and the Dow closed 0.4% higher as both made new highs in the session. Volume increased across the board, according to early figures. Losers equaled winners on the NYSE. Despite the Nasdaq's losses, winners led by 3-to-2, indicating that the selling was concentrated on select industries.IShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX), an ETF that tracks the Philadelphia semiconductor index, skidded 4.4% and was one of the most heavily traded shares Wednesday.Dents were visible in some technology leaders, including the FANG stocks. Facebook (FB) lost 4% in big volume, but managed to hold near the 50-day moving average. A modest gain from its 175.59 buy point is now nearly entirely gone. Amazon.com (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) not only stumbled but also had the highest volume since their big upside moves at the start of this month or late October.Nvidia (NVDA), another stock with far more volume than usual, plunged 7% and has undone about six weeks of gains. Nvidia now needs to show it can rebound from the 50-day line.The tech-sector rout overshadowed a fine day for retail, finance and other sectors, where there were dozens of breakouts.Department stores, auto parts chains, office supply stores and supermarkets were the four best-performing industry groups in today's market.

5,ZION,"Bank of America (BAC),  JPMorgan Chase (JPM), PNC Financial Services (PNC), Suntrust Banks (STI) and Zions Bancorp (ZION) all topped buy points Wednesday, at least intraday, as the Trump-backed GOP tax plan boosted Treasury yields and the stock market generally. Several other big banks are close to entries, while Citigroup (C) continued to rise after breaking out earlier this month.XThe tax reform would slash the corporate rate to 20% from 35%, while reducing personal income tax rates. Banks would benefit from the lower tax rates directly, as well as from stronger economic growth and the resulting impact on Federal Reserve and market interest rates.The continued courting of buy points by bank stocks comes a week after they neared buy zones following the Fed's still-bullish for raising interest rates and its decision to slim down its massive portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Market expectations of a Fed rate hike in December have risen significantly over the past two weeks, rising to 81% on Wednesday from 72% on Tuesday and just 38% a month ago.JPMorgan Chase rose rose 1.6% to 95.18 in the stock market today, closing just below a 95.32 flat-base buy point after moving to 95.72 intraday.Bank of America advanced 2.4% to 25.41, just below a 25.45 buy point with a shallow base. BofA hit 25.64 intraday.Meanwhile, three regional or superregional banks did close above buy points.PNC Financial Services (PNC) climbed 1.4% to 134.32, moving back above a 133.36 buy point of a flat base. SunTrust (STI) cleared a 59.10 entry, closing up 2% at 59.27. Zions, which serves several states in the West and Southwest, climbed 1.6% to 46.59, just topping a 46.56 buy point.Citigroup popped 1.9% to 72.28, near the high end of the 5% chase zone from a 69.96 flat base.Morgan Stanley (MS), up 1.3% to 48.07, is in a shallow base with a 49 buy point.Wells Fargo (WFC) rose 0.8% to 54.21. Wells Fargo is still reeling from the fake-account scandal and is trying to move back to its 200-day moving average.The 10-year Treasury yield, which can influence the rates on various types of loans, was up to 2.30% on Wednesday. The 2-year Treasury yield was up to 1.47%.Longer-term rates tend to rise when investors expect higher inflation in the future and demand a bigger return to offset a weakening dollar over that time.

6,ZION,"The Dow Jones industrial average ran ahead of the stock market again Wednesday, as Boeing (BA) gave the industrials a market-leading gain.The Dow was up 0.4% and climbed to a record high. The average was the only major index that had not made a record high already this week. Dow component Boeing gapped up more than 8% to an all-time high after the aerospace and defense giant reported quarterly results and gave a bullish outlook.XThe S&P 500 rose a fraction and the Nasdaq 0.1% as both reached record highs as well. Volume was tracking higher on the Nasdaq and lower on the NYSE compared with the same time Tuesday. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 off by 0.2%.Energy stocks were one of the day's leaders as U.S. crude prices jumped 1.5% to $48.61 a barrel, the highest in nearly eight weeks. The Energy Department reported today that U.S. crude inventories fell sharply last week.Chip stocks also drew some institutional interest, accounting for some of the gains in higher-than-normal volume.Broadcom (AVGO) moved just past the 256.88 buy point of a flat base. The price increase seemed limp and volume was well below normal — two characteristics that dampened an otherwise bullish move. Lam Research (LRCX) is trying to break out past a 167.15 buy point.In the software sector, Electronic Arts (EA) climbed above the 116.14 buy point of a flat base. Afternoon volume was about one-fourth higher than normal, not quite as much as you normally find with successful breakouts. BofA/Merrill Lynch upgraded the video game publisher to buy from neutral and hiked the price target to 131 from 125. EA reports earnings after Thursday's close.Zions Bancorp (ZION) broke out of a cup-with-handle base.

Domino's Pizza (DPZ) fell 2.5%, adding to yesterday's 10% plunge following quarterly results. Bloomin' Brands (BLMN) plunged 8%, undercutting a base it had been forming. Operating earnings of 28 cents a share met expectations, while sales fell 4% to $1.03 billion for the parent of Outback Steakhouse.Beleaguered Chipotle (CMG) was down 1% and still around the lowest share price since April 2013.RELATED:Boeing On Track For Best Day In 8 Years On Huge Cash Gains, Profit OutlookOil Rises For Third Day As U.S. Stockpiles Tumble, Production Falls2 Defense Giants Boost Views After Strong Earnings

7,ZION,"Stocks closed higher Wednesday in a session marked by dramatic reactions to quarterly results and in which Boeing (BA) posted its strongest single-day performance in at least a decade.The Dow Jones industrial average strode ahead 0.5% to end at a fresh high. The Nasdaq fought to a 0.2% gain, and the S&P 500 — haltered by heavy losses from Akamai Technologies (AKAM) and Universal Health Services (UHS) — managed a narrowly positive finish. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 also made new highs before paring gains.Some of the day's most dramatic moves came from big caps, not just Boeing, but Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and AT&T (T). Akamai, United Health and Triumph Group (TGI) were on the casualties list.The Nasdaq briefly took a new high before trimming gains. The Dow took and held new high ground above 21,681. Small caps slipped out of their recent strong performance, with the Russell 2000 dropping nearly 0.6% after climbing 0.9% to a new high on Tuesday. The Russell remained positive for the week, up 0.6% and working on its sixth straight weekly advance.The Federal Open Market Committee voted to hold interest rates steady, and offered no signal that it had modified its stance toward an additional rate hike later this year, after increases in March and in June. The Fed also said it plans to begin reducing its $4.5 trillion in bond debt ""relatively soon,"" a process many analyst had not expected to begin until sometime in 2018.The major indexes had come off their highs well before the FOMC release, and mildly trended further lower after the 2 p.m. ET announcement. Gold Miners, appliance manufacturers and video game developers were the day's top-scoring industry groups. All stocks flying highest and lowest during the session moved in response to quarterly results.Boeing led both the Dow and the S&P 500, powering up 9% in massive trade. The stock was already extended from its most recent buy point, and Wednesday's move sent shares more than 25% above that entry.Leading chipmaker AMD pared its gain back to close 5% higher, after gapping up 11% at the open. It reported second-quarter earnings of 2 cents a share from a year-ago loss and a 19% jump in revenue, which topped expectations. The strong-volume move left shares in buy range above a 14.77 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Security brand Brink's (BCO) locked up a 14% gain for the day, easily taking out a new high on stronger-than-expected second-quarter results and a boost in full-year guidance. Silicon Laboratories (SLAB) spiked 11% and U.S. Steel (X) rumbled ahead  7%.Among IBD 50 stocks, China-based education stocks once again set the pace. TAL Education (TAL) jumped more than 3% ahead of its earnings report Thursday after the close. New Oriental Education (EDU) also gained 3% in above-average trade, following through after Wednesday's upside reversal. New Oriental is in buy range after breaking out past an 82.72 cup-with-handle buy point.In addition to AMD, breakout names included Zion's Bancorp (ZION), Broadcom (AVGO) and Electronic Arts (EA).RELATED:Boeing On Track For Best Day In 8 Years On Huge Cash Gains, Profit OutlookOil Rises For Third Day As U.S. Stockpiles Tumble, Production Falls2 Defense Giants Boost Views After Strong Earnings

8,ZION,"Stocks opened slightly higher early Wednesday as investors prepare for the Federal Reserve's 2 p.m. ET policy announcement. It is widely expected that the Fed will raise interest rates by a quarter-point. Retail sales came in surprisingly weak, falling 0.3% in May vs. an expected 0.1% rise. The Nasdaq led the way early with a 0.1% advance, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average both traded right around their break-even marks.Among the Dow industrials, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Travelers Cos.

"
9,ZION,"President Trump's hint this month of a breakup of big Wall Street banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) hit their stocks hard — for maybe 30 minutes. Then the stocks recovered and finished higher for the day.Little wonder. Financial deregulation looks like it's one of the few Trumponomics planks that investors can count on. Despite all the headlines, chaining off commercial banks from investment banking is probably a nonstarter now in Congress. But Trump has the will — and the political wherewithal — to bust up heavy regulations clamped on banks after the financial crisis.Capital requirements, stress-test thresholds, fee limits and trading curbs are some of the weights that Trump likely will lighten. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also likely will lose much of its budget and authority. These changes could boost bank profits, shareholder returns and M&A activity, as well as boost lending to businesses and consumers that accelerates economic growth.Hope for such deregulation is the reason shares of JPMorgan, BofA, Wells Fargo and other banks large and small shot higher after Donald Trump's election.The stakes are huge: The excess capital that banks hold to comply with stress tests is estimated at well over $100 billion. They could return much of that money to shareholders via buybacks and dividends with the right reforms, such as reducing how many banks face Federal Reserve stress tests. If capital requirements are cut, excess capital could rise as high as $218 billion, Goldman Sachs analysts say.Regional banks also seek regulatory relief. Current rules imposed in the last eight years may discourage them from expanding beyond $10 billion in assets, where they'd face an additional regulator in the CFPB, more compliance and training requirements, and stress tests. Even small community banks face significant burdens, and they appear to have Trump's ear. Complaints include new mortgage-disclosure rules, caps on fees and heightened loan standards.Many local banks say they face unnecessary limits on whom they lend to and the products they offer. Their concerns are reflected in the declining number of banks. Only a few banks have been created since the financial crisis, suggesting that compliance costs and other red tape are too high and stifling new competition.""If I were the CEO of a small or community bank, an asset manager or an insurance company, I would be ecstatic"" over prospects for deregulation, said Douglas Elliott, a partner in Oliver Wyman's financial services consulting practice. ""There's virtually no downside.""For the largest banks, the regulatory outlook is ""more mixed,"" amid some high-level GOP support for Glass-Steagall and raising capital standards, but ""still overall a positive,"" Elliott said.Aligning oneself with big banks is still politically risky. The Republican Party platform molded by the populist Trump campaign endorsed reviving Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that split commercial and investment banking until its repeal in the late 1990s.But Trump's support for the idea was never strong or clear.In a Bloomberg News interview on May 1, Trump was asked if he wanted to break up the big banks. He made no commitment. Some people ""want to go back to the old system, right?"" he said. ""So we're going to look at that.""Those are hardly fighting words. And the reality is that even a tough fight would have a slim chance of winning in Congress, says KBW Washington analyst Brian Gardner. He figures Republicans opposed to Glass-Steagall would demand big concessions, such as killing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Democrats would reject that.By contrast, Trump clearly is serious about rolling back some Dodd-Frank provisions. The law is ""going to be very, very seriously changed so the banks can go back to loaning money,"" he told Bloomberg. Speaking to community bankers that same day, he blasted the law as being ""out of control,"" and ""not only for community banks — for banks, period.""Trump's diagnosis sounds a lot like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon's. In an April letter to shareholders, Dimon argued that big U.S. banks should be freed from post-crisis capital requirements that exceed Basel international rules. That would unlock $15 billion of equity capital at JPMorgan and support nearly $190 billion of loans, he wrote.Eliminating the capital surcharge for the eight biggest U.S. banks could boost earnings by 4.6%, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods have estimated.Part of the bank rally after Trump's surprise election was relief that more onerous regulations wouldn't come into being. Not only has the Federal Reserve's regulatory regime been fairly strict for the eight globally systemically important banks, constraining their dividends and buybacks, but it was set to get even tougher if Hillary Clinton had become president, notes Elliott.On tap was ""a significant increase in capital requirements"" for megabanks under a policy outlined in September by Daniel Tarullo, who headed the Fed's committee on bank supervision and regulation. Tarullo turned in his resignation in February in the wake of Trump's victory.""People are policy,"" said RBC Capital banking analyst Gerard Cassidy, and Trump's election is bringing ""an incredible amount of turnover.""Trump's people, Cassidy told IBD, are likely to be ""pro-bank people, pro-business people, which would inevitably lead to more sound, common-sensical"" regulations. ""We do expect to see more returns of excess capital this year and next year, even if the legislation is not changed,"" he said.A House panel on Thursday voted on party lines for legislation that would roll back much of Dodd-Frank. The legislation could clear the full House, but the Senate would be a much higher hurdle.Policy analysts see two legislative ideas with enough support to get to Trump's desk. Elliott expects Republicans to ax the CFPB's budget. Supporters say the CFPB is a long-needed watchdog, citing September's $100 million fine on Wells Fargo for employees illegally opening 2 million deposit and credit-card accounts for unknowing customers. But its crackdown on payday lending has reduced access to small, short-term loans, while its 1,659-page rules on prepaid debit cards could choke off a popular product.As the CFPB shrinks and loses authority in the Trump era, ""restrictions on banking fees will slacken for all banks, which should help boost earnings,"" Oppenheimer Funds portfolio manager Benjamin Ram and research analyst Christopher Mashia wrote in a March analysis.Meanwhile, solid bipartisan support exists for raising the asset threshold by which banks become subject to the Fed's annual stress test, Elliott says. The level could rise from $50 billion to ""between $150 billion and $500 billion,"" he says.In his outgoing speech April 4, Tarullo agreed that the $50 billion threshold was ""set too low,"" adding that Dodd-Frank's risk-based capital requirements are ""unduly complicated"" for small banks.While Tarullo is gone, his endorsement could help pave the way for freeing community banks from Dodd-Frank's additional safety and soundness provisions for ensuring that their risk controls and financial conditions are adequate. There also is broad support for raising the $10 billion asset floor that triggers additional compliance and oversight, including a requirement for banks to conduct their own stress tests.Many superregional banks would be happy to do their own stress tests. In the Fed's stress tests, the agency provides little transparency about how it determines whether capital is sufficient, spurring banks to be ultraconservative in setting dividends to avoid surprises. No bank wants to be in the position of Zions Bancorp (ZION), when it was the only one to fail the Fed's stress test in 2014.Raising the Fed stress-test asset threshold likely would spark consolidation, creating cost-saving opportunities without triggering a special regulatory headache.If Congress raised the Fed stress-test threshold to $250 billion, 21 more financial institutions would be exempt. They include KeyCorp (KEY), American Express (AXP), BB&T (BBT) and SunTrust Banks (STI). Some 13 banks would still face strict scrutiny, with a few superregionals such PNC Financial (PNC) and US Bancorp (USB) still grouped with the globally systemically important banking giants.Prospects for regulatory relief and higher net-interest margins helped vault superregional and regional banks to the top of IBD's 197 industry-group rankings after the election. They held five of the top 10 positions in mid-February. The money-center bank group, including seven of the eight ""systemically important"" U.S. banks, got as high as No. 15. Since then, most bank stocks have fallen below their 50-day moving averages as interest rates have fallen and doubts have grown about Trumponomics, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending.The big question facing Trump's financial regulators will be whether the pendulum has swung too far toward safety and soundness at the expense of access to credit and economic growth.Under the Fed's stress test, which assumes a severe recession comparable to the crisis that began in 2007, systemically important banks are seen losing a combined $195 billion. But that's less than 10% of their capital of $2.2 trillion.""It's clear that banks can use more of their capital to finance the economy without sacrificing safety and soundness,"" Dimon wrote. ""Had they been less afraid of potential CCAR stress losses (the Fed's capital review process), banks probably would have been more aggressive in making some small business loans, lower rated middle market loans and near-prime mortgages.""Dimon says JPMorgan has turned away $200 billion in deposits from large clients because of new rules requiring that ""capital in many cases must be held on these short-term, virtually riskless activities.""While the biggest banks may not get regulatory relief as quickly as smaller banks, KBW estimates that the giants' earnings could rise 13.5% if ultrasafe assets such as Treasuries and deposits at the Fed are excluded from the leverage ratio, or capital as a percentage of assets.Tarullo's final speech also targeted Dodd-Frank's much-criticized Volcker Rule aimed at barring banks from trading for their own accounts, while still allowing them to act as market makers. He called the rule ""too complicated."" He said it was affecting market making, ""particularly for some less liquid issues.""An outright legislative Volcker Rule repeal could lift big-bank earnings by 4.2%, Goldman has estimated. The chances of that appear negligible, though Trump regulators likely will try to ease compliance.RELATED:Markets Are 'Too Negative' On Trump Tax-Cut Odds: GoldmanBreakout Watch: Top Financial Stock Jumps Back Into Buy ZoneMorgan Stanley Beats Estimates As Fixed-Income Revenue DoublesGoldman Sacked: Wall Street Giant Blames Politics For Trading Woes

Dow component Home Depot (HD) cleared resistance around 150 and is rising from support at the 50-day moving average. Home improvement rival Lowe's (LOW) topped an 84.10 entry, but the stock dipped below it and volume was light.The small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 1.4%. Although U.S. stocks gains were solid, they didn't match the fervor of European indexes. The London FTSE 100 rallied 2.1%, the German DAX 3.4% and the Paris CAC 40 4.1% as investors applauded the French election results, which left a pro-EU candidate in good shape to win the presidency. The iShares MSCI Eurozone (EZY) ETF jumped 4.7% to the highest level since August 2015.On the main exchanges, volume was tracking higher on the Nasdaq and lower on the NYSE.  Winners led losers by 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq and better than 13-to-5 on the NYSE.Banking, travel and some cyclical industry groups led the market. Regional banks, whose shine had been fading for weeks, were among the better-performing stocks in today's market. Western Alliance (WAL), Zions Bancorp (ZION) and Citizens Financial Group (CFG) were up in heavy trading and back to the 50-day line or getting closer to it as they rebound.But it was the technology sector that stood out in terms of chart action, as several names broke out past buy points.Dell Technologies (DVMT) leapt past the 65.88 buy point in more than double its usual volume as shares rose 2.5% to 66.02.

Shares soared 4% to 53.78. The maker of semiconductor technologies for optical, wireless and satellite networks tried to breakout out initially last week, but got turned back. Earnings are due Tuesday after the close.Synopsys (SNPS) broke out past the 73.18 buy point of a flat base. Shares rose 1% to 73.63.

Indexes opened higher and continued building gains.Volume was tracking lower, which is common in the hours before a big event such as a Fed announcement. Winning stocks led losers by 11-to-3 on the NYSE and by 12-to-5 on the Nasdaq.The central bank is widely expected to raise the fed funds rate by a quarter point to a target range of 0.75% to 1%. With the economy improving, Wall Street is looking for any signs that the Fed may go beyond the three rate hikes it has indicated for this year.Steel stocks led the market, part of a broad advance in metals. U.S. Steel (X) rose 1.6% as it makes a move back above the 50-day moving average. But shares remain below the 39.24 buy point of the Feb. 13 breakout.Energy stocks bounced back as the price of crude climbed nearly 2% at midday. U.S. crude stockpiles fell unexpectedly. Also, the International Energy Agency said OPEC's production agreement needs more time to work and should result in a production shortfall.But the retail sector, which shined Tuesday, was one of the weakest in today's stock market. Drug stores, department stores, discount chains and apparel stores were in the bottom part of the day's industry performance. Even the internet retail group, which ranks higher than other retail groups at N0. 96, was off slightly. Wal-Mart (WMT), off 0.7%, was the weakest Dow industrials component. The IBD 50 was up modestly. Many of its components are finding support at the 50-day moving average. Curiously, most of those are regional banks. Western Alliance (WAL), Boston Private (BPFH), Zions (ZION) and Texas Capital (TCBI) are rising from pullbacks to the 50-day line.The industry has benefited from rising interest rates, and the confirmation of another increase today would only strengthen that investment thesis for banks.CenterState Banks (CSFL) edged past the 26.40 buy point of a flat base. Volume was about 30% above average, less than perfect for a breakout. The Florida-based bank has a top EPS Rating after posting profit gains of 39% to 50% the past four quarters. Biotech Cytokinetics (CYTK) broke out above the 13.55 buy point of an odd cup-shaped base. Volume was tracking more than twice its average. The small cap has had periods of volatile trading. It turned a profit in 2016, but analysts expect a loss this year of $2.25 a share.IBD 50 member Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) was inching above the 91.86 buy point of a flat base.RELATED:U.S. Oil Inventory Falls After IEA Urges Markets To 'Hold Their Nerve'Inside The IBD 50: Why Banks, Financial Plays Still MatterStock Market Today: Should You Sell These 7 Stocks In The Dow Jones Industrial Average?

17,ZION,"The postelection stock market euphoria got a slight damper at the end of November as mutual fund investors realized global economies were still facing a lot of uncertainties, which could spur further volatility.The S&P 500 soared to its high of 2213.35 on Nov. 25. It then gave back a small portion of its gains to end the month up 3.4%. Friday's positive job-market report helped equities tick back up as unemployment came in at a surprise 4.6%, the lowest level in nine years. With that, a Fed rate hike in December is nearly a certainty.U.S. diversified equity mutual funds on average surged 5.19% in November, bringing their yearly return to 9.1%, according to Lipper Inc. By far, the winners were small-cap value funds, scoring an impressive 12.19% and boosting their 2016 gains to 22.47%. Their growth counterparts also did well, jumping 7.91% for a yearly gain of 9.18%.  Large-cap value funds rose 6.25%, while their growth counterparts only scored 0.72%.

Taxable fixed-income funds shed 1.68% on average, while municipal bond funds fell 3.37%.""Everything that we're analyzing — including taxes, trade, fiscal spending, deficits, interest rates, monetary policy, the dollar — all of these are very fluid situations,"" said Brian Flanagan, senior equity portfolio manager at Thrivent Asset Management and lead manager of the Thrivent Mid-Cap Stock Fund Class A (AASCX).Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance On top of these, there were a number of conflicts present around the world before the election, he pointed out. Events such as Brexit, as well as the French and German elections, could rattle the markets even further. Just recently, European Central Bank's Mario Draghi warned of the risks to innovation, competition and productivity in the U.K. and to a lesser extend in Europe if the U.K. were to adopt a protectionist stance in the areas of trade, migration and foreign direct investment.That said, Bill Nygren — partner and portfolio manager at Harris Associates and manager of the Oakmark Select Fund (OAKLX), Oakmark Fund (OAKMX) and Oakmark Global Select Fund (OAKWX) — believes that equities represent the most attractive asset class: ""P/Es are very slightly higher than historical averages, but when you compare that to other choices like cash, that's yielding almost zero, or long-term bonds that are yielding only a couple percent, that small premium to historical averages seems like a good deal for equities relative to bonds or cash.""Nygren warns against loading up on high-dividend-paying names in the equity market that have been used as a substitute for low yields in fixed income. Those include the relatively stable businesses such as utilities, telecom and consumer packaged goods. He points out that these companies ""typically haven't traded at a premium to the market multiple and multiples on these stocks today are quite high. So . . . the business models that have a little more volatility, like the financial service companies, that have very low valuations relative to their historical valuations, are not only more attractive, but potentially safer investments than the overpriced low-risk businesses.""A name he likes in his $15 billion Oakmark Fund is Ally Financial (ALLY), one of the largest auto financing companies. He likes the fact that Ally is highly profitable, meets its capital requirements, and is expected to aggressively buy back shares. ""Like the other financials, one of the reasons Ally is priced cheaply is investors overweight the memory of the financial collapse in 2007-08.""Despite Oakmark Fund's value tilt, Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) is its largest holding besides the financials. Not only does he expect Google to grow faster than an average company in the S&P 500, but Nygren believes you get YouTube, AI and autonomous driving businesses nearly for free.OAKMX is up 16.57% year to date through Dec. 1, comfortably outpacing the S&P 500 by over 7% and ranking first among 1,369 of its Morningstar peers.Thrivent's Flanagan finds that regional banks provide a lot of value. The $1.5 billion Thrivent Mid-Cap fund holds financial names such as Zions Bancorp (ZION), First Republic Bank (FRC), Raymond James Financial (RJF) and KeyCorp (KEY). Their stocks have all made strong runs higher this year.The fund's largest holding is NVIDIA (NVDA). ""Their core market was gaming, which continues to do incredibly well. And they've created a common platform across a number of industries where they can use their graphic-processing units to accelerate development,"" said Thrivent's Flanagan. Those markets include autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and data centers.The stock slipped from new highs in the past week amid a broad chip pullback.Thrivent Mid-Cap Stock Fund has surged 24.76% in 2016, impressively ahead of gains by its peers and the S&P 500 of 9.41 and 12.13%, respectively. The fund's average three- and five-year returns are also solid, at 13.09% and 16.25%.Jeremy Javidi, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments and co-manager of $612 million Columbia Small-Cap Value Fund I (CSMIX), has an overweight in financial services, accounting for more than 33% of the fund's assets.""We're very positively inclined to insurance stocks. They benefit as interest rates rise,"" said Javidi. He purchased American Equity Investment Life (AEL) in April. The stock had sold off in an overreaction to the unveiling of the Department of Labor fiduciary rule. ""Our longtime horizon has allowed us to pull the trigger fast when we saw the market misinterpret what the future outlook would be for a stock like AEL,"" he said.He also bought UMB Financial (UMBF) in December 2015 at $47. ""A little-known fact is they're actually the sixth-largest HSA depository in the country. Those HSA deposits have grown 40% each of the last three years,"" Javidi said.He believes utilities and REITs are no longer attractive. Instead, he looks at dividend growth rather than dividend yield. Other sectors he's constructive on are health care and energy. His microcap value fund is up 27.55% year to date.Craig Hodges, CEO and CIO at Hodges Capital and manager of $356 million Hodges Fund (HDPMX), picks industries and companies that have high barriers of entry, such as cement, steel, corrugated paper and even airlines. The midcap stock fund holds names such as United States Steel (X), U.S. Concrete (USCR), Matador Resources (MTDR), American Airlines (AAL), Adidas (ADDYY) and Duluth Holdings (DLTH).

23,ZION,"Why did Alice Marie Johnson, a first-time nonviolent drug offender, get a life sentence?She and her husband divorced in 1989. The next year, she lost her job as a FedEx manager, followed by bankruptcy and home foreclosure in 1991. The following year, the mother of five lost her youngest child in a tragic motorcycle accident.She says the emotional and financial pressure caused her to make the ""biggest mistake of (her) life."" By her own admission, she ""became what is called a telephone mule ... passing messages between the distributors and sellers ... in a drug conspiracy."" She and 15 others were arrested in 1993 for drug trafficking and money laundering.While many of her co-defendants were given reduced or dropped charges for cooperating with prosecutors, Johnson was convicted for cocaine conspiracy and money laundering in 1996, and sentenced to mandatory life in prison without parole, plus an additional 25 years.In the '80s and '90s, many black leaders supported tough anti-drug laws. Facing an inner-city explosion of gang activity, violent crime and a crack epidemic, black politicians pressured Congress to pass these laws.The Rev. George McMurray was pastor of Harlem's Mother A.M.E. Zion Church in the '70s, a time when New York City faced a major heroin epidemic. He favored life sentences for convicted drug dealers. ""When you send a few men to prison for life, someone's going to pass the word down, 'It's not too good over here,'"" McMurray said. ""So instead of robbery and selling dope, (they'll think) 'I want to go to school and live a good life.'""When President Ronald Reagan signed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 into law — the law that punished crack cocaine dealers far more harshly than powder cocaine dealers — Harlem's Rep. Charlie Rangel stood right behind Reagan. Crack dealers, many of whom were black, got harsher sentences than those who dealt powder cocaine, many of whom were white. And Congressional Black Caucus members pushed Reagan to create the Office of National Drug Control Policy.Then came the massive 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which included longer sentences for first-time offenders. An influential group of black pastors wrote to the Congressional Black Caucus, ""While we do not agree with every provision in the crime bill, we do believe and emphatically support the bill's goal to save our communities, and most importantly, our children.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe black mayor of Baltimore, Kurt Schmoke, said: ""I believe the crime bill ... is part of the answer, and the crime bill should be supported by us. We do need to send a signal throughout our communities that certain types of activities will not be tolerated, that people will be held accountable and that if there is evil manifested by actions taken by individuals who choose to prey upon our residents that that evil will be responded to quickly and correctly.""The majority of the Congressional Black Caucus supported Congress' final bill. President Bill Clinton signed it. Hillary Clinton defended the crime bill a couple years later, saying that these laws were necessary to combat ""superpredators"" — a comment that came back to haunt her during the 2016 presidential campaign.But after black crack dealers received longer sentences than whites who dealt powder, the 1986 law became ""racist."" The CBC later asked President Bill Clinton to fix the disparity. His sentencing commission also advised him to narrow the disparity. Clinton, who wanted to appear ""tough on drugs,"" refused.So when Clinton signed his own tough anti-drug law in 1995, it preserved the crack-powder disparity. The Los Angeles Times wrote: ""One week after President Clinton decried the 'disproportionate percentage' of young black men going to prison, he has decided to sign into law a bill that would maintain stiff prison sentences for those caught with small amounts of crack cocaine.""President Donald Trump challenged the kneeling NFL players to give him names of those who have been ""unfairly treated"" by our criminal justice system. He promised to set up a process to review their cases and either pardon them or commute their sentences.It's a heck of an offer and should be a no-brainer. Given Colin Kaepernick and other NFL players' assertions of institutional/systemic/structural racism, Trump should soon be deluged with names of worthy candidates. If, as alleged, cops bust blacks for reasons of ""racial profiling"" and if, as alleged, blacks are wrongfully convicted and sentenced, how can the NFL players turn down Trump's offer?But to assert that black convicts like Alice Johnson are victims of a ""racist"" criminal justice system ignores the role played by black members of Congress to pass the very laws later denounced as racist.Other columns by Larry ElderMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

26,ZION,"Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and other financials are pulling back on the stock market today. But is the bank rally over? A quick look at their charts show that financial stocks are doing just fine, holding onto the vast majority of last week's huge advances.Consolidating gains is natural and healthy. Most of the banking stocks are well extended, but sideways action could present new buy opportunities down the road.Bank of America fell 2% to 19.75. Baird downgraded BofA and a few other financials Tuesday, BofA's second analyst cut of the week.""We think the bank rally post-election has largely discounted potential benefits from rising interest rates, lower tax rates, and more aggressive capital return. We believe investors should book gains and wait for more evidence that the structural improvement in macro trends and regulations will materialize,"" said Baird analyst David George in a report.But Wednesday's loss follows a fractional gain Tuesday and a 15% spike last week. Bank of America had already cleared a 16.34 buy point ahead of the election, as rising long-term bond yields and rising odds of a Federal Reserve rate hike buoyed bank stocks. Donald Trump's election win and the prospect of growth-and-inflation-boosting tax-and-infrastructure plans just hit turbo on the sector's solid advance.Shares are at their highest level since the 2008 financial crisis.Check out the weekly chart:RELATED:Bank Of America Downgraded AgainIBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks aren't the only Trump rally group to pause.

Wells Fargo shares tumbled in September on news of a fraudulent accounts scandal, so the bank didn't break out like its peers. But it could consolidate at current levels, perhaps form a handle, and present a potential buy point.Here's Wells' weekly chart:Goldman Sachs pulled back 2.3% to 206.26, snapping a seven-day winning streak.

27,ZION,"Get Jonathan Corr talking about his job, and it doesn't take long before he starts mentioning body counts. Corr isn't a cop or in the military. Nor is he referring to victims of terrorism or advocating for gun control. But his interest is tied to a subject that also inspires headlines — the after-effects of the housing crisis.
"
28,ZION,"For him, it's about how quality controls and new financial regulations have caused lenders' costs for completing a home loan to more than double since 2009, to around $7,000 per loan.
"
29,ZION,"""They've thrown bodies at the problem,"" Corr said.
"
30,ZION,"Corr is chief executive of Ellie Mae (ELLI), a software company that helps wean lenders away from, as he puts it, ""throwing just bodies and additional labor costs at the problem."" In his words, he helps lenders ""embrace technology and automation.""
"
31,ZION,"Based near Silicon Valley in Pleasanton, Calif., Ellie Mae sells lenders business-automation software to help streamline and automate the mortgage loan process, facilitate regulatory compliance and reduce errors in documents.
"
32,ZION,"Regulations Help
"
33,ZION,"Thanks in part to increasing regulations that have come out since the financial crisis, starting with the Dodd-Frank Act and the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, demand for Ellie Mae's software has grown. Over the last five years, revenue has climbed 42% on an annual compounded rate, while per-share profit has jumped 54%.
"
34,ZION,"When Ellie Mae reported third-quarter results last week, the company said revenue surged 61% over the same period in 2014 to $68.9 million. The company ended the quarter with 135,000 active users on its core Encompass mortgage-management platform, a 30% rise from the same period in 2014. Meanwhile, earnings climbed 67% to 45 cents a share, blasting through analyst estimates.
"
35,ZION,"That sent shares up more than 3% the next trading day, on Oct. 29, to close at 75.60. But the stock fell more than 3% on Friday and 9% on Monday, as investors took profits, perhaps signaling second-thought concerns about the firm's weak earnings guidance for the fourth quarter. The stock, however, has stabilized around 67.
"
36,ZION,"In its earnings report, Ellie Mae said it expects Q4 earnings to fall to 18 cents to 20 cents a share from last year's 38 cents a share. It blamed an accounting impact from a pending acquisition, increased investments and normal seasonality.
"
37,ZION,"The acquisition, of St. Louis-based Mortgage Returns, was announced earlier in October for an undisclosed sum. Mortgage Returns' customer relationship management and marketing automation solutions for the mortgage industry will be integrated into Ellie Mae's Encompass platform.
"
38,ZION,"Analysts don't seem too concerned about the weak Q4 guidance. After the earnings report, JMP Securities' Patrick Walravens maintained a ""market outperform"" on Ellie Mae and raised the price target to $83 from $80.

39,ZION,"Tailwinds
"
40,ZION,"""They are selling into two strong secular tailwinds,"" said Brian Schwartz, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. ""The first is that lenders are in the midst of re-envisioning and modernizing their front-office applications with software-as-a-service (SaaS) products.""
"

Corr isn't a cop or in the military. Nor is he referring to victims of terrorism or advocating for gun control. But his interest is tied to a subject that also inspires headlines — the after-effects of the housing crisis.For him, it's about how quality controls and new financial regulations have caused lenders' costs for completing a home loan to more than double since 2009, to around $7,000 per loan.""They've thrown bodies at the problem,"" Corr said.Corr is chief executive of Ellie Mae (ELLI), a software company that helps wean lenders away from, as he puts it, ""throwing just bodies and additional labor costs at the problem."" In his words, he helps lenders ""embrace technology and automation.""Based near Silicon Valley in Pleasanton, Calif., Ellie Mae sells lenders business-automation software to help streamline and automate the mortgage loan process, facilitate regulatory compliance and reduce errors in documents.Regulations HelpThanks in part to increasing regulations that have come out since the financial crisis, starting with the Dodd-Frank Act and the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, demand for Ellie Mae's software has grown. Over the last five years, revenue has climbed 42% on an annual compounded rate, while per-share profit has jumped 54%.When Ellie Mae reported third-quarter results last week, the company said revenue surged 61% over the same period in 2014 to $68.9 million. The company ended the quarter with 135,000 active users on its core Encompass mortgage-management platform, a 30% rise from the same period in 2014. Meanwhile, earnings climbed 67% to 45 cents a share, blasting through analyst estimates.That sent shares up more than 3% the next trading day, on Oct. 29, to close at 75.60. But the stock fell more than 3% on Friday and 9% on Monday, as investors took profits, perhaps signaling second-thought concerns about the firm's weak earnings guidance for the fourth quarter. The stock, however, has stabilized around 67.In its earnings report, Ellie Mae said it expects Q4 earnings to fall to 18 cents to 20 cents a share from last year's 38 cents a share. It blamed an accounting impact from a pending acquisition, increased investments and normal seasonality.The acquisition, of St. Louis-based Mortgage Returns, was announced earlier in October for an undisclosed sum. Mortgage Returns' customer relationship management and marketing automation solutions for the mortgage industry will be integrated into Ellie Mae's Encompass platform.Analysts don't seem too concerned about the weak Q4 guidance. After the earnings report, JMP Securities' Patrick Walravens maintained a ""market outperform"" on Ellie Mae and raised the price target to $83 from $80.Tailwinds""They are selling into two strong secular tailwinds,"" said Brian Schwartz, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. ""The first is that lenders are in the midst of re-envisioning and modernizing their front-office applications with software-as-a-service (SaaS) products.""The other tailwind, he says, comes from more regulatory pressures. They often prompt lenders to invest in new technology.But some regulatory changes can stall adoption rates as lenders come to grips with them.

62,ZION,"Shares of Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are sliding Thursday on continued interest rates concerns. The 10-year Treasury yield edged down while spread between that long-term rate and the 2-year yield remains narrow.Even as the Treasury yield recently hit a four-year high of 3.02%, most bank stocks didn't rally because short-term yields continued to gradually close the gap. A narrower yield spread weighs on net interest margins for banks, and the Treasury yield curve is now at its flattest levels since the period just before the Great Recession.On Thursday, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 2.95%, but off intraday lows. The 2-year yield edged down to 2.48%.As expected, the Fed did not unveil any new rate hikes on Wednesday, which was not enough to lift stocks for long.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Gregory Woodhams, senior vice president and co-chief investment officer of American  Century's global growth equity, and Joe Reiland, vice president and portfolio manager, took over the fund's management as of Feb. 16. Before that, Michael Orndorff and Marcus Scott comanaged the fund for the past nine and six years, respectively.American Century All Cap Growth strives to invest in companies that show continuous accelerating earnings growth and a strong price momentum. While it can invest in companies of all sizes, over 70% of its holdings fall into the large-cap category, 25% comprise midcap stocks, with the remaining allocation in small caps. It primarily invests in U.S. stocks, but had a less-than-5% allocation to foreign equities as of Dec. 31.Last year, the fund benefited from the risk-on rally that began shortly after Donald Trump won the election in November 2016. Growth stocks were lifted on expectations of President Trump's stimulus package for individuals and businesses, a solid earnings season and overall economic strength.Stock selection played a large role in the fund's performance in 2017, as much on the positive as the negative side. Its top-10 holdings represent 37% of the fund and include names such as Alphabet, IBD Leaderboard member Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), Mastercard (MA) and FedEx (FDX). These stocks soared between 33% and 53% last year.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersAmong the fund's largest sectors are technology at 30% of the portfolio, consumer cyclical 17%, health care 15% and financials 12%. With technology being the top performing sector, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple's positions have each grown to represent 7%, 5% and 4.4% of the fund.LogMeIn (LOGM) is a midcap internet service company that provides a cloud-based platform for online meetings, customer support, remote access and password security. Its earnings and revenue skyrocketed between 94% and 216% the past four quarters. Earnings per share jumped 110% last year and analysts estimate a 29% increase this year. The maker of GoToMeeting, OpenVoice and join.me also recently announced it will acquire cloud-based phone system provider Jive Communications and Unified Communications. Shares of LogMeIn advanced 20% last year. The stock is 13% off its Feb. 15 all-time high, having sliced through its 50-day moving average after the company reported 94% gain in earnings that beat expectations, but was light on revenue.Within the software space, creative design program maker Adobe Systems (ADBE) and customer relationship management firm Salesforce.com (CRM) also did well, each jumping 70.2% and 49.3% last year, and 15.3% and 12% year to date. Adobe, which successfully transitioned to cloud-based recurring subscription services recently announced that its longtime CFO Mark Garrett will be retiring. The maker of Photoshop and Acrobat plans to grow its e-commerce business. It's also on IBD's Leaderboard.Among banks, which are expected to benefit from rising interest rates, the fund holds Zions Bancorp (ZION) and SVB Financial (SIVB)). The holding company for Zion Bank, which operates via 436 branches in 11 Western and Southwestern states reported double-digit earnings growth in the past six quarters. Its stock is up 8% so far in 2018 after advancing 19% last year.The holding company for Silicon Valley Bank SVB Financial reported accelerating earnings and sales growth in the last five quarters. In the most recent quarter, earnings per share rose 53% on revenue growth of 32%. The stock rose 36% in 2017 and 5% this year.Among key detractors to American Century All Cap's performance in 2017 were biotech stocks such as Shire (SHPG), where despite reporting good results, ""investor concerns over competitive threats to the company's hemophilia franchise weighed on the shares,"" notes the latest fund annual report. Shire's stock fell 6.3% last year.Natural gas producer Range Resources (RRC) also was a drag on performance due to unfavorable weather conditions and gas prices. The stock declined over 50% last year and has continued its slide this year.RELATED:What's Will Danoff Into These Days?What's The Stock Market Doing Now?

76,ZION,"Ok...so what happened last night? All that hype about the China macro data kept everyone on edge over the weekend...what would they report? Would it be a disaster? What would that say about the health of the Chinese economy and then by default the global economy? In the end - it was NOT a blockbuster, in fact it was rather boring really....
"
77,ZION,"At 10:00 pm est - China released a bunch of data - and it was mixed.....no disasters but no upside surprises either.........3rd Qtr GDP came in above expectations at 6.9% (exp was for 6.8%), Industrial Production did rise 5.7%, but that was below the exp of 6%. Fixed Asset Investments (FAI) - a key reading - came in at 10.3% - below the expectation of 10.8% and Retail Sales - that beat at 10.9% vs. the exp of 10.8%... So what does it all mean? Well - to start with - the data implies that the world is not ending and that the Chinese economy appears to be stabilizing - which in the end is a positive.
"
78,ZION,"Angus Nicholson - Market Analyst at IG sums it up like this:
"
79,ZION,"""It's hard to be overly optimistic about the headline number, especially given the range of other data released today. Nonetheless, markets have clearly been buoyed by the better than expected headline number, and it shows that China's economy has not deteriorated as much as some had thought""
"
80,ZION,"James Laurenceson - Deputy Director of the Australia-China Relations Institute added that:
"
81,ZION,"""The data show a rebalancing away from growth driven by investment and secondary sector production towards consumption and the services sector. It's time we accept that Chinese growth isn't solely at the mercy of industrial production and fixed asset investment""
"
82,ZION,"So maybe, just maybe this is the 'new normal' for China. Maybe the world will see a China growing at a 6 handle and that's ok. Analysts are already looking out to the 4th qtr and suspect that by year end China will achieve annual growth of 6.8% -7% on continued fiscal and monetary support.
"
83,ZION,"Global markets are not panicking with on these reports. In fact - there appears to be a little bit of 'risk on' as the investors/traders are relieved that the data was NOT as bad as analysts had prepared us for. Asian markets essentially ended flat. Japan - the worst performer - ended the day -0.88%, Hong Kong + 0.04%, China + 0.14% and ASX +0.03%.
"
84,ZION,"European markets are also higher - discounting the China data and refocusing on earnings. FTSE flat, CAC 40 +0.32%, DAX + 0.86%, EUROSTOXX + 0.53%, SPAIN flat, and ITALY + 0.61%.
"
85,ZION,"France's Danone Group up 2.5% beat estimates, Germany's Deutsche Bank +3.1%, announces a big management shakeup and restructuring plan - heads to roll and that is helping to send other financials higher. German retailer Metro - announces a rise in sales and is talking all bullish about the coming Christmas season sending this stock up by 3.7%. Air France- KLM announces job CUTS in 2016 and investors love it - sending that stock higher.... and not to be left in the dark - Italian carmaker Ferrari is getting ready to price its IPO tomorrow and will start trading on the NYSE on Thursday.
"
86,ZION,"This morning US futures are off 1 pt.....Now prior to the China report - US futures were pointing lower on the expectation that we were gonna get hit hard....and when that did not happen - Futures moved to the plus side and are now flat. I suspect that the market will test resistance at 2040 and then back off trying to find support in the 2025 range - if not, then definitely the 1980 range.
"
87,ZION,"As much as there is plenty of US macro data this week - the focus will now return to US corp earnings. This week and next week will see hundreds of reports for investors to chew on. Earnings to include: HAS, MS, HAL, GPC, IBM, ZION, AXP, BA, KO, MCD, MSFT, and PG to name just a few.
"
88,ZION,"NOTE: Fed's Lacker is due to speak today at 12 pm.
"
89,ZION,"Up til now - earnings have been, well, not so good. Not horrible, but not great. 70% are beating the estimates while only 48% of those are beating on top line revenue growth. Despite the economic weakness and a bunch of downgrades - stocks have not done so badly.....with the DOW, S&P and Nasdaq all closing close to 2 month highs.... All of these indexes have now pierced their down trending 50 dma's and are now challenging their intermediate term resistance - or 100 dma's. Now here we may hit some trouble - but I think that is just a matter of time....unless earnings completely implode - then I suspect that we will test resistance one or two more times before 'breaking out' and challenging the longer term resistance levels defined by their 200 dma's. And as is usual - as we move thru the 4th qtr - FOMO (fear of missing out) will help to lift stocks going into year end.
"
90,ZION,"Now on the other hand - small caps are lagging...... The most recent lows for small caps came early October and it was much lower than the August 24th sell-off lows. The most recent highs were just two weeks ago and those highs were lower than the highs set in mid-September. - suggesting that a bearish downtrend (lower lows and lower highs) remains intact from a small cap perspective. And why would this be so?
"
91,ZION,"Well - it is earnings season, and it is more common for the large cap/mid cap companies to be able to borrow money to buy back shares which will serve to 'doll up"" their earnings per share. (Small cap companies are not nearly as active buying back stock to create the illusion of better earnings and so you have the disconnect.) Or it could be that small caps are more risky and at a time of global nervousness - investors may want the security of large cap, liquid, dividend paying names....It's just a thought.....
"
92,ZION,"The fact that small caps continue to lag might suggest that the selling pressure is not over yet....but until we get thru earnings season the divergence will continue. Then it will be Thanksgiving, and the debt debacle in DC, and then the FED December decision.... so there is plenty ahead to keep investors on their toes the question is: Does the market have enough strength to support another ""Santa Clause"" rally into the end of the year?

103,ZION,"Bank stocks have been rallying amid an improving economy and the expectation of higher interest rates, but will the rally continue when second-quarter results start filtering in during July?Financial services specialist Keefe, Bruyette & Woods expects a ""challenging"" second quarter for the big money-center banks amid margin pressures and lower-than-expected trading revenue.As for large regional banks: KBW notes that Wall Street analysts expect residential-mortgage and credit-card balances to rebound in the second quarter, helping to drive commercial and consumer loan growth.Still, KBW analysts expect continued net interest margin compression in the sector.In its second-quarter preview of bank stocks, Deutsche Bank research analysts see ""less upside in the near term,"" given that the big money-center bank stocks have ""rallied nicely"" since last July.So what are their top bank-stock picks?Deutsche Bank's top names among the biggest bank stocks are JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC).The former's net interest margin ""may positively surprise,"" Deutsche Bank said, and JPMorgan Chase might also have lower expenses and a decent return on capital.Cost cuts will also likely impact Bank of America positively, the analysts noted. Their ""buy"" rating also reflects ""large leverage to higher interest rates"" and reduced concerns over capital levels.Among the large regional banks, both Deutsche Bank and KBW give high ratings to Atlanta-based SunTrust Banks (STI) as it continues to better manage expenses and its balance sheet.KBW cites SunTrust, Northern Trust (NTRS) and Zions Bancorp (ZION) as the three big regional banks likely to beat Wall Street earnings estimates in Q2.IBD also rates Northern Trust highly, with a Composite Rating of 87 out of a possible 99. Zions has an 80 score, SunTrust a 78 and JPMorgan a 75.Deutsche Bank also has a buy rating on Buffalo, NY-based M&T Bank (MTB) ahead of a long-awaited deal to acquire Hudson City Bancorp (HCBK), which it expects to occur later this year.

139,ZION,"Middle East: Out of pure self-preservation, Israel may end up taking back Gaza. Its large, almost entirely Arab population should celebrate, because life under their supposed enemies is preferable to terrorist Hamas rule.After a torrent of rocket attacks on Israeli population centers in recent weeks, Israel responded by bombing numerous targets in northern Gaza. And now an Israeli ground invasion of the coastal Gaza Strip has begun — possibly to be followed by a long-term re-occupation.Gaza has been ruled by Syria, by Egypt, and now, thanks to the ballot box, by the terrorist group Hamas. Not for nothing did Melville once quip that ""hell is a democracy of devils.""The good old days for the almost-entirely Sunni Muslim territory were actually the years they were ruled by ... their arch foes, the Jews of Israel, following the Six-Day War in 1967.Confirmed Euro-liberal Conor Cruise O'Brien, in his 1986 book on Zionism, ""The Siege,"" noted that ""Jewish rule brought a significant degree of economic progress, better material conditions — including a 15% annual increase in wages — and benefits in the spheres of public health and education.""According to O'Brien, ""The refugees in Gaza, who had had nothing to lose in 1967, had something to lose by 1975."" Yet, ""The rising prosperity was accompanied by a continuing rejection of Jewish rule, with the rejection most manifest among those who might appear to have benefited the most: the educated classes.""As Middle East Forum President Daniel Pipes has written, ""Palestinian Arabs — even terrorists — generally prefer life in what they call the 'Zionist entity.'""Pipes has pointed out that even ""Palestinian leaders, between their fulminations, sometimes let down their guard and acknowledge Israel's virtues.""Nearly a decade ago Pipes suggested that ""This undercurrent of Palestinian love of Zion has hopeful and potentially significant implications.""But it doesn't help when, as Israel defends itself from Islamists bent on its annihilation, President Obama takes the wrong side, saying Wednesday: ""We've all been heartbroken by the violence, especially the death and injury of so many innocent civilians in Gaza.""Why ""especially"" the victims in Gaza, who are all Arabs? Aren't Israeli Jewish victims of Hamas worthy of just as much sympathy?Britain's Economist magazine noted that even before Israel's heavy military response, ""electricity functioned for less than half the day"" in Gaza. ""Half of Gazans are out of work or unpaid. Some say that in 18 months Gazans will have no piped drinking water at all.""Pipes' hopefulness for Gaza's future might be fulfilled if its residents could be shown that they're better off living under the rule of their neighbor, which is committed to Western civilized values, rather than under the malignant rule of the Islamic fanatics among them who are dedicated to their neighbor's destruction.

The goal is to head off a recurrence of taxpayer-funded bailouts as in 2008, when government rescues averted the collapse of some of the world's largest lenders.Firms that fail a second round of tests released next week may have to forgo stock buybacks and higher dividends.""The annual stress test is one of the Federal Reserve's most important tools to gauge the resiliency of the financial sector and to help ensure that the largest firms have strong capital positions,"" Daniel Tarullo, the Fed governor in charge of bank supervision and regulation, said in an e-mail statement.Under an adverse scenario of rising rates, banks lose $267 billion on all loans, including credit cards, commercial real estate, and mortgages. Under severely adverse conditions, loan losses total $366 billion.

147,ZION,"Moody's Investors Service, the rating services arm of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report), placed the long-term ratings of Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) and its subsidiaries, including the principal bank subsidiary, Bank of America N.A., on review for a possible upgrade.Also, BofA’s counterparty risk assessments have been placed on review for probable upgrade. Notably, the rating agency affirmed all short-term ratings of the company.Improving Profitability & Conservative Risk Profile Support the UpgradeThe primary reason for placing BofA’s ratings under review is the continuous improvement in profitability and conservative risk profile. These support Moody’s belief that the company will be able to sustain its profits over the long term.BofA has been witnessing a steady rise in profitability over the past two years. Legacy mortgage servicing and legal issues, which were dragging down the bank’s profitability, have ebbed gradually. Also, its cost savings efforts have supported profitability.Further, BofA’s businesses have been aided by improvement in the operating environment. Higher interest rates and favorable macroeconomic developments continue to support its earnings.The rating agency will be evaluating the possibility and sustainability of further improvements in BofA’s profitability. It will be specifically looking into the effect of higher deposit beta on the company’s future earnings growth.Additionally, Moody’s will be taking into consideration the sustainability of BofA’s conservative risk profile that aided the bank in showing resilience under the Federal Reserve’s severely adverse stress test scenarios. Further, the company’s restrained approach toward loan growth compared to several other big banks will be assessed.BofA’s credit profile has strengthened, mainly driven by the recent improvements in capital position. While the company remained conservative compared with other big banks in returning capital to shareholders, Moody’s anticipates this to change overtime.Though increase in capital deployment activities (with the approval from the Fed) may result in a slight deterioration in the company’s capital position, continuously improving profitability and strong balance sheet will likely provide support.Moody’s also expects that BofA’s strong liquidity position will remain steady at the current levels.Our TakeRise in interest rates, potential lesser regulations, and BofA’s efforts to enhance loans and deposits are expected to support top-line growth. Hence, this will definitely bolster its profitability further.Shares of BofA have rallied 10.1% so far this year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 4.1%.Currently, BofA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks Worth ConsideringA couple of stocks in the banking space worth a look include Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report) and Community Bank System, Inc.

148,ZION,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 6.8% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ZION due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Zions' Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues Up Y/YZions earnings for the first quarter came in at $1.09 per share, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents. Also, the figure compares favorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of 61 cents per share.Results, to a great extent, benefited from improvement in both net interest income and non-interest income. Also, the quarter witnessed overall improvement in credit quality. However, higher adjusted non-interest expenses remained a major headwind.Notably, net income attributable to common shareholders for the quarter came in at $231 million indicating an increase of 79.1% year over year.Revenues Improve, Costs EscalateNet revenues came in at $684 million for the reported quarter, increasing 9.6% year over year. Moreover, the revenue figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $666 million.Net interest income for the quarter came in at $542 million, up 10.8% year over year. The rise was primarily attributable to increased interest income, partially offset by higher interest expenses. Further, net interest margin expanded 18 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.56%.Non-interest income amounted to $138 million, up 4.5% from the year-ago quarter. The uptick primarily stemmed from increase in other service charge, commission and fees, as well as wealth management and trust income.Adjusted non-interest expenses were up 1.9% from the year-ago quarter to $419 million.Efficiency ratio was 61.3%, down from 65.9% reported a year ago. A fall in efficiency ratio indicates improvement in profitability.Strong Balance SheetAs of Mar 31, 2018, total loans, net of allowance came in at $44.9 billion, up 1.3% from the end of the prior quarter. Total deposits inched up 0.8% from the prior-quarter end to $53 billion.Credit Quality ImprovesThe ratio of non-performing assets to loans and leases, as well as other real estate owned, shrunk 50 bps, year over year, to 0.87%. Nonetheless, net charge-offs came in at $5 million, tanking 89.1% from the year-earlier quarter.In the reported quarter, the company registered a provision benefit of $47 million compared with $18 million of provision for credit losses recorded in the prior-year quarter.Capital & Profitability Ratios DeteriorateUnder the Basel III rules, Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.5%, as of Mar 31, 2018, down from 10.8% at the end of the prior-year quarter. Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 13.3%, down from 13.6% in the year-ago quarter.At the end of the Jan-Mar quarter, return on average assets was 1.45%, inching up from 0.88% as of Mar 31, 2017. Also, as of Mar 31, 2017, tangible return on average tangible common equity was 15.5%, up from 8.8% a year ago.OutlookManagement projects pre-provision net revenue to increase in the high-single digits rate, on the assumption of no further rate hikes.Considering the effect of $11 million of interest recoveries accounted in first-quarter 2018, management expects net interest income to rise moderately in the next 12 months, driven by continued growth in loans, partially offset by a slight rise in funding costs.  Notably, the projection does not take into assumption further rate hikes.  Customer related fees is expected to moderately increase in the upcoming four quarters.Zions expects non-interest expense to increase marginally in 2018.For 2018, preferred dividends are expected to be approximately $34 million.Moreover, efficiency ratio (excluding any benefits of rate hikes) is projected to be below 60% for 2019.Management expects effective tax rate to be in the range of 24–25% in 2018, ignoring stock-based compensation.For the next four quarters, management projects moderate growth in total loans, on the back of moderate to strong uptick in C&I, municipal, 1-4 family, owner occupied and CRE loan portfolios, as well as stable to slight increase in O&G portfolio.Management expects the national real estate portfolio to shrink in 2018. Further, this decline is predicted to continue over the next 18 to 24 months.Management anticipates the yield on securities to increase moderately, over time, since yield on new securities is higher than the yield on the current portfolio.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.

149,ZION,"The long-time demand of banks to scale back stringent regulations is finally a reality. The House passed a crucial bill easing some provisions of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act that were put in place as safeguard against repeat of the 2008 financial crisis.The House passed the bill on Tuesday backed by majority voting of 258 to 159, promising it to be beneficial for small and mid-sized banks. It would now be presented to President Donald Trump for signing, with the Senate already having passed the legislation in March.Highlights of the BillPerhaps the most significant relief from the bill is the reduction in the number of banks labeled as systemically important financial institutions (SIFI). The bill will eventually raise the threshold for SIFI to $250 billion in assets from the current $50 billion.Banks with assets in the range of $50-$100 billion will get immediate relief while those with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion will be exempted 18 months later. This will lower the number of SIFI banks to just around a dozen from the present 38.Therefore, banks including SunTrust (STI  -  Free Report), BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Citizens Financial Group, Inc. and Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report), which are presently under stringent supervision, will heave a sigh of relief. These banks will not be required to undergo annual stress tests or submit so-called ‘living wills,’ both necessitated as measures to plan for financial disaster. So, this will eventually lower regulatory compliance costs.Further, the move will likely lead to a wave of M&As for the banking industry. At present, consolidation in the industry is few and far between as banks try to put off crossing the threshold levels that trigger tougher rules.Other than this, the bill will lower the amount of capital required to be held by the custodian banks. The bill will allow these companies to set aside the money they received from clients and immediately send it to the Fed or some other central bank for safety. Thus, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) custodian banks — State Street (STT  -  Free Report), BNY Mellon and Northern Trust (NTRS  -  Free Report) — will be the major gainers.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Further, banks with less than $10 billion in assets will be exempted from complying with the Volker Rule, which prohibits proprietary trading. The bill also eases mortgage loan data reporting requirements for several banks and credit unions as well as relaxes rules on what type of real estate loans smaller community banks can make.Additionally, the legislation will add new safeguards for student loan borrowers and necessitate credit reporting companies like Equifax and TransUnion to provide free credit monitoring services.Is Dodd-Frank Hurting Banks’ Financials?The Dodd-Frank Act has been criticized by small and medium banks for tougher rules that have made it difficult of them to do business and remain profitable. But in reality, did the law actually hurt their profitability?Well, if we go by the figures, banks have continued to earn significant profits. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)-insured commercial banks and savings institutions reported record earnings of $56 billion in first-quarter 2018, up 27.5% year over year. Notably, community banks, constituting 92% of all FDIC-insured institutions, reported net income of $6.1 billion, 17.7% above the prior-year quarter level.While one can say that improving economy and higher interest rates have supported banks, strict rules have also played their part to some extent in aiding the financials.Monitoring by regulatory bodies has helped banks to keep a check on their operations and maintain sufficient capital cushion to avoid another financial crisis. By establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) to oversee credit cards, mortgages and other financial products as well as other regulatory bodies to check for signs of instability, the Dodd-Frank Act provided stability to the banking industry.Road AheadThe bill is not as aggressive as expected by many large banks and not enough to make sweeping changes in the regulations. Still, it is the most important step to fulfill President Trump’s election promise of lessening banking regulations, which are stifling economic growth (as seen by many) and lending activities.But the legislation is of little help to some of the nation’s biggest banks (in term of assets) like JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), PNC Financial, Goldman and Wells Fargo. Notably, further discussions seem to be going on about lowering capital requirements and easing other restrictions on these banks.Later this month, the banking regulators are expected to release a proposal to weaken the Volker Rule for big banks. Further, the CFPB interim head has significantly scaled back the agency’s activities and stopped probes into finance companies.Thus, in the coming days, more regulatory easing is expected. These will definitely help the banks to further improve profitability. Also, shareholders might expect more returns in the form of buybacks and dividends.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

150,ZION,"On Sep 12, the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) increased 1.1%, leading gains for the markets on a day when benchmarks hit record highs. Gains for financials and banks in particular were powered by rising Treasury yields. These gains came on the back of a strong selloff in Treasurys on Monday, which occurred after the impact of Hurricane Irma was much lower than feared. Additionally, a widely anticipated North Korean missile test failed to materialize. Replacing these lingering concerns was a couple of encouraging developments. U.S. job openings surged to a record level and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin provided encouraging comments on tax reforms. This indicates that investors’ appetite for risk will only rise in the days to come, leading to a further spike in yields. Adding select bank stocks to your portfolios looks like a profitable option at this time.Geopolitical Fears Subside, Irma Impact Less than FearedUltimately, the impact of Hurricane Irma was less than feared earlier. Also, after a widely anticipated missile test from North Korea failed to materialize, geopolitical tensions subsided substantially. As a result, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note increased by 4.5 basis points to 2.171%, a level not witnessed since August. Yields on the 30-year and 2-year Treasury notes also increased to 2.774% and 1.335%, respectively.Tuesday’s spike in yields followed a strong selloff in Treasurys on Monday. On this occasion, a sharp selloff in bonds ensued with investors forsaking safe-haven assets for riskier investment options. Consequently, the 10-year yield increased to 2.125%, marking the largest single day gain since Jul 25.Tuesday’s increase takes the weekly increase for the 10-year Treasury note to more than 11 basis points. The rise in yields boosted the likes of Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) which gained 2.2% and 1.2%, respectively. Since banks lend over the long term and borrow for shorter periods, an increase in the long-term yield is beneficial for them. This boosts net interest margin, an important profitability metric for the banking sector.Job Openings Data, Mnuchin Interview Raises OptimismAn increase in rates and better prospects for the banking sector are generally accepted as a sign of economic strength. Data released on Sep 12 seemed to back such an inference, with U.S. job openings hitting a record level in July. With the metric increasing from 6.12 million to 6.17 million in July, job openings have now exceeded the 6 million mark for two successive months. This is first such occurrence since the inception of this particular Department of Labor report. Additionally, data from the Census Bureau has revealed a significant year-over-year increase in income levels.Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has offered encouraging comments about tax reform efforts. Speaking at an investment conference in New York, Mnuchin said he was hoping that the Republican Party would be able to push tax reforms through Congress within this year.Further, he revealed that the Trump administration may seek to backdate the benefits of such reform to the beginning of the current year. Such comments provide a firm basis for a further rise in yields.Our ChoicesWith the abatement of geopolitical and weather related tensions, investors are looking to reap stronger profits from relatively riskier assets. Encouraging developments regarding the economy are also helping to stoke such optimism.A selloff in bonds is resulting in a spike in yields, which bodes well for banks. Picking up banking stocks looks like a smart option at this point. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report) offers a wide variety of commercial and retail banking and mortgage-lending financial services.Zions Bancorp has expected earnings growth of 41.3% for the current year.

151,ZION,"Hurricanes, Harvey and Irma, are expected to make U.S. banks suffer billions of dollars in losses, per a report published by The Street.Since borrowers in the affected areas are being unable to repay their loans, banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and a few others are dreading huge loan losses that they might have to face.According to analysts at The Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

153,ZION,"Performances of most of the banks that released their first-quarter 2018 results till now were decent. Driven by higher rates and modest improvement in loan balances, banks reported an increase in their net interest income. Also, given the rebound in trading activities during the quarter, trading revenues improved.However, lower mortgage income and dismal investment banking performance adversely impacted overall fee income to some extent.On the cost front, while the absence of considerable legal expenses since the last few quarters is encouraging, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might escalate costs moderately.Per the latest Earnings Trends, overall earnings for the finance sector (of which banks are a major part) in the first quarter are projected to jump 26.3% year over year.Let’s have a look at what can be expected from Bank of Hawaii Corporation (BOH  -  Free Report), Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report), TCF Financial Corporation (TCF  -  Free Report) and Old National Bancorp (ONB  -  Free Report), which are expected to report their quarterly results on Apr 23.The earnings of Bank of Hawaii are projected to register year-over-year growth in first-quarter 2018. Its Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.23 reflects an increase of 2.5% from the prior-year quarter.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $160.91 million, which reflects a year-over-year decline of 2.9%.Notably, according to our quantitative model, chances of Bank of Hawaii beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are low.

154,ZION,"Shares of Boston, MA-based, leading international wireless tower operator, American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) hit a new 52-week high of $146.09 during the trading session on Aug 25, before closing a tad lower at $144.24.Over the past 52 weeks, American Tower’s shares have ranged from a low of $99.72 to a high of $146.09. The average volume of shares traded over the last three months is approximately 1.6 million. The stock has a market cap of $61.72 billion.Comparison with Broader IndustryOver the last three months, the price performance of American Tower has been impressive. The stock has soared 10.01%, outshining the industry’s gain of 0.81% over the same time frame.When compared to the market at large, the stock’s performance looks favorable, as the S&P 500 index and the broader Finance sector (which houses American Tower) has rallied 0.86% and 4.36%, respectively.Taking the stable performance of the stock into consideration, we expect American Tower to scale higher in the coming quarters.Positive Earnings SurpriseThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.35% in the last reported second quarter of 2017 result. Moreover, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the previous four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 3.91%.Catalysts Behind the UpsurgeAmerican Tower continues to benefit from increased investment of wireless carriers in 5G networks. Next-generation 4G LTE and 5G networks along with increased usage of smartphones and tablets are boosting demand for tower leasing. Additionally, the company’s increased investments in Asia are paying off.We believe that the company’s tower buyouts in emerging markets have driven its top line and lent it a competitive edge. American Tower’s Indian, EMEA and Latin American operations account for almost 50% of its organic core revenue growth. Notably, within the Property segment, revenues from the United States totaled $897 million (in second-quarter 2017), up 8.07% year over year. Meanwhile, total international revenues amounted $741million, up 24.12% year over year. Within this, revenues from Asia came in at $295 million, increasing a whopping 31.11% year over year. EMEA revenues grossed $160 million, up 18.52% year over year. Latin America revenues totaled $287 million, up 21.09% year over year. The company’s total revenue from international business is likely to outperform revenues from the United States in the next three to seven years.American Tower continues to generate most of its revenues from long-term (typically 5-10 year) tower leases with major wireless carriers. Further, the company provides on-site maintenance as well as servicing of antennas, amplifiers and base station equipment. The $100-million tower lease agreement with U.S. telecom behemoth AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) has helped the company raise 2017 revenue guidance.We are also impressed with American Tower’s efforts to reward stockholders with a quarterly cash distribution of 64 cents per share on shares of its common stock. The distribution will be paid on Jul 14, 2017 to stockholders of record at the closure of business on Jun 19, 2017.All these above factors played a pivotal role in driving the company’s share price to a new 52-week high.A Broker FavoriteWe note that earnings estimates for American Tower have exhibited a healthy uptrend. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings for full-year 2017 has jumped 1.51% to $6.71 per share.Given the wealth of information at the disposal of brokers, it is in the best interest of investors to be guided by broker advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.Other Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader Finance sector are Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report) and Old National Bancorp.

155,ZION,"Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report) is slated to announce fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Jan 22, after market close. Its revenues and earnings for the quarter are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, Zions’ earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher net interest income and lower provisions aided results. Also, loan growth remained strong. However, higher adjusted non-interest expenses and lower non-interest income were the undermining factors.Notably, the company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three and matched in one of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 11.5%.However, Zions’ activities in the fourth quarter failed to encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 73 cents for the to-be-reported quarter remained stable over the last seven days. Nevertheless, it reflects year-over-year improvement of 21.7%.The company’s strong fundamentals have helped its shares to gain 18.1% in 2017, outperforming the industry’s growth of 7%.Zions Bancorporation Price and EPS Surprise  Zions Bancorporation Price and EPS Surprise | Zions Bancorporation QuoteWill the rally in stock price continue post Q4 earnings release? To a great extent, it depends on the company’s ability to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates. Let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts.A Likely Positive Surprise?According to our quantitative model, chances of Zions beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Zions is +0.36%.Zacks Rank: Zions carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsGiven the rise in interest rates, along with modest improvement in lending witnessed in the fourth quarter, Zions’ net interest income is likely to improve. While a slight rise in funding costs is expected to hurt NII to some extent, management projects the same to rise moderately in 2017, driven by continued growth in loans and securities.Further, driven by treasury management, mortgage and wealth management, the company projects non-interest income (excluding dividends and securities gains/losses) to increase in mid-single digit rate.Thus, improvement in both NII as well as non-interest income should lead to higher revenues in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the fourth quarter is $670.6 million, which reflects improvement of 10.2% year over year.However, despite taking a number of initiatives to control costs, the company’s adjusted non-interest expenses are expected to increase 2-3% year over year in 2017 due to its continued spending on technology systems overhaul and normal salary adjustments.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Synovus Financial Corp. (SNV  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter results on Jan 23. It has an Earnings ESP of +0.23% and a Zacks Rank #2.

The rise was chiefly driven by higher wealth management revenues (up 30% year over year).On the other hand, non-interest expenses increased 23.7% year over year to $445.5 million.  An increase in salaries and benefits, information systems, and other costs, which came as an outcome of continued investments in the expansion of franchise, led to the spike.The efficiency ratio was 63.7% compared with 60.1% recorded in the prior-year quarter. It should be noted that a rise in the efficiency ratio indicates deterioration in profitability.Notably, due to the Tax Reform Act, First Republic recorded a one-time revaluation adjustment of $39.7 million for reduction of deferred tax assets, increasing the provision for income taxes.Balance Sheet Still HealthyAs of Dec 31, 2017, loans climbed 20.8% year over year to $62.8 billion, while total deposits were up 17.6% to $68.9 billion. Loan originations were $7.4 billion in the reported quarter, down 6.3% year over year, marking the second strongest quarter ever.First Republic’s total wealth management assets were $107 billion as of Dec 31, 2017, indicating 28% year-over-year growth. Wealth management assets included investment management assets, brokerage assets, money market mutual funds, and trust and custody assets. Notably, net new assets from existing and new clients, along with market appreciation, led to the elevated level of assets.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagOn a year-over-year basis, total non-performing assets plunged 23.1% year over year to approximately $37.7 million. The non-performing assets to total assets ratio contracted 3 bps to 0.04%.However, provision for loan losses jumped 61.9% on a year-over-year basis to $17 million in the reported quarter.Capital PositionAs of Dec 31, 2017, the company’s Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.85%, indicating a decline of 52 bps from the comparable period last year.Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 12.22%, down 85 bps year over year.Common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.63% compared with 10.83% in the year-earlier quarter.Tangible book value per share increased 14.4% year over year to $40.43.In ConclusionFirst Republic’s performance during the fourth quarter was decent. The company’s efforts to maintain its organic growth momentum, backed by growth in loans and deposits, which aided revenue growth, highlight optimism. Moreover, lower non-performing assets are the other tailwinds. However, higher expenses, and provisions and decline in net interest margin remain concerns. FIRST REPUBLIC BANK Price and EPS Surprise FIRST REPUBLIC BANK Price and EPS Surprise | FIRST REPUBLIC BANK QuoteFirst Republic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

157,ZION,"It has only been a handful of days into 2018 and the markets are already touching record highs. It looks like the rally will continue for some time.The Dow Jones Industrial index crossed the 25,000 level for the first time yesterday, while other two major indexes — the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also closed at all-time highs. The primary driving factor is the strong domestic economic data including better-than-expected ADP private sector payroll reading for December 2017, and robust manufacturing and services sector data.Also, the FOMC Minutes from last month revealed discussions that the new tax act (which was not even finalized at the time of the meeting) will aid GDP given the increase in consumer spending, higher business investments and a steady decline in unemployment rate.The tax act is expected to result in huge savings and cash repatriation for the companies. But only a few sectors/industries will continue to gain over the longer term, banks being one of them. (Read more: Christmas Comes Early for Bank Stocks: Tax Reform Bill Passed)Apart from this, the Fed has indicated three more rate hikes this year. This alone is sufficient to improve banks’ financial performance. But anticipated higher inflation driven by tax cut stimulus may lead the central bank to raise the interest rate at a faster pace, as economic growth improves further. Higher rates help banks in expanding their net interest margins, thus driving revenue growth.All these indicate a stronger economy this year. With banks’ financials directly linked to the health of the nation, they stand out to be clear winners.Further, reduction in stringent regulations might be implemented soon as part of President Donald Trump’s election promise. While no time frame has been outlined for the execution, the announcement of a bipartisan agreement has helped investors regain confidence. This will help banks in reducing regulatory compliance costs and will likely to lead to a wave of M&As for the banking industry.Picking the Winning Banking StocksThe banking industry, as a whole, is likely to gain from the favorable factors.

159,ZION,"Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 23, after market close. Its revenues and earnings for the quarter are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, Zions’ earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher revenues and benefit from provisions aided results. However, higher adjusted non-interest expenses was the undermining factor.Also, the company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three and matched it in one of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 10.1%.Zions Bancorporation Price and EPS Surprise  Zions Bancorporation Price and EPS Surprise | Zions Bancorporation QuoteFactors to Influence Q1 ResultsIncrease in net interest income: Per the Fed’s latest data, commercial and industrial loans (constituting a large part of Zions’ loan portfolio) recorded robust improvement in the first quarter, while growth in commercial real estate loans remained modest. Overall, the quarter witnessed a marginal improvement in lending activities on a year-over-year basis.Thus, modest loan growth along with higher interest rates will likely support the bank’s net interest income in the to-be-reported quarter.Notably, Zions expects net interest margin for the first quarter to remain stable sequentially. Benefits from the December rate hike will likely be offset by the effect of tax reform and its impact on the municipal loan and securities portfolio yield.Modest fee income growth: Zions’ first-quarter non-interest income will benefit from rise in service charge on deposits as deposit balance is expected to increase in the quarter. Also, as trading activities improved during the quarter, the company’s capital markets and foreign exchange fees are expected to rise.On the other hand, loan sales and servicing income are anticipated to fall as mortgage banking activities continued to be hurt by higher rates. Thus, Zions’ non-interest income is expected to witness a slight increase in to-be-reported quarter.Expenses not to lend much support: Despite undertaking a number of cost control initiatives, Zions’ adjusted non-interest expenses are expected to increase in the to-be-reported quarter due to its continued spending on technology systems overhaul and investment in franchise.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of Zions beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are low. This is because it doesn’t have the right combination of the two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Zions is -1.21%.Zacks Rank: Zions has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of the earnings beat.Nonetheless, Zions’ activities in the first quarter encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 83 cents for the quarter increased 1.2% over the last 30 days. It reflects year-over-year improvement of 36.1%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the first quarter is $666.1 million, which reflects improvement of 7.3% year over year.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.79% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Zions Bancorporation shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Zions Bancorporation is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Banks - West industry that ranks in the Top 39% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, seven analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one has dropped the estimate.

Also, the figure compares favorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of 60 cents per share.Results to a great extent benefited from improvement in both net interest income and non-interest income. Also, the quarter witnessed overall improvement in credit quality. Further, loan growth remained strong. However, higher adjusted non-interest expenses remained a major headwind.After taking into consideration the tax adjustment, relating to the passage of the Tax Act, net income attributable to common shareholders for the quarter came in at $114 million or 54 cents per share.For 2017, net income attributable to common shareholders was $550 million or $2.60 per share, up from $411 million or $1.99 per share registered in 2016.Revenues Improve, Costs EscalateNet revenues were $665 million for the quarter, increasing 9.4% year over year. However, the figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $670.6 million.Net interest income for the quarter came in at $526 million, increasing 9.6% year over year. The rise was primarily attributable to increased interest income, partially offset by higher interest expenses. Further, net interest margin improved 8 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.45%.Non-interest income amounted to $139 million, up 8.6% from the year-ago quarter. The rise was due to an increase in all components except other income.Adjusted non-interest expenses increased 5.1% from the year-ago quarter to $415 million.The efficiency ratio was 61.6%, down from 64.5% a year ago. A fall in efficiency ratio indicates improvement in profitability.Strong Balance SheetAs of Dec 31, 2017, total loans, net of allowance came in at $44.3 billion, up 1.5% from the end of the prior quarter. Total deposits increased nearly 1% from the prior quarter-end to $52.6 billion.Credit Quality ImprovesThe ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and leases as well as other real estate owned decreased 41 bps year over year to 0.93%.

This is because benefits from the December rate-hike will be offset by the effect of tax reform and its impact on the municipal loan and securities portfolio yield.Zions expects adjusted non-interest expense to increase in the low-single digits rate in 2018.Management expects effective tax rate to be in the range of 24–25% in 2018.Over the next four quarters, preferred dividends are expected to be approximately $34 million.2018-2019 ObjectivesManagement projects annual mid-single digit loan growth, driven by improvement in the commercial real estate loan portfolio, which is also expected to grow in the mid-single digits rate.The company targets customer-related fees to grow slightly from the fourth-quarter 2017 level.Given that the company has been reinvesting its cash flow from the investment portfolio into higher yielding securities, the securities portfolio is expected to increase in the long term.Moreover, adjusted efficiency ratio is projected to be below 60% for 2019.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month. There have been five revisions higher for the current quarter compared to two lower.Zions Bancorporation Price and Consensus  Zions Bancorporation Price and Consensus | Zions Bancorporation Quote VGM ScoresAt this time, ZION has a nice Growth Score of B, however its momentum is doing a bit better with an A.

162,ZION,"SVB Financial Group’s (SIVB  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $2.89 per share increased 53% year over year. The reported quarter’s figure excluded one-time net costs of $37.6 million related to the tax reform.GAAP earnings including one-time tax charges were $2.19 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $2.60.Results were primarily driven by higher net interest income (NII) and non-interest income. Moreover, loan and deposit balances reflected strength. However, higher non-interest expenses acted as a headwind. Also, a rise in provision for credit losses was a negative for the company. It is probably due to these negatives that the shares of the company lost 1.3% following the release.For 2017, the company reported GAAP net income of $490.5 million or $9.20 per share, compared with $382.7 million or $7.31 per share in 2016.Increased Revenues Offset Rise in ExpensesSVB Financial’s net revenues for the quarter were $546 million, increasing 33.1% year over year.

A rise in all expense components except other expenses led to this increase.Non-GAAP operating efficiency ratio was 48.85%, decreasing from 57.87% in the prior-year quarter. A fall in efficiency ratio indicates higher profitability.Strong Balance SheetAs of Dec 31, 2017, SVB Financial’s net loans amounted to $22.9 billion, increasing 4.2% from the prior quarter, while total deposits declined 1.2% sequentially to $44.3 billion.Credit Quality: Mixed BagThe ratio of allowance for loan losses to total gross loans came in at 1.10%, down 3 bps year over year. Also, the ratio of net charge-offs to average gross loans came in at 0.23%, down from 0.44% registered in the year-ago quarter.However, provision for credit losses increased 34.5% year over year to $22.2 million.Capital Ratios Deteriorated, Profitability Ratios EnhancedAs of Dec 31, 2017, CET 1 risk-based capital ratio came in at 12.78% compared with 12.80% as of Dec 31, 2016.

Also, non-GAAP return on average equity was 11.09%, increasing from 10.77% in the prior-year quarter.2018 OutlookSVB Financial provided the updated 2018 guidance based on the assumption of no further change in interest rate during the year.

Allowance for loan losses for total gross performing loans, as a percentage of total gross performing loans, is expected to remain flat year over year.Non-performing loans, as a percentage of total gross loans, are anticipated in the range of 0.50-0.70%.Effective tax rate is anticipated in the range of 27.0%-30.0%.Our ViewpointThe company remains well-positioned to capitalize on future opportunities on the back of its sturdy capital position and consistent growth in loans and deposits. Moreover, its focus on improving non-interest income is expected to support top-line growth. Also, it remains well-positioned to benefit from an improved rate scenario. However, mounting operating expenses are likely to weigh on the company’s performance in the near term.SVB Financial Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  SVB Financial Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SVB Financial Group QuoteSVB Financial carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

163,ZION,"With the aim of simplifying corporate structure and streamlining business operations, Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report) intends to merge its parent company into its banking subsidiary. With this move, the holding company will be eliminated and the resulting banking organisation will continue to operate with its existing name.Once the corporate structure is simplified, Zions will be eligible to file an application with the Financial Stability Oversight Council (""FSOC"") seeking to get the ""systemically important"" regulatory label removed from its name.According to the provisions contained in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, banks, which have more than $50 billion in assets, are considered systemically important financial institutions (SIFI). The SIFIs have to abide by various capital requirement rules and there is a lot of scrutiny that this regulatory label carries with itself. This is because failure of any of these companies can pose a threat to the global financial system.Notably, among the various companies within the group like Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and many others, Zions is the smallest, with assets of nearly $65 billion as of Sep 30, 2017. Zions, which operated as a multi-bank holding company earlier, has been taking a number of initiatives to consolidate its several branches. In 2015, it consolidated its seven subsidiary banks into a single national bank charter.Zions’ chairman and CEO, Harris H. Simmons, said, “There is much evidence that a consensus exists among Washington policymakers that a straightforward regional bank of Zions' size and lack of complexity does not warrant the 'systemically important' appellation, and we are optimistic that the FSOC will arrive at that conclusion as well.”Thus, Zions is expected to file the documents related to this move by the end of the year. Assuming that things will go in its favour, Zions expects the process to be completed within six months from the time of filing the request with the FSOC.Moreover, if things go as planned, Zions’ compliance costs will likely decrease due to lesser regulatory restrictions. This will likely aid bottom-line growth in the quarters ahead.Zions’ shares have gained 9.4% so far this year, outperforming the 4.2% growth for the industry it belongs to.Currently Zions carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

164,ZION,"The long wait for relief of regulatory burden may finally be over. While the Trump administration continues to push for the reversal the Dodd Frank Act, a bipartisan agreement announced on Monday came as a breather. This is expected to pave the way for significant changes and bring major relief to banks.Highlights of the AgreementThe major relief from the plan, unveiled by the Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, is likely to come in the form of reduction in the number of banks labeled as systemically important financial institutions (SIFI). The bill aims to raise the threshold for SIFI to $250 billion in assets from the current $50 billion.This will lower the number of SIFI banks to just around a dozen from the present 40. Thus, the banks including SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report), BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Citizens Financial Group, Inc. and Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report), which are presently under stringent supervision, will heave a sigh of relief.The move is expected to not only lower regulatory compliance costs but also lead to a wave of M&As for the banking industry. At present, consolidation in the industry is few and far between as banks try to put off crossing the threshold levels that trigger tougher rules.Per the plan put forward under the bipartisan deal, banks with assets in the range of $50-$100 billion will get immediate relief once the bill is enacted while those with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion will be exempted 18 months later.Further, the bill gives authority to the Federal Reserve to fast-track the exemption. Notably, the Fed will be required to conduct stress test for banks in the $100-$250 billion range periodically.For several regional banks with more than $250 million in assets, the bill is not so important. Some of these Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) banks like The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report), Capital One Financial Corp. (COF  -  Free Report) and U.S. Bancorp, though functioning as community banks, will stay subjected to stricter regulations. This will put them in a disadvantageous position to some extent in terms of lower costs.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other BenefitsThe bill also has something to offer to the smaller community banks and credit unions with total assets of less than $10 billion. These will be exempted from implementing Volcker Rule (prevents proprietary trading) and from following stringent capital and liquidity rules as long as leverage ratio is in the range of 8-10%. Also, it aims to ease mortgage rules for small banks.Moreover, the bill is expected to be beneficial to trust and custodial banks like State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) and Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report). There is a provision that prevents deposits held at the Fed by such banks to be included in calculating the supplementary leverage ratio. This will aid these companies in clearing the annual stress tests.Reactions & Road AheadBankers and the overall banking industry cheered the deal. The KBW Regional Banking Index closed the day 1.3% higher.Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association in a statement said, “While this legislation could go much further, ABA still views this bipartisan bill as an important first step in right-sizing the rules for America’s banks.”Further, Crapo said, “The bipartisan proposals on which we have agreed will significantly improve our financial regulatory framework and foster economic growth by right-sizing regulation, particularly for smaller financial institutions and community banks.”Nonetheless, the road ahead is expected to be bumpy. The deal is not as aggressive as expected by many large banks and not enough to make sweeping changes in the regulations.Still, it is the most important step taken by the Senate to fulfill President Trump’s election promise of lessening banking regulations, which are stifling economic growth. Also, it is critical in securing the support that was lacking from the earlier efforts to lessen undue regulatory burden.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

165,ZION,"On Aug 22, we issued an updated research report on Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report). The company’s escalating expenses are likely to impact its bottom-line growth. Also, rising nonperforming assets remain a concern. However, its strong capital position isa tailwind.Northern Trust missed earnings estimates by 4.8% in second-quarter 2017. Results reflected higher expenses and a decline in non-interest income. Nevertheless, the quarter witnessed rise in assets under management and assets under custody.The company's shares have remained flat year to date compared to the industry's rally of 4.3%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northern Trust’s current-year earnings has been revised nearly 1% downward over the past 30 days. As a result, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Northern Trust’s investments in technology have led to higher compensation and software expenses. Over the last five years (ended 2016) the company’s expenses have seen a compound annual growth rate of 1.4%. Further, the trend was witnessed in the first six months of 2017 as well. This mounting expense base is likely to deter bottom-line growth in the near term.At the end of the second quarter, the company’s nonperforming assets (NPAs) amounted to about $166.7 million. Such elevated levels of NPAs do not bode well for the company as they impact the net interest income. Further, it also increases expenses as a result of the collection efforts involved.  However, Northern Trust’s strong capital position supports its capital deployment activities. For third-quarter 2017, the company raised its common stock dividend by 10.5%. These steady capital deployment activities are likely to enhance shareholders’ confidence in the stock.Better-Ranked Finance StocksPeople's Utah Bancorp’s (PUB  -  Free Report) Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has beenrevised 2.9% upward, over the last 30 days.

Moreover, the figure improved 11.9% from the year-ago tally.Revenues improved from the prior-year quarter. In addition, a considerable rise in loans and deposit balances was recorded.

However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $723.2 million.First Republic’s net interest income jumped 17.6% year over year to $587.8 million, primarily supported by growth in average earnings assets. Nevertheless, net interest margin was 2.97%, down 16 basis points (bps) year over year.Non-interest income came in at $133.1 million, up 31.1% year over year. The rise was chiefly driven by higher wealth management revenues (up 27.6% year over year).On the other hand, non-interest expenses increased 22% year over year to $461.6 million. An increase in salaries and benefits, information systems, and other costs, which came as the outcome of continued investments in the expansion of franchise, primarily led to this spike.The efficiency ratio was 64% compared with 63% recorded in the prior-year quarter. It should be noted that a rise in the efficiency ratio indicates deterioration in profitability.Balance Sheet Still HealthyAs of Mar 31, 2018, loans climbed 21% year over year to $65.2 billion, while total deposits were up 16.4% to $71.3 billion. Loan originations were $7.3 billion in the reported quarter, up 29.9% year over year, mainly due to elevated business lending, multifamily and construction loans.First Republic’s total wealth management assets were $113 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, indicating 25.4% year-over-year growth. Wealth management assets included investment management assets, brokerage assets, money market mutual funds, and trust and custody assets. Notably, net new assets from existing and new clients, along with market appreciation, led to the elevated level of assets.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagOn a year-over-year basis, total non-performing assets decreased 5.4% year over year to approximately $48.9 million. The non-performing assets to total assets ratio shrunk 2 bps to 0.05%.However, provision for loan losses jumped 42.9% on a year-over-year basis to $13 million in the reported quarter.Capital PositionAs of Mar 31, 2018, the company’s Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.64%, indicating a contraction of 58 bps from the comparable period last year.Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 11.8%, down from 12.94% in the prior-year quarter.Common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.47% compared with 11.15% in the year-earlier quarter.Tangible book value per share increased 11.6% year over year to $41.46.Dividend UpdateFirst Republic announced a quarterly cash dividend of 18 cents per share of common stock, up around 5.9% from the prior payout. The new dividend will be paid on May 10 to shareholders of record as of Apr 26, 2018.In ConclusionFirst Republic reported an impressive first quarter. The company’s efforts to maintain its organic growth momentum, backed by improvement in loans and deposits, which boosted revenue performance, highlight optimism. Furthermore, lower non-performing assets are other tailwinds. However, higher expenses, and provisions, and decline in net interest margin remain concerns. First Republic Bank Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise First Republic Bank Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | First Republic Bank QuoteFirst Republic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

167,ZION,"BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) remains well positioned for organic growth, supported by a rise in loan and deposit balances. Also, easing margin pressure should aid its top-line growth in the upcoming quarters.However, the company’s expenses remain elevated, which might curb profitability growth. Also, its significant exposure to risky loan portfolios remains a concern.The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year earnings has been revised 1.4% downward over the past 30 days. The stock currently carries just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking at the fundamentals, the company’s loans and leases have increased at a CAGR of 5.2% in the last five years (2012–2016).

Supported by a solid capital position, it should continue to enhance shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.Further, with the interest rate environment improving gradually, BB&T’s margin pressure seems to be easing. This is expected to aid its top-line growth. Notably, following the latest Fed rate hike, the company raised its prime lending rate to 4.25%.However, the company’s expenses have increased at a CAGR of 3.6% over the last five years (as of the end of 2016). Given that it plans to continue with its acquisitions and mergers in the future, expenses are expected to remain elevated, thereby hurting bottom-line growth.Also, the company’s significant exposure to commercial, direct retail lending and residential mortgage loan portfolios pose risks. Although it has been successfully disposing assets, it still holds a large amount of risky loans that could pose a problem in case of further deterioration in macro-economic conditions.BB&T’s shares have gained 21.2% in a year’s time, underperforming the 30.8% growth for the industry it belongs to.

Further, the bottom line jumped 31.6% from the year-ago quarter figure.Results were primarily driven by higher net interest income (NII) and non-interest income.

172,ZION,"SVB Financial Group’s (SIVB  -  Free Report) strong capital position and consistent growth in loans and deposits position it well for future growth. Also, shares of the company have gained 62.7% in the past 12 months, outpacing the 28.6% growth for the industry it belongs to.However, mounting expenses and lack of geographic diversification remain major concerns.Nevertheless, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year earnings have been revised nearly 3.1% upward in the last 30 days, reflecting analyst’s optimism about its earnings growth prospects.Looking at the fundamentals, the company has been witnessing consistent growth in deposits and net interest income (NII) over the past several years. It has seen its non-interest-bearing demand deposits increasing at a CAGR of 14% over the last three years (2014–2016). This change in deposit mix is expected to drive the company’s organic growth.Also, pressure on the company’s net-interest margin (NIM) seems to be easing gradually with improvement in the rate environment. Notably, driven by a consistent growth in loans, management projects NIM to rise further in 2017.Further, the company’s efforts toward improving non-interest income, which constituted nearly 27% of net revenue in the first half of 2017, should further support top-line growth.However, SVB Financial has been witnessing a consistent rise in operating expenses for the past few years, primarily due to rise in compensation and benefit costs. Expenses increased at a CAGR of 12.4% in the last five years (2012–2016).Thus, elevated expenses are expected to hurt the company’s profitability in the near term.Also, the company has minimal international exposure and derives less than 10% of its total revenue from foreign clients.

176,ZION,"Investors typically have a fixation for the price-to-earnings (P/E) strategy while looking for stocks trading at bargain prices. The ratio is widely considered by value investors as a useful tool for working out the fair market value of a stock. However, even this widely popular valuation multiple is not devoid of shortcomings.What Gives EV/EBITDA the Upper Hand?Although the widespread popularity of P/E stems from its apparent simplicity, a more complicated metric called EV/EBITDA is often viewed as a better option as it offers a clearer image of a company’s valuation and earnings potential. EV/EBITDA determines the total value of a firm while P/E just considers its equity portion.EV/EBITDA, also known as the enterprise multiple, is the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company’s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents.The other constituent, EBITDA, gives a better understanding of a company’s profitability as it strips out the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings.Generally, the lower the EV/EBITDA ratio, the more tempting it is. A low EV/EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued.  EV/EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company’s balance sheet that P/E ratio does not. Given this reason, EV/EBITDA is generally used to value potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to bear. Stocks with a low EV/EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.Another limitation of P/E is that it can’t be used to value a loss-making entity. A firm’s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. In contrast, EV/EBITDA is hard to manipulate and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are EBITDA-positive.EV/EBITDA also allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels and is a useful yardstick in assessing the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have substantial depreciation and amortization expenses.But EV/EBITDA is not without its downsides. It varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements.Thus, instead of solely relying on EV/EBITDA, you can club it with the other key ratios such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to screen bargain stocks. Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for bargain stocks:EV/EBITDA 12 Months-Most Recent less than X-Industry Median: A lower EV/EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation.P/E using (F1) less than X-Industry Median: This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers.P/B less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued.P/S less than X-Industry Median: The lower the P/S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proven its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 10 stocks that passed the screen:Synnex Corporation (SNX  -  Free Report) is a global IT supply chain services company, offering a comprehensive range of services to original equipment manufacturers, software publishers and reseller customers worldwide.

178,ZION,"Most banks that reported third-quarter 2017 results this week managed to record bottom-line improvement on the back of top-line strength and lower provisions.

Moreover, margin pressure seems to be easing significantly. Further, the rise in deposit balances helped drive organic growth at the banks.However, mortgage banking business was disappointing.

179,ZION,"Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report) is slated to announce second-quarter 2017 results tomorrow, after the market closes. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Driven by an increase in revenues and lower credit cost, Zions’ first-quarter earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, rise in operating expenses was an undermining factor.Also, the company’s business activities and prospects encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the just concluded quarter moved 1.6% upward over the last 30 days.Zions boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 11.8%.The company’s price performance has been decent as well. Its shares have gained 1.2% year to date as against the industry’s decline of 0.3%.Zions Bancorporation Price and EPS Surprise  Zions Bancorporation Price and EPS Surprise | Zions Bancorporation QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Zions beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time are high. This is because, it has the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Zions is +1.61%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 63 cents is above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents.Zacks Rank: Zions carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This further increases the predictive power of ESP.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsManagement expects net interest margin to benefit from the Mar 2017 rate hike. Also, we believe that increasing yields and growth in investment securities portfolio will boost margins to some extent in the to-be-reported quarter.This is expected to have some positive impact on net interest income (NII) in the second quarter. Further, a modest improvement in loans will support NII.Zions has been undertaking several initiatives to control costs. Though its cost-saving efforts are likely to reduce operating expenses to some extent, the company’s continued spending on technology systems overhaul and normal salary adjustments will keep overall expenses stable during the quarter.Zions’ oil and gas-related exposure (9.4% of net loans) remains a matter of concern, despite a recovery in oil prices. Though the company expects energy-related losses to be lower year over year, oilfield services portfolio is likely to hamper significant improvement in asset quality. Hence, overall provisions should remain elevated during the quarter.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other finance stocks worth considering, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.T.

180,ZION,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Zions is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ZION in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 63 cents per share for ZION, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ZION, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 1.61% heading into earnings season.Why is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Zions Bancorporation Price and EPS Surprise  Zions Bancorporation Price and EPS Surprise | Zions Bancorporation QuoteGiven that ZION has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

181,ZION,"Over the last five trading days, major banks displayed a bearish trend. Though most banks which reported second-quarter 2017 results this week managed to beat estimates, concerns over the underlying weakness shadowed the optimism.Results demonstrated an upswing in loans and improved margins. However, lower treasury yields curbed the benefits. Additionally, rise in deposit balances and lower provisions driven by reserve releases in the Oil & Gas loan portfolio were impressive.Investment banking fees were favorable, but fixed income and equity trading slumped during the quarter. Also, higher funding costs and decline in mortgage origination volume were on the downside.Though the absence of exceptionally high legal expenses was a big support, an overall rise in non-interest expenses owing to high spending on technology and other market development initiatives was an undermining factor.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Jul 14, 2017)Important Earnings of the Week1. Rising interest rates and loan growth drove JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (JPM  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.82 per share, which easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57. Also, the figure reflects a 17% rise from the year-ago period. Notably, the results included a legal benefit of $406 million.Solid loan growth and higher interest rates supported net interest income. Further, investment banking fees recorded a rise. Apart from these, results were supported by a fall in provision for credit losses, mainly driven by reserve releases in the Oil & Gas loan portfolio.As expected, fixed income and equity trading slumped during the quarter. Also, fall in mortgage banking income, due to higher funding costs and decline in mortgage origination volume, was a headwind. Operating expenses reported a rise during the quarter. (Read more: JPMorgan Q2 Earnings Beat on Loan Growth, Higher Rates)2. Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.0% in second-quarter 2017, riding on higher revenues. The company’s income from continuing operations per share of $1.27 for the quarter outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21. Also, earnings compared favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.25 per share.Overall revenues escalated, driven by higher banking revenues. However, expenses surged. Further, Citigroup’s costs of credit escalated largely reflecting net credit losses and a net loan loss reserve release. (Read more: Citigroup Beats on Q2 Earnings, Shares Fall Slightly)3. Higher interest income drove Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings which recorded a positive surprise of 4.9%. Earnings of $1.07 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02. Moreover, the figure compared favorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $1.01 per share.Wells Fargo witnessed organic growth aided by strong loans and deposit balances. Higher net interest income was also favorable. In addition, a solid capital position and improving credit quality acted as the key positives. However, higher expenses and lower non-interest income were on the downside. (Read more: Wells Fargo Tops Q2 Earnings Estimates, Costs Flare Up)4. Higher investment banking fees as well as loan growth drove Bank of America Corporation’s (BAC  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings of 46 cents per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents. Results included $103 million of after-tax gains related to the sale of its non-U.S. consumer credit card business. The figure was 12% higher than the prior-year quarter.Sequential decline in net interest margin (owing to lower treasury yields during the quarter) and decline in mortgage banking fees were headwinds. Further, a slight rise in expenses and fall in trading revenues (as expected) acted as negatives. However, increase in investment banking fees more than offset these and partially aided fee income growth during the quarter.The quarter witnessed modest loan growth, which helped in improving interest income. Additionally, provision for credit losses recorded a fall. (Read more: BofA's Q2 Earnings Top on Investment Banking, Loans)5. Riding on higher revenues, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report) reported a positive earnings surprise of 4.5% in second-quarter 2017. Earnings per share of $2.10 easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01.Moreover, it reflects a 15% increase from the prior-year quarter.

182,ZION,"As we pass the three-quarters mark on the first-quarter earnings season, a few key trends have been established. First is that the median EPS growth rate is fairly healthy, while the total net income reported is sharply below a year ago. More companies are posting positive surprises than disappointments, although the margin is slightly less than we have seen in the past. It is also clear that there seem to be two markets, with part of the economy continuing to enjoy very robust earnings growth, while other parts, chiefly the Financials, are having a downright awful earnings season.
"
183,ZION,"Lets first look at the good news. The median year-over-year EPS growth rate is 9.3%, and six of the ten sectors are posting double digit gains. While at this point it seems unlikely that we will see the sort of double digit growth in median EPS that we saw quarter in and quarter out for many years, it is far from the end of the world. The median expectation for the firms yet to report is for 7.7% growth. Assuming that those companies surprise by the same margin as the firms that have already reported (median surprise of 2.90%), we will see the current number rise somewhat, but probably fall just short of the double digit level.
"
184,ZION,"The ratio of positive to negative surprises is running at 2.4:1. Not as good as in the past (over 3.0 is normal in recent years), but comfortably above 1.0. Only the Financials are posting more disappointments than positive surprises, and there just barely. So far the Financials have been responsible for 36% of all disappointments, even though they are responsible for only 20.6% of the total firms reporting. On the other side, the ratio of positive surprises to disappointments is running at very high levels in Health Care (4.83), Industrials (7.80) and Staples (5.75).
"
185,ZION,"Keep in mind what the median measures. It is a gauge of what the ""normal"" firm will report in terms of EPS. It is not influenced significantly by extreme data points, and implicitly treats the results from Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report), General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) the as being just as important as the results for Murphy Oil (MUR  -  Free Report), Manitowoc (MTW  -  Free Report) and Big Lots (BIG  -  Free Report). Changes in shares outstanding, due to buybacks or new issuance also affect the results in this measure, while they do not affect total net income.

"
187,ZION,"Turning now to the ""worst of times"" in this tale of two markets. Total net income reported is 15.3% below the total net income Q1 2007 levels. This is a big improvement from the -20.1% we reported last week. Specifically, reported firms earned reported $143.8 billion in net income (before non-recurring items) this year and $166.8 billion last year.
"
188,ZION,"The Financials have been responsible for more than the total drop in net income though. Total earnings in the sector are off 67.9% to $17.0 billion versus the $53.0 billion they reported a year ago. That is a drop of $36.0 billion versus a drop of just $23.0 billion for the market as a whole. Put another way, if the Financials are excluded, then total net income is actually up 11.4%. The actual picture is some what wore than that for the Financials since some of there problems have been taken in the form of one time extraordinary charges, or have not even shown up on the income statement (just hits to the balance sheet taken in other comprehensive income).
"
189,ZION,"Let's put what is happening to the Financials another way. At this point in the earnings season the Financials had earned more than twice as much as any other sector in terms of total earnings. This year they are in fifth place, behind Energy, Health Care, Industrials and Tech. On the other hand, in the fourth quarter they were dead last as the sector as a while was bleeding red ink.
"
190,ZION,"The biggest earnings gains so far have been in the Energy sector, with total net income 19.7% above last year, and in the Material sector, with a gain of 17.5%. Based on the expectations for the firms yet to report, those percentages should climb significantly for both of those sectors. Consumer Staples (+13.3%) and Tech (+13.3%) are both also having very solid quarters on a total net income basis. While the Financials are clearly the core of the problem in terms of weak earnings, it has not been a good quarter so far for the Durables (down 20.9%). Health Care is up just 3.2%, a very significant slowdown from the 18.2% growth it showed in the fourth quarter.
"
191,ZION,"If all the remaining firms come in and match expectations the decline in total earnings should be down 13.4%, a slight improvement over what the numbers are showing right now. That would be a fairly significant improvement over the decline that we saw in the fourth quarter (22.8%).

"
193,ZION,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
194,ZION,"The revisions ratio is trending up and this week made it into the neutral zone. The ratio is still below one (0.90) but thats better than we have seen in a while. With positive surprises running more than two to one over disappointments, one should expect to see more increases than cuts in full year expectations. After all, first-quarter earnings are part of full year earnings, thus if a firm reports higher than expected earnings for the quarter, and the analyst does not raise his full year numbers by the amount of the beat, he is implicitly cutting his estimates for the rest of the year. However, we did see a nice improvement, with the ratio rising to 0.90 from 0.67 last week and 0.57 two weeks ago. Still a weak reading but it does appear that the analysts are reacting to the better than expected results posted so far.
"
195,ZION,"The overall pace of estimate revisions is approaching what should be the peak for this quarter. Over the last four weeks there have been 3,145 changes in estimates: 1,493 up and 1,652 down, up 44.6% from 2,175: 869 up and 1,306 down last week.  The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.90, in line with the revisions ratio, and in slightly negative/neutral territory. Five sectors, Industrials, Energy, Consumer Staples, Materials and Health Care are solidly in positive territory.  The Financials and The Consumer Discretionary sectors continue to be the weakest, as they have for many months now.
"
196,ZION,"The Industrials topped the chart this week with a revisions ratio of 1.93. The strength was mostly due to the Rails, Aerospace and Heavy Machinery firms. The Energy sector had the next best revisions ratio this week at 1.91. The general story is: upstream good, downstream bad. The Exploration and Production firms such as Anadarko (APC), XTO Energy (XTO) and EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) were noteworthy for their strength. The independent refiners like Tesoro (TSO) and Valero (VLO  -  Free Report) bucked the trend and were weak. As angry as people are about prices at the pump, this is strong evidence that it is the price of crude, not huge downstream (refining and marketing) profits that are the heart of the problem.
"
197,ZION,"The Financial sector continues to get slammed with estimate cuts, currently running at three times as many as estimate increases. Banks, brokers and insurance companies were all slammed with cuts, and there seemed few places to hide. However, the sector is not alone. The Discretionary sector also had more than two times as many cuts as increases. Retailers were noteworthy in their weakness, with Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY) some of the poorest performers.

199,ZION,"The 2009 revisions story is similar to the 2008 story. The revisions ratio is well below one but improving at 0.81, up from 0.64 last week, and 0.54 two weeks ago. Analysts seem to be suspecting that the period of earnings weakness stemming from the soft economy could last quite a while. The most strength comes from the commodity sensitive Energy and Materials sectors. The Industrials also joined the party this week, mostly due to strength at the same sorts of firms that were strong for 2008. Energy leads the parade this week with almost three increases for every cut. The strong firms were very similar to those for 2008, but the downstream firms were not as weak. The strength in the sector was very widespread.
"
200,ZION,"The revisions picture for the Financial sector is even worse for 2009 than it is for 2008, coming in at 0.21, or almost five cuts for every increase. Revisions like these will eat away at the robust earnings rebound seen for 2009 (unless 2008 gets cut faster). We do not seem to be getting out of the woods on the Financial sector front.

201,ZION,"The total number of revisions for the whole S&P 500 for 2009 is also starting to pick up. There were a total of 2,449 revisions: 1,095 up and 1,354 down. This is up 48.9% from 1,645 (639 up and 1,006 down) last week. As with the 2008 revisions, this number is within a few weeks of its peak for the quarter. The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.75, somewhat weaker than the revisions ratio, and still very much in negative territory.

"
203,ZION,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
204,ZION,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2007, 2008 and 2009, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing ""earnings share"". The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index.
"
205,ZION,"Despite their current problems, the Financials are still a very significant influence on the market, accounting for a larger slice of the earnings in each year than any other sector. However, it is now likely that they will lose that crown this year to the Energy sector.  Even with all the disasters in the sector, for 2007, the Financials accounted for 22.1% of the total net income for the S&P 500. In 2008, that is currently expected to decline to 17.5% before rebounding to 20.9% in 2009. However, in recent years the sector has accounted for well over a quarter of all earnings. Its long standing earnings dominance is being challenged this year by the Energy sector, but it is likely to reassert its unquestioned top spot next year. Even though the sector is at a substantial discount on P/E basis to the overall market it is still the biggest total market cap sector, at 17.1%. That may not last for long as the Tech sector is virtually tied at 16.6%.  Given the on going massive cuts in estimates, please take the P/E on the Financials with a bag of rock salt. The true earnings are likely to be far lower than current estimates now suggest.
"
206,ZION,"For many years Financials were clearly the dominate factor in the overall market. Based on 2008 earnings, the Financials have a P/E of 14.9x and based on 2009, only 10.7x. However given the pace of estimate cuts in the sector, the true P/E is probably higher since the actual earnings will be significantly lower. Energy has just taken the throne as the cheapest based on 2008 earnings, trading at 11.3x, and 10.6x based on 2009 expectations. Thus, even on 2009 earnings the Energy sector is now the cheapest. Keep your eyes on the revisions. Unless the spreading of economic weakness to the rest of the world causes oil prices to plunge (and the recent trends are very much in the other direction), you can have much more confidence in Energy earnings forecasts actually being achieved (or exceeded) than is true with the Financials.
"
207,ZION,"While Energy accounts for only 13.09% of the total market cap of the S&P 500, it was responsible for 15.8% of 2007 earnings and is expected to be the source of 17.8% of 2008 earnings (falling to 16.1% in 2009). This is almost a mirror image of Tech which has a 16.64% weight in the index but was responsible for only 11.7% of 2007 earnings. However, Techs earnings share is expected to rise to 13.1% in 2008 and in 2009.
"
208,ZION,"The S&P 500 as a whole is trading for 15.3x and 13.1x, 2008 and 2009 earnings, respectively. Based on a blend of 67% 2008 earnings and 33% 2009 earnings; that translates to a 6.87% earnings yield, which looks extremely cheap relative to a 3.86% 10-year treasury bond. Even against the AA-corporate bond yield of 5.81% it looks attractive. However, the current level of expectations for corporate earnings still implies that profits will stay well above their historical averages as a share of GDP. That would be an exceedingly rare occurrence during a recession.
"
209,ZION,"The comparison between the earnings yield on the S&P and the 10-year bond is in my opinion more a reflection of the extreme unattractiveness of long term treasury bonds at this point than stocks looking particularly cheap in general, however there are attractive stocks out there. It appears that the flight to quality has caused a massive bubble in the price of treasury securities. The prices are hard to justify given the risk that the massive injections of liquidity by the Fed to ameliorate the credit crunch will end up fueling the fires of inflation.

Also, the figure compared favorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $1.91 per share.Results were primarily driven by higher net interest income (NII) and non-interest income. Also, a fall in provision for credit losses was a positive for the company. Moreover, loan and deposit balances reflected strength. However, higher non-interest expenses acted as a headwind.Net income available to common shareholders was $195 million, up from $101.5 million registered in the prior-year quarter.Increased Revenues Offset Rise in ExpensesNet revenues for the quarter were $575.5 million, increasing 34.5% year over year.

Rise in all expense components, except correspondent bank fees and other expenses, led to this increase.Non-GAAP operating efficiency ratio was 47.09%, decreasing from 56.35% in the prior-year quarter. A fall in efficiency ratio indicates higher profitability.Strong Balance SheetAs of Mar 31, 2018, SVB Financial’s net loans amounted to $24.3 billion, increasing 6.4% from the prior quarter, while total deposits increased 3.8% sequentially to $45.9 billion.Credit Quality ImprovesThe ratio of allowance for loan losses to total gross loans was 1.11%, down 7 bps year over year.

Also, non-GAAP return on average equity was 18.12%, increasing from 11.03% in the prior-year quarter.2018 OutlookSVB Financial provided the updated 2018 guidance, based on the assumption of no further change in the interest rate during the year. Average loan balance is expected to increase at a percentage rate in the high-teens. Further, average deposit balance is projected to rise in the low-double-digits rate.Further, NII is expected to rise at a percentage rate in the low thirties while NIM is anticipated to be 3.50-3.60%.Moreover, the company anticipates core fee income, including foreign exchange fees, deposit service charges, credit card fees, lending related fees, client investment fees as well as letters of credit fees, to increase at a percentage rate in the high twenties.Further, non-interest expense, net of non-controlling interests, is projected to increase at a percentage rate in the low double digits rate.On the credit quality front, net loan charge-offs are expected to be 0.30-0.50% of average total gross loans. Allowance for loan losses for total gross performing loans, as a percentage of total gross performing loans, is expected to remain flat year over year.Non-performing loans, as a percentage of total gross loans, are anticipated to be 0.50-0.70%.Effective tax rate is anticipated to be 27.0-30.0%.Our ViewpointThe company remains well-positioned to capitalize on future opportunities on the back of its sturdy capital position and consistent growth in loans and deposits. Moreover, its focus on improving non-interest income is expected to support top-line growth. However, mounting operating expenses are likely to weigh on the company’s performance in the near term. Also, deteriorating asset quality witnessed over the past few years remains a concern.SVB Financial Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  SVB Financial Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SVB Financial Group QuoteSVB Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

213,ZION,"Shares of Prosperity Bancshares Inc. (PB  -  Free Report) lost nearly 2.4% following the release of its first-quarter 2018 results. Earnings of $1.07 per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14. However, the figure improved 8.1% on a year-over-year basis.Results were hurt by an increase in expenses and lower non-interest income along with continued margin pressure. Also, a significant increase in provision for credit losses was a negative factor. However, higher net interest income and stable loan balances were on the positive side.Net income available to common shareholders for the reported quarter was $74.4 million, up from $68.6 million registered in the prior-year quarter.Net Interest Income Improves, Expenses RiseNet revenues of $181.2 million in the reported quarter lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $184.8 million. Also, the figure decreased 1.1% from the prior-year quarter.Net interest income was $153.2 million, increasing nearly 1% year over year. The rise was primarily due to an increase in income on loans, partially offset by an increase in the average rate on interest bearing deposits and a decrease in loan discount accretion.However, net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased 4 basis points (bps) to 3.16%.Non-interest income declined 9.4% year over year to $27.9 million. This fall was primarily due to lower mortgage income, nonsufficient fund fees, service charges on deposit accounts and other noninterest income.Non-interest expenses increased 2.6% year over year to $80.1 million. The rise was due to an increase in salaries and benefits costs, net occupancy and equipment costs along with credit and debit card, data processing and software amortization costs. Also, the company witnessed net loss on sale or write-down of other real assets in the reported quarter.Solid Balance SheetAs of Mar 31, 2018, total loans were $10 billion, almost in line with the prior-quarter end. Total deposits decreased 2.7% from the previous quarter to $17.3 billion.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAs of Mar 31, 2018, total nonperforming assets were $33.2 million, decreasing 19.4% year over year.

Moreover, total risk-based capital ratio was 15.97%, up from 15.14% at the end of the year-ago quarter.Also, common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 15.31%, up from 14.45% in the prior-year quarter.The annualized return on average assets was 1.32% at the end of the reported quarter, up from 1.23% in the prior-year quarter. Similarly, annualized return on common equity was 7.69% compared with 7.45% in the prior-year quarter.Our ViewpointProsperity Bancshares remains well positioned for organic growth, supported by a strong balance sheet position. Also, steady improvement in asset quality should support its profitability. However, continued margin pressure (despite interest rate hikes) remains a major concern. Furthermore, the bank’s strategy to grow inorganically may lead to higher merger-related charges, resulting in rise in operating expenses.Prosperity Bancshares, Inc.

214,ZION,"Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report) is slated to report its second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 21, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are expected to record marginal growth on a year-over-year basis.Driven by an increase in revenues, Moody’s’ first-quarter earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, rise in operating expenses was an undermining factor.Also, the company’s business activities and prospects encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33 for the just-concluded quarter moved up by a penny over the last seven days.Moody’s boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 11.7%.The company’s price performance has been impressive as well. Its shares have gained 34.3% year to date, significantly outperforming the Zacks categorized Miscellaneous Financial Services industry’s rally of 6.7%.Moody's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Moody's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Moody's Corporation Quote Before digging deeper into the factors that are likely to influence the results, let’s check what our quantitative model predicts.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?According to our quantitative model, chances of Moody’s beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Moody’s is +4.51%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.39 is more than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33.Zacks Rank: Moody’s currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the chances of an earnings beat.Factors to Drive Better-than-Expected Results  Favorable corporate bond issuance environment: Backdrop for bond issuance (driven by tightening of credit spreads and pull back of long-term yield curve) during the second quarter was favorable. Thus, investment grade bond and leveraged loan issuances volume remained strong year over year. So, Moody’s corporate finance revenues are expected to rise.Structured products issuance trend remain strong: Quarterly issuance volume for commercial mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations and asset backed securities remained robust. So, Moody’s will likely benefit from this trend and witness a rise in structured finance revenues during the quarter.Strategic deal to support revenue growth: Moody’s is expected to record revenue growth on the back of its strategic acquisitions, which has increased scale and cross-selling opportunities across products and vertical markets. However, strength of the U.S. dollar is likely to impact quarterly revenues to some extent.Expenses to remain high: As Moody’s continues with its inorganic growth strategy, acquisition and restructuring costs are expected to remain high. So, overall expenses are anticipated to rise during the quarter.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other finance stocks worth considering, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Huntington Bancshares Inc.

215,ZION,"First Republic Bank’s (FRC  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings per share came in at $1.06, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.09. However, the figure improved 9.3% from the year-ago tally.Higher revenues during the quarter were primarily responsible for the bottom-line improvement from the year-ago quarter. In addition, considerable rise in loans and deposit balances were recorded. Non-performing assets also declined. On the other hand, higher expenses and provisions remained a headwind.Net income available to common shareholders for the quarter jumped 16.7% year over year to $172.3 million.Revenue Climbs, Expenses Flare UpNet revenue in the quarter came in at $641.3 million, up 19.9% year over year. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $650.0 million.First Republic’s net interest income jumped 20.5% year over year to $532 million, primarily supported by growth in average earnings assets. However, the net interest margin was 3.16%, down 5 basis points (bps) year over year.Non-interest income came in at $109.4 million, up 17% year over year. The rise was chiefly driven by higher wealth management revenues.On the other hand, non-interest expenses were up 24.1% year over year to $397.1 million.  An increase in salaries and benefits, information systems and occupancy costs, which came as an outcome of continued investments in the expansion of franchise, mainly stemmed the upside.The efficiency ratio was 61.9% compared with 59.8% recorded in the prior-year quarter. It should be noted that a rise in the efficiency ratio indicates deterioration in profitability.Balance Sheet Still HealthyAs of Jun 30, 2017, loans climbed 21.3% year over year to $57.8 billion, while total deposits were up 23.7% to $63.3 billion. Loan originations were a record $7.3 billion in the reported quarter, up 12.1% year over year.First Republic’s total wealth management assets were $95.4 billion as of Jun 30, 2017, indicating 25.9% year-over-year growth. Wealth management assets included investment management assets, brokerage assets, money market mutual funds, and trust and custody assets. Notably, net new assets from existing and new clients, along with market appreciation, led to the elevated level of assets.Credit Scenario: A Concern?On a year-over-year basis, total non-performing assets declined 23.4% year over year to approximately $45.3 million. The non-performing assets to total assets ratio contracted 3 bps to 0.06%.However, provision for loan losses climbed 68.3% on a year-over-year basis to $23.9 million in the reported quarter.Capital PositionAs of Jun 30, 2017, the company’s Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.99%, reflecting a decline of 59 bps from the prior-year quarter.Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 12.49%, down 74 bps year over year.Common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.72% compared with 10.74% in the year-earlier quarter.Tangible book value per share increased 16.3% year over year to $37.83.In ConclusionFirst Republic’s decent performance during the second quarter looks encouraging. The company’s efforts to maintain its organic growth momentum, backed by growth in loans and deposits, which aided upswing in revenues, highlight optimism. Moreover, lower non-performing assets are another tailwind. However, higher expenses, and provisions and decline in net interest margin remain concerns. FIRST REPUBLIC BANK Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise FIRST REPUBLIC BANK Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | FIRST REPUBLIC BANK QuoteFirst Republic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

216,ZION,"Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) is slated to announce second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 19, before the opening bell. While investors cheered its enhanced capital deployment plan, we don’t think this optimism will continue following the earnings release.While Morgan Stanley’s performance in the last quarter reflected improved trading revenues and higher investment banking fees, a challenging operating backdrop is expected to dampen the company’s second-quarter earnings.Earnings estimate revisions depict pessimism too. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter was revised 2.5% downward, over the last seven days. Nonetheless, the company’s revenues and earnings are expected to grow modestly year over year.Also, Morgan Stanley boasts a decent earnings surprise history. This is evident from the chart below:Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise  Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise | Morgan Stanley QuoteEarnings WhispersDeclining earnings estimates increase chances of a beat. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively predict earnings beat this time. Here’s why:Morgan Stanley does not have the right combination of two main ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher – for increasing chances of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 76 cents.Zacks Rank: Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).As it is we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Impact Q2 Results  Trading income slump on low volatility: For the major part of the quarter, trading activities remained sluggish largely due to low volatility in both bond and equity markets. While the markets witnessed a modest increase in volatility almost at the end of quarter, it is not likely to be enough for Morgan Stanley to record any improvement in trading revenues.Underwriting fees to record a slight rise: Driven by an improving market conditions, the second quarter witnessed an increase in equity issuance while debt issuance was hit by higher interest rates. Per the data compiled by Thomson Reuters, equity market activities led to more than nearly 22% rise in equity underwriting fees, with Morgan Stanley at the top spot (recording over 50% growth in fees).However, the data indicates that global fees related to bond activity roughly totaled $6.5 billion during the second quarter, down more than 16% year over year. So, Morgan Stanley should have recorded a decline in debt underwriting fees during the quarter.All in all, total underwriting fees is expected to witness a slight rise on the basis of improved equity markets.Advisory fee revenues to suffer: Global M&A activity remained lackluster. Per the Thomson Reuters data, the total deal value of announced M&As across the world fell during the quarter. Thus, total fees earned through deal making should have declined as well. Likewise, Morgan Stanley is expected to earn $372.1 million as advisory fees in the quarter, indicating a fall of 20.9% from the prior-year quarter.Slight rise in net interest income (NII) on loan growth: Improvement in loan demand, particularly commercial and industrial, and real estate during quarter is expected to support NII. Further, a rise in interest rates will likely lead to an increase in interest income as well.Support to bottom line from expense control: Morgan Stanley has a cost savings plan – Project Streamline – in place. This is likely to result in lower expenses during the quarter. Also, as much improvement in revenues is not likely, chances of a big increase in compensation expenses is low.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few bank stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results on Jul 18.

217,ZION,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Zions has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 20.27, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.36. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Zions’ PE ratio above its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE is almost on par with the Zacks classified Banks-West industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 20.05.We should also point out that Zions has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 17.43, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Zions stock in the near term too.P/CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn’t take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business.This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company’s management and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company’s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. However, it is not commonly used for cross-industry comparison, as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry.In this case, Zions’ P/CF ratio of 14.88 is lower than the Zacks classified Banks-West industry average of 15.96, which indicates that the stock is somewhat undervalued in this respect.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Zions currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of ‘B’, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Zions a good choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for is 1.87, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.91. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, ZION is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Zions might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of ‘C’ and a Momentum score of ‘A’. This gives ZION a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of ‘B’. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen three upward estimate revision in the past sixty days compared to one downward, while the current year estimate has seen eight upward and one downward revision in the same time frame. As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1.6% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0.8%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Zions Bancorporation Price and Consensus Zions Bancorporation Price and Consensus | Zions Bancorporation QuoteThis positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment, and its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term.Bottom LineZions is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its good lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, with a good industry rank (top 23% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #2, the company deserves attention right now. In fact, over the past one year, the Zacks Banks-West industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

The company reported negative earnings surprise of 1.7 %, reflecting elevated expenses. Earnings per share came in at $1.14, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16. However, the figure improved 14% from the year-ago tally.Despite rising rates, net interest margin disappointed on high deposit costs. However, revenues improved from the prior-year quarter. In addition, considerable rise in loans and deposit balances were recorded. Non-performing assets and provisions also declined.Net income available to common shareholders for the quarter jumped 20.3% year over year to $185.7 million.Revenues Climb, Expenses Flare UpNet revenues in the quarter came in at $670.3 million, up 20.1% year over year. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $695 million.First Republic’s net interest income jumped 19.6% year over year to $551 million, primarily supported by growth in average earnings assets. Nevertheless, net interest margin was 3.09%, down 7 basis points (bps) year over year.Non-interest income came in at $119.3 million, up 22.7% year over year. The rise was chiefly driven by higher wealth management revenues.On the other hand, non-interest expenses were up 23.9% year over year to $418.4 million.  An increase in salaries and benefits, information systems and occupancy costs, which came as an outcome of continued investments in the expansion of franchise, mainly stemmed the upside.The efficiency ratio was 62.4% compared with 60.5% recorded in the prior-year quarter. It should be noted that a rise in the efficiency ratio indicates deterioration in profitability.Balance Sheet Still HealthyAs of Sep 30, 2017, loans climbed 19.2% year over year to $59.5 billion, while total deposits were up 18.7% to $65.4 billion. Loan originations were $7.2 billion in the reported quarter, up 11.9% year over year, marking the strongest third quarter ever.First Republic’s total wealth management assets were $101.3 billion as of Sep 30, 2017, indicating 26.4% year-over-year growth. Wealth management assets included investment management assets, brokerage assets, money market mutual funds, and trust and custody assets. Notably, net new assets from existing and new clients, along with market appreciation, led to the elevated level of assets.Credit Quality ImprovedOn a year-over-year basis, total non-performing assets plunged 29.8% year over year to approximately $37.9 million. The non-performing assets to total assets ratio contracted 4 bps to 0.04%.Further, provision for loan losses plummeted 43.9% on a year-over-year basis to $10.1 million in the reported quarter.Capital PositionAs of Sep 30, 2017, the company’s Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.76%, indicating a decline of 50 bps from the comparable period last year.Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 12.18%, down 70 bps year over year.Common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.58% compared with 10.52% in the year-earlier quarter.Tangible book value per share increased 16.4% year over year to $38.90.In ConclusionFirst Republic’s performance during the third quarter was decent. The company’s efforts to maintain its organic growth momentum, backed by growth in loans and deposits, which aided upswing in revenues, highlight optimism. Moreover, lower non-performing assets are another tailwind. However, higher expenses and decline in net interest margin remain concerns. FIRST REPUBLIC BANK Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise FIRST REPUBLIC BANK Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | FIRST REPUBLIC BANK QuoteFirst Republic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

219,ZION,"Investors looking for stocks in the Banks - West sector might want to consider either Zions (ZION  -  Free Report) or First Republic Bank (FRC  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Zions and First Republic Bank are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that ZION likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than FRC has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.ZION currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.45, while FRC has a forward P/E of 20.71. We also note that ZION has a PEG ratio of 1.45. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. FRC currently has a PEG ratio of 1.63.Another notable valuation metric for ZION is its P/B ratio of 1.49. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, FRC has a P/B of 2.24.Based on these metrics and many more, ZION holds a Value grade of A, while FRC has a Value grade of D.ZION sticks out from FRC in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that ZION is the better option right now.

220,ZION,"Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report) is slated to announce third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 23, after the market closes. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Driven by an increase in revenues and lower provisions, Zions’ second-quarter earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, rise in operating expenses was an undermining factor.Moreover, the company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 15%.However, Zions’ activities in the third quarter failed to encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 72 cents for the to-be-reported quarter remained stable over the last seven days. Nevertheless, it reflects a year-over-year improvement of 26.5%.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $666.8 million is projected to witness an increase of 8.6% year over year.Further, the company’s price performance has been decent. Its shares have gained 7% year to date, outperforming the industry’s growth of 2.6%.Zions Bancorporation Price and EPS Surprise  Zions Bancorporation Price and EPS Surprise | Zions Bancorporation QuoteWill the rally in stock price continue post Q3 earnings release? To a great extent, it depends on the company’s ability to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates. Let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts.According to our quantitative model, chances of Zions beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Zions is -0.34%.Zacks Rank: Zions carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsThe third quarter witnessed a moderate improvement in lending, particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial as well as consumer. Thus, loan growth combined with a rise in interest rates should boost the company’s NII in the quarter.Moreover, driven by continued growth in investment securities portfolio as well as benefit from rate hikes, management expects net interest margin (NIM) to improve in the quarter. Thus, higher margin should further have a positive impact on NII.Zions has been undertaking a spate of initiatives to control costs. Although its cost-saving efforts are likely to reduce operating expenses to some extent, the company’s continued spending on technology systems overhaul and normal salary adjustments will keep overall expenses stable during the quarter.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Legg Mason, Inc. (LM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.97% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3. It is scheduled to report results on Oct 25.Invesco Ltd. (IVZ  -  Free Report) is slated to report results on Oct 26.

221,ZION,"The U.S. economy is slowly gaining traction as reflected by the rise in real GDP numbers, declining unemployment rate, improving consumer spending and a stabilizing housing market.During the third quarter, global M&A activities remained strong and are likely to lend support to banking revenues. Also, the effect of June rate hike is expected to be fully reflected on net interest margin this quarter, thereby boosting revenues. On the flip side, loan growth remained soft and trading revenues were weak.Though the quarter lacked volatility and was affected by hurricanes Harvey and Irma that temporarily curbed activities, the tax policy proposed by the Trump’s government has given banking stocks a boost.Moreover, the Fed’s decision to trim its balance sheet slowly and initiate four more rate hikes by the end of 2018 has rekindled hopes of investors over banks’ performance.Per our latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings and revenues for the broader Zacks Finance Sector in the third quarter are expected to witness year-over-year growth of nearly 1%.4 Bank Stocks That Might Rally Post Q3 ResultsWe have selected four bank stocks that have gained more than 5% since their second-quarter earnings release.

226,ZION,"Most banks that reported first-quarter 2018 results this week managed to record bottom-line improvement on the back of rising rates, lower taxes and improved trading activities. This also led to positive price movement for most bank stocks over the last five trading days.In addition to the benefits from higher interest rates, banks’ results mirrored a marginal upswing in loans. Moreover, the results show eased margin pressure.Importantly, high volatility led to improved trading activities in the quarter, leading to higher trading revenues for banks.However, mortgage banking business was disappointing. Also, an overall rise in non-interest expenses owing to high spending on technology and personnel, and other market development initiatives was an undermining factor. Nevertheless, legal expenses remained under control. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Apr 13, 2018)Important Earnings of the Week1. Driven by top-line strength, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.3% in first-quarter 2018. Earnings per share of $1.68 for the quarter easily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61. Also, earnings compared favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.35 per share. Overall high revenues were reflected, driven by elevated banking, equity markets and consumer banking revenues, along with loan growth. However, fixed income markets revenue disappointed. Moreover, expenses escalated on ongoing investments. (Read more: Citigroup Beats on Q1 Earnings, Records High Revenues)2. Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) recorded positive earnings surprise of 4.7% in the first quarter. Earnings of $1.12 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07. Moreover, results improved from the prior-year quarter earnings of $1.03. Notably, results are preliminary which might be impacted on resolution of matters with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) related to the bank’s compliance risk-management program with a charge of $1 billion in civil money penalties.Lower provisions and higher interest income aided results. Nonetheless, elevated interest expense and reduced non-interest income, with lower mortgage revenues, were the undermining factors. Additionally, expenses soared. Further, reduction in loans and deposits acted as headwinds for the quarter. (Read more: Wells Fargo Q1 Earnings Beat, Low Provisions Recorded)3. Amid an expected weakness in investment banking, strong trading results, higher rates and lower tax rate drove JPMorgan’s (JPM  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of $2.37 per share, which handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.28. The reported figure was up 44% from the prior-year quarter. Results in the reported quarter included 11 cents per share of mark-to-market gains related to the adoption of new recognition and measurement accounting guidance for certain equity investments previously held at cost.Decent loan growth (driven mainly by improved wholesale loans) and higher interest rates aided net interest income growth. Further, higher equity trading income (up 26%) and fixed income trading (up 8%) supported the top line. Additionally, mortgage banking income witnessed a rise, driven by growth in residential mortgage loans, partially offset by fall in mortgage origination volume.

Despite dismal investment banking performance, higher interest rates, trading rebound and tax cuts drove Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of 62 cents per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents. Also, the figure came in 38% higher than the prior-year quarter. Net interest income growth (driven by higher interest rates), higher card income, impressive equity trading income (up 38%) supported revenues. Operating expenses recorded a decline. Additionally, provision for credit losses remains stable. (Read more: BofA Tops Q1 Earnings on Higher Rates, Equity Trading)5. PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of $2.43 beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Moreover, the bottom line reflected a 24% increase from the prior-year quarter. Continued easing of pressure on net interest margin helped the company earn higher net interest income during the quarter. Though mortgage banking revenues declined, overall non-interest income witnessed year-over-year growth. However, higher expenses hurt results to some extent. Further, the results were partially offset by higher provisions. The company’s net income for the quarter was $1.24 billion, up 15.4% from the prior-year quarter. (Read more: PNC Financial Beats Q1 Earnings Estimates, Revenues Up)6. U.S. Bancorp’s (USB  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 95 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The figure came ahead of the prior-year quarter earnings of 82 cents. The company’s top line benefitted from rise in net interest income on the back of easing margin pressure and higher fee income. Further, elevated average loans and deposit balances were tailwinds. However, escalating expenses and lower mortgage banking revenues remained major drags.

227,ZION,"Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce second-quarter 2017 results on Tuesday, Jul 18, before the opening bell. Despite investors cheering the company’s latest capital deployment plan, the same is not expected to continue following the earnings release.While BofA’s performance in the last quarter reflected improved trading revenues, an increase in interest income and higher investment banking fees, challenging operating backdrop is expected dampen the company’s second-quarter earnings.In May, at an investor conference call, the company CEO Brian T. Moynihan said that second-quarter earnings are likely be hit by fall in trading revenues and lower-than-expected interest rates.Earnings estimate revisions depict pessimism too. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter was revised 4.4% downward over the last seven days, with four out of eight estimates moving lower and none moving higher.Earnings WhispersDecrease in earnings estimates increase chances of a beat. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively predict the earnings beat this time. Here’s why:BofA does not have the right combination of two main ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher – for increasing chances of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BofA is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 43 cents.Zacks Rank: BofA’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate reflects 20.5% improvement on a year-over-year basis. Further, BofA has a decent surprise history, as evident from the chart below:Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Bank of America Corporation QuoteFactors Impacting Q2 ResultsLack of volatility to hurt trading revenues: For the major part of the quarter, trading activities remained sluggish mainly due to low volatility in both bond and equity markets. While the markets witnessed a marginal rise in volatility almost at the end of quarter, it is not likely to be enough for BofA to record any improvement in trading revenues.During an investor conference at the end of May, management revealed that the quarter’s trading revenues are expected to be down 10–12% year over year.Lack of investment banking activities to curb fee income: Global M&A activity remained lackluster. Per the Thomson Reuters data, the total deal value of announced M&As across the world fell during the quarter. Debt underwriting was soft as well, while equity underwriting seems to have improved. But as BofA’s is one of the lead players in this space, it might not suffer a loss.Mortgage revenues not to be a major support: An expected higher rate environment and less-concerned lenders over regulatory restrictions might have led to a rise in demand for refinancing activities during the quarter, thus helping BofA record some mortgage revenues. However, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no big support is expected from this segment. So, the contribution of mortgage revenue gains to total revenue will not be extraordinary.Slight rise in net interest income (NII) on modest loan growth: Improvement in loan demand, particularly commercial and industrial, and real estate during quarter is expected to support NII. Nonetheless, management expects $100–$110 million reduction in NII owing to lower-than-expected interest rates and the divestiture of its U.K. consumer credit card operations, MBNA Ltd.  Reduced scope for significant cost control: Expense reduction, which has long been the main method to remain profitable, is not expected to be the primary support this quarter. In fact, BofA expects to record a charge of $100 million as it closes/sells its data centers.Nonetheless, given the success of BofA’s cost-saving efforts and other restructuring initiatives as well as absence of significant legal costs and provisions, overall expenses should remain more or less stable.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few bank stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results on Jul 18. It has an Earnings ESP of +4.67% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

228,ZION,"The first quarter earnings season is winding down with 463 of the firms in the S&P 500 having reported. Five sectors have all their reports in and two more are more than 95% done. The only sectors with significant numbers left to report are Consumer Discretionary (mostly retailers with January fiscal years, and thus April first quarters) and Tech.
"
229,ZION,"We can draw a couple of conclusions about the results. First is that there is a serious dichotomy between growth as measured by the median EPS growth rate and as measured by the total net income growth. The median EPS growth rate is fairly healthy, while the total net income reported is sharply below a year ago. More companies are posting positive surprises than disappointments, although the margin is slightly less than we have seen in the past. It is also clear that there seem to be two markets, with part of the economy continuing to enjoy very robust earnings growth, while the other part, chiefly the Financials, are having a down right awful earnings season.
"
230,ZION,"Lets first look at the good news. The median year-over-year EPS growth rate is 9.0%, and six of the ten sectors are posting double-digit gains. While we will not see the sort of double-digit growth in median EPS that we saw quarter in and quarter out for many years, it is far from the end of the world. The median expectation for the firms yet to report is for 5.6% growth. Assuming that those companies surprise by the same margin as the firms that have already reported (median surprise of 2.94%), we will see the current number stay right around where it is now, or even dip slightly.
"
231,ZION,"The ratio of positive to negative surprises is running at 2.2:1. Not as good as in the past (over 3.0 is normal in recent years), but comfortably above 1.0. Only the Financials are posting more disappointments than positive surprises, and there just barely. The Financials have been responsible for 32.8% of all disappointments, even though they are responsible for only 19.9% of the total firms reporting. On the other side, the ratio of positive surprises to disappointments is running at very high levels in Health Care (5.29) and Industrials (5.50). Energy, with a surprise ratio of 3.00, has the second highest median surprise, at 7.23%. Telecom has the best median surprise at 8.00%, even though its surprise ratio is just 1.67. However, given the very small number of firms in the Telecom sector (nine), medians of any sort are less meaningful than sectors with large numbers of firms in them.
"
232,ZION,"In terms of year-over-year growth, Energy is the clear winner, with half the Energy firms reporting year over year EPS growth in excess of 29.3%. Since all the energy firms have their numbers in, that number will not change. Tech holds the silver with 19.7% growth, while Industrials hold the bronze at 17.4%. Honorable (double digit) mentions go to Telecom, Health Care and Staples. Financials and Discretionary are both posting negative growth, while Materials and Utilities were barely positive.
"
233,ZION,"Keep in mind what the median measures. It is a gauge of what the ""normal"" firm will report in terms of EPS. It is a gauge of what the ""normal"" firm will report in terms of EPS. It is not influenced significantly by extreme data points, and implicitly treats the results from Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report), General Electric (GE) and Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) the as being just as important as the results for Murphy Oil (MUR  -  Free Report), Manitowoc (MTW  -  Free Report) and Big Lots (BIG). Changes in shares outstanding, due to buybacks or new issuance also affect the results in this measure, while they do not affect total net income.

"
235,ZION,"Turning now to the ""worst of times"" in this tale of two markets. The total net income reported so far is 18.4% below the total net income that those same 463 firms reported in the first quarter of 2007. This is an improvement from the -23.9% they reported in the fourth quarter. Specifically, those firms reported $162.5 billion in net income (before non recurring items) this year and $199.1 billion last year.
"
236,ZION,"The Financials have been responsible for more than all the drop in net income. Total earnings in the sector are off 70.7% to $11.5 billion versus the $59.4 billion they reported a year ago. That is a drop of $47.9 billion compared to a drop of just $36.6 billion for the market as a whole. Put another way, if the Financials are excluded, then total net income is actually up 8.1%. While still below the median growth number (which would be 11.43% if the Financials were excluded) it is much less than the yawning chasm at the full S&P numbers show. The actual picture is some what wore than that for the Financials since some of there problems have been taken in the form of one time extraordinary charges, or have not even shown up on the income statement (just hits to the balance sheet taken in other comprehensive income).
"
237,ZION,"Lets put what is happening to the Financials another way. At this point in the earnings season last year, the Financials had earned more than the next two highest sectors (Energy and Health Care) with the Telecom sector thrown in for good measure. This year they are in sixth place, behind Energy, Health Care, Industrials, Tech and Staples. Its earnings only exceed the small Telecom, Materials, and Utility sectors, all of which in normal times provide less than 4% of total earnings each, and the Discretionary sector, which is both hurting itself, and which tends to be highly seasonal (most retailers are in the sector). On the other hand, in the fourth quarter Financials were dead last as the sector as a whole was bleeding red ink.
"
238,ZION,"The biggest earnings gains so far have been in the Energy sector, with total net income 25.6% above last year, and in the Material sector, with a gain of 14.3%. Both have all the reports in so those numbers are now fixed. Tech holds the bronze with growth of 12.3%and is the only other sector to post double digit growth on a total net income basis. While the Financials are clearly the core of the problem in terms of weak earnings, it has not been a good quarter so far for the Durables (down 29.3%). Health Care is up just 3.2%, a very significant slowdown from the 17.9% growth it showed in the fourth quarter. Much of that slowdown can be traced to lower earnings at Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), which in the first quarter of last year was responsible for 19.9% of all earnings in the sector. Weak results from Health Insurance firms like United Health (UNH  -  Free Report) and Wellpoint (WLP) did not help the sectors cause this quarter either.
"
239,ZION,"If all the remaining firms come in and match expectations the decline in total earnings should be down 18.5%, a slight deterioration over what the numbers are showing right now. That would be an improvement over the decline that we saw in the fourth quarter (22.8%).

"
241,ZION,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
242,ZION,"The revisions ratio is continuing to trend up. It is now at 1.08, a reading that we generally consider neutral, but the trend is encouraging. With positive surprises running more than 2:1 over disappointments, one should expect to see more increases than cuts in full year expectations. After all, first quarter earnings are part of full year earnings, thus if a firm reports higher than expected earnings for the quarter, and the analyst does not raise his full year numbers by the amount of the beat, he is implicitly cutting his estimates for the rest of the year. However, we did see a nice improvement, with the ratio rising to 1.08 from 1.02 last week and 0.90 two weeks ago. It does appear that the analysts are reacting to the better than expected results posted so far.
"
243,ZION,"The overall pace of estimate revisions is approaching what should be the peak for this quarter. Over the last four weeks there have been 3,733 changes in estimates: 1,935 up and 1,798 down, up 5.4% from 3,543 last week. Either this week or next should mark the peak of total revisions activity for the quarter.  The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.99, Just slightly the revisions ratio, and in neutral territory. Seven sectors are in positive territory.  The Financials and The Consumer Discretionary sectors continue to be the weakest, as they have for many months now. However, even there, the ratios have more than doubled off their lows.
"
244,ZION,"The Energy sector again topped the chart this week with a revisions ratio of 2.24. The general story is: Upstream good, downstream bad. The Exploration and Production firms such as Chesapeake (CHK) and EOG Resources (EOG) were noteworthy for their strength. The Coal firms Peabody (BTU) and Consol Energy (CNX) were also strong. The independent refiners like Tesoro (TSO) and Valero (VLO  -  Free Report) bucked the trend and were weak. As angry as people are about prices at the pump, this is strong evidence that it is the price of crude, not huge downstream (refining and marketing) profits that are the heart of the problem. The Industrials had the next best revisions ratio this week at 2.12. The strength was mostly due to the Rails and Heavy Machinery firms.
"

247,ZION,"The 2009 revisions story is similar to the 2008 story. Although the revisions ratio is below one, it is improving at 0.95, up from 0.88 last week, and 0.81 two weeks ago. The most strength comes from the Energy and Industrial sectors. Energy lead the parade this week with almost five increases for every two cuts. The strong firms were very similar to those for 2008. One firm that was noteworthy in its weakness (for both years) was BJ Services (BJS) which suffered a large earnings shortfall in the first quarter.
"
248,ZION,"The revisions picture for the Financial sector is even worse for 2009 than it is for 2008, coming in at 0.26, or almost four cuts for every increase. Revisions like these will eat away at the robust earnings rebound seen for 2009 (unless 2008 gets cut faster). We do not seem to be getting out of the woods on the Financial sector front. While the weakness was widespread, the end of the alphabet seemed to be taking it hardest with numerous cuts for Wachovia (WB), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Washington Mutual (WM), XL Capital (XL  -  Free Report) and Zion (ZION  -  Free Report)..
"
249,ZION,"The total number of revisions for the whole S&P 500 for 2009 is also nearing its seasonal peak. There were a total of 2,947 revisions: 1,437 up and 1,510 down. This is up 5.9% from 2,782 (1,300 up and 1,482 down) last week. As with the 2008 revisions, this number is within a few weeks of its peak for the quarter. The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.88, somewhat weaker than the revisions ratio, and edging into neutral territory.

"
251,ZION,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
252,ZION,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2007, 2008 and 2009, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing ""earnings share"". The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index.
"
253,ZION,"For years, the Financials were the dominate force in the market, both in terms of market cap, and even more so in terms of total earnings. They have now been dethroned on both counts. Still, despite their current problems, the Financials are still a very significant influence on the market. However, it is now likely that they will lose the earnings crown this year to the Energy sector.  Even with all the disasters in the sector, for 2007, the Financials accounted for 22.2% of the total net income for the S&P 500. In 2008, that is currently expected to decline to 16.0% before rebounding to 20.7% in 2009. However, in recent years the sector has accounted for well over a quarter of all earnings. Energy has usurped the crown this year, with its earnings share climbing to 18.3% from 15.8% in 2007. However, analysts expect a Financials restoration next year, with the sectors share rebounding to 20.7% while Energy slips back to 16.4%. On the market cap (and index weight) front, Tech overtook the Financials 16.7% to 16.3%. Given the ongoing estimate cuts in the sector, and the estimate increases in the Energy sector, I suspect the Energy sector might just keep its crown in 2009 as well, but that is a long shot prediction.
"
254,ZION,"For many years Financials were clearly the dominate factor in the overall market, despite generally selling for below market P/Es. Based on 2008 earnings, the Financials have a P/E of 14.8x and based on 2009, only 10.3x. However given the pace of estimate cuts in the sector, the true P/E is probably higher since the actual earnings will be significantly lower. Energy has just taken the throne as the cheapest based on 2008 earnings, trading at 11.5x, and 10.9x based on 2009 expectations. The Tech sector is far and away the most expensive in the market, trading for 19.6x 2008 and 16.8x 2009 expectations.  Keep your eyes on the revisions. Unless the spreading of economic weakness to the rest of the world causes oil prices to plunge (and the recent trends are very much in the other direction), you can have much more confidence in Energy earnings forecasts actually being achieved (or exceeded) than is true with the Financials.
"
255,ZION,"The S&P 500 as a whole is trading for 15.4x and 13.0x, 2008 and 2009 earnings, respectively. Based on a blend of 67% 2008 earnings and 33% 2009 earnings; that translates to a 6.85% earnings yield, which looks extremely cheap relative to a 3.77% ten year T-note. Even against the AA corporate bond yield of 5.97% it looks attractive. However, the current level of expectations for corporate earnings still implies that profits will stay well above their historical averages as a share of GDP. That would be an exceedingly rare occurrence during a recession.  The comparison between the earnings yield on the S&P and the 10 year T-note is in my opinion more a reflection of the extreme unattractiveness of long term T-notes at this point than stocks looking particularly cheap in general, however there are attractive stocks out there. It appears that the flight to quality has caused a massive bubble in the price of T-notes. The prices are hard to justify given the risk that the massive injections of liquidity by the Fed to ameliorate the credit crunch will end up fueling the fires of inflation.

257,ZION,"Data in this report, unless stated otherwise, is through the close on Thursday 5/15/2008
"
258,ZION,"With almost 90% of the earnings reports in for the first quarter, we have a pretty good handle on how it will all turn out.
"
259,ZION,"There is a serious dichotomy between growth measured by the median EPS growth rate and measured by the total net income growth rate. The median EPS growth rate is fairly healthy, while total net income reported is sharply below a year ago.
"
260,ZION,"More companies are posting positive surprises than disappointments, although the margin is slightly less than we have seen in the past. It is also clear that there seem to be two markets, with part of the economy continuing to enjoy very robust earnings growth, while other parts, chiefly the Financials, are having a down right awful earnings season.
"
261,ZION,"Lets first look at the good news. The median year-over-year EPS growth rate is 9%. Six of the ten sectors are posting double-digit gains. While at this point it seems unlikely that we will see the sort of double-digit growth in median EPS that we saw quarter in and quarter out for many years, it is far from the end of the world. The median expectation for the firms yet to report is for 4.9% growth. Assuming that those companies surprise by the same margin as the firms that have already reported (median surprise of 2.86%), we will see the current number stay right around where it is now, or even dip slightly.
"
262,ZION,"The ratio of positive to negative surprises is running at 2.2:1. Not as good as in the past (over 3.0 is normal in recent years), but comfortably above 1.0. Only the Financials are posting more disappointments than positive surprises, and there just barely. So far the Financials have been responsible for 34% of all disappointments, even though they are responsible for only 20% of the total firms reporting so far. On the other side, the ratio of positive surprises to disappointments is running at very high levels in Health Care (5.1), and Industrials (6.1) and Staples (4.0). Energy, with a surprise ratio of 3.0, has the highest median surprise.
"
263,ZION,"In terms of year-over-year growth, Energy is the clear winner, with half the Energy firms reporting year-over-year EPS growth in excess of 29.3%. Since all the energy firms have their numbers in, that number will not change. Tech holds the silver with 18.5% growth, while Industrials hold the bronze at 16.9%. Honorable (double digit) mentions go to Health Care, Telecom and Staples. Financials and Discretionary are both posting negative growth, while Materials and Utilities were barely positive.
"
264,ZION,"Keep in mind what the median measures. It is a gauge of what the ""normal"" firm will report in terms of EPS. It is not influenced significantly by extreme data points, and implicitly treats the results from Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report), General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) the as being just as important as the results for Murphy Oil (MUR  -  Free Report), Manitowoc (MTW  -  Free Report) and Big Lots (BIG  -  Free Report). Changes in shares outstanding, due to buybacks or new issuance also affect the results in this measure, while they do not affect total net income.

"
266,ZION,"Turning now to the ""worst of times"" in this tale of two markets. Total net income reported is 17.9% below the total net income that those same 444 firms reported in the first quarter of 2007. (This is an improvement from the -23.2% they reported in the fourth quarter.)  Specifically, reported firms earned $157.8 billion on a net basis (before non-recurring items) this year and $191.9 billion last year.
"
267,ZION,"The Financials have been responsible for more than all of the drop in net income though. Total earnings in the sector are off 79.6% to $12.1 billion versus the $53.4 billion they reported a year ago. That is a drop of $47.3 billion versus a drop of just $34.1 billion for the market as a whole. Put another way, if the Financials are excluded, then total net income is actually up 9.9%. The actual picture is some what wore than that for the Financials since some of there problems have been taken in the form of one time extraordinary charges, or have not even shown up on the income statement (just hits to the balance sheet taken in other comprehensive income).
"
268,ZION,"Lets put what is happening to the Financials another way. At this point in the earnings season the Financials had earned more than the next two highest sectors (Energy and Health Care) with the Materials sector thrown in for good measure. This year they are in sixth place, behind Energy, Health Care, Industrials, Tech and Staples. On the other hand, in the fourth quarter they were dead last as the sector as a whole was bleeding red ink.
"
269,ZION,"The biggest earnings gains so far have been in the Energy sector, with total net income 25.6% above last year, and in the Material sector, with a gain of 14.3%. Both have all the reports in so those numbers are now fixed. Consumer Staples (+13.7%) and Tech (+12.6%) are both also having very solid quarters on a total net income basis. While the Financials are clearly the core of the problem in terms of weak earnings, it has not been a good quarter so far for the Durables (down 23.5%). Health Care is up just 4.9%, a very significant slowdown from the 18.2% growth it showed in the fourth quarter. The poor showing in Industrials (up just 4.4%) is in large part due to GE.
"
270,ZION,"If all the remaining firms come in and match expectations the decline in total earnings should be down 18.5%, a slight deterioration over what the numbers are showing right now. That would be an improvement over the decline that we saw in the fourth quarter (22.8%).

"
272,ZION,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
273,ZION,"The revisions ratio is trending up and this week made it just barely into positive territory (>1.0). While the reading of 1.02 should be interpreted more as neutral than positive, it is nice to see it climb over the dividing line. With positive surprises running more than 2:1 over disappointments, one should expect to see more increases than cuts in full year expectations. After all, first quarter earnings are part of full year earnings, thus if a firm reports higher than expected earnings for the quarter, and the analyst does not raise his full year numbers by the amount of the beat, he is implicitly cutting his estimates for the rest of the year.
"
274,ZION,"We did see, however, a nice improvement, with the ratio rising to 1.02 from 0.90 last week and 0.67 two weeks ago. It does appear that the analysts are reacting to the better than expected results posted so far. The overall pace of estimate revisions is approaching what should be the peak for this quarter. Over the last four weeks there have been 3,543 changes in estimates: 1,790 up and 1,753 down. Either this week or next should mark the peak of total revisions activity for the quarter.
"
275,ZION,"The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.96, in line with the revisions ratio, and in neutral territory. Five sectors, Industrials, Energy, Consumer Staples, Materials and Health Care are solidly in positive territory. The Financials and The Consumer Discretionary sectors continue to be the weakest, as they have for many months now. However, even there, the ratios have more than doubled off their lows.
"
276,ZION,"The Energy sector topped the chart this week with a revisions ratio of 2.30. The general story is: Upstream good, downstream bad. The Exploration and Production firms such as Anadarko (APC), XTO Energy (XTO) and EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) were noteworthy for their strength. The independent refiners like Tesoro (TSO) and Valero (VLO  -  Free Report) bucked the trend and were weak. As angry as people are about prices at the pump, this is strong evidence that it is the price of crude, not huge downstream (refining and marketing) profits that are the heart of the problem.
"
277,ZION,"The Industrials had the next best revisions ratio this week at 1.91. The strength was mostly due to the Rails, Aerospace and Heavy Machinery firms.
"
278,ZION,"The Financial sector continues to get slammed with estimate cuts, currently running at three times as many as estimate increases. Banks, Brokers and Insurance companies were all slammed with cuts, and there seemed few places to hide. However, the sector is not alone. The Discretionary sector also had more than two times as many cuts as increases. Retailers were noteworthy in their weakness, with Kohls (KSS  -  Free Report), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) some of the poorest performers.

Analysts seem to be suspecting that the period of earnings weakness stemming from the soft economy could last quite a while. The most strength comes from the commodity sensitive Energy and Materials sectors. The Industrials also joined the party this week, mostly due to strength at the same sorts of firms that were strong for 2008. Energy lead the parade this week with almost three increases for every cut. The strong firms were very similar to those for 2008, but the downstream firms were not as weak. The strength in the sector was very widespread.

281,ZION,"The revisions picture for the Financial sector is even worse for 2009 than it is for 2008, coming in at 0.24, or more than four cuts for every increase. Revisions like these will eat away at the robust earnings rebound seen for 2009 (unless 2008 gets cut faster). We do not seem to be getting out of the woods on the Financial sector front. While the weakness was widespread, Banks like Comerica (CMA  -  Free Report), National City (NCC), Wachovia (WB) Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Zion (ZION  -  Free Report) were particularly hard hit.
"
282,ZION,"The total number of revisions for the whole S&P 500 for 2009 is also nearing its seasonal peak. There were a total of 2,782 revisions: 1,300 up and 1,482 down. This is up 13.6% from 2,449 (1,095 up and 1,354 down) last week. As with the 2008 revisions, this number is within a few weeks of its peak for the quarter. The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.81, somewhat weaker than the revisions ratio, and still very much in negative territory.

"
284,ZION,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
285,ZION,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2007, 2008 and 2009, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing ""earnings share"". The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index.
"
286,ZION,"For years, the Financials were the dominate force in the market, both in terms of market cap, and even more so in terms of total earnings. They have now been dethroned on both counts. Still, despite their current problems, the Financials are still a very significant influence on the market. However, it is now likely that they will lose the earnings crown this year to the Energy sector. Even with all the disasters in the sector, for 2007, the Financials accounted for 22.2% of the total net income for the S&P 500. In 2008, that is currently expected to decline to 17.3% before rebounding to 20.8% in 2009. However, in recent years the sector has accounted for well over a quarter of all earnings. While Energy has usurped the crown this year, analysts expect a restoration next year, with the sectors share rebounding to 20.8% while Energy slips back to 16.3%. On the market cap (and index weight) front, Tech overtook the Financials this week 16.7% to 16.4%. Given the ongoing estimate cuts in the sector, and the estimate increases in the Energy sector, I suspect the Energy sector might just keep its crown in 2009 as well, but that is a long shot prediction.
"
287,ZION,"For many years Financials were clearly the dominate factor in the overall market, despite generally selling for below market P/Es. Based on 2008 earnings, the Financials have a P/E of 14.4x and based on 2009, only 10.2x. However given the pace of estimate cuts in the sector, the true P/E is probably higher since the actual earnings will be significantly lower. Energy has just taken the throne as the cheapest based on 2008 earnings, trading at 11.6x, and 11.0x based on 2009 expectations. Keep your eyes on the revisions. Unless the spreading of economic weakness to the rest of the world causes oil prices to plunge (and the recent trends are very much in the other direction), you can have much more confidence in Energy earnings forecasts actually being achieved (or exceeded) than is true with the Financials.
"
288,ZION,"While Energy accounts for only 13.85% of the total market cap of the S&P 500, it was responsible for 15.8% of 2007 earnings and is expected to be the source of 18.1% of 2008 earnings (falling to 16.3% in 2009). Tech is the most expensive sector of the market on a P/E basis. It has a 16.67% weight in the index but was responsible for only 11.7% of 2007 earnings. However, Techs earnings share is expected to rise to13.1% in 2008 and 13.0% in 2009.
"
289,ZION,"The S&P 500 as a whole is trading for 15.2x and 12.9x, 2008 and 2009 earnings, respectively. Based on a blend of 67% 2008 earnings and 33% 2009 earnings; that translates to a 6.93% earnings yield, which looks extremely cheap relative to a 3.77% ten year T-note. Even against the AA corporate bond yield of 5.83% it looks attractive. However, the current level of expectations for corporate earnings still implies that profits will stay well above their historical averages as a share of GDP. That would be an exceedingly rare occurrence during a recession. The comparison between the earnings yield on the S&P and the 10-year T-note is in my opinion more a reflection of the extreme unattractiveness of long term T-notes at this point than stocks looking particularly cheap in general, however there are attractive stocks out there. It appears that the flight to quality has caused a massive bubble in the price of T-notes. The prices are hard to justify given the risk that the massive injections of liquidity by the Fed to ameliorate the credit crunch will end up fueling the fires of inflation.
