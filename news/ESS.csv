The Russell 2000 also was up 1.2%. Volume was lower compared with the same time Friday. Breadth was impressive, with winners over losers by a more than 4-1 ratio on the NYSE and by 12-to-5 on the Nasdaq.Changes went into effect today in Standard  & Poor's indexes, which caused some big moves in affected stocks.Brink's (BCO) went from the small-cap S&P 600 to the S&P MidCap 400. Brink's broke out of a cup-without-handle base in strong volume, but a 3% gain faded and the stock was only slightly above the 81.45 buy point.Armour Residential REIT (ARR) replaced Brink's in the S&P 600. Armour gapped up past the 26.85 buy point of a cup-with-handle base in big volume.It was one of several real estate investment trusts that have been breaking out.

3,ESS,"How large of an investment opportunity is being created by the upcoming Sept. 1 expansion of the familiar 10 major sectors with the debut of a new, 11th sector devoted to real estate, in benchmarks such as the S&P 500 and others run by S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI?The impact could be big.Real estate stocks -- and the mutual funds holding many of them -- stand to get a windfall infusion of billions of dollars. Diversified stock funds would have to buy more than $100 billion of REIT stocks to wipe out their real-estate underweights relative to their benchmarks, according to JPMorgan. Investors, including many of those funds, are already buying REITs, says Mike Grupe, executive vice president of research and investor outreach of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT).""That sort of inflow could drive up stock prices,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research for S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""Shareholders in funds holding real estate stocks could see at least a short-term bump up.""That's more likely to benefit shareholders in real-estate sector funds than U.S. diversified stock funds. Diversified funds are likely to be buyers, says Gregg Fisher, chief investment officer of investment management firm Gerstein Fisher and lead manager of three of its funds. Sector funds are already fully exposed to real estate.Still, diversified funds that are underweight also might boost their real estate weighting, says J. Scott Craig, manager of $43 million Eaton Vance Real Estate Fund (EIREX). ""If they hear from consultants and clients who look at fund reports (after Sept. 1) that show sector weightings, they might be pushed to act. Especially if their real estate weighting is still 0%, it could be a stark number.""Many mutual funds are bulking up on real estate stocks, including REITs, because their respective investment mandates call for them to hew to some degree to their benchmark's sector weightings, Grupe says. But no one knows how much in REIT stocks will eventually be bought, Rosenbluth says.As a result of the change, which was decided in late 2014, real estate will be broken out from the financial sector, of which it is now part.Real estate made up 2.45% of the S&P 500 Index and 3.19% of the MSCI ACWI global index as of March 31, according to Morningstar Inc. The average U.S. stock fund had a real estate weighting of  2.3%, compared with 4.4% for their benchmarks, as of Dec. 31.""REITs will also draw money simply because of increased exposure,"" Fisher said.With more attention drawn to real estate, more investors will chase the group's recent performance. Real estate funds were up 6.37% this year on average through June 16 vs. 0.82% for the average U.S. diversified stock fund, according to Lipper Inc. Also, they're up 11.42% over the past 52 weeks vs. a 5.26% loss for U.S. diversifieds.And REITs' outlook is attractive to many investors. Economic growth, even if it is slow, props up demand for real estate, Grupe says.And because share-price performance by real estate has a low correlation to stocks and bonds, real estate offers investors an attractive way to cut portfolio volatility stemming from those other asset classes.For example, U.S. stocks averaged only a 0.55 correlation to U.S. REITs from 1990 through 2015, according to Cohen & Steers. That means their performance resembled those of REITs by only a little more than 50%. U.S. bonds had only a 0.19 correlation to REITs.Fisher, whose investment approach is basically quantitative, says that CoreSite (COR) is a holding that illustrates the types of stocks that should draw new investor inflow.He says the stock has attractive metrics, such as price momentum and relative valuation.IBD readers are likely to notice that the stock has a 99 Composite Rating, the highest possible. The Composite Rating combines IBD's five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Composite Rating.It also has a 2.6% dividend yield.Craig's favorite segment going forward is apartment REITs. An expansion of supply amid slower revenue growth has hurt the segment, he says. But he likes Equity Residential (EQR) because it has been oversold. ""Investors have been right about the direction of the impact of slower revenue growth but wrong about the magnitude,"" he said.Equity Residential's focus is in coastal cities, where the apartment markets are strongest. New housing supply in those markets has hurt EQR's fundamentals, he says, but only ""quite modestly.""Craig also likes AvalonBay (AVB) and Essex Property (ESS), other apartment REITs that investors have oversold.AvalonBay is the biggest developer of apartment REITs, he says. And like EQR, it has heavy exposure to the ""sexy six"" -- Boston, Manhattan, the District of Columbia, Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles. ""These, I believe, are the six best long-term real estate markets in the U.S.,"" he said. ""They have highly educated work forces, high average household income, high cost of single-family housing, significant barriers to new construction and diversified economies. Those characteristics lead to greater rent growth and property price appreciation over the long term.""Essex, he adds, is a West Coast pure play. Avalon and Essex have dividend yields of 3.1% and 3%, respectively.In addition, he likes Federal Realty (FRT), a REIT with a 2.4% dividend yield, whose stock is not beaten down, he says. ""This REIT's portfolio includes a number of successful mixed-use properties, and it can add more of the same,"" he said.Grupe likes the office segment because new supply has been limited, he says, while demand keeps rising.And he likes self storage. ""We love our stuff,"" Grupe says about Americans. Economic growth enables people to pay for storing it.

4,ESS,"When New York-based newspaper editor Horace Greeley famously advised young men to ""go west"" and seek their fortunes back during the 1800s, he likely had no idea how many would take that advice to heart.More than 150 years later, thousands of young men and women continue to go west each year in search of jobs and urban adventure. Many pour into West Coast hubs such as Los Angeles, Seattle and the San Francisco Bay Area, where the combination of rapid population growth and limited housing options has created a cash cow for companies that own and operate apartment communities.One of those companies is Essex Property Trust (ESS), a real estate investment trust that buys, develops and manages multifamily residential properties on the West Coast.Essex focuses exclusively on three markets: Southern California, where its properties extend south from Santa Barbara to San Diego, and east from Los Angeles to the Inland Empire; the Bay Area including San Francisco, San Jose and Essex's new hometown of San Mateo; and the greater Seattle metro area.These areas dominate lists of top-performing apartment markets in the U.S.Seattle Or Bay AreaReis (REIS), a provider of commercial real estate research, notes that during the 2015 third quarter — the most recent period data are available — the top four fastest-growing U.S. apartment markets in terms of revenue per unit were either in the Bay Area or Seattle.San Francisco led the way with 9.4% year-over-year growth in effective revenue per unit, a revenue metric that weighs changes in both occupancy and rental rates. San Jose ranked second at 8.7% growth, followed by Oakland-East Bay at 7.1% and Seattle with 6.6%. Denver rounded out the top five with 6.3% growth.""It should come as no surprise that tech markets dominate the best-performing multifamily metros,"" said Victor Calanog, a senior vice president and chief economist at Reis. ""What is a bit of a surprise is how resilient Seattle and Denver have been, given the amount of new supply that has come online in both markets.""Top MarketsEssex's primary markets also dominate the top of the 2015 National Apartment Index compiled by commercial real estate brokerage firm Marcus & Millichap (MMI).The index ranks metro areas by data such as vacancy rates, rental rates, job growth and demographic trends. San Francisco, New York, San Jose and Oakland ranked Nos. 1 through 4, respectively, in the 2015 index. Los Angeles ranked No. 8, while Seattle-Tacoma ranked No. 11.Double-Digit GrowthEssex's heavy exposure to the country's hottest apartment markets is reflected in its financial results, almost always showing double-digit revenue and earnings growth. As of 2015's third quarter, Essex had produced four straight quarters of double-digit growth in net operating income, a key metric for multifamily housing REITs.""Results have been outstanding in 2015,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Wes Golladay said in a third-quarter research report, noting that Essex's portfolio was ""at least 96% leased"" across all regions.He expects similarly robust results this year.""Essex appears well-positioned heading into 2016 with a highly favorable supply and demand backdrop,"" Golladay noted.Quarterly ResultsFor the third quarter, Essex logged core funds from operations of $2.49 a share, up 14% from a year ago and 3 cents above consensus estimates. Revenue climbed 12% to $304.6 million, also beating views. Overall net operating income grew 15.5% to $208.4 million.Same-property gross revenue climbed 7.6% during the quarter, while same-property net operating income rose 10.1% year-over year.""Exceptional job growth resulted in demand that substantially exceeded deliveries of new housing, pushing rental rates higher in Seattle and all coastal California regions,"" Chief Executive Michael Schall said in a prepared statement.On Dec. 16, Essex's board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $1.44 per common share payable Jan. 15 to shareholders of record as of Jan. 4.The company is due to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2015 results after the close on Feb. 4. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Q4 funds from operations of $2.50 a share, up from $2.29 the prior year. Full-year funds from operations are seen rising 23% for 2015 and another 12% for 2016.Essex's stock price set a new high of 244.71 on Dec. 29 and currently trades near 237.As of Dec. 16, Essex had ownership interests in 244 apartment communities, with an additional nine properties in various stages of active development.Growth By AcquisitionThe company got a lot bigger in 2014 when it merged with BRE Properties, another Bay Area REIT, in a deal valued at more than $4 billion. Essex also recently announced a relocation of its corporate headquarters from Palo Alto to San Mateo.Meanwhile, the company continues to juggle its portfolio, expanding in some areas and contracting in others.On Dec. 11. the company announced it had sold a property in Silicon Valley for $245 million and was in contract to buy two properties, in Los Angeles and San Jose, for a combined $166 million.The Silicon Valley property — Menlo Park's Sharon Green Apartments, which was built in 1970 — sold at a cost of $828,000 per apartment home. The two properties Essex acquired carried a cost of $441,000 per apartment home.In a research note, analyst Karin Ford of Mitsubishi Securities said the deal lets Essex take advantage of record pricing levels while also reallocating capital from an older asset into newer assets in less-mature markets.""The $828,000-per-unit sale price is a record-high water mark for an apartment sale on the peninsula,"" Ford said. ""Essex is recycling capital out of an older asset that, although it is well-located, would likely require significant capital expenditures.""A potential problem for Essex would be a slump in the tech industry, Ford says.""Despite strong technology sector performance at present, we have longer-term concerns about a potential tech slowdown and the risk this represents to the company's growth trajectory,"" he said.

5,ESS,"The stock market continued to firm up Tuesday with just two more sessions left in the calendar year. And it was no surprise that the leading major index of the year once again took charge. The Nasdaq composite gapped higher at the open and largely kept its solid gains throughout the session. The tech-filled index drove ahead 1.3% to end…
"
6,ESS,"Last year may have been the year of the REIT, as total returns for the dividend stocks fetched an alluring 27.5% total return in aggregate, double that of the S&P 500 Index.
"
7,ESS,"But this year, the group of real estate investment trusts, or REITs, got battered.
"
8,ESS,"They logged a paltry total return of just 1% through Dec. 4 vs. the S&P 500's 3.6% gain, according to SNL Financial. But self-storage and apartments were standouts.
"
9,ESS,"Prospects of a looming rate hike by the Fed scared investors. REITs return at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends, leaving them sensitive to interest-rate increases as they seek financing to grow, since they don't have much cash on hand. Or so investors like to think.
"
10,ESS,"""Rumors of rising interest rates have certainly weighed on REITs,"" said Jason Lail, manager of real estate research at SNL Financial.
"
11,ESS,"With a rate hike expected imminently, will REITs falter again in 2016?
"
12,ESS,"REIT experts say that it might be better to look at fundamentals such as operating earnings, which in REIT parlance are known as funds from operations, or FFOs.
"
13,ESS,"""A rising interest rate environment is indicative of the overall health of the economy,"" Lail said. ""REITs are much more tied to economic health than to interest rates in regard to their performance.""
"

17,ESS,"Through the first week in December, health care's total return sunk by 12.4%, according to SNL Financial.
"
18,ESS,"But operating earnings jumped by 25.6%, the best showing of any sector. ""And that can definitely have a positive impact on health care REIT equity pricing in 2016,"" Lail said.

"
22,ESS,"SNL forecasts that FFOs for health care REITs will jump 25.6% in 2016, followed by specialty REITs' 23.9% gain, thanks in part to strong performance from data centers.
"
23,ESS,"Demand For Data Centers
"
24,ESS,"""Data center REITs are enjoying continued increases in demand for space,"" especially from cloud service providers and digital media, Lail said.
"
25,ESS,"Four data-center REITs are among Lail's top-25 picks for 2016 in terms of FFO growth, led by CoreSite Realty (COR), which is projected to grow FFO by 16.9%.
"
26,ESS,"Others are CyrusOne (CONE) (16.3%), QTS Realty Trust (QTS) (15.9%) and Equinix (EQIX) (13.2%), which has the largest market cap, at $18 billion, and counts Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) (Web services and cloud computing) as customers.
"
27,ESS,"In health care, Lail singles out Physicians Realty Trust (DOC) and Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI) for impressive FFO growth in 2016. He limited his top 25 picks, compiled exclusively for IBD, to U.S. REITs with market caps above $1 billion and at least three analyst estimates.
"
28,ESS,"Besides their sensitivity to interest rates due to long-term leases, too much construction all at once might have brought down health care REITs this year.
"
29,ESS,"""Health care is a very good long-term investment that right now has suffered because of new construction,"" said Calvin Schnure, senior vice president of research and economic analysis at NAREIT. ""There's a near-term bunching of supply that has had some impact on rents and (same-property) operating income. It's unclear how long it will take to digest. But medium- and long-term fundamentals are quite strong for that sector.""
"
30,ESS,"Millennials And Rentals
"
31,ESS,"REITs tied to the rise of the rental market — and the millennials who have been flocking to rental apartments — are also expected to stay at the forefront in 2016.
"
32,ESS,"Self-storage REITs have shown the best total equity returns this year, with the sector up a whopping 35.6% through Dec. 4. Total returns for multifamily apartment REITs were up 14.4%.
"
33,ESS,"Self-storage REITs operate storage facilities that apartment dwellers and others rent to store their extra stuff. They include Extra Space Storage (EXR), CubeSmart (CUBE), Sovran Self Storage (SSS) and Public Storage (PSA), the largest by market cap.

164,ESS,"Apartment Investment & Management Co. (AIV  -  Free Report), better known as Aimco, has received support from a broad coalition in the company’s appeal of the California court decision for its case against Airbnb. Particularly, the group backs Aimco’s measures to hold Airbnb legally responsible for engaging in brokering and endorsing illegal short-term rentals.Going by facts, per a December 2017 U.S. District Court ruling, Airbnb was provided ""immunity"" from liability for illegal short-term rentals brokering at Aimco’s apartment communities. This was granted on the basis of the federal Communications Decency Act (CDA) which protects online-service providers from the responsibility for the content users post.However, last month, Aimco filed its Ninth Circuit brief in the company’s appeal of the December 2017 ruling. And now the coalition has filed amicus briefs in support of Aimco’s appeal that the CDA does not offer such broad immunity to Airbnb.Among the members in the coalition, are names like National Multifamily Housing Council and the National Apartment Association; the California Apartment Association and Avalon Bay Communities; the League of California Cities, International Municipal Lawyers Association and California State Association of Counties; the American Hotel and Lodging Association; and others. All these strengthen Aimco’s appeal and raise hopes for the reconsideration of the ruling.Moreover, an amicus brief, pointing out the troubles created by Airbnb to affordable housing and stable communities, has been filed with the court by a group of New York neighborhood associations.According to Aimco's legal representative Mike Williams, ""Airbnb is a full-fledged real estate broker of illegal short-term rentals and should be held to the same level of scrutiny and accountability as a 'brick-and-mortar' broker engaged in comparable unauthorized activities.""According to Aimco and the parties supporting its appeal, rather than focusing on Airbnb’s act of publishing of property listings, the company should be held legally accountable for illegal short-term rental activities, as such doings pose a threat to the safety and quality of life of full-time residents. In fact, per the company, though prospective Aimco residents go through criminal background checks, several Airbnb customers are not thoroughly examined and are unknown trespassers. These customers not only pose a risk to safety but have also triggered disruption and damaged property at Aimco’s apartment premises.Such a support from the broader fraternity is a positive for the company. Moreover, Aimco is making diligent efforts to reposition its portfolio by shedding non-strategic properties and investing the proceeds in opportunistic acquisitions. The company’s portfolio is diversified in terms of geography and price point, and its revamping efforts have the capability to drive long-term growth.However, the dilutive impact on earnings from such asset dispositions cannot be bypassed in the near term. Also, new supply in various markets, which is affecting other residential REITs like AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) and Essex Property Trust, Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report), is also anticipated to dampen the company’s rent growth and new-lease pricing ability. Hike in interest rate adds to its woes.Aimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In the past three months, shares of the company have underperformed the industry. While the stock has inched up 1.8%, the industry has rallied 4.6% during this period. Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

165,ESS,"In the peak leasing season, residential REIT AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) is expected to benefit from its high quality assets located in some of the premium markets of the country. In fact, in 2017, the company delivered the seventh consecutive year of above-sector average core funds from operations (FFO) per share growth, which is encouraging. Based on its strong fundamentals, this uptrend is expected to continue going forward.Moreover, in the recently-announced quarterly update, AvalonBay noted that it expects total rental revenues for established communities in Q2 to climb 2.4-2.5% from the prior-year period. The mid-point of the latest outlook denotes a 15-basis-point expansion from what the company had previously projected. The company had reported a 2.4% increase in rental revenues for established communities in the first quarter.Increasing consumer confidence backed by job growth, rising wages and a healthier balance sheet promise solid prospects for AvalonBay. Additionally, corporate profits are up and business confidence has recovered.Also, demographic growth continues to be strong in the young-adult age cohort, which has a higher propensity to rent. This age cohort has also experienced a considerable part of net job growth and is helping spur primary renter demand. Household formation is also picking up pace, which is encouraging.Furthermore, the company has a healthy balance sheet and ample liquidity to support its growth needs. As of Mar 31, 2018, AvalonBay had no borrowings outstanding under its $1.5-billion unsecured credit facility. In addition, the company’s annualized net debt-to-core EBITDA for first-quarter 2018 was 5.1 times.Nonetheless, hike in interest rate can pose a challenge for the company. Essentially, rising rates imply higher borrowing cost for the company, which may affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate and lower dividend payouts as well. Further, the dividend payout might become less attractive compared to the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.In addition to the above, new apartment deliveries are anticipated to remain elevated in the company’s markets in 2018 and modestly decrease in 2019. Specifically, Metro New York, New Jersey and Mid-Atlantic regions are likely to remain choppy amid rising supply of residential units in upcoming quarters.In addition, supply continues to be most noticeable in the urban sub-markets. This high supply in a number of the company’s markets is likely to put pressure on rental rates. Hence, growth in its stabilized portfolio is likely to remain modest in the upcoming period. Furthermore, there is high concession activity amid higher supply, which remains a concern.Nevertheless, AvalonBay is not the only company reeling under this high supply pressure. Other residential REITS like Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) and Essex Property Trust Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report) too are facing the brunt. This unhealthy environment is unlikely to dissipate any time soon, with aggressive deliveries feared to continue into early next year as well.Per a report from real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — during the last half of 2017, across the nation’s 150 largest metros “annual pace of completions” climbed above the 300,000-unit level. Further, through early 2019, “scheduled new supply” will keep adding on to the flow at about the same annual pace.AvalonBay currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company’s shares have appreciated 2.2% in the past three months compared with its industry’s growth of 5.4%.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

166,ESS,"In the recently-announced quarterly update, residential REIT AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) noted that it expects total rental revenues for established communities in Q2 to climb 2.4-2.5% from the prior-year period.The midpoint of the latest outlook denotes a 15 basis point expansion from what the company had previously projected for the second quarter when it provided the 2018 established communities total rental revenue growth outlook this January. The company reported a 2.4% increase in rental revenues for established communities in the first quarter.Established communities refer to those consolidated communities which have stabilized occupancy as of Jan 1, 2017, and are neither executing nor planning any significant redevelopment work, and are not held for sale or planned for disposition in the current year.Moreover, the company mentioned that it has begun construction on two new communities for an estimated total capital cost of around $205 million in the second quarter. On the other hand, the company sold two wholly-owned operating communities for approximately $195 million. Two other wholly-owned communities are under contract or in advanced marketing stages for a projected price of around $280 million.Notably, in the peak leasing session, AvalonBay is expected to benefit from its high quality assets in premium locations, favorable demographics, household formation, recovering economy and job market growth.However, new apartment deliveries are anticipated to remain elevated in the company’s markets in 2018 and modestly descend in 2019. Specifically, the Metro New York, New Jersey and Mid-Atlantic regions are likely to remain turbulent amid rising supply of residential units in the upcoming quarters. In fact, in the Mid-Atlantic region, supply is expected to continue through 2019, while in New York, New Jersey market, supply might attain peak level this year, before declining in 2019. Additionally, supply continues to be the most noticeable in the urban sub-markets.This high supply in a number of the company’s markets is likely to put pressure on rental rates. Hence, growth in AvalonBay’s stabilized portfolio is expected to remain modest in the near future. Furthermore, there is high concession activity amid higher supply, which remains a concern.Nonetheless, this elevated supply has not only affected AvalonBay, but other residential REITs as well, including Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) and Essex Property Trust Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report), curbing their near-term growth momentum to some extent. And there seems to be no respite from this   dreary environment any time soon, with aggressive deliveries anticipated to continue through early next year too.In fact, according to a report from real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — during the last half of 2017, across the nation’s 150 largest metros “annual pace of completions” climbed above the 300,000-unit level.

167,ESS,"Apartment Investment and Management Company (AIV  -  Free Report), better known as Aimco, reported first-quarter 2018 pro forma funds from operations (FFO) of 60 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure indicates a 3% increase from the year-ago quarter tally of 58 cents.Results displayed growth in property net operating income (NOI), supported by same-store properties, and lease-up of redevelopment and acquisition communities. However, these positives were partially offset by lower NOI from apartment sales in 2017 and 2018.In the reported quarter, total revenues of $247.7 million comfortably outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $243.7 million. In addition, the reported figure came in marginally higher than the prior-year quarter tally of $246.5 million.Quarter in DetailSame-store revenues (before utility reimbursements) increased 2.6% year over year to $144.9 million while expenses (net of utility reimbursements) increased 2.1% from the prior-year quarter to $38.9 million. Consequently, same-store NOI climbed 2.7% to $106 million on a year-over-year basis.Same-store average daily occupancy expanded 30 basis point (bps) year over year to 96.3%. Rental rates on new leases were up 0.4% whereas rental rates on renewal leases were up 4.9% from the expiring lease rates.As of Mar 31, 2018, Aimco had cash and restricted cash on hand of $91 million. Moreover, the estimated fair market value of the company’s unencumbered apartment communities was around $2 billion.Further, at the end of the quarter under review, Aimco’s outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility were $79 million and available capacity was $509 million, after considering $12 million of letters of credit, backed by the facility.Portfolio ActivityDuring the reported quarter, Aimco invested $47 million in redevelopment and development.In addition, Aimco is revamping its portfolio through property sales and reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents, superior margins and higher-than-expected growth.Through these efforts, the company increased its revenues per apartment home by 7% to $2,052. Additionally, it enhanced the quality and expected growth rate of its portfolio. Specifically, the percentage of A, B and C+ home was 49%, 35% and 16%, respectively, in first-quarter 2018 compared with 51%, 35% and 14% recorded in the year-ago quarter. GuidanceFor full-year 2018, the company updated its pro forma FFO per share guidance to $2.39-$2.49 from $2.42-$2.52 provided earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $2.48.For second-quarter 2018, Aimco provided pro forma FFO per share guidance of 57-61 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is 62 cents.The company projects same-store NOI growth to be in the range of 1.70-3.10% and revenue growth in the range of 2.10-3.10%.DividendOn May 2, Aimco announced a quarterly cash dividend of 38 cents per share of Class A Common Stock for the first quarter. This marks a 6% year-over-year increase. The dividend will be paid on May 31 to stockholders of record as of May 18, 2018.Bottom LineAimco’s efforts to reposition its portfolio by shedding non-strategic properties and investing the proceeds in opportunistic acquisitions are likely to drive long-term growth. In addition to this, the company has a solid portfolio, diversified both in terms of geography and price point. This is likely to help meet the rise in demand for apartment properties efficiently.However, the dilutive impact on earnings from such asset dispositions cannot be bypassed in the near term. Also, new supply in various markets is anticipated to dampen the company’s rent growth and new lease pricing ability. Hike in interest rate adds to its woes.Apartment Investment and Management Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Apartment Investment and Management Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Apartment Investment and Management Company QuoteAimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

168,ESS,"Residential real estate investment trust (REIT) Essex Property Trust Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report) delivered first-quarter 2018 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $3.09, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.05. Core FFO per share improved 5.1% from the year-ago quarter figure of $2.94.Results reflect growth in net operating income (NOI) and high occupancy level.Total revenues of $347.3 million in the quarter grew 3.5% year over year. However, the figure narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $347.5 million.Quarter in DetailDuring the reported quarter, Essex Property’s same-property gross revenues grew 3.3% from the prior-year quarter, while same-property net operating income (NOI) improved 3.6% year over year. Financial occupancies of 97.1% expanded 60 basis points (bps) year over year.Essex Property exited first-quarter 2018 with cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, of $139.1 million, up from $61.1 million recorded at the end of 2017.Notably, in January 2018, the company made an amendment to its unsecured line of credit facility, thereby enhancing the maximum amount available for borrowing from $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion, as well as lengthening the maturity to December 2021. As of Apr 27, 2018, the company had around $1.2 billion in undrawn capacity on its unsecured credit facilities.During the reported quarter, the company repurchased 16,834 shares of its common stock for a total of $3.8 million (including commissions), at an average price of $224.13 per share. The company had $245.2 million of purchase authority left under its stock buyback program at the end of the quarter.Notably, the company did not issue any shares of common stock under its equity distribution program.OutlookEssex Property provided its guidance for second-quarter and full-year 2018. For the full year, the company projects core FFO per share in the range of $12.28-$12.64, denoting 2 cents per share increase at the mid-point. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $12.43.The current-year projection is backed by expectations for same-property revenue growth in the band of 2.3-3.0%, denoting a 15-basis-point (bps) increase at the mid-point, and same-property NOI growth in the 2-3.4% range, marking 20-bps growth at the midpoint.For second-quarter 2018, the company projects core FFO per share of $3.00-$3.10. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $3.10.ConclusionWe are encouraged with the stellar Q1 performance of Essex Property, in terms of FFO per share. However, the company’s revenue miss remains a disappointment. With a strong property base and solid balance sheet, Essex Property is likely to leverage on favorable demographic trends in its markets.The company’s substantial exposure to the West Coast market, which is home to several innovation and technology companies, offers ample scope to boost its top line over the long term. Nonetheless, aggressive rental concessions and moderate pricing power amid high supply remain concerns. Also, rate hike adds to its woes.Essex Property currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company’s funds from operations (FFO) per share and revenues are anticipated to have increased moderately year over year.In the last-reported quarter, this San Mateo, CA-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered in-line results, in terms of FFO per share.

This is depicted in the graph below:Essex Property Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Essex Property Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Essex Property Trust, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to Drive the ResultsPer the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — the national apartment market remained moderated in first-quarter 2018, with occupancy shrinking slightly and rent growth slowing down. Nevertheless, the first quarter marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and curbs growth in demand.Going by statistics, the annual rent growth slipped to 2.3% in Q1. This marked moderation from the 2.6-2.9% growth rate experienced throughout 2017. Occupancy level of 94.5% in March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%, with metros having subdued construction activity faring well and recording the strongest occupancy. Nevertheless, the overall occupancy level is still healthy.Essex Property’s focus on acquisition and development of West Coast properties is predicted to have offered ample scope to enhance its top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, the West Coast is a hub of innovation and technology companies. While real wages are expected to rise amid growth in these companies, we anticipate apartments in the area to have registered decent demand and rent growth in the Jan-Mar quarter.Further, a solid balance sheet and financial flexibility raises our confidence in the company. Notably, in January 2018, the company amended its unsecured line of credit facility, thereby enhancing the maximum amount available for borrowing from $1 billion to $1.2 billion, as well as lengthening the maturity to December 2021. Furthermore, as of Feb 2, 2018, the company had around $891 million in undrawn capacity on its unsecured credit facilities.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $347.5 million, marking an expected increase of 3.6% year over year.For the first quarter, the company estimates core FFO per share of $2.99-$3.09. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $3.05. It reflects 3.7% growth from the prior-year quarter.Lastly, Essex Property’s shares have ascended 3.5% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s decline of 0.3%.A Surprise in Store?Our proven model shows that Essex Property has the right combination of the two key ingredients —positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat in the first quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Essex Property is +0.05%.Zacks Rank: Essex Property carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around:Amanda Hoffer Properties (AHH  -  Free Report), slated to release first-quarter results on May 1, has an Earnings ESP of +0.88% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

Further, favorable demographics and strong job growth in target markets are anticipated to drive demand for MAA’s properties.

Annual rent growth slipped to 2.3% in Q1 which marked moderation from the 2.6-2.9% growth rate experienced throughout 2017. Occupancy level of 94.5% in March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%. Nevertheless, the overall occupancy level is still healthy and the first quarter usually marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of householdsFurther, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of markets of MAA. This high supply is likely to put pressure on rental rates in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, there is high-concession activity amid elevated supply, which remains a concern.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.46, which indicates no movement on a year-over-year basis. (Read more: Mid-America Apartment Q1 Earnings: What's in Store?)Our proven model does not conclusively show that MAA is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

In addition, key leases executed in the quarter included 593,765 RSF at 1655 and 1725 Third Street property in the Mission Bay/SoMa submarket leased to Uber Technologies, Inc. and 192,070 RSF at Summers Ridge Science Park in Sorrento Mesa submarket leased to Quidel Corporation.On a year-over-year basis, same-property NOI grew 4.0%. It climbed 14.6% on a cash basis. Occupancy of operating properties in North America remained high at 96.6%.As of first-quarter 2018, investment-grade or large cap tenants accounted for 57% of annual rental revenues in effect. Furthermore, 79% of the annual rental revenues are from Class A properties in AAA locations.Notably, during the reported quarter, the company acquired 11 properties in four transactions, for a total of $320.5 million. The properties offer both current and future value-creation development and redevelopment scopes.LiquidityAlexandria exited first-quarter 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $221.6 million, down from $254.4 million reported at the end of the prior quarter. The company had $2.3 billion of liquidity as of the first quarter.OutlookAlexandria expects adjusted FFO per share in the band of $6.52-$6.62 for 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $6.57.The company’s 2018 guidance is backed by expectations for occupancy in North America (as of Dec 31, 2018) in the range of 96.9-97.5%, rental rate increases for lease renewals and re-leasing of space of 13.0-16.0%, and same-property NOI growth of 2.5-4.5%.Our ViewpointWe are encouraged with the stellar performance of Alexandria in the Jan-Mar quarter. Notably, strong fundamentals of the life-science industry have enabled the company’s Class A properties in upscale locations to enjoy high occupancy. Additionally, Alexandria’s efforts to improve credit profile look encouraging. The company has adequate capital buffer which will likely cushion its position during any adverse situation.

178,ESS,"Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results after the market closes on May 2. Both its revenues and funds from operations (FFO) are anticipated to experience year-over-year growth.In the last reported quarter, this retail real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered in-line results with respect to FFO per share. Results reflected growth in revenues. However, the company’s proactive releasing efforts to reposition properties had an adverse effect on its quarterly results.The company has a decent surprise history with earnings surpassing estimates in three of the trailing four quarters while meeting in one. This resulted in an average positive surprise of 1.37%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:Federal Realty Investment Trust Price and EPS Surprise Federal Realty Investment Trust Price and EPS Surprise | Federal Realty Investment Trust QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderFederal Realty has been taking advantage of the redevelopment opportunities. Amid a fast-evolving retail environment, the company is making strategic efforts to reposition, redevelop and re-merchandise its portfolio. These efforts will help the company to counter competition from e-retailers.Subsequently, minimum rents from the retail and commercial segment are likely to record sequential growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $153 million indicates marginal growth of 1.3% compared with the prior quarter. Total rental income is projected to be $220 million, which remains stable from the prior-quarter tally.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $223.8 million, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 7.9%.However, rising consumer purchases through the Internet emerged as a pressing concern for this REIT. These made retailers reconsider their footprints and eventually opt for store closures. Also, retailers, who are not able to cope with competition, are filing for bankruptcies.Accordingly, percentage rents, which indicate additional rent based on the level of sales achieved by the tenant, are predicted to witness a considerable decline due to the tepid retail environment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.02 million reflects a 16.6% decline compared with the prior quarter.Moreover, Federal Realty’s activities during the reported quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q1 FFO per share remained stable at $1.50 in a month’s time. However, it indicates rise of 3.5% year-over-year.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Federal Realty is likely to beat on earnings this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Federal Realty is -0.29%.Zacks Rank: Federal Realty’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP.

179,ESS,"HCP Inc. (HCP  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, before the opening bell. Both its revenues and funds from operations (FFO) are expected to have registered declines, on year-over-year basis.In the last-reported quarter, this Irvine, CA-based healthcare REIT delivered a positive surprise of 2.13%, in terms of FFO per share. Results reflected growth in three-month same-property portfolio (SPP) cash net operating income (NOI).The company has an impressive surprise history. In fact, over the trailing four quarters, this REIT exceeded estimates in each occasion, generating an average positive surprise of 3.72%. This is depicted in the graph below.HCP, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise HCP, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | HCP, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up, prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderHCP enjoys a diversified, well-balanced portfolio in the healthcare sector. In the to-be-reported quarter, the company is likely to have gained from rising healthcare spending and a growing aging population. Importantly, strategic divestitures, in a bid to lower its Brookdale-portfolio concentration, are anticipated to have driven the company’s Q1 performance.Subsequently, rental and related revenues are likely to have recorded sequential growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $261 million indicates growth of 2.3% as compared to the prior quarter. Further, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues from medical office are expected to inch up 0.8% to $121 million as compared with the prior-quarter tally.Furthermore, during the Jan-Mar quarter, HCP made progress with the sale and transition of 36 senior housing operating assets and 32 triple-net leased communities, operated by Brookdale. During the quarter, 24 senior living communities, owned by HCP, announced shifting their operator from Brookdale Senior Living to Atria Senior Living. This move will considerably decrease Brookdale’s concentration in HCP’s portfolio, increase lease coverage of their remaining triple-net assets leased to Brookdale, improve the diversification of tenants in the portfolio, and enhance credit profile and balance sheet.Notably, senior living providers have been facing operational and financial challenging times, thanks to the fall in private-pay healthcare, low margins and heavy government control. Amid these, a reduction in Brookdale’s concentration — which is one of the largest senior living providers — bodes well.  In its life-science segment, we estimate occupancy to have been stable as compared to the previous quarter, while revenues are anticipated to be down 2% to $95 million sequentially.The company remained focused on balance-sheet restructuring in the first quarter. Specifically, it reduced its mezzanine loan investments by selling a loan, secured by interests in skilled nursing and long-term healthcare portfolio, Tandem, to Fundamental Advisors LP, for $112 million.HCP’s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q1 FFO remained unchanged at 46 cents in a month’s time. Further, it indicates a 9.8% decline year over year.A Surprise in Store?Our proven model shows that HCP has the right combination of the two key ingredients —positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat in the first quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for HCP is +0.22%.Zacks Rank: HCP carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to come up with a positive surprise this time around:Amanda Hoffer Properties (AHH  -  Free Report), slated to release first-quarter results on May 1, has an Earnings ESP of +0.88% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

180,ESS,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results after the market closes on May 2.In the last-reported quarter, this Bethesda, MD-based lodging real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of around 7.7%, with respect to funds from operations (FFO) per share. Results highlighted margin improvement through better productivity.The company has a decent surprise history. In fact, over the preceding four quarters, the company posted surprises in three occasions, with an average beat of 6.8%. This is depicted in the graph below: Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors That Might Impact Q1 ResultsHost Hotels boasts a portfolio of upscale hotels across potential markets in the United States. Also, the company is making concerted efforts to enhance its portfolio quality through strategic capital-recycling program. The lodging REIT has been making well-planned redevelopments to fortify its position in vibrant markets.Moreover, the company is enhancing its portfolio with strategic assets like the three Hyatt-managed hotels, while monetizing a considerable part of real estate in Washington D.C. and lowering its exposure in New York.Host Hotels also has a decent balance sheet and ample liquidity. The company’s Q1 performance is expected to display improvement in productivity at many of its hotels.However, though supply growth has been sluggish in the past, it has gathered momentum, of late. In fact, growth is expected to remain elevated in 2018, particularly in markets where the company has exposure.Moreover, in the fourth-quarter 2017 conference call, management had stated that the company’s performance is likely to be the weakest in first-quarter 2018. This is due to tough comparisons resulting from inauguration and Women's March in D.C. last year as well as Easter weekend beginning on Mar 30 this year.Notably, the company usually reaps 23-24% of its total EBITDA in the Jan-Mar quarter. In addition to this, dilutive impact of asset sales cannot be bypassed. Also, rate hike is another key concern for this REIT.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.32 billion, indicating an expected decline of 1.9% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Room Revenues is pegged at $824 million, down from $847 million reported in the prior quarter. The Food and Beverage revenues estimate is pegged at $413 million which is slightly above the $409 million generated in the prior quarter.In fact, there was lack of any solid catalyst for being positive on the stock. Therefore, in a month’s time, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the first quarter remained unchanged at 40 cents. The figure denotes an estimated decrease of 9.1% year over year.However, Host Hotels’ shares have gained 8.0% over the past month, outperforming 2.3% growth recorded by its industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Host Hotels will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of -2.99%.Zacks Rank: Host Hotels’ Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP.

181,ESS,"Retail real estate investment trust (REIT) Taubman Centers Inc. (TCO  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share of $1.04, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents. The figure also came in 13% higher than the year-ago tally of 92 cents.Adjusted revenues, including minimum rents, overage rents and expense recoveries, for the quarter came in at $141 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $144 million. Also, revenues were down nearly 2% from the prior-year quarter.The quarter experienced higher rents and greater lease cancellation income. Further, cost-saving initiatives executed in the previous year enabled the company to enjoy lower general and administrative expenses.Quarter in DetailComparable center net operating income (NOI) climbed 9.2% for the quarter. Average rent per square foot in comparable centers came in at $57.73, up 3.9% from the prior-year quarter. For the period ended Mar 31, 2018, the trailing 12-month releasing spreads per square foot were 4.4%.Moreover, comparable center mall tenant sales per square foot rose 12.4% in the reported quarter. Further, the company’s 12-month trailing comparable center mall tenant sales per square foot came in at $837, marking a 5% increase.As of Mar 31, 2018, leased space in comparable centers was 95%. Additionally, ending occupancy in comparable centers was 92.8% on Mar 31, 2018, flat year over year.LiquidityTaubman Centers exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $53.9 million, up from the $42.5 million reported at year-end 2017.GuidanceThe company projects 2018 adjusted FFO per share of $3.72-$3.86, which remained unchanged from the previous outlook. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $3.76.The full-year FFO per share guidance continues to be backed by assumptions of comparable center NOI growth of about 2-3% for the year. Also, the guidance does not include any future costs that might be incurred related to shareowner activism.Our ViewpointTaubman recorded encouraging NOI growth during the Jan-Mar quarter. The company’s operating performance benefited from the new comparable centers in the quarter.  In addition, it witnessed robust growth in sales per square foot.However, the prevalent choppy retail real estate environment remains a concern for the company. In fact, with a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preferences and growing online retail, mall traffic continues to suffer. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures. This is expected to impact demand for retail space at Taubman’s shopping centers. Furthermore, it has been witnessing elevated levels of tenant turnover for the past two years.Taubman Centers, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Taubman Centers, Inc.

(VTR  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 funds from operations (FFO) as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts of 96 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.01. The figure came in lower than the year-ago quarter tally of $1.03.Results reflected an increase in property-level operating expenses.Ventas posted revenues of $943.7 million in the first quarter, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $850.6 million. Further, it compared favorably with the year-ago number of $883.4 million.For the first quarter, same-store cash net operating income (NOI) growth for the total portfolio (1,049 assets) climbed 2.6% year over year. Segment-wise, same-store cash NOI for the triple net leased portfolio grew 4.4%, seniors housing operating portfolio witnessed rise of 0.7% and medical office building portfolio rose 2.2%.Quarter in DetailDuring the reported quarter, Ventas signed a mutually-beneficial agreement with Brookdale Senior living which currently operates the company’s 128 wholly-owned senior housing communities. It combines all of the company’s leases with Brookdale into a single Master lease, with an initial term through Dec 2025. Brookdale has two 10-year extension options as well.Brookdale and Ventas also plan to sell a few properties from the Brookdale portfolio, totaling $30 million in cash rent.LiquidityVentas exited first-quarter 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $92.5 million, up from $81.4 million as of Dec 31, 2017.Updated 2018 OutlookVentas updated 2018 normalized FFO per share outlook to $3.99-$4.07 from the previous range of $3.95-$4.05.The company updated same-store cash net operating income growth to 0.5-1.5% in 2018 from 0.5-2% issued earlier.Our TakeVentas is poised to grow on the back of its diversified portfolio, strategic acquisitions and strong balance sheet. Rising healthcare spending and aging population augur well for long-term growth. Moreover, the mutual agreement, which the company has signed with Brookdale, is likely to provide further support to Ventas.However, an elevated supply of seniors’ housing assets in certain markets is likely to put pressure on rent and occupancy growth in the near-term. Further, the company is exposed to concentration risks since the majority of its revenues are generated from a few tenants. Hike in interest rate is also a concern.Ventas, Inc.

However, the prior-year quarter’s net income included a benefit of $3.5 million from an insurance settlement and net realized gains of $3.1 million from the sale of investments. Excluding other items, operating loss for the first quarter of 2018 improved by about $4.1 million.Total revenues for the quarter came in at $19.9 million compared with $13.5 million, recorded in the year-ago period. This upswing was driven by higher leasing revenues, timber revenues and real-estate revenues.However, the quarter witnessed a slight decline in the resorts and leisure business revenues.The company’s total expenses for the quarter escalated 12.7% from the prior-year quarter to $20.4 million.Shares of St. Joe declined 0.4% to $16.80 during the regular trading session on Apr 26.Behind the Headline NumbersIn the reported quarter, real-estate revenues came in at $7.7 million, up from $1.5 million recorded in the comparable period last year.

Such efforts, to achieve an optimal portfolio mix, will likely help the company bolster revenues and provide a more stable source of earnings. Further, its continued efforts to enhance its leasing portfolio enabled it to record encouraging growth in this segment.Nonetheless, inconsistent revenue performance in a number of segments renders volatility to the company’s top line.

184,ESS,"Welltower Inc. (WELL  -  Free Report) reported normalized funds from operations (FFO) per share of 99 cents for first-quarter 2018, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Further, on a year-over-year basis, the figure declined 5.7% from $1.05.Results highlight a choppy seniors housing market.However, the company posted revenues of nearly $1.1 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07 billion. It also compared favorably with the year-ago number of $1.06 billion.Importantly, it was announced that Welltower and ProMedica Health System would acquire Quality Care Properties (QCP) real estate in newly-formed joint venture (80/20), for $20.75 per share. Also, ProMedica entered into a definitive deal to acquire the operations of HCR ManorCare and Arden Courts, QCP's principal tenants. In addition, ProMedica would enter into a 15-year absolute triple-net master lease as a tenant-to-real estate joint venture.Notably, this $2.2-billion Welltower investment is estimated to provide around 20 cents per share annual accretion to the company. Further, it represents an 8% initial cash yield and 1.8xproperty level EBITDAR coverage, with corporate lease guarantee from a secure investment grade health system. Moreover, with this partnership, ProMedica will gain immediate scale in the rapidly growing home health, post-acute and memory-care markets. It will invest as much as $400 million in capex over the next five years.Quarter in DetailTotal portfolio same-store net operating income (SSNOI) inched up 1.8% year over year, mainly driven by growth in seniors housing triple-net, outpatient medical and long-term/post-acute care segments.Welltower accomplished $578 million of pro-rata gross investments in the first quarter. This included $476 million in acquisitions/joint ventures, $59 million in development funding, as well as $43 million in loans. Notably, the company completed 67% of these investments with present relationships.On the other hand, the company accomplished total dispositions of $987 million in the quarter. This comprised loan payoffs of $92 million and property sales of $895 million.The company exited first-quarter 2018 with $202.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, down from $380.4 million recorded at the end of the prior-year quarter. In addition, as of Mar 31, 2018, the company had $2.1 billion of available borrowing capacity under its primary unsecured credit facility. Furthermore, it extinguished secured debt of $183 million during the reported quarter.Dividend UpdateWelltower announced a cash dividend of 87 cents per share for the first quarter. The dividend will be paid on May 23 to stockholders of record on May 8, 2018. This marks the company’s 188th consecutive quarterly cash dividend payout to stockholders.2018 OutlookDue to timing variability associated with the completion of the ProMedica joint venture and acquisition of Quality Care Properties, the company has not included enhanced acquisition-activity guidance in its current earnings outlook. As such, Welltower affirmed its normalized FFO per share outlook of $3.95-$4.05 for 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $4.03.Also, the company anticipates its 2018 average blended SSNOI growth of around 1-2%. In addition, the company increased its 2018 disposition proceeds projection to $1.9 billion from the $1.3 billion guided earlier.Our TakeWelltower’s partnership with ProMedica Health System is a strategic fit. It spans the entire spectrum of care, including wellness, post-acute, assisted living, memory care, hospice and home health, and gives the company solid scope to capitalize on the individual market dynamics.Nonetheless, the seniors housing market remains challenging. Additionally, rate hike is a concern for Welltower due to its high exposure to long-term leased assets. Stiff competition and effects of increased dispositions on earnings add to its woes.Currently, Welltower has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Further, leasing spread per square foot for the trailing 12-month period ended Mar 31, 2018, increased 12.6% to $8.45.Total portfolio NOI growth for the reported quarter came in at 4.8%. This reflects increase in operating income from comparable properties, as well as additions from new development, redevelopment, expansion and acquisitions.

It boasts a strong and improving balance sheet. Moreover, the company is focusing on overhauling its properties and increasingly adopting omni-channel strategies. In fact, recently, Simon Property announced substantial redevelopment program at five properties. This move will help the retail REIT transform the former Sears stores and draw more traffic to these malls, in order to benefit the existing retailers.Admittedly, Simon Property is putting in every effort to enhance the value of its assets. However, the implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost and therefore, would limit any robust growth in its profit margins in the near term. Also, rate hike has added to its woes.Currently, Simon Property carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

187,ESS,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Essex Property Trust, Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 6.3% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ESS due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Essex Property Q4 FFO and Revenues Grow Y/YEssex Property delivered an in-line performance for fourth-quarter 2017. The company reported core FFO per share of $3.01 for the quarter, meeting the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Core FFO per share improved 7.1% from the year-ago quarter figure of $2.81.Results reflect solid growth in NOI and high occupancy level.Total revenues of $345.1 million in the quarter grew 4.9% year over year. However, the figure narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $346.5 million.In 2018, management expects housing demand to surpass supply in coastal markets of California and Washington. This is likely to result in growth in market rent close to long-term averages. Specifically, West Coast is anticipated to outdo the nation both in terms of rent growth as well as job growth in the year.For full-year 2017, core FFO per share came in at $11.91, 7.9% ahead of the prior-year tally of $11.04. This was backed by 5.4% year-over-year growth in total revenues to $1.4 billion.Quarter in DetailDuring the reported quarter, Essex Property’s same-property gross revenues grew 3.0% from the prior-year quarter, while same-property NOI improved 3.4% year over year. Financial occupancies of 96.8% expanded 20 basis points (bps) year over year.Further, the company sold two communities for a total contract price of $160.3 million during the quarter. On the other hand, the company acquired one community for a total contract price of $59.0 million.LiquidityEssex Property exited year-end 2017 with cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, of $61.1 million, down from $170.3 million at the end of 2016.Notably, in January 2018, the company made an amendment to its unsecured line of credit facility, thereby enhancing the maximum amount available for borrowing from $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion as well as lengthening the maturity to December 2021. As of Feb 2, 2018, the company had around $891.0 million in undrawn capacity on its unsecured credit facilities.During the fourth quarter, the company issued 33,571 shares of common stock at an average price of $261.19 through its equity distribution program for net proceeds of $8.7 million. For full-year 2017, the company issued 345,444 shares of common stock at an average price of $260.38. This helped generate net proceeds of $89.1 million.OutlookEssex Property provided its guidance for first-quarter and full-year 2018. For the full year, the company projects core FFO per share in the range of $12.24-$12.64. The full-year 2018 projection is backed by expectations for same-property revenue growth in the band of 2.0-3.0% and same-property NOI increase in the range of 1.6-3.4%.For first-quarter 2018, the company projects core FFO per share in the $2.99-$3.09 band.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

188,ESS,"We have crossed the halfway mark in the Q4 reporting season for the S&P 500 index, with results from 251 members already out. Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these 251 S&P 500 constituents are up 16% from the year-ago quarter on a 10.5% rise in revenues, with 80.5% beating EPS estimates and 78.1% exceeding top-line expectations.Retail REIT GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) and residential REIT Essex Property Trust, Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report) are yet to report their numbers this earnings season. Let’s take a look at which of these REIT has an edge over the other ahead of their Q4 release on Feb 7.However, before delving deeper into figures, let's first discuss the overall scenario for the REIT industry and then the particular asset categories to which these two companies belong to.A Glance at the IndustryAdmittedly, the December rate hike and possibilities of further increases in rates this year have kept investors in the REIT space worried to some extent. This is because the use of leverage for the REIT business makes the returns from this industry susceptible to interest-rate movements. Particularly, a rise in the interest rate affects the present value of future cash flows. Therefore, asset valuation, including bond coupons and stock dividends, experiences a decline.However, apart from the rate factor, underlying asset class dynamics play a vital role in determining the operating performance of REITs. And per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — the U.S. apartment market reported moderate rent growth for the calendar year 2017 and seasonal pricing cuts in the fourth quarter. While U.S. apartment rents increased at a modest rate of 2.5% in 2017, effective rents for new leases edged down 0.9% during the quarter. Admittedly, the levels of rent growth have moderated from the earlier years. However, national apartment occupancy came in at 95.1% at the end of fourth-quarter 2017, remaining stable year over year.Also, the holiday season turned out to be blissful for the retailers with upbeat consumer sentiment amid an improving economy, rising income and low unemployment level. Per government data, consumer spending remained solid during this season, with retail sales rising 0.9% and 0.4% in November and December, respectively.However, the retail real estate market continued to bear the brunt as mall traffic suffered amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preference through online channels, resulting in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years, while others unable to cope with competition are filing bankruptcies. Additionally, the turbulent retail real estate market is said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which mall landlords find unjustified.Zacks MethodologyEarnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in the upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Price PerformanceDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, GGP Inc. outpaced Essex Property in terms of price performance. GGP Inc. rallied 12.6% compared with Essex Property’s depreciation of 5%. Notably, the month of November witnessed increased shareholder activity in the retail real estate market, triggered by Brookfield Property Partners’ takeover offer for GGP Inc.GGP 4Q Factors at PlayChicago, IL-based GGP Inc. has a solid portfolio of high-quality retail properties across attractive locations in the United States. Therefore, amid an improving economy, these retail properties have the capability to generate decent cash flows, given its cluster of renowned tenants. Nevertheless, the choppy retail real estate market with rising online sales, store closures and retailers’ bankruptcies is likely to have restrained demand for space considerably.GGP Inc. has been making efforts to counter such pressure through various initiatives. The company is focusing on omni-channel retailing to generate higher sales. Further, it is focusing on offering mall visitors with access to retail, dining and entertainment hubs in some of the best trade areas in the nation. Such strategic moves boost the shopping experience and enhance sales volume at tenant stores, consequently raising demand for the company’s assets. However, implementation of such measures requires significant upfront costs, which might impede near-term growth in profit margins.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $651.7 million, reflecting projected growth of 6.8% from the year-ago period. For fourth-quarter 2017, the company projects funds from operations (FFO) per share in the range of 46-48 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 47 cents, indicating projected growth of 9.3% year over year.Yet, over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed estimates in one occasion and met in the other three, the average positive surprise being 3.6%. This is depicted in the graph below.General Growth Properties, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  General Growth Properties, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | General Growth Properties, Inc. QuoteGGP Inc. has an Earnings ESP of -0.46%. In addition, it has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which also reduces the predictive power of ESP. (Read more: Can GGP Counter Impact of Online Retail Boom in Q4 Earnings?)Essex Property 4Q Factors to ConsiderSan Mateo, CA-based Essex Property has a strong property base and a sturdy balance sheet. The company’s substantial exposure to the West Coast market, which is home to several innovation and technology companies, is likely to offer scope to boost its top line in the quarter to be reported. Also, there is significant pent-up demand.Nonetheless, apartment deliveries remained elevated in the reported quarter. This uptick in supply is a concern because it curbs landlords’ ability to command more rent and results in lesser absorption. As such, in the fourth quarter, occupancy is likely to remain nearly unchanged. Furthermore, escalating supply in certain submarkets is expected to result in aggressive rental concessions and moderate pricing power of landlords.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $346.1 million, marking an expected increase of 5.2% year over year. Additionally, for the fourth quarter, the company estimates core FFO per share in the $2.95-$3.05 band. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $3.01, indicating 7.1% growth year over year.The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three occasions — the average beat being 0.94%, in the preceding four quarters. This is depicted in the graph below:Essex Property Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Essex Property Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Essex Property Trust, Inc. QuoteEssex Property has an Earnings ESP of -0.21% and a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. (Read more: Essex Property to Post Q4 Earnings: What's in Store?)Our TakeTherefore, per our proprietary model, we cannot conclusively predict positive surprise in terms of FFO per share for GGP Inc. and Essex Property in the fourth quarter.

189,ESS,"Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report), commonly referred as MAA, reported fourth-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) of $1.50 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.48. The figure also compared favorably with the prior-year quarter tally of $1.13.This residential REIT’s quarterly results reflected growth in same-store property net operating income (NOI) and rise in average effective rent per unit for the same-store portfolio.Rental and other property revenues came in at $382.7 million in the fourth quarter, higher than the prior-year quarter tally by 24.6%. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus estimate of $386.3 million.For full-year 2017, FFO per share came in at $5.94, up 6.3% from the prior-year tally of $5.59. This was backed by 35.9% year-over-year growth in rental and other property revenues to $1.5 billion.Quarter in DetailDuring the reported quarter, combined adjusted same-store NOI increased 2.2% compared with the prior-year quarter. This reflected 1.8% growth in revenues and 1.3% rise in operating expenses.In the large market, 1.6% growth in revenues and a 1.3% increase in expenses resulted in the company’s NOI to be up 1.7%. Again, in the secondary market, a 2.6% rise in revenues and 1.1% increase in expenses led to 3.6% growth in NOI.The quarter witnessed 1.7% year-over-year increase in average effective rent per unit. Further, during the quarter, average physical occupancy for the same-store portfolio was 96.2%, reflecting an expansion of 20 basis points from the year-earlier quarter.As of Dec 31, 2017, MAA held cash and cash equivalents of nearly $10.8 million, down from $33.5 million as of Dec 31, 2016. Furthermore, as of the same date, around $598.3 million of combined cash and capacity was available under its unsecured revolving credit facility.The Post Properties MergerDuring fourth-quarter 2017, MAA incurred a total of 5 cents per share of merger and integration costs. For full-year 2017, the company incurred 17 cents per share of merger and integration costs. Notably, it expects full consolidation of MAA and Post Properties to be accomplished later this year. Additionally, MAA continues to project expected synergies of around $20.0 million in gross overhead costs to be realized from the merger.Portfolio ActivityDuring fourth-quarter 2017, MAA purchased a newly developed 320-unit apartment community — Acklen West End — in the Downtown/West End submarket of Nashville, TN, for $71.8 million. On the other hand, the company sold two properties in the Atlanta, GA, market for aggregate proceeds of $97.4 million.At the end of the fourth quarter, MAA had three multi-family projects under development (937 units), with total projected cost of $214.0 million. Notably, an estimated $46.3 million remained to be funded as of Dec 31, 2017.OutlookMAA projects 2018 FFO per share in the range of $5.85-$6.15. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 2018 FFO per share is $6.15. For first-quarter 2018, the FFO per share is anticipated in the band of $1.38-$1.48. At present, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter FFO per share is $1.50.Our ViewpointMAA remains well poised for long-term growth, backed by its well-balanced portfolio, which is diversified in terms of markets, submarkets and price points, and is located in the growing Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States. Also, integration of the MAA and Post Properties is on track and is anticipated to significant scale and capabilities. Nevertheless, rising supply of new units in a number of markets is likely to put pressure on rental rates and adversely affect revenue growth in the near term.MAA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

190,ESS,"The U.S. apartment supply remains elevated, with fourth-quarter 2017 projected to be the peak period for deliveries. However, delays resulting from labor shortage and escalating costs could push the peak season to first-quarter 2018, as expected completion dates of a number of projects are changing to early 2018 from late 2017.Per the apartment pipeline data from Axiometrics, a RealPage Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) company, the Houston market is likely to experience a significant decline in new units in 2018, while Dallas, Atlanta, Denver and Austin markets are anticipated to see a moderation in supply. However, the Washington, DC and Los Angeles markets are likely to witness upswing in construction, while new units in New York and Seattle markets are expected to hover near the 2017 levels.This could cast a pall on residential REIT stocks like AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) and Essex Property Trust Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report).Notably, the delay in deliveries has been quite evident in the last few quarters. In fact, per a recent report from Axiometrics, 103,861 new units are marked for delivery in the third quarter, while 117,866 new units are projected to be up in the market in the fourth quarter, according to the survey as of Aug 21. This is in contrast to the data as of May 22, which estimated delivery of 112,856 units in the third quarter and 109,333 in the fourth.The figures clearly illustrate a decrease of around 9,000 units in the third-quarter schedule, thanks to the delays, and an addition of around 8,500 units to the fourth-quarter roster. The third- and fourth-quarter new unit numbers are also higher than the projections in the first of the year, when they were estimated to be 73,748 in the third quarter and 65,688 in the fourth quarter.Moreover, data as of Aug 21 suggests expected deliveries of around 381,237 new units for full-year 2017, reflecting a decline of about 13,300 units from the May 22 projections. This reveals a shift of deliveries to 2018. Along with new construction starts, identified supply for 2018 climbed and has now reached 281,139 units. Although the figure is below the anticipated volume of 2017, it is fast reaching the 2016 aggregate, and has exceeded the 2015 and 2014 tallies.Elevated supply has already affected the performance of residential REITs over the last few quarters. The anticipation of a stressed environment in the near term is also likely to affect their ability to command more rents and concession levels. Further, with some of the residential REITs’ development deliveries running behind schedule amid a delay in construction activities, lease-up net operating income is expected to be adversely affected in the near term.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

This was partly due to the delay in the delivery of new apartments. However, “periodic disruption from large concessions” is expected to continue when a number of “competing apartment communities are simultaneously in lease-up within the same submarket”. Amid this, for the next few years, management anticipates rental growth in core coastal markets to “trend near long-term averages”.Essex Property Trust, Inc.

194,ESS,"Public Storage’s (PSA  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $2.48 marked 4.6% growth from the prior-year quarter figure of $2.37. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.46.Results highlight improvement in net operating income (NOI) from both same-store and non same-store facilities. Higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot supported the company’s same-store performance. Additionally, Public Storage benefited from its expansion efforts.Quarterly revenues of $669.9 million also climbed 3.8% from the prior-year quarter. The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $668.9 million.Behind the HeadlinesSame-store revenues advanced 2.1% year over year to $549.9 million during the first quarter, while the company’s NOI inched up 1.7% to $395.9 million. The increase in same-store revenues was primarily driven by a 3.0% rise in realized annual rent per occupied square foot to $17.30. However, the weighted-average square foot occupancy of 92.3% contracted 80 basis points year over year.In addition, the company’s NOI from non-same store facilities grew on the back of the 127 self-storage facilities acquired and developed since January 2016.Portfolio ActivityIn the reported quarter, Public Storage bought two self-storage facilities, comprising 0.2 million net rentable square feet of area, for $18 million. As of Mar 31, 2018, the company was under contract to acquire three self-storage facilities, spanning 0.2 million net rentable square feet of space, for $19 million.Finally, as of Mar 31, 2018, the company had several facilities in development (2.7 million net rentable square feet), with an estimated cost of $381 million, as well as expansion projects (2.3 million net rentable square feet) worth roughly $281 million.

The amount will be paid on Jun 28 to shareholders of record as of Jun 13, 2018.In ConclusionPublic Storage is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States. The company’s acquisition and expansion efforts look promising. In addition, a solid balance sheet has enabled the company to pay sustainable dividends. However, supply has been rising in a number of its markets. This limits the company’s power to raise rents and turn on more discounting.

195,ESS,"AvalonBay Communities, Inc.’s (AVB  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $2.18 came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s core FFO per share also recorded 4.3% growth from the year-ago figure of $2.09.Total revenues of $560.8 million increased 7.4% year over year, as revenues from development communities and stabilized operating communities recorded growth. The revenue figure also came in higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $558.5 million.Results highlight growth in average rental rates. However, occupancy level declined marginally, while operating expense flared up due to property taxes, payroll and insurance costs.Quarter in Detail   For the reported quarter, average rental rates were up 2.5% year over year, while economic occupancy edged down 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues from established communities — those that have stabilized operations as of Jan 1, 2017, are neither executing nor planning any significant redevelopment work, and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year — improved 2.4% year over year, indicating increase in average rental rates but partially offset by a decline in economic occupancy.However, operating expenses for established communities escalated 5.3% on a year-over-year basis. Consequently, NOI from established communities inched up 1.2 % year over year to around $295.4 million.Notably, during the first quarter, the company accomplished the development of three communities, for an aggregate total capital cost of $287.0 million. These communities comprise a total of 770 apartment homes. Further, the company purchased two land parcels for future development, for a total investment of $57.08 million. The company intends to commence construction of apartment communities on this land this year.As of Mar 31, 2018, AvalonBay had 18 communities under construction (expected to contain in total 5,774 apartment homes and 97,000 square feet of retail space), which are anticipated to be accomplished for an estimated total capital cost of $2.65 billion. This includes the company’s share of communities being developed through joint ventures.Liquidity PositionAs of Mar 31, 2018, AvalonBay had no borrowings outstanding under its $1.5-billion unsecured credit facility. The company had around $271.4 million in unrestricted cash and cash in escrow as of that date. In addition, the company’s annualized net debt-to-core EBITDA for first-quarter 2018 was 5.1 times.OutlookFor second-quarter 2018, AvalonBay expects core FFO per share of $2.16-$2.22. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $2.21.In ConclusionAvalonBay is well poised to grow on the back of its solid portfolio of high-quality assets in premium locations. Furthermore, the company has a healthy balance sheet. Moreover, stellar job growth in recent months indicates more household formations and raises expectations for higher apartment demand during the peak leasing period.Nevertheless, there is presence of elevated supply in a number of the company’s markets. In addition, high concession activity amid elevated supply remains a concern. Hence, growth in its stabilized portfolio is likely to remain modest in the upcoming period. Rate hike remains another concern.AvalonBay currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. AvalonBay Communities, Inc.

Moreover, total revenues improved 3.6% to $304.1 million year over year.Notably, the company registered new leasing spreads of 15.6%.

The company projects FFO per share at $1.42-$1.46, similar to the previous guidance. This is based on same-property NOI growth (excluding redevelopments) projections of 1.5-2.00%, net disposition estimations of $700-$900 million, and total redevelopment & development investment of $425-$525 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2018 FFO per share is currently pegged at $1.44.Share Repurchase ProgramThe company repurchased 1.6 million shares of common stock for $24.3 million under its $300-million share-repurchase program in the first quarter.  Our ViewpointWe are impressed by Kimco’s performance which indicates higher leasing spreads, same-property NOI and occupancy. In addition, the company remains on track with its strategic 2020 Vision, which envisages the disposal of non-strategic assets and ownership of premium assets in major metro markets in the United States. Further, its share buyback program raises optimism.Nevertheless, shrinking footfall at malls amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers are expected to hurt this retail REIT’s performance.

Further, the company’s investments in high-growth markets are anticipated to boost its leasing metrics.Nonetheless, the company faces stiff competition from other market players.

However, the figure narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $346.5 million.In 2018, management expects housing demand to surpass supply in coastal markets of California and Washington.

Specifically, West Coast is anticipated to outdo the nation both in terms of rent growth as well as job growth in the year.For full-year 2017, core FFO per share came in at $11.91, 7.9% ahead of the prior-year tally of $11.04.

As of Feb 2, 2018, the company had around $891.0 million in undrawn capacity on its unsecured credit facilities.During the fourth quarter, the company issued 33,571 shares of common stock at an average price of $261.19 through its equity distribution program for net proceeds of $8.7 million.

The company’s funds from operations (FFO) per share and revenues are anticipated to increase year over year.In the prior quarter, this San Mateo, CA-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) generated a positive surprise of 0.68% in terms of FFO per share. Results reflected solid growth in revenues.Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three occasions — the average beat being 0.94%. This is depicted in the graph below:Essex Property Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Essex Property Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Essex Property Trust, Inc. QuoteFor the fourth quarter, the company estimates core FFO per share in the $2.95-$3.05 range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $3.01.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors That Might Influence Q4 ResultsPer a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — the U.S. apartment market reported moderate rent growth for the calendar year 2017 and seasonal pricing cuts in the fourth quarter. While U.S. apartment rents increased at a modest rate of 2.5% in 2017, effective rents for new leases edged down 0.9% during the quarter. Admittedly, the levels of rent growth have moderated from the earlier years. However, national apartment occupancy came in at 95.1% at the end of fourth-quarter 2017, remaining stable year over year.Essex has a strong property base and a sturdy balance sheet. The company’s substantial exposure to the West Coast market, which is home to several innovation and technology companies, is likely to offer scope to boost its top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, there is significant pent-up demand.However, apartment deliveries remained elevated in the reported quarter. This elevated supply is a concern because it curbs landlords’ ability to command more rent and results in lesser absorption. As such, in the to-be-reported quarter, occupancy is likely to remain nearly unchanged. Furthermore, escalating supply in certain submarkets is expected to result in aggressive rental concessions and moderate pricing power of landlords.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $346.1 million, marking an expected increase of 5.2% year over year.Moreover, in a month’s time, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the fourth quarter inched up 0.3% to $3.01, highlighting analysts’ bullish sentiments.However, Essex Property’s shares have descended 13.8% in the past six months, underperforming the industry’s decline of 10.5%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Essex Property will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP is pegged at -0.04%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Essex Property has a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.  We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around:CubeSmart (CUBE  -  Free Report), slated to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 15, has an Earnings ESP of +1.10% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

200,ESS,"With the Q2 earnings season on its last leg, this is the right time to gauge the performance of the real estate investment trust (REIT) industry.Admittedly, rate hikes and a cautious approach of investors have affected gains in this industry so far this year. However, investors need to keep in mind that operating performance of this special hybrid asset is highly determined by the dynamics of the individual asset categories. A number of asset categories displayed strength in second-quarter 2017, with the economy and the job market showing signs of recovery.In fact, per a NAREIT media release, occupancy rates remained high in the second quarter, while funds from operations (“FFO”), a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs, reported growth.Specifically, the Q2 scorecard reveals that the total FFO of the listed U.S Equity REIT industry of $15.6 billion in the reported quarter increased 7.9% sequentially. The figure also came in 7.3% higher than the prior-year quarter tally.Same-store net operating income (NOI) reported 3.3% year-over-year growth. Results were driven by segments like Single Family Homes, Data Centers and Manufactured Home Communities, which witnessed robust same-store NOI growth of 6.8%, 5.8% and 5.7%, respectively.Furthermore, properties owned by the listed Equity REITs enjoyed solid occupancy levels. In fact, the occupancy rate remained unchanged at 93.4%, slightly below the record high occupancy rate of 93.7% recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2016.Admittedly, growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data is not only helping tech companies, but also driving demand for data center REITs. Moreover, the industrial asset category hogged the limelight for experiencing high demand, with the economy and job market displaying signs of recovery, ecommerce gaining strength, and the manufacturing environment remaining healthy.Also, the residential real estate market benefited from healthy demand levels and a delay in deliveries that kept the supply number in check. No doubt, the shrinking mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales kept retail REITs on tenterhooks. However, retail REITs managed to grab attention from new and productive tenants, and were able to replace with the ones which departed.Among the S&P 500 REIT constituents, data center REIT Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR  -  Free Report) and industrial REIT Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) delivered better-than-expected results in the quarter, with positive surprises of nearly 3.4% and 7.7%, respectively, in terms of FFO per share. Also, retail REIT Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) and residential REIT Essex Property Trust, Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report) surpassed estimates, registering positive surprise of 1.2% and around 1.7%, respectively.Currently, Digital Realty, Prologis, Simon Property Group and Essex Property carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Also, improved economy and job market strengths are likely to act as a catalyst and drive demand for apartments in the company’s markets in the quarter in review.However, although apartment deliveries may not peak in the quarter, the figure remains consistently high in the West Coast submarkets. Also, there is aggressive rental concessions provided at newly developed communities. This is expected to continue and moderate pricing power.In addition, the company expects expenses to increase in the second quarter. Furthermore, due to capital markets activities, interest expense is predicted to be higher.Nevertheless, over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the second quarter inched up 0.3% to $2.92, reflecting analysts’ bullish sentiments on the stock.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Essex Property will beat estimates this season.

202,ESS,"Defying concerns about supply in the market, the residential real estate market is back with a bang driven by robust demand levels. Per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report), the second-quarter demand level of 175,645 apartments across the nation marked one-third increase from the level witnessed a year ago.This helped occupancy to remain high at 95.0% as of mid-year and led to stabilization in the annual pace of rent growth, which came in at 3.6%, close to 3.7% growth experienced in the first quarter. Notably, job formation and checked move-outs for buying homes acted as the catalyst.But not all residential REITs are equally poised to gain, as location of properties play a crucial role in determining the demand of properties.However, one such residential REIT stock which has been displaying strength is Essex Property Trust, Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report). This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 13.1% year to date, outperforming the 5.6% increase of the industry it belongs to. Furthermore, funds from operations (“FFO”) per share estimates for third-quarter and full-year 2017 moved north over the past seven days.This San Mateo, CA-based residential REIT is likely to well leverage on favorable demographic trends in its markets. In fact, demographic growth continues to be strong in the young-adult age cohort, which has a higher propensity to rent. This age cohort also experiences a considerable part of the net job growth and provides a significant source of pent-up demand.Moreover, despite the supply issue plaguing the market earlier, the company continues to display robust fundamentals and improving prospects. The company reported core FFO per share of $2.97 for second-quarter 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.92. Core FFO per share also improved 8.4% from the year-ago quarter figure of $2.74. Results reflect solid growth in revenues.The company has also raised its outlook for full-year 2017. It projects core FFO per share in the range of $11.70–$11.96 from $11.56–$11.96 guided earlier, marking an increase of 7 cents at the mid-point.Further, the company revised estimates for same-property gross revenue growth to 3.2–4.0% from the prior range of 3.0–4.0%, indicating an uptick of 10 bps at the mid-point. Same-property net operating income (NOI) is now guided in the band of 3.3–4.6% from the previous range of 2.8–4.6%, marking a 30 bps expansion to the mid-point. Further, Essex has a 23-year history of increasing cash dividend.Why a Solid Choice?Same Property NOI Growth: Essex Property has been experiencing solid growth in same property NOI. In fact, per a presentation by the company, since 2012 through 2016, its same property NOI witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.9%, well ahead of 5.5% growth recorded by the peer average. This trend is likely to continue in 2017 as well, with the company raising the NOI expectation for the present year.FFO Per Share Growth: Essex Property delivered an earnings surprise of 1.71% in the last reported quarter. In three of the trailing four quarters, the company delivered a positive surprise, with an average beat of 1.23%.Its historical FFO per share growth (3–5 years) of 7.34% comes above the industry average of 4.05%. This momentum is anticipated to continue in the near term as indicated by the  projected FFO per share growth (F1/F0) of 7.39% for the company compared to the industry average rate of 3.71%. This, in turn, highlights Essex Property’s bright prospects.Superior ROE: Essex Property’s Return on Equity (ROE) is 11.5% compared with the industry’s average of 10.5%. This reflects that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to the industry.Strong Leverage: The debt-to-equity ratio for Essex Property is 0.88 compared with the industry average of 0.95.

203,ESS,"AvalonBay Communities, Inc.’s (AVB  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $2.25 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The company’s core FFO per share also recorded 6.1% growth from the year-ago figure of $2.12.Total revenues of $555.3 million increased 7.1% year over year as revenues from development communities and stabilized operating communities recorded growth. The figure also compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $555.2 million.Results highlight growth in average rental rates. Additionally, economic occupancy managed to increase slightly in the quarter. The company also announced a hike in quarterly dividend.For full-year 2017, core FFO per share came in at $8.62, up 5.3% from the prior-year tally of $8.19. This was backed by 5.5% year-over-year growth in total revenues to nearly $2.2 billion.Quarter in Detail   For the reported quarter, average rental rates were up 2.1% year over year, while economic occupancy inched up 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues from established communities — those that stabilized operations as of Jan 1, 2016, are neither executing nor planning any significant redevelopment work and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year — improved 2.2% year over year, indicating increase in average rental rates and economic occupancy.However, operating expenses for established communities flared up 2.7% on a year-over-year basis. Consequently, NOI from established communities rose 2.0% year over year to around $282.7 million.Notably, in the fourth quarter, the company acquired 850 Boca (containing 370 apartment homes), in Boca Raton, FL, for $138.0 million. The purchase denoted the company's entry into the Southeast Florida metropolitan region.As of Dec 31, 2017, AvalonBay had 21 communities under construction (expected to contain in total 6,544 apartment homes and 97,000 square feet of retail space), which are anticipated to be accomplished for an estimated total capital cost of $2.9 billion.

The new dividend will be paid on Apr 16 to stockholders of record on Mar 29, 2018.In ConclusionAvalonBay’s better-than-expected performance in the fourth quarter and the hike in dividend look encouraging. The company is well poised to grow on the back of its solid portfolio of high-quality assets in premium locations. Furthermore, the company has a healthy balance sheet. Nevertheless, there is presence of elevated supply in a number of the company’s markets. Hence, growth in its stabilized portfolio is likely to remain modest in the upcoming period.

In addition, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $623.7 million.Per management, solid and steady rental demand across the company’s markets was supported by favorable demographics, low unemployment level and rising wages. However, 2018 is anticipated to witness high levels of new supply, leading to decreased pricing power as well as decelerating revenue growth.For full-year 2017, normalized FFO per share came in at $3.13, ahead of the prior-year tally of $3.09. This was backed by 1.9% year-over-year growth in total revenues to nearly $2.5 billion.Quarter in DetailSame-store revenues (includes 72,529 apartment units) were up 2.2% year over year to $590.4 million, while expenses climbed 2.5% year over year to $169.6 million.

Also, expense is projected to flare up 3.5-4.5%.Dividend UpdateCurrently, Equity Residential expects to declare first quarter common share dividend of 54 cents per share. This reflects an annualized hike of 7.2% from the amount paid in 2017.Our ViewpointEquity Residential’s better-than-expected performance in the fourth quarter is impressive.

The company’s current focus is on the acquisition and development of assets primarily in the six core coastal metropolitan areas — Boston, New York, Washington D.C., Southern California, San Francisco and Seattle.

Portfolio occupancy of 98.5% as of Jun 30, 2017 expanded 20 basis points (bps) sequentially and 50 bps year over year.Further, the company had 76 properties available for lease, out of a total of 5,028 properties in the portfolio as of Jun 30, 2017, compared with 83 properties as of Mar 31, 2017. Moreover, during the reported quarter, the company re-leased 53 properties to existing and new tenants, recapturing 113.2% of the expiring rent.Portfolio ActivityDuring the reported quarter, Realty Income invested $321.2 million in 73 new properties and properties under development or expansion, situated in 27 states. The assets are fully leased, with a weighted average lease term of around 13 years and an initial average cash lease yield of 6.6%. Notably, around 33% of the rental revenues from acquisitions during first six months of 2017 are from investment grade rated tenants.On the other hand, during the reported quarter, the company sold 15 properties for $12.8 million, with a gain on sales of $2.8 million.LiquidityFinally, Realty Income exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $12.2 million, up from $11.9 million at the end of the prior year.However, the company has a $2.25 billion unsecured credit facility, comprising $2.0 billion revolving credit facility and a $250 million five-year unsecured term loan.

206,ESS,"With a strong property base and solid balance sheet, Essex Property Trust (ESS  -  Free Report) is likely to leverage on favorable demographic trends in its markets. The company’s West Coast exposure offers ample scope to boost top line over the long term. Moreover, it has raised the dividend every year since its IPO in 1994. However, aggressive rental concessions and moderate pricing power amid high supply remain concerns. Also, rate hike adds to its woes for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.Essex’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for full-year 2017 has been revised upward by one cent per share, in the last 60 days.Shares of Essex have outperformed the industry it belongs to, so far this year. The company’s shares have gained 4.5%, while the industry has recorded growth of 2.5%.The company’s substantial exposure to the West Coast market, which is home to several innovation and technology companies, bodes well for its top line. Though there are near-term concerns about potential slowdown in the technology industries, with the growing use of technology in every sphere of life, the region is expected to experience growth in wage levels over the long term. Therefore, apartments situated in the centers of technology and innovations are likely to gain from higher demand and poised to deliver decent growth in rent over the long term.Further, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest attraction for REIT investors and Essex Property has been steadily raising its payout. In fact, the company has raised its dividend every year since the IPO in 1994, thereby generating a compound annual dividend per share growth of 6.4%. These moves instill investors’ confidence on the stock.However, the company has a significant concentration of assets in Southern California, Northern California and the Seattle metropolitan area. Specifically, 83% of the company’s rental revenues were generated from communities located in California for the year ended Dec 31, 2016. This makes the company’s operating results and financial conditions susceptible to any unfavorable fluctuation in local markets.Also, a hike in interest rates can pose a challenge for Essex. Essentially, rising rates imply higher borrowing costs for the company, which would affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate.Better-ranked stocks in the real estate investment trust (REIT) space include BRT Realty Trust (BRT  -  Free Report), Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report) and Reis (REIS  -  Free Report).  All three carry a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

The figure was higher than 76 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Results reflected enhanced same-store net operating income (NOI) and lease-up NOI.

In addition, the reported figure came in 2.3% higher than the prior-year quarter tally of $248.9 million.Quarter in DetailSame-store revenues increased 2.8% year over year to $148.2 million, while expenses edged down 1.1% year over year to $42.3 million.

However, total revenues of $550.5 million managed to exceed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $538.5 million.Results highlight modest growth in average rental rates. Economic occupancy managed to increase only slightly in the quarter.Nevertheless, the company’s core FFO per share recorded 5.8% growth from the year-ago figure of $2.07. This was driven by growth in net operating income (NOI) from existing, acquired and newly developed operating communities.Also, total revenues increased 6.6% year over year as revenues from development communities and stabilized operating communities recorded growth.AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | AvalonBay Communities, Inc. QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Quarter in Detail   For the reported quarter, average rental rates were up 2.0% year over year, with the highest growth in the Pacific North West portfolio (4.1%), followed by the South California (3.8%) and New England (2.3%) portfolios. Economic occupancy inched up 0.2% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues from established communities — those that stabilized operations as of Jan 1, 2016, are neither executing nor planning any significant redevelopment work and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year — improved 2.2% year over year, indicating increase in average rental rates.However, operating expenses for established communities flared up 2.4% on a year-over-year basis. Consequently, NOI from established communities rose 2.1% year over year to around $279.0 million.Notably, in the third quarter, the company acquired The Lodge Denver West, in Lakewood, CO, (252 apartment homes) for roughly $76.8 million. The acquisition marked the company's entry into the Denver metropolitan area.As of Sep 30, 2017, AvalonBay had 23 communities under construction (expected to contain 6,888 apartment homes in total), which are anticipated to be completed for an estimated total capital cost of $3.2 billion. This includes the company's share of communities being developed through joint ventures.Liquidity PositionAs of Sep 30, 2017, AvalonBay had $242.0 million outstanding under its $1.5-billion unsecured credit facility. The company had around $217.1 million in unrestricted cash and cash in escrow as of that date.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $8.43.In ConclusionAvalonBay is well poised to grow on the back of its solid portfolio of high-quality assets in premium locations. Furthermore, the company has a healthy balance sheet. Nevertheless, there is presence of elevated supply in a number of the company’s markets. Hence, growth in its stabilized portfolio is likely to remain modest in the upcoming period. Additionally, delay in construction activities in the development portfolio is likely to affect the company’s lease-up NOI in the near term. Rate hike add to its woes.AvalonBay currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

The figure came in higher than 78 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Results mirror enhanced same-store net operating income (NOI) and lease-up NOI.

216,ESS,"The U.S. apartment market reported a stable rent growth, while occupancy remained healthy in the third quarter, per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report). For new leases, effective rents inched up 0.9% during the quarter and 2.6% annually. Also, apartment occupancy came in at 95.5% for the third quarter across the country’s top 100 metros.However, not all residential REITs are equally poised to gain, as location of properties play a crucial role in determining the demand of properties.Nonetheless, one such residential REIT stock which has been displaying strength is Essex Property Trust, Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report). This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 11.3% year to date, outperforming 5.4% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.This San Mateo, CA-based residential REIT is likely to well leverage on favorable demographic trends in its markets. In fact, demographic growth continues to be strong in the young-adult age cohort, which has a higher propensity to rent. This age cohort also experiences a considerable part of the net job growth and provides a significant source of pent-up demand. Moreover, despite the supply issue plaguing the market currently, the company continues to exhibit robust fundamentals and improving prospects.Why a Solid Choice?Same Property NOI Growth: Essex Property has been experiencing solid growth in same property NOI. In fact, per a presentation by the company, since 2012 through 2016, its same property NOI witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.9%, well ahead of 5.7% growth recorded by the peer average. This trend is likely to continue in 2017 as well, with the company raising the NOI expectation for the current year.FFO Per share Growth: Essex Property delivered an earnings surprise of 1.71% in the last reported quarter. In three of the trailing four quarters, the company delivered a positive surprise, the average beat being 1.23%. In addition, its historical FFO per share growth (3-5 years) of 13% comes above the industry average of 6.3%.Estimate Revisions: The stock has also seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year funds from operations (FFO) per share being revised 0.3% upward in two months’ time, reflecting analysts’ bullish sentiments. Given its progress on fundamentals, the stock is likely to keep performing well in the quarters ahead.Dividend Payout: Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest attraction for REIT investors and Essex Property has been steadily raising its payout. In fact, the company has raised the dividend every year since the IPO in 1994, thereby generating a compound annual dividend per share growth of 6.4%. These moves boost investors’ confidence on the stock.Superior ROE: Essex Property’s Return on Equity (ROE) is 8.03% compared with the industry’s average of 3.48%. This reflects that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to the industry.Strong Leverage: The debt-to-equity ratio for Essex Property is 0.88 compared with the industry average of 0.98. This mirrors the financial stability of the company and lesser risk for shareholders.Other Key PicksOther similarly-ranked stocks in the Residential REIT industry are Equity LifeStyle Properties, Inc. (ELS  -  Free Report) and Starwood Waypoint Homes .

217,ESS,"The U.S. apartment supply remains elevated and there seems to be no respite any time soon. While fourth-quarter 2017 was earlier projected to be the peak period for deliveries, delays stemming from labor shortage and escalating costs continue to push the delivery schedule to 2018.According to the apartment pipeline data from Axiometrics, a RealPage Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) company, for an estimated 56,186 units, delivery has been postponed to the next year, up from 50,658 units delayed from 2016 to 2017, and 14,805 units from 2015 to 2016. Particularly, the numbers of projects, the completion dates of which are changing to 2018 from 2017, are escalating “week by week, month by month.”The delayed figure has been based on a formula using prior year’s delay percentage as a base. Particularly, Dallas, New York and Houston are slated to have “most units delayed into 2018.” These are also the metros with the maximum marked supply for 2017, per that report.Moreover, data, as of Sep 18, suggests expected deliveries of around 370,582 new units for full-year 2017, reflecting a decline of about 11,655 units from the Aug 21 projections. This reveals a shift of deliveries to 2018. Along with new construction starts, identified supply for 2018 climbed 16,729 units and has now reached 298,068 units.This could cast a pall on residential REIT stocks like AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) and Essex Property Trust Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report). In fact, performance of residential REITs over the last few quarters has already been affected by elevated level of supply of new units. Now, the anticipation of a continuation of the stressed environment into 2018 is also likely to impact the occupancy levels, as well as landlords’ ability to command more rents and concession levels.In addition, with some of the residential REITs’ development deliveries running behind schedule amid a delay in construction activities, lease-up net operating income is expected to be adversely affected in the near term.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

218,ESS,"Essex Property Trust, Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1, after the market closes.In the prior quarter, this San Mateo, CA-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) generated a positive surprise of 1.71% in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share. Results reflected solid growth in revenues.Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three occasions — the average beat being 1.23%. This is depicted in the graph below:Essex Property Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Essex Property Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Essex Property Trust, Inc. QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.For third-quarter 2017, the company estimates core FFO per share in the $2.88-$2.98 range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $2.97.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderEssex has a strong property base and a sturdy balance sheet. The company’s substantial exposure to the West Coast market, which is home to several innovation and technology companies, is likely to offer scope to boost its top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Improved economy and job market strengths are anticipated to act as a catalyst and drive demand for apartments in the company’s markets in the quarter.Notably, per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report), the U.S. apartment market reported stable rent growth, while occupancy remained healthy in the third quarter. However, the levels of rent growth have moderated from the previous years. For new leases, effective rents moved up 0.9% during the quarter and 2.6%, annually. Further, apartment occupancy came in at 95.5% for the third quarter across the country’s top 100 metros.However, although apartment deliveries have not yet reached peak levels due to delay in delivery, the supply remained elevated in the third quarter. This elevated supply is a concern because it curbs landlords’ ability to command more rent and results in lesser absorption.As such, in the to-be-reported quarter, occupancy is likely to remain nearly unchanged. Furthermore, escalating supply in certain submarkets is expected to result in aggressive rental concessions and moderate pricing power of landlords.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $342.1 million, marking an expected increase of 3.9% year over year.Moreover, in a week’s time, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the third quarter inched up 0.3% to $2.97, highlighting analysts’ bullish sentiments.Essex Property’s shares have rallied 12.9% year to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 5.1%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Essex Property will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is pegged at -0.18%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Essex Property currently has a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative ESP makes our surprise prediction difficult.  We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report), slated to release third-quarter results on Nov 1, has an Earnings ESP of +2.96% and a Zacks Rank of 2.
