0,IFF,"Stocks in the REIT Leaders screen rarely make major moves, unless something happens that rocks the industry. That's exactly why Gramercy Property Trust (GPT), a key player in the warehouse REIT field, showed unusual action as it soared 15% Monday.The real estate investment trust agreed to a buyout offer from Blackstone Group (BX) that's valued at $7.6 billion. Affiliates of Blackstone offered $27.50 per share for Gramercy, which owns warehouses in the U.S. and Europe that it leases to companies.Gramercy has been increasing its industrial assets, which are now about 80% of the company's portfolio. The rest covers office space and specialty retail. In 2015, less than half of the properties were industrial. Buildings are in major metropolitan areas such as Chicago, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Dallas.The growth of online commerce has expanded the need for warehousing and logistics. Last year, Gramercy announced a joint venture to acquire and manage distribution centers specifically for online retailing, where demand for warehouse space is strong.In a presentation last month, Gramercy said some of its largest tenants are FedEx (FDX), gym operator Life Time Fitness, Bank of America (BAC) and Amazon.com (AMZN).Last month, logistics company Prologis (PLD) agreed to acquire logistics real estate company DCT Industrial Trust for $8.4 billion, including debt. DCT owns 71 million square feet of space.The deal underscores demand for warehousing space, and suggests other deals may be coming.Blackstone and Gramercy have both been in IBD's Dividend Leaders and REIT Leaders screens thanks to solid dividend yields and dividend growth rates.Blackstone has an annualized dividend yield of nearly 7%. The firm is one of the largest investment advisory and management firms in the world.RELATED:Athenahealth Confirms Takeover Bid; IFF, Blackstone Clinch DealsTop Dividend Company Aims For Online-Retail WarehousesInside Big Cap 20

10,IFF,"Propelled by the overall market, U.S. diversified stock mutual funds notched a 0.78% gain on average in April. The month's modest gain was far better than the losses of January and February.But it lagged the 1.7% gain by the average U.S. taxable bond fund tracked by Lipper Inc.Going forward, mutual fund managers expect more volatility, and many are looking for stocks with stable earnings growth that can thrive without a tailwind from a robust economy.In the just-completed month, multicap value funds did best among the mutual fund market capitalization and style categories.The key impetus was the Federal Reserve's dovish stance on interest rate hikes.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month Leaders In a late March speech, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the central bank would ""proceed cautiously in adjusting policy"" in 2016. In its April meeting, the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee stuck by Yellen's March outlook and declined again to raise rates.""Economic activity appears to have slowed,"" the FOMC said, adding that household spending had ""moderated.""Those statements told investors that the Fed thinks U.S. economic growth is slower than previously believed. Slower growth and slower rate hikes mean a weaker U.S. dollar.""That helps U.S. exporters, which is good news for many U.S. large-cap stocks,"" said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer of Charles Schwab Investment Management.And a weaker dollar lowers the cost of paying off debt for most emerging markets, making it easier for them buy goods and services from the U.S. and others.Putting it bluntly, the Fed did not want to break a fragile U.S. economy by raising the price of money. ""The more dovish tone by the Fed brought down market volatility and helped support all of the assets that have been hurt in anticipation of Fed rate hikes,"" said Mark Hamilton, chief investment officer for asset allocation at OppenheimerFunds.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance Jittery investors lifted precious metals funds 28.76% in April, best among sectors. Energy funds and natural resources funds, which had lost 41.45% and 20.54% respectively in the two years that ended March 31, were the next-best-performing April sectors, jumping 11.62% and 10.46% last month.World equity funds gained 1.33% in April, led by Latin American funds' 6.59% leap up.Taxable bond funds were paced by high-yield funds' 2.89% advance. With investors willing to take on risk, safe-haven general U.S. Treasury funds slipped 0.33%.""I expect mediocre returns and a fair amount of volatility going forward,"" Hamilton said. When the Fed finally does get around to its next rate hike, volatility is likely to rise, he said.Broadly, he expects the U.S. economy to outperform for several quarters. That should benefit U.S. large caps.James Abate, chief investment officer of Centre Funds and manager of $158 million Centre American Select Equity (DHAMX), expects a reversal of the recent months' rotation into value away from growth.""Materials, energy, industrials and other cyclical sectors are likely to reverse,"" Abate said. ""So we've taken the opportunity to amplify our positions in stable-growth-type companies, Nifty 50 type names. Key stocks for us are names like Amazon (AMZN), PepsiCo (PEP), Exelon (EXC) and Carnival Cruise (CCL). We sold the one energy stock that we held.""Amazon is the epitome of what he's looking for. ""It is strong and has a unique business model that can grow regardless of the economic backdrop,"" he said.Exelon is a utility with low cyclicality, he said. Its current return on equity is about 9%. ""This is roughly half its 15 year median return on equity,"" he said. ""We see incremental ROE moving higher with plenty of room to expand. With the Pepco (acquisition) closing, we see an increased focus on cost-cutting and rate relief in the regulated utility units contributing to profit margin expansion, with a strong balance sheet to allow future dividend hikes and buybacks.""Equally good, the stock is virtually unaffected by economic developments in Japan or Europe, he said.He also likes the idea that Carnival has almost nowhere to go but up from its depressed profit margins and returns on capital.And he adds Merck (MRK), which he calls another low-cyclicality, defensive name. ""It's got a strong drug pipeline,"" he said. ""It's seeing improvements in return on assets. It can be another Nifty 50 name.""Abate has stayed underweight in energy, industrials and financials. ""In materials, our exposure is to companies that are capable of growing and are not dependent on an acceleration in the global economy,"" he said. In that area, his names include Vulcan Materials (VMC) and International Flavors & Fragrances (IFF).Abate says value stocks are unlikely to add a lot to gains they've scored already this year. ""So I'm embracing companies that are more stable and less sensitive to the ups and downs of the economic cycle,"" he said.He also does not rule out a correction of 20% to 25% some time during 2016, and his fund has hedged that possibility with put options.""Profits are disappointing,"" he said. ""Profit margins are decelerating. And there's a poor top-line revenue outlook. It's hard to see price-earnings multiples expand further.""Like Aguilar, Abate expects volatility the rest of this year. The best gains should be confined to a narrow band of stocks, he says. ""With bond yields low and other asset classes disappointing, we'll see a new Nifty 50 do well,"" he said. ""Diversification is good, but over-diversification can be bad. We're down to 52, down from the mid-60s in 2013.""Polaris Capital Management's Bernard Horn, lead or co-manager of five funds totaling $3.4 billion in assets, is concerned about the impact of sluggish economic growth. He used volatility in recent months to buy shares in larger U.S. and foreign banks at depressed prices, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM). ""The valuation became compelling,"" he said.He also added to asset manager Franklin Resources (BEN). ""They have great long-term performance, but have slumped in the last three to five years. We saw an opportunity to buy into a good long-term franchise with a lot of cash on its balance sheet. They have a relatively low tax rate because they have managers who sit offshore, like Mark Mobius,"" who's based in Hong Kong as executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group.Horn also added to Web.com Group (WEB), which creates and maintains websites for small businesses. ""They help small businesses get onto social media sites,"" he said. ""A business they just bought does sophisticated marketing and lead-generation for customers.""Another he added to was electronics and technology distributor Avnet (AVT), a company which also assembles products for customers. ""They've got a good management team that squeezes out free cash flow and value-added services for customers,"" Horn said.In Q1, he added to Thailand-based Siam Commercial Bank. The investment may not ripen quickly, he says. ""The Thai economy is a little soft now, so this may take time to play out,"" he said.

24,IFF,"On Jul 6, we issued an updated research report on International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF  -  Free Report). While International Flavors & Fragrances is well poised to benefit from growing demand for flavors and fragrances, product innovation, acquired assets and expansion in emerging nations, higher costs along with huge debt levels remain headwinds. Better-than-expected Q1 International Flavors reported better-than-expected results for the first quarter of 2018, delivering a positive earnings surprise of 7%. Adjusted earnings in the reported quarter improved 11% year over year to $1.69 per share. Upbeat Outlook for 2018 and Beyond For 2018, International Flavors anticipates gaining from its efforts to cut costs, make strategic investments and expand businesses globally. It anticipates achieving the upper-end of its previously-issued sales and operating income growth projections of 6-8% and 6.5-8.5%, respectively. On a currency-neutral basis, sales growth is predicted to be 3-5% and operating income growth is projected to be 5-7%. Earnings per share are anticipated to increase 5.5-7.5% or 4-6% on a constant-currency basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 is currently pegged at $6.29, reflecting year-over-year growth of 6.8%. In the 2016-2020 timeframe, the company anticipates local currency sales to grow 4-6% while predicts operating income and earnings per share to expand 7-9% and more than 10%, respectively. Results will benefit from business expansion in emerging markets and growth opportunities stemming from acquired assets. Capital spending will be 3-3.5% of net sales. Shareholders will be rewarded with returns amounting 50-60% of net income. Strategic Initiatives a Boon The company’s concerted efforts to innovate products by a dedicated research and development wing will be a catalyst. Notably, the company’s introduction of Veraspice — a fragrance ingredient; Re-Imagine — programs that enable the company to pursue unaddressed opportunities in the food and beverage industry as well as assist it in innovation initiatives; and Tastepoint — a new company formed to serve middle-market customers are worth mentioning here. Further, the company has been working on its multi-year productivity program, anticipated to yield annualized savings of $40-$45 million by the end of 2019. These programs are predicted to help the company reduce its global workforce by 5%, reduce costs, make suitable investments and expand business globally. Acquisitions to be Catalysts Over time, the company has reinforced its product portfolio and leveraged business opportunities through the addition of assets. The buyouts of David Michael & Company in October 2016, Fragrance Resources in January 2017 and PowderPure in April 2017 are worth mentioning in this regard. In May 2018, the company signed an agreement to combine its operations with Frutarom. While anticipated to be neutral to earnings per share in the initial year of the deal closure, this buyout is predicted to yield double-digits earnings accretion for the second year. Moreover, run-rate cost synergies of $145 million are predicted to be realized by the third year. For 2016-2020 timeframe, the company anticipates acquisitions to generate approximately $500 million to $1 billion in revenues. Higher Costs & Expenses to Dent Margins International Flavors is dealing with adverse impacts of rising costs and operating expenses. Notably, the company’s cost of sales in the last five years (2013-2017) grew at 2.8% (CAGR) while its operating expenses (including adjusted selling, general and administrative as well as research and development expenses) went up 2.4%. The trend continued in the first quarter of 2018 as well, with costs and sales, and operating expenses increasing 13% and 7.6% from their respective tallies in the year-ago comparable quarter. Unwarranted rise in costs and expenses will prove detrimental to the company’s margins and profitability. High Leverage a Concern International Flavors is a highly leveraged company. In the last five years (2013-2017), the company’s long-term debt has soared 11.8% (CAGR) while grew roughly 2.7% sequentially to $1,676 million at the end of first-quarter 2018. Moreover, the company’s total debt/total equity has increased from 63.6% in 2013 to 96.6% in 2017. It was 94.2% at the end of first-quarter 2018. High-debt levels can inflate the company’s financial obligations and put pressure on margins.  In the last three months, International Flavors’ shares have declined 8%, against 2% growth recorded by the industry. International Flavors currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks in the sector include KMG Chemicals, Inc. (KMG  -  Free Report), Domtar Corporation (UFS  -  Free Report) and Methanex Corporation (MEOH  -  Free Report). All three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. KMG Chemicals has expected long-term growth rate of 28.5%. Its shares have appreciated 26% over the past three months. Domtar has expected long-term growth rate of 5%. Its shares have gained 11% over the three months. Methanex Corporation has a long-term earnings growth rate of 15%. Its shares have appreciated 13% over the past three months. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think. See This Ticker Free >>

25,IFF,"We issued an updated research report on International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF  -  Free Report) on Jun 11.This industrial gas producer and supplier currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Its market capitalization is approximately $10 billion.We briefly discussed the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds below.Factors Favoring International Flavors & FragrancesDiversity and Strategic Initiatives a Boon: International Flavors serves a wide range of customers, including manufacturers of perfume and toiletry, soaps, detergents, fabric care, household cleaners and air fresheners. Also, the company’s businesses are spread in North America; Europe, Africa and the Middle East; Latin America and Greater Asia. Such diversification helps the company to negate weaknesses in one or more business sources or operating areas.In addition to diversity, the company’s diligent efforts to innovate products, by a dedicated research and development wing, will be advantageous. Notably, the company’s introduction of Veraspice — a fragrance ingredient; Re-Imagine — programs that enable the company to pursue unaddressed opportunities in the food and beverage industry as well as assist the company in its innovation initiatives; and Tastepoint — a new company formed to serve middle-market customers are worth mentioning here.Also, the company has been working on its multi-year productivity program, anticipated to yield annualized savings of $40-$45 million by the end of 2019. These programs are predicted to help the company reduce its global workforce by 5%, reduce costs, make suitable investments and expand business globally.Acquisitions: Another interesting aspect about International Flavors is its acquisitive nature. Over time, the company has solidified its product portfolio and leveraged business opportunities through the addition of assets. Here, buyouts of David Michael & Company in October 2016, Fragrance Resources in January 2017 and PowderPure in April 2017 are worth mentioning.In May 2018, the company signed an agreement to combine its operations with Frutarom. While anticipated to be neutral to earnings per share in the initial year of the deal closure, this buyout is predicted to yield double-digits earnings accretion for the second year. Also, run-rate cost synergies of $145 million are predicted to be realized by the third year.For 2016-2020 timeframe, the company anticipates acquisitions to generate approximately $500 million to $1 billion in revenues.Growth Projections: For 2018, International Flavors anticipates achieving better sales and operating income results. The company is now targeting the upper-end of its previously-issued sales and operating income growth projections of 6-8% and 6.5-8.5%, respectively. Earnings per share are projected to increase 5.5-7.5% or 4-6% on a constant-currency basis.In the 2016-2020 timeframe, the company anticipates local currency sales to grow 4-6% while predicts operating income and earnings per share to expand 7-9% and more than 10%, respectively. Results will benefit from business expansion in emerging markets and growth opportunities stemming from acquired assets. Capital spending will be 3-3.5% of net sales. Shareholders will be rewarded with returns amounting 50-60% of net income.Factors Working Against International Flavors & FragrancesStock Performance and Earnings Estimates: In the last three months, International Flavors’ shares have declined 11%, underperforming 1.1% growth recorded by the industry.Moreover, earnings estimates on the company have been revised downward in the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $6.24 for 2018 and $6.79 for 2019, representing declines of 0.8% and 0.4% from their 30-day-ago respective tallies. Also, the company has an Earnings ESP of -1.28% for 2018 and -3.09% for 2019. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Rising Costs & Expenses Raise Concerns: International Flavors is dealing with adverse impacts of rising costs and operating expenses. Notably, the company’s cost of sales in the last five years (2013-2017) grew at 2.8% (CAGR) while its operating expenses (including adjusted selling, general and administrative as well as research and development expenses) went up 2.4%. The trajectory continued in the first quarter of 2018 as well, with costs and sales, and operating expenses increasing 13% and 7.6% from their respective tallies in the year-ago comparable quarter. We believe that unwarranted rise in costs and expenses will prove detrimental to the company’s margins and profitability.Long-Term Debt: International Flavors is a highly leveraged company. In the last five years (2013-2017), the company’s long-term debt has soared 11.8% (CAGR) while grew roughly 2.7% sequentially to $1,676 million at the end of first-quarter 2018. Also, the company’s total debt/total equity has increased from 63.6% in 2013 to 96.6% in 2017. It was 94.2% at the end of first-quarter 2018. We believe, if unchecked, high-debt levels can inflate the company’s financial obligations and put pressure on margins.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are DAQO New Energy Corp. (DQ  -  Free Report), Ferro Corporation (FOE  -  Free Report) and Ingevity Corporation (NGVT  -  Free Report). While DAQO New Energy sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both Ferro and Ingevity carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

28,IFF,"A few chemical companies are scheduled to report their quarterly numbers on May 7.

Earnings for these companies increased 26% from the same period last year, while sales are up 11.6%.Basic Materials is among the Zacks sectors that are expected to score the strongest gains in Q1. Earnings for the sector are projected to surge 42.5% in Q1, while revenues are expected to climb 22%.The chemical industry is gaining strength on the back of continued demand strength across major end-use markets such as construction and automotive and an upswing in the world economy.A recovery in demand in the energy space — another key chemical end-market — has also been another tailwind for the industry. The recovery is being driven by a rebound in crude oil prices from their historic lows. The rebound in oil prices has also led to a favorable pricing environment for chemical products.While chemical companies are exposed to certain headwinds including a spike in raw materials costs, these are expected to continue gaining from strategic measures including cost-cutting and productivity improvement, pricing actions and portfolio restructuring in Q1. Synergies from acquisitions should also lend support to earnings.

29,IFF,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 7, after the market closes.In the last four quarters, the company delivered better-than-expected results in three while lagging in one. Average earnings surprise was a positive 3.68%. Notably, in the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.40 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.69%. Estimates for the to-be-reported quarter are pegged at $1.58.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). In the last month, the company’s shares have yielded 2.3% return, outperforming roughly 2% gain of the industry it belongs to.Let us see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement. Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsWe believe that International Flavors & Fragrances will benefit from growth in global and domestic economies as well as increasing trade relations with foreign nations. Particularly, emerging nations are attractive markets for the company as the demand for consumer products is high in those regions. For 2018, the company anticipates consumer staples volume to grow 2% over the previous year.International Flavors & Fragrances’ expectation for the full year will give a rough idea of the factors that might have influenced the quarterly results. The company anticipates gaining from acquired businesses as well as its multi-year productivity program, enabling it to control costs, make strategic investments and expand businesses globally. Also, the launch of Re-Imagine in 2017 will help in capturing unaddressed opportunities in the food and beverage industry while assisting the company in innovation initiatives.For the Flavors segment, continued growth in a number of consumer food companies, as well as the need for more transparency in consumer products, has created opportunities for the company. Demand for flavors is strong from Savory, Sweet, Dairy and Beverages categories of consumer products. The segment will gain from the PowderPure buyout and the creation of Tastepoint — a new company to serve middle-market customers. Both the buyout and the company formation were accomplished in 2017.The Flavors segment’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $441 million for the first quarter of 2018. This projection is above $402 million and $406 million recorded in the last reported quarter and the year-ago quarter, respectively. Also, the segment’s average sales surprise for the last four quarters was a positive 1.26%.In addition to growing population and rising product demand, the company’s Fragrances segment will gain from new business wins and more businesses from existing customers. Demand for Fragrance Compounds and Ingredients remain strong. Also, the acquisition of Fragrance Resources in 2017 and the creation of new fragrance ingredient called Veraspice will be advantageous.The Fragrances segment’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $465 million for the first quarter of 2018. This projection is above $453 million and $422 million recorded in the last reported quarter and the year-ago quarter, respectively. Also, the segment’s average sales surprise for the last four quarters was a positive 2.02%.On the flip side, rise in raw material costs, a high debt level, industry competition and unfavorable movements in foreign currencies are concerning.

30,IFF,"We issued an updated research report on International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF  -  Free Report) on Mar 26. A vast customer base, gains from business expansion efforts and sound capital allocation strategies are key drivers for the company. On the flip side, risks related to international operations, high debts, rising costs and industry competition remain concerns.The company, with a market capitalization of approximately $10.5 billion, currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Below, we briefly discussed the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Factors Favoring International Flavors & FragrancesNear- and Long-Term Growth Potential Solid: International Flavors serves a wide customer base — through its two business segments, Flavors and Fragrances — in the food and beverage industries. Its products, including flavor compounds, fine fragrances, consumer fragrances and fragrance ingredients, are primarily used by manufacturers of perfume and toiletry, soaps, detergents, fabric care, household cleaners and air fresheners. Such diversity in the application areas of its products is a boon. Also, international diversity, especially the company’s efforts for expansion in emerging nations, will be advantageous.For 2018, International Flavors anticipates net sales growth to be 6-8% while predicting operating profit to grow 6.5-8.5%. Earnings per share growth are likely to be around 5.5-7.5%.In 2016-2020 time period, the company anticipates local currency sales to expand 4-6%, operating profit to grow 7-9% and earnings per share to rise more than 10%. Sales from acquired assets are predicted to range within $500 million to $1 billion; capital spending to be 3-3.5% of sales and cash returned to shareholders to be 50-60% of net income.Strategic Initiatives: Expansion of product portfolio — through the addition of new and innovative compounds — has been a priority for International Flavors over time. It has a dedicated research and development wing working in these aspects. Also, several other initiatives like Tastepoint — a new company to serve middle-market customers and Re-Imagine — programs that enable capture of unaddressed opportunities in the food and beverage industry will prove beneficial in the quarters ahead. Additionally, it is working on a multi-year productivity program. Through this program, it will be able to check on costs, make strategic investments and expand businesses globally. It intends to reduce the workforce by 5% globally. By the end of 2019, the company anticipates this productivity program to yield annualized savings of $40-$45 million.Acquisitions and Shareholders Return: Buyouts has been International Flavors’ one of the preferred modes of business expansion. The acquisitions of David Michael & Company in October 2016, Fragrance Resources in January 2017 and PowderPure in April 2017 have proved beneficial since added to the company’s portfolio.Also, rewarding shareholders with dividend payments and share buybacks have worked in favor of the company. In 2017, it paid cash dividends of $206.1 million to its shareholders while using $58.1 million for repurchasing treasury stocks. In August 2017, it announced an 8% increase in its quarterly dividend rate while in November, it announced a $300 million share buyback program.Factors Working Against International Flavors & FragrancesShare Price Performance, Poor Valuation & Earnings Estimates: In the last three months, International Flavors’ shares have declined 13.3%, worse than 7% decline recorded by the industry.On a P/E (TTM) basis, the company’s shares look overvalued compared with the industry with respective tallies of 22.5x and 21.8x in the last three months. This makes us cautious about the stock. In addition, the stock’s Zacks Consensus Estimate has decreased 0.2% to $6.29 for 2018 and by 0.7% to $6.75 for 2019.Rising Costs & Expenses, Huge Debts Raise Concerns: International Flavors is exposed to risks, emanating from the rise in costs and expenses. In the fourth quarter of 2017, its cost of sales grew 14% year over year while research and development expenses increased 19% and adjusted selling and administrative expenses expanded 6.4%. Margin profile was weak as adjusted gross margin slipped 110 bps year over year and adjusted operating margin fell 90 bps. Also, its long-term debt was approximately $1.6 billion while exiting the quarter. We believe, if unchecked, rising costs and expenses, and huge debt levels can be detrimental to its profitability in the quarters ahead.Threat From International Expansion & Industry Competition: Expansion of business in international arenas has exposed International Flavors to risks arising from adverse movements in foreign currencies. Also, uncertainties in economic growth or reduction in consumer spending of the countries served can severely impact the company’s businesses.Moreover, International Flavors faces stiff competition from the companies offering similar products and services or those producing different items for same uses. Some key players in the industry are CSW Industrials, Inc. (CSWI  -  Free Report), DAQO New Energy Corp. (DQ  -  Free Report) and KMG Chemicals, Inc. (KMG  -  Free Report). While both CSW Industrials and DAQO New Energy sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), KMG Chemicals carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.In the last 60 days, earnings estimates for each of these stocks improved for the current year and the next year. Also, average positive earnings surprise for the last four quarters was 9.55% for CSW Industrials, 34.57% for DAQO New Energy and 29.79% for KMG Chemicals.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

31,IFF,"Albemarle Corporation (ALB  -  Free Report) will release its first-quarter 2018 results after the bell on May 9.Albemarle swung to a loss on a reported basis in the fourth quarter of 2017, hurt by a sizable income tax expense associated with the new U.S. tax reform laws. However, adjusted earnings of $1.34 per share for the quarter outstripped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21.Revenues rose around 23% year over year to $857.8 million in the fourth quarter, also topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $791.5 million. Sales in the quarter were aided by favorable impacts of pricing and higher sales volume across the company’s segments as well as favorable currency impacts.Albemarle has an impressive earnings surprise history. It has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 6%.Albemarle’s shares have lost around 8.7% over a year, underperforming the roughly 9.5% gain recorded by the industry. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAlbemarle, in its fourth-quarter call, said that it expects adjusted earnings per share for 2018 in the band of $5 to $5.40, a year-over-year increase of 9-18%. It also envisions net sales for 2018 to be between $3.2 billion and $3.4 billion. Adjusted EBITDA has been forecast in the range of $955-$1,005 million.Albemarle, last month, successfully completed the earlier announced sale of its polyolefin catalysts and components business to W. R. Grace & Co. (GRA  -  Free Report). Per the terms of the deal, the curatives and organometallics portions of the Performance Catalysts Solutions business remain with Albemarle. Grace will assume the operations and lease at the Product Development Center in Baton Rouge, LA, and operations at the Yeosu site in South Korea. The divestment demonstrates Albemarle’s continued commitment toward portfolio management in the best interest of shareholders and employees.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for Albemarle for the to-be-reported quarter stands at $806.5 million, reflecting an increase of 11.7% from the year-ago quarter.Strength in the company’s core Lithium and Advanced Materials division boosted its fourth-quarter results. The lithium unit is expected to continue to drive its results in the March quarter.Albemarle is seeing significant momentum in its lithium business and is well placed to leverage strong expected growth in the battery-grade lithium market. The company is executing a number of projects aimed at boosting its global lithium derivative capacity.Albemarle, in March, received approval from Chile's Economic Development Agency for an increase in its lithium quota, enabling the company to sustainably expand its lithium production in Chile to roughly 145,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent per annum through 2043. Per the company, this increase in quota will be enabled by deploying innovative technology for extracting more lithium without requiring additional brine pumping at the Salar de Atacama, giving it the opportunity to boost capacity in a highly sustainable and efficient manner.Sales from the company’s Lithium and Advanced Materials unit jumped 30% year over year to $362.4 million in the fourth quarter, supported by favorable pricing, higher sales volumes and favorable currency impacts. The results in the lithium business are expected to continue to be boosted by favorable pricing trends as well as higher volumes in battery grade products in the first quarter.Revenues from the Bromine Specialties segment rose around 13% year over year to $219.1 million in the last reported quarter driven by higher sales volumes and favorable pricing. While the division is expected to continue to gain from healthy flame retardant demand in electronics and construction markets, it faces headwinds from higher cost for raw materials, distribution and freight.Revenues from the Refining Solutions unit rose 24% year over year to $238.4 million in the fourth quarter, supported by favorable pricing, higher sales volumes and favorable currency impacts. The company expects its Catalysts unit (now includes Refining Solutions and Performance Catalyst Solutions) to benefit from higher volumes in fluid cracking catalysts and favorable product mix. However, the unit faces headwind from higher expected input costs.Albemarle Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Albemarle Corporation price-eps-surprise | Albemarle Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Albemarle is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

33,IFF,"We believe that Cosan Limited (CZZ  -  Free Report) is a solid choice for investors seeking exposure in the agriculture space. The company’s strengthening foothold in the sugar and ethanol business, initiatives to enhance productivity and efficiency and strengthening of distribution network bode well.The stock has been upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) on Nov 11.In the last three months, the American Depository Receipts of this agriculture products company have yielded 7.3% return, outperforming 0.8% decline recorded by the industry. Why the Upgrade?Cosan performed well in third-quarter 2017, marking this as the second consecutive quarter of quarterly profits. Adjusted net income increased remarkably from the year-ago tally on the back of revenue growth and a fall in financial expenses. Fuel volumes sold in the quarter jumped 4.2% year over year on the back of growth in gasoline and diesel volumes sold. Sugar volume sold grew 16.7% and ethanol volume sold increased 27.3% year over year.For the Raizen Energia segment, Cosan anticipates volume of sugarcane crushed to be within 59-63 million tons for the crop year April 2017-March 2018.

Also, for the Comgas segment, the company anticipates volume of gas sold to fall within 4.3-4.4 million cbm, above the previous projection of 4-4.3 million cbm for 2017.In the quarters ahead, we believe that Cosan’s initiatives to improve its production capabilities and services will enable it to capitalize on the growing sugar and ethanol demand. The Comgas business will gain from recovery in industrial activity in the country, increasing industrial applications of natural gas and expansion in networks. Moove will benefit from its customer base in Brazil while will expand internationally to tap business opportunities. Rumo will gain from investments to strengthen its rail yards, terminals and rail lines as well as from its cost reduction efforts.Cosan’s Raizen business will likely gain from its network of Shell branded service stations, roughly 6,138 at the end of the third quarter. Also, Raizen’s efforts to enhance distribution network, improve efficiency and selective positioning of logistics will aid growth.The stocks’ earnings estimates for 2017 and 2018 have been revised upward in the last 30 days.

35,IFF,"The chemical industry has gotten its mojo back on strength across major end-markets and an improving world economy. While chemical makers should benefit from strategic growth measures and investment on capacity expansion, the industry is still reeling under certain headwinds. There are a few reasons to be cautious about the chemical industry in the near term, which we have outlined below: China Woes LingerSlowdown in China -- a major market for chemicals -- remains a deterrent over the short haul. The world’s second-biggest economy remains plagued by persistent industrial overcapacity, weak property investment and rising corporate debt. In particular, ballooning debt levels (manifested by rising debt to GDP ratio) and rapid credit expansion have raised a red flag on the Chinese economy.The country’s GDP expanded 6.7% in 2016, a deceleration from 6.9% a year ago, also the weakest annual growth in 26 years. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), its annual report on the Chinese economy, issued a warning about the country’s surging debt level that has raised risks for a potential sharp decline in growth in the medium term. The IMF projects China’s GDP to grow 6.8% in 2017, moderating to 6.5% in 2018. Moreover, the Chinese government has set a GDP growth target of roughly 6.5% for 2017.Capital outflow pressures, rapid credit expansion, continued reliance on stimulus measures and geopolitical uncertainties are among the key risks to the country’s economic growth. As such, a sluggish Chinese economy may weigh on demand for chemicals in this significant market.Harvey-Stoked Disruptions Pose a ConcernHurricane Harvey weighed on U.S. chemical production during the third quarter, knocking off a sizable chunk of production capacity. Harvey led to the shutdown of several chemical plants along the Gulf Coast -- the epicenter of the U.S. specialty chemicals and petrochemicals industry.In particular, the storm ravaged Texas that accounts for nearly three-quarters of the U.S. production of ethylene, which is among the world’s most important petrochemicals and a basic ingredient for final products ranging from plastic bottles to tires to polyester fabric. Many chemical plants producing ethylene are located near the Gulf Coast’s concentration of petroleum facilities.According to IHS Markit, 54% of total U.S. ethylene production capacity was hit by Harvey. A number of major chemical producers had to shutter or cut back ethylene production, leading to reduced supply of this major chemical. The lingering effects of Harvey is a concern for U.S. chemical companies. Lost production volumes as well as costs related to the disruptions caused by the storm may pose some headwinds for U.S. chemical makers in the fourth quarter of 2017.Still-Challenging Fertilizer/Agrichemical SpaceFertilizer and agricultural chemical companies are still grappling with a difficult pricing environment. While the potash market has stabilized this year from the 2016 lows, the picture is not so good for nitrogen and phosphate.Higher supply has contributed to a softer nitrogen pricing environment. Abundant nitrogen supply driven by new production capacity is expected to weigh on global prices in 2017. Additional nitrogen capacity including a significant increase in North America is expected to come online globally in the back half of the year.Global capacity expansion continues to exert pressure on urea and other nitrogen fertilizer prices. Elevated supply in the global nitrogen market is hurting prices, causing farmers to delay buying activities. As such, nitrogen margins of fertilizer producers remain thwarted by a weak pricing environment.Excess capacity (outpacing demand) also continues to hurt prices of phosphate as witnessed so far this year. Phosphate markets are expected to remain oversupplied through the second half, thereby putting pressure on prices.Moreover, agriculture market fundamentals remain weak and there is continuous negative sentiment among agriculture investors that can create uncertainty in the near term. Insipid economic growth in certain key markets including Latin America is affecting demand for nutrients. Moreover, the prevailing softness in agricultural commodity pricing remains a concern for fertilizer and agricultural chemicals companies as it is hindering fertilizer usage by farmers given the adverse effect of lower crop pricing on growers’ income.Prices of major crops (such as corn and soybeans) remain at their multi-year lows as markets remain awash with grains. An expected bumper corn and soybean harvest is likely to put a cap on crop prices in 2017.Raw Material Pricing HeadwindsCommodity pricing remain a concern for many U.S. chemical producers. Their ability to pass these costs on to end consumers is not always easy, given the competitive pressures in play.A number of chemical companies including PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report), Celanese Corp. (CE  -  Free Report) and Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report) are witnessing a spike in raw material prices, exacerbated by short supply due to hurricanes. As a result, margins of these producers may be under pressure moving ahead amid an inflationary environment. A number of chemical makers, in their September quarter earnings call, have warned of continued headwinds from elevated input costs through the rest of 2017.Stocks to Steer Clear OfAs you can see, there are a number of reasons to be watchful about the chemical industry. As such, it would also be a prudent choice to get rid of certain companies in the space that show weak fundamentals and carry an unfavorable Zacks Rank.We hold a bearish view on KMG Chemicals, Inc. (KMG  -  Free Report), Compass Minerals International, Inc. (CMP  -  Free Report), Stepan Company (SCL  -  Free Report) and Axalta Coating Systems Ltd. (AXTA  -  Free Report), each holding a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).We also suggest staying away from stocks such as PPG Industries, Platform Specialty Products Corp. (PAH  -  Free Report) and International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF  -  Free Report), all carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).(Check out our latest Chemical Industry Outlook for a more detailed discussion on the fundamental trends.)Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

37,IFF,"A couple of chemical companies are gearing up to report their quarterly numbers on Nov 6.  Per the Zacks Industry classification, the chemical industry is grouped under the broader Basic Materials sector. Based on the latest Earnings Outlook, 69.8% of the sector participants on the S&P 500 index reported their quarterly numbers as of Nov 1. Earnings for these companies are up 8% from the same period last year on 3.6% higher revenues. Overall third-quarter earnings for the sector are projected to decline 2.3% while revenues are expected to increase 10.7%.The chemical industry has enjoyed a positive run this year, helped by continued strength across major end-use markets such as construction, electronics and automotive. Chemical companies continue to shift their focus to attractive, growth markets. Moreover, they remain actively focused on mergers and acquisitions to diversify and shore up growth.Strategic measures including productivity improvement, pricing actions, portfolio restructuring and earnings-accretive acquisitions are expected to drive the performance of chemical makers in the third quarter. Cost-cutting measures and productivity improvement actions by chemical companies should continue to yield industry-wide margin improvements. Synergies from acquisitions should lend support to earnings in the third quarter.  We take a sneak peek at two chemical companies that are scheduled to report their third-quarter results on Nov 6.FMC Corporation (FMC  -  Free Report) will report after the bell. It has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 63 cents. FMC Corp. currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an ESP of 0.00% that makes surprise prediction difficult. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters while missed in the other two, delivering an average negative surprise of 1.7%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the to-be-reported quarter stands at $690 million, reflecting a decline of 14.6% from the year-ago quarter.Net sales for FMC Corp.’s Agricultural Solutions segment is expected to rise 4.3% year over year while remaining flat sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at $583 million. Segment income is expected to increase 15.6% sequentially and 23% year over year as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $111 million. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales for the Lithium unit is projected to be $103 million, reflecting a 47.1% rise year over year and a 39.2% increase on a sequential comparison basis. Segment income is also expected to surge 96.6% year over year and 42.3% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $34.4 million.While FMC Corp. is faced with challenging agriculture market fundamentals and pricing headwinds, it is benefiting from its strategic investments, acquisitions and efforts to expand its market position and strengthen its portfolio. Strong momentum in its Lithium unit is also expected to continue to supports results in the to-be-reported quarter. However, weaker prices contributed to lower earnings in the company’s agriculture business in the second quarter and are expected remain a headwind in the third.

41,IFF,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 14, after market close.In the last four quarters, the company delivered better-than-expected results in three quarters while lagging in one. Average earnings surprise was a positive 3.05%. Notably, last quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.47 per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.52%.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In the last six months, the company’s shares have yielded 2.4% return, outperforming roughly 4.3% decline of the industry it belongs to.Let us see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement.Factors to Affect Q4 ResultsWe believe that International Flavors & Fragrances’ solid product portfolio, large customer base and an exhaustive research and development wing will be advantageous. Veraspice — a fragrance ingredient; Tastepoint,  a company to serve middle-market customers; and Re-Imagine, programs that enable capture of unaddressed opportunities in the food and beverage industry as well as assist the company’s in its innovation initiatives, are added benefits.Also, the company’s buyouts in the past few quarters will have a positive impact. Since its acquisition in October 2016, David Michael has strengthened the company’s customer base in the fast-growing middle-markets and is predicted to generate incremental revenues of $85 million in 2017. Likewise, Fragrance Resources, acquired in January 2017, is anticipated to generate incremental revenues of $75 million and modestly boost earnings in 2017.Commitment toward rewarding shareholders with dividends and share buybacks builds a positive momentum for the company. Also, its multi-year productivity program will help in restricting costs, make strategic investments and expand businesses globally. Despite the benefits expected from these initiatives, related pre-tax charges amounting to $35 million will likely be accrued in the year.Unfavorable foreign currency translations remain an issue, with a likely adverse impact of 1% on operating profit growth and 2% on earnings per share growth in 2017. Also, higher raw material costs can hurt the segmental results.For the Flavors segment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $398 million for the fourth quarter, lagging average revenues of $410 million generated in the first three quarters of 2017. Also, the operating profit for the segment is estimated to be $84 million, below an average of $96.3 million in the first three quarters of 2017.Likewise, for the Fragrances segment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $428 million for the fourth quarter, below the average revenues of $438 million generated in the first three quarters of 2017. Also, operating profit for the segment is estimated to be $80 million, below an average of $87 million in the first three quarters of 2017. Stocks to ConsiderOur proven model provides some idea on the stocks that are about to release their earnings results.

42,IFF,"We believe that Ferro Corporation (FOE  -  Free Report) is a solid choice for investors seeking exposure in the chemical space. The company’s strengthening segmental businesses as well as its strategic acquisitions and focus on innovation bode well. It currently has a market capitalization of $2 billion.The stock has been upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) on Nov 24.Ferro reported better-than-expected results in the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 17.79%. The company’s shares have yielded roughly 64% return in a year. Notably, the stock has rallied 3% in the last month, outperforming 1.6% gain of the industry. Why the Upgrade?Ferro’s third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share grew 22.2% year over year while net sales increased 21.3% on the back of healthy growth in Color Solutions, Performance Colors & Glass and Performance Coatings segments sales. Organically, net sales grew 4.9%, on a constant currency basis.We believe that Ferro is well placed to gain traction from its diversified product portfolio and focus on innovation. Also, it has a solid customer base in various end markets, including construction, automotive, electronics, industrial products, household furnishings and appliance. In the coming quarters, improving demand for lead-free enamel solutions in the automotive market and strengthening electronics business will be prime growth catalysts for the Performance Colors & Glass segment while rebuilding activities after the recent natural disasters and healthy demand for surface polishing technology will drive sales for the Color Solutions segment. Performance Coatings segment will gain from higher demand for its technologically advanced products in the appliance and other end markets.Additionally, Ferro’s acquisitive nature has helped in business expansion over time. In August, the company acquired Israel-based Dip Tech Ltd., a provider of digital printing solutions for glass coatings. The assets are expected to enhance the company’s portfolio in the Performance Colors & Glass segment and boost earnings in 2018. Moreover, it acquired Spain-based Gardenia Quimica in August and completed acquiring Endeka Group in November. Both these buyouts will strengthen the company’s Performance Coatings segment’s offerings in the ceramic tile market.For 2017, Ferro has increased its adjusted earnings per share forecast to a range of $1.26-$1.29 from the prior projection of $1.22-$1.27. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization are now expected to be $228-$231 million versus $223-$228 expected earlier. Sales are now predicted to grow 17-17.5%, up from the previous projection of 12-13%.The stocks’ earnings estimates for 2017 have been revised upward by five analysts while that for 2018 have been raised by three in the last 30 days. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock stands at $1.29 for 2017 and $1.50 for 2018, representing 1.6% and 1.4% increase from their respective estimates 30 days ago.Ferro Corporation Price and Consensus  Ferro Corporation Price and Consensus | Ferro Corporation QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the industry include Kraton Corporation (KRA  -  Free Report), Ingevity Corporation (NGVT  -  Free Report) and International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.

43,IFF,"We issued an updated research report on Cosan Limited (CZZ  -  Free Report) on Nov 21. Healthy sugar and ethanol businesses as well as growth opportunities from natural gas and fuel distribution, lubricants and logistics businesses will drive growth.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Why Should Investors Add Cosan’s Stock to PortfolioBefore we begin the discussion, a quick recap of the company’s recently reported third-quarter results will give an insight about the company’s financial performances. Adjusted net income in the quarter increased remarkably over the year-ago tally on the back of revenue growth and a fall in financial expenses. Fuel volumes sold in the quarter rose 4.2% year over year while sugar and ethanol volume sold grew 16.7% and 27.3% respectively.Strengthening Sugar & Ethanol Business: The company is the world’s largest producer and processor of sugarcane. Notably, it crushed approximately 59.4 million tons of sugarcane in crop year April 2016-March 2017. Sugarcane is the main raw material used for producing sugar and ethanol. The company is the largest sugar and ethanol producer in Brazil as well as one of the largest in the world.For the crop year April 2017-March 2018, the company anticipates volume of sugarcane crushed within 59-63 million tons. Sugar volume produced is likely to come in the range of 4.3-4.7 million tons while ethanol volume production is expected in the range of 2-2.3 billion liters. Volume of energy sold is estimated within 2.2-2.4 million MWh.Additional Business Opportunities: A diversified business structure has been advantageous for Cosan over time. Besides its sugar and ethanol businesses, the company is engaged in the distribution of fuels (through Raizen Combustiveis) and natural gas (Comgas); lubricants, basic oils and specialties (Moove); investments (Cosan Corporate) and logistics businesses (Rumo).In the quarters ahead, Raizen Combustiveis will gain from its efforts to enhance distribution network, improve efficiency as well as selective positioning of logistics. At third-quarter end, the company had a network of 6,138 Shell branded service stations. Additionally, Comgas will gain from recovery in the country’s industrial activity, increasing industrial applications of natural gas and expansion in networks. Moove will benefit from its customer base in Brazil and expand internationally to tap business opportunities. Rumo will gain from investments to strengthen its rail yards, terminals and rail lines plus benefit from its cost reduction efforts as well.Price Performance and Earnings Estimates: Market sentiments have been positive for Cosan over time. Last year, the American Depository Receipts of this agriculture products company has yielded 29%, thus outperforming the 15.1% rally of the industry it belongs to. The stocks’ Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 98 cents for 2017 and $1.81 for 2018, reflecting year-over-year growth of 197% and 84.7% respectively.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering in the Zacks Basic Materials sector include Kraton Corporation (KRA  -  Free Report), International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF  -  Free Report) and Monsanto Company . While Kraton sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both International Flavors & Fragrances and Monsanto carry a Zacks Rank of 2.

44,IFF,"We believe that Daqo New Energy Corporation (DQ  -  Free Report) is a solid choice for investors seeking exposure in the chemical space. Anticipated rise in solar PV installations in various countries as well as the company’s initiatives to enhance production capabilities at polysilicon facilities bode well.The stock has been upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) on Nov 18. Why the Upgrade?Daqo New Energy has performed well in two of three reported quarters. Year to date, the company’s American Depository Shares have rallied 123.1%, substantially outperforming 8.9% gain of the industry. Notably, in third-quarter 2017 results, it pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 62.07%.The company’s revenues grew 64.6% year over year on the back of solid customer demand for polysilicon products. As noted, polysilicon sales volume in the quarter totaled 4,500 MT, increasing 58.6% year over year. Gross profit surged 70.8% while margin came in at 41.3% versus 39.9% in the year-ago quarter.In the quarters ahead, we believe that Daqo New Energy will gain traction from the maintenance works that it completed in two phases at its Xinjiang polysilicon facilities in the past months. These initiatives helped to improve production, expand hydrochlorination capacity and enhance manufacturing efficiency. Additionally, a new Phase 3B expansion plan has been approved to enhance polysilicon annual production capacity by 38.9% to 25,000 MT for the company’s Xinjiang facilities. Also, additional efforts at these facilities are anticipated to raise the annual production capacity to 30,000 MT by 2019. The company expects that enhanced production capacity will cater to the demand from mono-crystalline wafer and semiconductor markets.Moreover, increasing annual solar PV installation in countries like China, the United States, India and Japan have created healthy demand environment for the company. Notably, annual solar PV installation in 2017 is likely to be approximately 50 GW in China, 12 GW in the United States and 10 GW in India while a double-digit growth is predicted globally.For 2017, Daqo New Energy anticipates to produce roughly 4,800-5,000 MT of polysilicon while sales to external customers are predicted to be within 4,300-4,500 MT.The stocks’ Zacks Consensus Estimate currently stands at $7.81 for 2017 and $5.76 for 2018, representing 18.5% and 11.6% increase over their respective estimates 30 days ago.DAQO New Energy Corp.

45,IFF,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8, after market close.The company pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 0.96% in the last four quarters, surpassing estimates in two and lagging in others. We believe that a sound financial performance and growth prospects have lifted investor sentiments for the company. In the last six months, its shares have yielded 14.35% return, outperforming the gain of 3.33% recorded by the industry.Let us see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that International Flavors & Fragrances is likely to pull off an earnings surprise this quarter. This is because the company has the combination of two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: International Flavors & Fragrances currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.69%, with the Most Accurate estimate of $1.45 above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.44.International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: International Flavors & Fragrances’ Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. Moreover, its positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.What is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?We believe that International Flavors & Fragrances is poised to benefit from its internationally diversified business structure and huge product base. Key strategic markets, including North America, Africa & Middle East, are potential growth drivers for the company. Also, it is working hard for the development of new and innovative compounds through its exhaustive research and development wing.     Also, the company’s acquired assets will help it expand its offerings and in turn, its profitability in the quarter. The buyout of David Michael business (in Oct 2016) was is in sync with the company’s Vision 2020 business strategy and has enabled it to expand in the fast-growing middle-markets. It is predicted to generate revenues of $85 million in 2017. In Jan 2017, the company acquired Fragrance Resources. This asset is likely to generate revenues of $75 million in 2017 as well as modestly boost earnings. In April, the company acquired Oregon-based Columbia Phytotechnology LLC (also known as PowderPure).On a separate note, International Flavors & Fragrances recently announced an 8% increase in its quarterly dividend rate from 64 cents to 69 cents per share. We believe such disbursements are reflective of the company’s shareholder-friendly policies. Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies in the industry that you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Versum Materials, Inc.

46,IFF,"The chemical industry is back on track after the recent lows. The industry’s upturn is due to strength across key end-use markets such as construction, automotive and electronics and an upswing in the world economy.The chemicals industry has outperformed the broader market over the past year. The industry has returned around 16% over the same period, while the S&P 500 index advanced roughly 14%.Chemical companies continue to shift their focus on attractive, growth markets in an effort to whittle down their exposure on other businesses that are dealing with weak demand. The industry is also seeing a pick-up in consolidation activities – exhibited by a wide swath of deals in the recent past – as chemical makers are increasingly looking to diversify their business and enhance operational scale. Moreover, margins are expected to see improvements due to cost-cutting measures and productivity improvement actions.Chemical makers also continue to see strong demand from the automotive sector. A recovery across housing and commercial construction has been another supporting factor for the chemical industry recovery.The prospects for the U.S. chemical industry looks bright. The American chemical industry is on course for strong growth this year and the next, notwithstanding a few headwinds. The American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry trade group, envisions accelerated growth for the domestic chemical industry on the back of an improving global economy and a surge in shale-linked capital spending.The shale gas bounty is projecting to drive investment on plants and equipment in the U.S. Chemical makers are ratcheting up investment on shale gas-linked projects to take advantage of ample and affordable natural gas supplies.The European chemical industry has also swung back to life after remaining in a rut for a while. The business environment for the European chemical industry has improved on the back of improving global economic sentiment and a resurgent Eurozone economy.Q2 Performance So FarWe have crossed the midpoint of the Q2 earnings season, having already seen positive earnings surprises from a host of chemical names. As per the Zacks Industry classification, the chemical industry is under the broader Basic Materials sector. Based on our latest  report, 60% of the sector participants on the S&P 500 index reported their quarterly numbers as of Jul 28. Earnings for these companies are up 9.7% from the same period last year on 4.9% higher revenues.However, the growth picture for Q2 reflects a moderation from Q1 with earnings expected to improve by 6.2%, and revenues expected to increase by 3.3%. This is in contrast to a 15.9% increase in earnings in Q1 on 5.4% higher revenues. How to Pick the Winners? Given the large number of players operating in the chemicals space, picking the right stocks is apparently not an easy task. But our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple. One can trim down the list with the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) – and a positive Zacks Earnings ESP.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they report with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP – the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate – is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have high chances of notching up earnings surprises in their next announcements. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as much as 70%. Below we list three chemical stocks that have the right combination of elements to rack up positive surprises this earnings season:The Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report), which offers performance chemicals across North America, the Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America, will release its second-quarter results after the bell on Aug 2.

The company has an expected long-term earnings growth of 8.6%.

47,IFF,"We issued an updated research report on International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF  -  Free Report) on Jul 14. Though the company has strong growth prospects in the near and long term, we believe that exposure to headwinds might restrict its growth momentum in the quarters ahead.Year to date, shares of International Flavors & Fragrances have yielded a return of 12.65%, outperforming the gain of 9.15% recorded by the Zacks categorized Chemicals Specialty industry.It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Below we briefly discuss the company’s tailwinds and headwinds.Growth Drivers  Geographical & Product Portfolio Diversification: The company’s internationally diversified business structure, with operations primarily in North America, Europe, Africa and the Middle East, Latin America and Greater Asia, have proven advantageous over time. Also, it has a huge product base, including flavor compounds for the food and beverage industries as well as fragrances for the cosmetics industry and household products industry. The company is focused on the development of new and innovative compounds through its exhaustive research and development wing. Inorganic Growth Strategies: Acquiring meaningful businesses have helped the company expand its product offerings and in turn, its profitability. Among many, buyouts of David Michael & Company in Oct 2016 and Fragrance Resources in Jan 2017 deserve special mention. For 2017, the company anticipates acquired assets, David Michael and Fragrance Resources, to contribute roughly 4.5% to sales growth and 2.5% to both operating profit and earnings per share growth. In April, the company acquired Oregon-based Columbia Phytotechnology LLC (also known as PowderPure). With the addition of PowderPure, the company expects to strengthen its natural platforms and satisfy demand for natural and clean label products. Over 2016–2020, the company anticipates acquired assets to generate approximately $500 million to $1 billion in sales.Shareholders’ Return and Promising ’17 Guidance & Long-Term Targets: Share buybacks and dividend payments are the prime means of returning value to shareholders. In first-quarter 2017, the company paid cash dividends of $50.7 million to its shareholders while using $37.6 million for the purchase of treasury stocks. Over 2016–2020, the company anticipates cash returned to its shareholders to be within 50–60% of the net income.For 2017, International Flavors & Fragrances anticipates net sales to grow 7.5−8.5% and earnings per share to increase 6.5−7.5%. Operating profit is likely to grow 5.5−6.5% while earnings per share will increase 6.5−7.5%. In the quarters ahead, the company anticipates gaining from its multi-year productivity program, enabling it to check on costs, make strategic investments and expand businesses globally.Over 2016–2020 timeframe, the company hopes to achieve around 4–6% expansion in local currency sales, about 7–9% operating profit growth and over 10% rise in earnings per share.Near-Term HeadwindsImpact of Global Uncertainties: Global uncertainties might reduce or alter consumer spending which may cause a change in customer order pattern, even cancellations. Any such adverse happenings might influence International Flavors & Fragrances’ business operations and hence, its profitability.Woes Related to International Operations: The company’s presence in international markets has exposed it to risks arising from foreign currency-translation and geopolitical issues. For the quarter ended Mar 31, 2017, foreign currency translation produced a negative impact of 1% on revenue growth and 4% on earnings per share. For 2017, the company predicts a negative foreign currency impact of 1.5% on revenues, 2.5% on operating profit growth and 3.0% on earnings per share growth.Stiff Competition & Others: International Flavors & Fragrances is also exposed to risks arising from stiff industry rivalry and volatilities in input price & supply. We believe increased competition from the existing or future rivals, combined with aggressive price competition, might force the company to reduce prices or increase spending, which would negatively impact its sales and profits.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderInternational Flavors & Fragrances currently has a $10.5 billion market capitalization. Some better-ranked stocks in the chemical industry include American Vanguard Corporation (AVD  -  Free Report), Ashland Global Holdings Inc. (ASH  -  Free Report) and KMG Chemicals, Inc.

49,IFF,"We issued an updated research report on International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF  -  Free Report) on Sep 15. A diversified product portfolio, large customer base, potential benefits from strategic initiatives and synergistic benefits from acquisitions will prove advantageous for the company. However, headwinds related to international operations and industry competition might restrict its growth momentum in the near term.It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In the last three months, shares of International Flavors have yielded a return of 6.8%, outperforming roughly 0.7% decline of the industry.However, on a P/E (TTM) basis, International Flavors & Fragrances looks overvalued compared to the industry with respective tallies of 25.8x and 23.7x in the last three-month period. Also, the stock is trading at a higher multiple compared with the median of last three- month P/E multiple of 24.2x. This makes us cautious on the stock.Below we discuss why investors should now hold International Flavors’ stock. Growth DriversDiversification Benefits: We believe International Flavors is poised to benefit from its vast customer base in the food and beverage industries. It is also likely to gain from rising demand from manufacturers of perfume and toiletry, soaps, detergents, fabric care, household cleaners and air fresheners. Its product portfolio includes flavor compounds, fine fragrances, consumer fragrances and fragrance ingredients. Through its research and development wing, the company focuses on the development of new and innovative compounds.Furthermore, international diversity has played a major role in International Flavors’ profitability over time. Notably, in second-quarter 2017, the company’s sales from North American operations grew 19% year over year while that from Europe, Africa and the Middle East were up 6%. Revenues from Latin American operations grew 3% year over year. The company is working hard to strengthen its foothold in emerging nations, as growing economy in these countries will boost demand for consumer products and in turn, demand for flavors and fragrances used in them. Inorganic and Other Strategic Initiatives: International Flavors remains keen on making meaningful acquisitions to expand its foothold in unexplored markets and enhance its product offerings. Notably, the company acquired David Michael & Company in October 2016, Fragrance Resources in January 2017 and PowderPure in April 2017. David Michael buyout is in sync with the company’s Vision 2020 business strategy and will boost its customer base in the fast-growing middle-markets and generate incremental revenues of $85 million in 2017. Fragrance Resources are anticipated to generate incremental revenues of $75 million in 2017 and modestly boost earnings in the year. In second-quarter 2017, these buyouts contributed 6% to the company’s sales growth.In the quarters ahead, the company anticipates gaining from its multi-year productivity program, enabling it to check on costs, make strategic investments and expand businesses globally. It intends to reduce its workforce by 5% globally. By 2019-end, the company anticipates this productivity program to yield annualized savings in the range of $40-$45 million. Also, the company’s newly launched fragrance ingredient — Veraspice — as well as the formation of Tastepoint, a new company to serve middle-market customers will boost growth opportunities. Promising 2017 Guidance, Long-Term Targets and Shareholder-Friendly Policy: For 2017, International Flavors anticipates net sales to grow 7.5-8.5% on a currency neutral basis while predicts earnings per share to increase 6.5-7.5%. Operating profit is likely to grow 5.5-6.5%.Over 2016-2020 timeframe, the company hopes to achieve around 4-6% expansion in local currency sales, about 7-9% operating profit growth and over 10% rise in earnings per share. It also anticipates returning 50-60% of the net income to its shareholders.Share buybacks and dividend payments are the prime means of returning value to shareholders for International Flavors. In first-half 2017, the company paid cash dividends of $101.2 million while using $53.2 million for repurchasing treasury stocks. In August, it raised its quarterly dividend rate by 8%. Headwinds Restricting International Flavors’ Growth ProspectsDiversification Woes: We believe International Flavors’ geographical expansion has exposed it to risks arising from foreign currency movements and geopolitical issues. Notably, foreign currency translation produced a negative impact of 2% on revenue growth and 6% on earnings per share in second-quarter 2017. Also, this headwind is predicted to negatively impact revenue by 1%, operating profit by 1.5% and earnings per share by 2.5%. Relation to Global Uncertainties: Difficult macro conditions might reduce or alter consumer spending which may cause a change in customer order pattern, even cancellations. Any such adverse happenings might influence International Flavors’ business operations and hence, its profitability.Stiff Competition & Others: International Flavors is exposed to risks arising from stiff industry rivalry and volatilities in input price & supply. We believe increased competition from the existing or future rivals, combined with aggressive price competition, might force the company to reduce prices or increase spending, which would negatively impact its sales and profits. Stocks to ConsiderInternational Flavors & Fragrances currently has $11.4 billion market capitalization. We believe that the above-mentioned positives and negatives clearly justify the stock’s current Zacks Rank #3.Some better-ranked stocks in the industry are Kraton Corporation (KRA  -  Free Report), Ferro Corporation (FOE  -  Free Report) and AdvanSix Inc. (ASIX  -  Free Report). While Kraton Corporation sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both Ferro Corporation and AdvanSix carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Kraton Corporation’s earnings estimates for 2017 and 2018 improved over the last 60 days. Also, the company pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 16.54% for the last four quarters.Ferro Corporations’ earnings estimates for 2017 and 2018 improved over the last 60 days. Also, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 16.17% for the last four quarters.AdvanSix’s earnings estimates for 2017 and 2018 were revised upward in the last 60 days.

78,IFF,"Albemarle Corporation (ALB  -  Free Report) will release its second-quarter 2017 results after the bell on Aug 7. The chemical maker’s adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share for first-quarter 2017 topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 95 cents. Revenues increased around 17.5% year over year to $722.1 million in the quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $678.7 million.Albemarle has an impressive earnings surprise history. It has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 8.97%.Albemarle has outperformed the industry it belongs to over a year, partly reflecting its forecast-topping earnings performance and its strategic growth initiatives. The company’s shares have rallied around 45.5% over this period, compared with roughly 21.3% gain recorded by the industry.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.  Factors to ConsiderAlbemarle, in its first-quarter earnings call, said that it is more optimistic about 2017 based on a strong start in Lithium and Bromine Specialties and favorable outlook for both businesses. Strength across these businesses boosted the company’s first-quarter results and is expected to continue to drive its results in the June quarter.Albemarle, in May, raised sales and earnings guidance for 2017, factoring in more favorable outlook for lithium and bromine. It now expects net sales in the band of $2.9–$3.05 billion (up from $2.8–$2.95 billion expected earlier) and adjusted earnings per share of between $4.20 and $4.40 (up from $4.00–$4.25 per share) for 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the year is also expected to be between $835 million and $875 million, also an increase from $800–$840 million expected earlier.Albemarle remains committed to strengthen its lithium business and is well placed to leverage strong expected growth in the battery-grade lithium market. The company, earlier this year, said that its Talison joint venture in Australia has approved the expansion of lithium concentrate production at its Greenbushes mine. The expansion will double the lithium carbonate equivalent capacity at Greenbushes from 80,000 metric tons per year to more than 160,000 metric tons.The buyout of the lithium assets of Jiangxi Jiangli New Materials Science and Technology Co. Ltd. has also allowed Albemarle to supply premium lithium salts to an expanded global customer base and accelerated the company’s ability to meet its goal of capturing 50% of the growth in the lithium industry.Albemarle is also selling non-core businesses and assets to boost growth opportunities and focus on its key businesses. As part of this move, the company has sold its Chemetall Surface Treatment unit to German chemical giant BASF (BASFY  -  Free Report) for around $3.2 billion. Albemarle also divested the tribotecc metal sulfides business to Treibacher Industrie AG. These divestments also led to significant cash generation for Albemarle, allowing it to cut debt and strengthen its balance sheet.Albemarle Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Albemarle Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Albemarle Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Albemarle is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Albemarle is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate Estimate stands and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $1.10. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Albemarle currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a 0.00% ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.

79,IFF,"Earnings Preview 8/5/11
"
80,IFF,"The second quarter earnings season is winding down, but is not over yet. There will be 480 firms reporting, but just 20 of those are in the S&P 500. By next Friday afternoon, almost 90% of the S&P 500 will have reported.
"
81,IFF,"So far, earnings season has been very strong with 3.4 times as many S&P 500 firms reporting positive surprises than have disappointed. The firms reporting next week include: Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report), Disney (DIS  -  Free Report), International Flavors (IFF  -  Free Report), J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report), Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Sara Lee (SLE).
"
82,IFF,"It will be a relatively light week for economic data. Tuesday brings the report on Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the second quarter, as well as a FOMC meeting. On Wednesday we get the Federal Budget Deficit for July, followed by the June Trade Deficit on Thursday, and the finish up with Retail sales on Friday. While not as busy a data week as either of the last two, there is more than enough there to move the markets.MondayThe ISM manufacturing index is expected to continue its downward trend, falling from 55.3 in June to 54.0 for July. It was as high as 61.2 level in April, which indicated extremely fast growth. As a “magic 50 index, any reading over 50 means that manufacturing is growing. Thus the consensus is looking for continued, but somewhat slower growth. In addition to the overall index, pay close attention to how some of the key sub-indexes which cover production, new orders and employment are faring. Based on the reported regional mini-ISM’s the consensus looks a touch optimistic.Construction Spending fell by 0.6% in May. The consensus is looking for an unchanged level of spending in June. That seems a tad optimistic to me, but construction has been hit hard for a long time, so maybe it will just stay at the current very depressed levels.TuesdayProductivity is expected to actually have declined by 0.6% in the second quarter, down from 1.8% growth in the first quarter. Given the big revision to GDP growth, I would expect to see a downward revision to the first quarter number, but I doubt that the second quarter number will be as weak as the consensus is looking for. While over the long run productivity is probably the most important number there is since it ultimately governs income per capita, fast productivity in a time of high unemployment is far from an unmixed blessing. The consensus is also looking for unit labor costs to jump by 2.2% in the second quarter, up from just 0.7% in the first quarter. I’ll take the under on that one, but an upward revision to the first quarter would not surprise me.The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) will meet. It is universally expected that they will keep the Fed Funds rate at the 0% to 0.25% level it has been at since December 2008. Of more interest will be any changes in their wording that suggest that they might be moving closer to a third round of Quantitative Easing. We will closely examine how the policy statement has changed from the last one shortly after it comes out here at Zacks.WednesdayThe Budget Deficit should come in around $165 billion in July, the same level as a year ago. The budget deficit numbers are extremely seasonal, but are not seasonally adjusted, so looking at month-to-month changes is worse than useless, it is downright misleading. While the deficit is huge, expected to come in at about $1.5 Trillion this year, running a budget deficit when the economy is weak is a good thing. Both cutting spending and raising taxes in a slow economy will slow growth. The notion that cutting spending will not hurt the economy, or would even help it, is just flat out wrong. Not all tax increases are economically damaging. It depends on which spending is cut, and which taxes are raised. The obsession in Washington about cutting the deficit fast and hard now is extremely misplaced, and threatens to send the economy back into recession.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They had a very nice decline early in the year, but then had a rough few months. Last week they fell by 1,000 to 400,000 (after an upward revision to the prior week of 3,000). The 400,000 level is important psychologically in that it has historically been the inflection point, below which we tend to create enough jobs to bring down the unemployment rate. A slight increase is expected next week, rising to 409,000. The four-week moving average will stay well above the 400,000 level, where it has been for the last three months. The week-to-week numbers can be very volatile, so the four-week average is the thing to focus on. The sharp rise in initial claims was an early warning of the weak jobs report for June. Keep an eye on the prior week's revision as well as the change from the revised number.Continuing claims have also in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they rose by 10,000 to 3.730 million. That is down 804,000 from a year ago. I would expect a small decline this week. The consensus is looking for them to be at 3.700 million. Some of the longer term decline due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks. Those, however, don’t last forever either. Federally paid extended claims fell by 42,000 to 3.718 million. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 7.570 million, which is down 75,000 from last week (there are some timing issues so the change in continuing and existing claims does not match the change in the total). The total number of people getting benefits is now 1.055 million below year ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity -- finding a new job -- and how many have left on the road to poverty -- having simply exhausted even the extended benefits. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.The Trade Deficit is expected to fall slightly to $48.0 billion in June from $50.2 billion in May.  Falling Oil prices should help as out oil addiction is responsible for over half of our chronic trade deficit. We will probably see more of that effect in the July numbers as well. The trade deficit is directly responsible for our increasing indebtedness to the rest of the world, not the budget deficit. A rising trade deficit slows economic growth and job creation. In the short term, a rising budget deficit increases economic growth, and job creation. As such, at least in the short-to-medium term, the trade deficit is a far more serious economic problem than the budget deficit is.FridayRetail Sales are expected to have risen by 0.5% in July, up from a 0.1% rise in June (seasonally adjusted). This is a broad measure of retail sales, not just activity at the malls. Most significantly, it includes auto sales. Excluding autos, retail sales are expected to rise just 0.2% after being unchanged in June. While the numbers are adjusted for seasonal variations like the number of shopping days, they are not adjusted for inflation. As such, some of the weakness in retail sales will probably come from gas stations, and not due to a sudden drop in the number of people eating hot dogs off the rollers and drinking 44oz fountain drinks.Potential Positive or Negative Surprises
"
83,IFF,"Historically the best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. Similarly, a recent history of earnings disappointments, cuts in the average estimate for the quarter in the month before the report is due and a poor Zacks Rank (#4 or #5) are often red flags pointing to a potential disappointing earnings report.
