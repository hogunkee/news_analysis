0,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) imposed a first-ever price increase for Dupixent, a potential blockbuster eczema treatment, an analyst said Monday.Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond sees the opportunity for Dupixent upside in the second quarter as ""substantial."" Prescription trends are up almost 30% quarter over quarter, and Regeneron/Sanofi raised the list price by 3% as of June 29.""Coupling this with bullish management commentary from our recent visit as well as encouraging dermatologist survey feedback, we think Dupixent remains well-positioned to outperform expectations this quarter and beyond,"" he said in a note to clients.On the stock market today, Regeneron jumped 1.8%, to close at 351.14. Sanofi dipped a fraction, to 40.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

For the first 12 weeks of the period, new prescriptions grew 16.7% vs. the prior quarter, Raymond said.He models $193 million in worldwide second-quarter revenue from the eczema treatment. To help this, Regeneron and Sanofi just increased the list price for Dupixent, Raymond said.This is the first price increase for the eczema treatment since its launch in March 2017. Regeneron never increased the price of eye drug Eylea over seven years. But Regeneron and Sanofi added a 5.3% increase for rheumatoid arthritis drug Kevzara in May.Kevzara's price increase makes ""this Dupixent increase a little less surprising, but nonetheless a nice tail wind to start the third quarter,"" he said.Together, volume and price growth bode well, Raymond said.""With some upside now on the pricing front, though we model flat net pricing, we are comfortable maintaining our worldwide 2018 Dupixent revenue estimate of $880 million, ahead of consensus $806 million,"" he said.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:How Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?How To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

1,REGN,"Shares of The Medicines Company (MDCO) popped early Wednesday — but later sank — after it unveiled clean safety data for its LDL cholesterol drug, a potential rival to approved meds from Amgen (AMGN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN).The data stems from three ongoing studies of Medicines' drug, inclisiran, in partnership with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY). The committee recommended Medicines and Alnylam continue the ongoing studies looking at lowering ""bad"" LDL cholesterol.Medicines' studies are called Orion. In them, Medicines is studying 3,660 patients across three studies. Patients either randomly receive inclisiran or a placebo. To date, more than 1,550 patient-years of safety data have been accumulated, the biotech said in a news release.""According to the company, the pivotal studies are generating five patient-years of safety (data) per day, to us making the clean safety profile increasingly striking,"" Chardan analyst Gbola Amusa said in a report to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn the stock market today, Medicines shares slipped 0.7% to close at 35.36, after earlier jumping as much as 5.7%. The stock outperformed broader biotech companies, which sank nearly 3%. Medicines stock broke out of a cup-with-handle at 32.50 last month.Confidence is growing in drugs like inclisiran, which work by RNA interference, Amusa said. In this case, inclisiran works to inhibit synthesis of the PCSK9 protein in liver cells. High LDL cholesterol has ties to the PCSK9 protein.Fellow biotech companies Amgen and Regeneron with its partner Sanofi (SNY) also have approved medicines that work to block the PCSK9 protein. Further, Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) is working on another type of LDL cholesterol drug called bempedoic acid.The market for LDL cholesterol drugs could be huge. Amusa predicts Medicines' inclisiran will be a blockbuster. He models $4.7 billion in peak sales in 2030.Amusa sees Medicines' commercial plan to administering inclisiran every six months as being favorable compared to rival drugs from other biotech companies. Patients on Amgen's Repatha and Regeneron/Sanofi's Praluent receive injections every two weeks or monthly.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat also expects the dosing schedule for inclisiran to challenge biotech companies Amgen and Regeneron.""From a commercial perspective, an every six-month regimen for (an LDL cholesterol drug) is disruptive — especially at the steep price discount Medicines intends to come in at,"" he said in a report to clients.Amgen shares dipped 0.6%, to 183.53, and Regeneron advanced 2.9%, to 336.61, on Wednesday. Regeneron's rise likely stemmed from a pair of upgrades this week.RELATED:How Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?How To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

2,REGN,"Today, it would be true to report many of the well-known large-cap biotech stocks are showing ""disappointing"" or ""downright awful"" performance in 2018. Just witness the damage lately in shares of Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN).XIt would also be true to report that some companies in IBD's biotech industry group have been fantastic winners.Select gene therapy firms have been rising fast since breakouts in the second half of 2017. And blood disease expert Bioverativ, a Biogen spinoff, had a nice rally going before it soared 62% on Jan. 22. Make sure you see the big price gap in the accompanying chart below. Bioverativ soared in mammoth volume on news that it's being acquired by French pharmaceuticals titan Sanofi (SNY) for $11.6 billion.Could an investor have used good stock charts to find a breakout by Bioverativ before it made that giant single-day gain? Yes. Bioverativ crafted a double-bottom base, helping to set up the big move.If you don't use stock charts, you're trading at a disadvantage. Without charts, it's very tough to determine two keys about the market: 1) the current psychology of buyers and sellers; and 2) the balance of supply vs. demand in any given stock.When did Bioverativ break out? Jan. 9, while the stock market itself was in a confirmed uptrend. A confirmed uptrend is the best time to buy top-performing growth stocks. You have greater odds of making money when you invest with the larger trend.The specialist in therapies for hemophilia and rare blood disorders established an excellent prior uptrend, running from 44.98 on the close of its Feb. 2, 2017, market debut to a peak of 64.41 more than five months later. The stock corrected 16% in four weeks and carved out a three-month saucer with handle (1), but never broke out.Then Bioverativ really began to sell off.On Oct. 27, the midcap swooned 12% and hit as low as 50.50 (2). This created the first low in the base. In a proper double bottom, a stock will rebound back near its highs, then sell off a second time. And during that decline, the stock must undercut the first low.Why? You want to see an authentic shakeout of uncommitted shareholders. Find signs that shares move from weak hands to strong hands.The correct buy point? When the stock rises a dime over the middle peak in between the two lows.Bioverativ did exactly that. The stock rebounded up to 58.19, less than 3 points off the base's left-side peak of 60.74, then nose-dived again. This time, the sell-off took Bioverativ all the way to 48.28. A fine undercut of the first low (3).A double bottom forms over a minimum seven weeks. Corrections of more than, say, 30% to 33% are not ideal. The deeper the correction, the more a stock has to work just to get back to its highs.Look for signs of symmetry within the base. It should look like a ""W"" except that the second low undercuts the first.Bioverativ possessed all of these bullish traits in its 11-week double bottom. On Jan. 9, 2018, the stock gapped up 7%, surpassing the 58.29 buy point (middle peak of 58.19 plus 10 cents).  Volume gushed 75% above normal levels. Seven sessions later, Bioverativ traded at 64.11, up 10% from the proper entry, right before the acquisition news sent shares vaulting 62%.Prior to its breakout, the Waltham, Mass., firm notched quarterly earnings-per-share gains of 64%, 73% and 31%. Revenue had soared 317% in 2015, then rose another 58% and 32% the next two years.Expect double bottoms to proliferate among leading stocks when the major indexes fall furiously in several waves. Great market leaders built double bottoms and broke out after the bear markets in the fall of 1998, the fall of 2002, and other occasions.Sometimes you'll see a handle form on the double bottom. It's the market's way of presenting an additional buy point.(Sanofi completed its acquisition of Bioverativ on March 8. A version of this column was published on March 1, 2018. Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more analysis and commentary on the financial markets, growth companies, charts and stock breakouts.)RELATED:This Is The Golden Rule Of InvestingWhat Is The Current Stock Market Direction?

3,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (REGN) experimental cancer drug ""looks legit"" in treating a form of lung cancer, an analyst said Thursday — meaning it could soon rival Dow Jones' Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).All three are working on cancer drugs called PD-1 checkpoints. These immuno-oncology drugs teach the immune system to identify and fight tumor cells. Merck and Bristol already have drugs approved called Keytruda and Opdivo, respectively.But Regeneron appears to be hot on their tails. In an early-stage study, Regeneron tested its drug, cemiplimab, in previously treated patients with what's called non-small cell lung cancer. Overall, tumors shrank in 29% of patients, and 57% had their disease under control.Regeneron unveiled the data late Wednesday ahead of the American Society for Clinical Oncology annual meeting in June. Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond called the data the biggest surprise of the meeting. Cemiplimab has long been an ""also-ran in the (immuno-oncology) space.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""This compares well to (overall response rates) for approved anti-PD-1's Keytruda and Opdivo in the high teens,"" he said in a note. ""Granted, these are small numbers, but we do think investors may take interest in this.""In today's action on the stock market today, Regeneron climbed 1.5% to close at 308. Merck dipped 1.1% to 59.07, as Bristol added 1% to 52.74.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges noted the overall response rate for cemiplimab in that specific group of patients is in line with the 18%-20% rates for Keytruda and Opdivo in Phase 3 studies. Cemiplimab also looks safe in these patients.""These results, although generated from a small cohort, are encouraging signs that cemiplimab has the potential to compete toe-to-toe with established products on the market,"" he said in a report to clients.RBC analyst Kennen MacKay was less surprised by Regeneron's success with cemiplimab in non-small cell lung cancer. The proof of concept came ""as expected,"" he said in a note. Though, the biotech company tested cemiplimab in a small group of patients.The study supports cemiplimab's potential to have in-line of potentially better effectiveness than leaders Keytruda and Opdivo, MacKay added.Regeneron is also testing cemiplimab in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of patients with an advanced form of skin cancer called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Overall responses as well as duration of response improved in updated data vs. this time last year, Leerink's Porges said.""We believe cemiplimab is well on track to receive an expedited approval in this previously overlooked indication (use) and carve out at least an initial niche in the competitive PD-1/PD-L1 (cancer drugs) field,"" he said.Porges sees an 80% likelihood Regeneron will gain approval for cemiplimab in the advanced type of skin cancer. He expects $39 million in 2018 sales of cemiplimab for that use with peak sales of $1.8 billion. He kept his 435 price target on Regeneron stock.The Food and Drug Administration will review cemiplimab in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in October. That review date could help Regeneron and partner Sanofi (SNY) to be the first to that market, RBC's MacKay said.RELATED:How Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?Start Here To Find The Best Stocks To Buy And WatchWhat Is Inflation, And Why Does It Matter To The Fed — And You?

4,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) dipped to a four-year low Thursday on a mixed first-quarter report that featured expected Dupixent and Praluent misses, but also a surprise after blockbuster Eylea topped U.S. estimates.On the stock market today, Regeneron slipped 1.3% to close at 292.41, canceling out earlier increases of nearly 4%. Shares of partner Sanofi (SNY) rose a fraction to 39.12. Meanwhile, biotech stocks collectively toppled 2.2%.Eylea, a treatment for several eye diseases, raked in $984 million in U.S. sales. Revenue grew 15% year over year to beat the consensus for $961 million, according to several analysts. The beat is a surprise after Roche (RHHBY) also topped expectations for its competing drug Lucentis.""This first-quarter result keeps Eylea on track to post a meaningful 7% year-over-year growth vs. 2017 U.S. sales of $3.7 billion,"" RBC analyst Kennen MacKay wrote in a note to clients. He kept his sector perform rating on Regeneron.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Total revenue of $1.51 billion lagged some estimates, including the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $1.53 billion. But it topped less bullish estimates by $10 million, Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said.Adjusted profit of $4.67 per share grew 60% year over year and beat views for $4.51.As expected, products developed with Sanofi — eczema drug Dupixent, cholesterol drug Praluent and arthritis drug Kevzara — all missed. Dupixent brought in $131 million, Praluent generated $60 million and Kevzara accounted for $12 million.""So no big surprise there,"" Raymond said in a note to clients. He reiterated his overweight rating on Regeneron.Overall, collaboration revenue of $189 million from Sanofi lagged the consensus for $231 million, Raymond James analyst Laura Chico said in a note to clients. But Bayer (BAYRY) collaboration revenue of $248 million topped by $11 million.Regeneron also lowered the high-end of its 2018 guidance for Sanofi collaboration revenue. It now expects $450 million to $485 million, down from earlier estimates for $450 million to $500 million.RELATED:How To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

6,REGN,"AbbVie (ABBV), Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) could spike in the second half of 2018 amid an accelerating number of drug approvals and launches, an analyst said Wednesday.This would reverse a trend in the first half of the year that saw shares of biotech stocks slip to No. 27 out of 197 industry groups tracked by Investor's Business Daily. The group was ranked fifth just 13 weeks ago. Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies are ranked No. 78, down from No. 51.Leerink analysts classified the first half of 2018 as ""disappointing for large-cap biopharma companies."" Biotech stocks and pharmaceutical companies faced a dearth of clinical study results to validate their pipelines and re-price their stocks, they said.""The second half of the year promises to be more exciting for small-/mid-cap biopharma stocks, with significant clinical events on the horizon, including readouts from binary Phase 3 trials,"" they wrote in a note to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAmong other biotech stocks and pharmaceutical companies, AbbVie is expected to report data from a study of its drug, upadacitinib. Researchers are looking at the drug as a treatment for forms of arthritis.Further, the Food and Drug Administration likely will decide whether to approve AbbVie's drug called Elagolix as a treatment for endometriosis, a condition of the female reproductive system. The FDA will also decide the fate of a drug dubbed Venclexta in a form of leukemia.Stock market trackers also expects Celgene to unveil data from late-stage studies of Revlimid and luspatercept. Celgene partners with Acceleron Pharma (XLRN) on luspatercept in two blood diseases. Revlimid is Celgene's major cancer drug.Celgene could also reveal more about its Juno Therapeutics acquisition, through which it is moving into a class of cancer therapy known as CAR-T, short for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. There, it competes with Novartis (NVS) and Gilead Sciences (GILD).""Data from CAR-T development updates should define the path forward for these products (Revlimid and luspatercept),"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in the note.Porges also expects the FDA to make a decision on Regeneron and Sanofi's (SNY) Dupixent as an asthma treatment. Physicians can already use Dupixent to treat eczema. The duo also has cemiplimab, which the FDA is considering in an advanced form of skin cancer.In addition, Intra-Cellular Therapies (ITCI) is working on a drug dubbed lumateperone as a schizophrenia treatment. Analysts will focus on whether the FDA accepts the application for approval based on ""mixed Phase 3 data,"" Porges said.""Intra-Cellular will also report topline data from the ongoing Phase 3 study in bipolar depression in the second half, as they look for a second indication for lumateperone,"" he said.Porges expects Zogenix (ZGNX) to have data for a late-stage study of its drug, ZX008. Researchers are considering the drug as a treatment for a type of epilepsy called Dravet syndrome. GW Pharmaceuticals' (GWPH) drug, Epidiolex, will likely gain approval for this use in June.Additionally, Dova Pharmaceuticals (DOVA) and FibroGen (FGEN) have catalysts in chronic liver and chronic kidney diseases, respectively. Dova expects the FDA to soon decide whether to approve its drug. FibroGen expects to unveil topline data from a study of its drug in the second half of the year.The FDA is also taking a flexible stance on orphan drug development, Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz said in the note. The approval of Sarepta Therapeutics' (SRPT) Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug, Exondys 51, in 2016 ""triggered a cascade of noteworthy filings,"" he said.""We continue to believe the FDA's continuing evolution will warrant positive sentiment for rare disease-focused companies, particularly names like Amicus Therapeutics (FOLD), Sarepta and Uniqure (QURE) as long as the investigational drug is deemed safe and demonstrates strong (effectiveness),"" he said.RELATED:How Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

7,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) toppled to a four-year low Friday after partner Sanofi (SNY) missed first-quarter expectations on three drugs, including blockbuster hopeful Dupixent.On the stock market today, Regeneron fell 3.4% to close at 313.05, after falling as much as 6.5% to touch a low last seen in July 2014. Sanofi tumbled 1.9% to 39.60. Biotech stocks collectively advanced a fraction.Sanofi reported about $132 million in sales of Dupixent, an eczema treatment.

Still, it ""looks like the first quarter won't be very pretty"" for Regeneron.MacKay is more bearish. The surprise Dupixent sales miss comes despite strong prescription trends. He'd expected 20% quarter-over-quarter prescription growth for Dupixent. Sanofi's earnings release suggests reimbursement headwinds are growing for Dupixent, he said.""We anticipate new Dupixent-specific reimbursement hurdles imposed by payers in 2018 may also have contributed to the miss, and concerningly may complicate the utility of (prescription) analysis to forecast Dupixent sales trajectories moving forward,"" he said in a note.Others Regeneron-partnered drugs struggled in the quarter, Piper Jaffray's Raymond said. Praluent, a cholesterol-lowering drug that rivals Amgen's (AMGN) Repatha, missed by about $7 million. Rheumatoid arthritis drug Kevzara also lagged by the same amount.Regeneron is slated to report Thursday. RBC's MacKay also calls for sales of eye disease drug Eylea to miss. On Thursday, Roche (RHHBY) reported strong revenue for its competing drug, Lucentis. Lucentis brought in $413 million in U.S. sales, topping views for $374 million.""We anticipate that the higher-than-expected U.S. Lucentis sales could reflect physician preference/switching to Lucentis prefilled syringes from Eylea due to recent reports of ocular inflammation in limited batches of Eylea kits,"" he said.The issue was ultimately determined to be unrelated to the drug. But it's likely physicians are hanging back on Eylea until they're sure the inflammatory concerns are in the past, MacKay said.

9,REGN,"Amgen (AMGN) reported a ""ho-hum"" quarter on Tuesday, an analyst said, after the No. 1 biotech beat first-quarter expectations though 2018 guidance came in slightly soft at the midpoints.Sales of Enbrel, one of Amgen's biggest products, declined for the fifth straight quarter. Amgen cited lower demand, lower net selling price and year-earlier favorable changes in accounting estimates for the dip.But Amgen raised the low end of its full-year revenue outlook and boosted its adjusted profit expectations. Both metrics were slightly below the Street at the midpoint, but are now relatively in line, Mizuho analyst Salim Syed said in a note to clients.""Looks like a ho-hum quarter,"" he said.In after-hours trading on the stock market today, Amgen shares were flat. The stock ended the regular session down 1.6%, at 171.94. That matched the broad biotech group, which also wrapped down 1.6% at the closing bell.For the first quarter, Amgen reported adjusted profit of $3.47 per share, rising 10% to beat the consensus for $3.15 a share. Sales edged up 2% to $5.55 billion, just north of the Street's view for $5.46 billion.Bright spots in the quarter included cholesterol drug Repatha and Senispar, which treats a condition resulting from enlargement of a gland causing high levels of calcium in the blood.Repatha sales grew 151% year over year to $123 million. Of that, $84 million stemmed from sales in the U.S. Repatha competes with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi's (SNY) drug Praluent. Analysts had modeled $110 million in total sales and $78 million in the U.S., Syed said.U.S. Senispar sales came in at $409 million, topping consensus for $326 million. Total sales of $497 million grew 18%. RBC analyst Brian Abrahams, though, notes Senispar is likely to see generic rivalries in the long term, ""though this overhand may not materialize until post-2018.""Amgen's biggest drugs declined in the first quarter. But these ""pillar legacy products"" still drove the topline beat, Abrahams said in a note to clients.Enbrel, an arthritis and psoriasis drug, declined 6% to $1.105 billion in sales. Still, that was just above the consensus for around $1.096 billion, Mizuho's Syed said.Sales of Neulasta, a bone marrow stimulant, decreased 5% to $1.155 billion. The consensus had modeled around $1.122 billion to $1.129 billion, Syed said. Neulasta sales have declined for four straight periods.""While Neulasta's beat is an unexpected positive, we don't anticipate this will reinvigorate investor enthusiasm given the product remains at risk from potential biosimilar entry,"" RBC's Abrahams said.For the year, Amgen predicted adjusted profit of $12.80-$13.70 per share and $21.9 billion to $22.8 billion in sales. The midpoints of both outlooks were slightly below the consensus view for adjusted income of $13.28 per share and $22.7 billion in sales.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

10,REGN,"In one corner, you have conventional wisdom and many experts like Burton Malkiel, professor emeritus at Princeton University and the author of ""A Random Walk Down Wall Street."" In the other corner, you have IBD's founder William O'Neil, and plenty of other investment pros with a real track record of long-term investing success.These two sides disagree in a fundamental way over whether or not one can time the market.Malkiel's book states that there's ""no point in following any technical trading rule for the timing of purchases or sales. A simple policy of buying and holding will be at least as good as any technical procedure.""Meanwhile, O'Neil's investing books, including ""The Successful Investor"" and ""How to Make Money in Stocks,"" and the weekly newspaper IBD Weekly have been among those arguing the opposite for years. The message: You can and should in fact time the market.So what's an investor to do?This story should serve as an introduction to or refresher on IBD's approach to market timing. Learn the strategy to become better armed to make up your own mind on the matter of timing.The first thing you need to know about IBD's method is the follow-through-day concept. A follow-through confirms that the broad stock market has switched to rally mode after spending a considerable time retreating, also known as correcting.You get a follow-through when a major stock index (the S&P 500, Nasdaq or NYSE composite) closes up significantly from the prior session and in greater volume.What's meant by ""up significantly"" these days? IBD generally looks for a gain of 1.2% or more. When the markets are choppier and daily price swings are heavier than normal, IBD may demand that the follow-through gain be much bigger than that. In other cases, if volatility is low, a genuine follow-through could occur on a minimum 1% gain.The most powerful follow-through days happen — not always, but often — on Day 4 through Day 7 of an attempted rally. Within this window, you frequently get a clear signal of a new uptrend, and it can end up being a really strong move up, with many leading stocks providing big profits to their holders.On the other hand, you also can get follow-through days outside that window of Day 4 through Day 7, as happened in December 2011. All three indexes followed through on Dec. 20, 2011 (1). That was Day 17 of a new rally attempt.Even with a late follow-through, there was real strength in the ensuing uptrend. Plenty of leading stocks showed big gains in 2012's first quarter, such as Apple (AAPL) and Priceline Group (PCLN), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN).On Jan. 9, 2012, less than a month after the Nasdaq's Day 17 follow-through, Apple began a swift new run to new highs and shiny profits for alert IBD readers. The iPhone, Macbook and iPad seller rose above the 426.80 buy point in a 12-week cup without handle. The stock did not see heavy volume on the breakout day and moved sideways a few weeks. Then it burst into new highs in nearly triple average volume on Jan. 25 following quarterly results.By September that year, Apple rallied more than 65% to a high of 705 before embarking on a new deep correction. The company split its shares 7-for-1 in June 2014.Keep in mind that a follow-through doesn't have much to do with that week's headlines.In mid-December 2011, there was plenty of dismal news, from weaker-than-expected retail sales to experts seeing no solution to the eurozone debt crisis.Even a follow-through might not change the overall choppy nature of the major indexes. The year 2018 proves this case. After a steep 12% slide in less than three weeks from late January to mid-February, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both scored a Day 4 follow-through on Valentine's Day, Feb. 14. But the ride in stocks since then has not exactly been wine, roses and bonbons.Today, Apple has traded in a choppy fashion too. But that's part of the basing process.Final point. Not every follow-through works. Some are head-fakes. But every major market bottom going back to 1900 had one.(A version of this column was published in the Dec. 7, 2012, edition of IBD.

Like Trump, his speech was light on its impact for biotech companies and pharmaceutical companies. Instead, the White House is considering changes to Medicare and caps on out-of-pocket spending.Most proposals will impact so-called middlemen including pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs and drug distributors. They include the likes of Express Scripts (ESRX), CVS (CVS) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC).

More broadly, the president is calling for Part B to merge into Part D, Azar said.""Inflation-capped price increases in Part B is likely most impactful proposal in biotech, as well as out-of-pocket transparency for Part B vs. Part D drugs (infusions vs. self-injectables) and unifying Part B billing codes,"" RBC analysts said.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) has the largest exposure among large-cap biotechs to Part B through its eye disease drug called Eylea. Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Amgen (AMGN) also are exposed. Further, Sage Therapeutics (SAGE), Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) and Dynavax (DVAX) face difficulties.Azar also suggested changes to how PBMs issue and negotiate rebates. He proposed an end so-called ""gag clauses"" on pharmacists. These prevent pharmacists from telling consumers when they'd actually save money by paying out of pocket for their medicines.""Right now, we're asking a pretty straightforward question: What if, instead of the current system where drug companies get paid rebates and middlemen take a cut, we just had fixed-price discounts?"" Azar said. ""This would fix the situation where even the pharmacy benefit manager, who is hired to help keep prices low, makes money from higher list prices.""He also suggested pharmaceutical companies include their list prices in advertising that goes out directly to consumers. Further, Azar said he and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are developing incentives to lower list prices.But most of these changes are long-term ""further actions,"" Raymond James analyst Michael Baker said in a note. Changes to Part D contracts that prevent pharmacists from explaining when out-of-pocket costs are cheaper ""will likely not have a meaningful impact.""RELATED:Biotech Stocks Fly As Trump Speech Seen As 'More Bark Than Bite'Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?Long-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

12,REGN,"Traders torched stocks today amid a bonfire of selling (with respects to the passing of novelist Tom Wolfe) in the U.S. Treasury bond markets. But a small posse of leadership-quality companies bucked the broad Wall Street decline.They included new IPO Altair Engineering (ALTR), Splunk (SPLK), Cree (CREE), Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) and China Lodging (HTHT).In stocks today, homebuilders finished as the worst performer among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, down 5%, as the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond hit 3.08%, marking a new six-year high.D.R. Horton (DHI) tanked more than 6% to 40.58 and dropped sharply beneath its long-term 200-day moving average. The stock is now 23% beneath a 53.32 peak. LGI Homes (LGIH), which staged a vicious reversal last week despite posting robust Q1 results (EPS up 112% to $1.10, sales up 71% to $279 million), took out its 200-day line as shares fell 5.9% to 58.19.LGI Homes' turnover jumped 149% above its 50-day moving average, a strong hint that fund managers sold anxiously.""Rising mortgage rates are further squeezing affordability for would-be homebuyers that are already frustrated by limited inventory of available homes and higher home prices that have resulted,"" Bankrate.com chief financial analyst Greg McBride said.On Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average both slid 0.8%; at one point, both averages fell more than 1%. The S&P 500 sank 0.7%. Volume increased on both main exchanges, according to early data. The higher volume vs. Monday's action implies unusually intense professional selling.As noted in IBD's The Big Picture column, such significant drops in heavier volume are called distribution. A bevy of strong distribution days can signal an end to a major market uptrend.Despite the broad decline among large caps, the Russell 2000 inched less than 1 point higher. The small cap S&P 600 also rose less than 1 point; at 982, the 600 is up 4.9% since Jan. 1 while the S&P 500 is up 1.4%. The IBD current outlook for the market remains ""Confirmed uptrend.""Meanwhile, Leaderboard member Apple (AAPL) staged a gap-down in price, but volume was well below the 50-day average. Given Apple's solid breakout last week, it's normal to see even top stocks pull back to or near the proper buy point.A downward gap appears on a daily chart when the intraday high is below the intraday low of the prior trading session.In Apple's case, Tuesday's intraday high of 187.07 is 79 cents below Monday's session low of 187.86. Not much of a gap.On May 4, Apple broke out of a compact double bottom base pattern that supplied a 179.04 buy point. So far, the breakout has produced a gain of more than 6%.At 186.26, the iPhone, iPad and digital services giant is now up 57% past a 118.12 buy point in a first-stage cup with handle, one of the most important chart patterns that top growth stocks produce before breaking out to new highs and big price runs. Apple cleared that base in the midst of its fundamental turnaround, on Jan. 6, 2017.Altair, a member of IBD's specialty enterprise software industry group, barreled more than 6% higher to 33.51 and narrowly eclipsed a 33.49 buy point in a seven-week cup without handle. The 17% decline within the base is bullishly mild. The Troy, Mich.-based expert in innovation-boosting engineering software went public at 13 a share on Nov. 1 last year.Notice on a daily chart how Altair has made a habit of breaking out of IBD-style bases, going up quickly in just a few days, then reversing sharply below the correct entry. But from a longer point of view, the small cap has done a marvelous job of staying on the north side of its 50-day moving average.Altair on Monday posted a 167% leap in Q1 profit to 8 cents a share as revenue rose 19% to $91.7 million, a quarterly best.Meanwhile, Ligand thrust higher for a fifth straight session, rising more than 2% to 185.37. The biotech play is extended 7.7% past a 172.17 entry in a well-formed double-bottom base.The midpoint of 172.07, found in between the two sell-offs within the base, is in the upper half of the base's price range. That's a good sign.According to IBD Stock Checkup, Ligand sports a shiny Composite Rating of 98 on a scale of 1 to 99. This rating, found only in IBD Weekly and at Investors.com, gauges a stock's corporate fundamentals, stock price strength, and quality of institutional sponsorship. It is not a purely technical indicator.Ligand's Relative Price Strength Rating is a stout 91, also on a scale of 1 to 99. This means the San Diego-based company is beating 91% of all publicly traded companies in IBD's database in 12-month price performance.In terms of market value, at $3.9 billion Ligand barely lifts a finger to the likes of Celgene (CELG), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Amgen (AMGN) in the biotech world. However, Ligand is body-slamming these three peers in terms of earnings growth. Ligand has grown profits 91%, 57%, 77% and 172% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see earnings in Q2 rising 43% to 96 cents a share. Keep in mind, that's on top of the 91% jump in the year-ago quarter.Revenue broke the $50 million barrier on a quarterly basis in both the past two quarters. Year over year, the top line has boomed higher by 43%, 54%, 32% and 92% in the past four quarters.Read this recent New America feature piece on why Ligand is growing so rapidly.China Lodging, a major player in the fast-growing travel market in the Middle Kingdom, sprinted 9% to 169.50 in quadruple normal trade. The stock surpassed a 161 buy point in an unusual four-month double bottom. The RS line roared into new high ground.The proper buy zone goes up to 169.05, or 5% past the 161 entry.China Lodging posted a 79% jump in first-quarter earnings to 61 cents a share as revenue rose 42% to $332 million. After-tax margin climbed an impressive 310 basis points to 13.5%.The stock ranks No. 5 in the IBD 50.Keep in mind that China Lodging's recent base-on-base structure is at least fourth stage, which increases the risk of a breakout failure. The stock initially broke out of an 11-week cup base at 33.10 in the week ended March 18, 2016.However, some companies with stellar fundamentals defy the odds.(For the latest updates on this story and other market coverage, check IBD stories on stocks today.

14,REGN,"Sanofi (SNY) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (REGN) Dupixent is off to a strong start in the U.S., but revenue from the eczema drug lagged in Europe, an analyst said Wednesday after Sanofi's fourth-quarter report.X Dupixent generated 118 million euros, or $145.6 million according to current exchange rates during the fourth quarter, which was close to Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez's expectations for 119 million euros, or $146.9 million. Worldwide sales soundly beat Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond's estimate for $135 million.In Europe, though, Dupixent sales were 1 million euros, or $1.23 million, which lagged the model of RBC analyst Kennen MacKay for $19 million. The consensus had called for $8 million in Dupixent revenue in Europe, he said.""We view the U.S. result as indicative of continued solid uptake with Dupixent's 40%-plus quarter-over-year growth continuing to impress,"" he said in a note to clients. ""In contrast, we anticipate that the European ramp could take additional time.""Sanofi fell 4.1% to close at 40.39 on the stock market today. Regeneron, Sanofi's partner on Dupixent and other drugs, dipped 1.2% to 334.61. Regeneron is set to report its fourth-quarter earnings early Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's rule of always selling a stock 20%-25% after it breaks out has some exceptions that include asking whether the market is in the early or late stages of a new bull run. For more tips, visit the Investor's Corner.For the fourth quarter, Sanofi reported total revenue of 8.69 billion euros, or $10.72 billion, falling 2% on a constant-currency basis vs. the year-earlier period. Leerink's Fernandez had called for 8.83 billion euros, or $10.9 billion.Earnings per share declined 8.8% at a constant exchange rate to 1.06 euros, or $1.31 and missed Fernandez's view for 1.20 euros, or $1.48. Fernandez cited higher operational spend for Sanofi's earnings miss. Operational expenses were 9% above his expectations.In 2018, Sanofi expects earnings per share to grow 2%-5% at constant exchange rates, including the contributions from recently announced acquisitions of Biogen (BIIB) spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) and Ablynx (ABLX).RELATED:GlaxoSmithKline Slips On 2018 Guidance As Generic Advair LoomsThese Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: AnalystBristol Continues 2-Day Plunge Amid Debate On Merck-Rivaling Combo

15,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) should benefit after Novartis (NVS) and Roche (RHHBY) presented data for drugs they hope will rival blockbuster eye treatment Eylea, an analyst said Monday.X Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges questioned the reliability of data presented by Novartis for a drug called brolucizumab and Roche for its RG7716. Both could rival Eylea in treating eye diseases.""The confusing and somewhat lackluster data presented over the weekend for Eylea's theoretical competitors should lift some of the overhang that Regeneron's stock has suffered from over the last six months,"" he said in a note to clients.Novartis' brolucizumab is being tested as a treatment for an eye condition that can cause blindness called wet age-related macular degeneration. Porges referred to the study design as ""confusing/confounding.""Patients were checked for disease progression at specific times and could have their dose schedule changed, Porges said. In addition, there were multiple disease assessment guidelines to determine dose levels, potentially complicating the drug's label.""The other clear implication from these guideline criteria is that patients were required to actively lose vision at the every-12-weeks dosing schedule before they were switched to more frequent dosing, which some meeting participants (and) specialists considered unethical given the long-term effects of loss of acuity,"" he wrote.IBD'S TAKE: It's tough hanging onto a stock through a correction as declines mount. When is it time to let go? And is it possible to still capture a big gain in some stocks? Head to the Investor's Corner for a deep dive.Roche's RG7716 is being developed to treat the same disorder.  The drug showed a benefit over Roche's Lucentis — which treats several eye conditions — in a study of 229 patients. But in two earlier studies with a total of 667 patients there was no benefit on vision correction.Two studies suggested the mechanism used by RG7716 added some benefit in terms of retinal thickness. Porges argues it's uncertain whether increasing retinal thickness has a clinical benefit.""Even if RG7716 succeeds at showing superiority to Lucentis, and confirming the signal from this trial in larger studies, it then looks, as one attendee at the meeting suggested, 'just like Eylea,' "" he said.RBC analyst Kennen MacKay, though, called the data from RG7716 ""compelling, though do not check all the boxes yet."" Unlike Porges, he sees the results adding competitive headwinds to Regeneron's Eylea in terms of its long-term market position.However, Roche faces an uphill battle in rivaling Regeneron as Eylea's effectiveness deepens over time and it's still unknown how RG7716 will perform over a longer time frame, MacKay said in a note to clients.On the stock market today, Regeneron jumped 1.9% to close at 342.67, as Novartis lifted 0.9% to 84.01, and Roche advanced 0.8% to 29.22. The market has been in a correction recently, with biotech and pharma stocks sliding last week.RELATED:Biotech Investors Flee In Droves As Market Correction Rocks The GroupRegeneron Dips In Sympathy With Biotechs Despite Quarterly BeatGeneralists on Biotech Sidelines As Tax Reform Sweeps The U.S.

16,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) dived Thursday in sympathy with biotech stocks despite broadly topping fourth-quarter metrics and sales expectations for key drugs Dupixent, Eylea and Praluent.X There was ""not a whole lot of suspense on most product revenue numbers"" after Regeneron pre-released most metrics in January and partner Sanofi (SNY) issued its fourth-quarter report on Wednesday, Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said in a note to clients.For the fourth quarter, Regeneron brought in $1.58 billion in sales, growing 29% and beating the consensus for $1.5 billion. Adjusted profit of $5.23 per share advanced 72% and topped estimates for $4.68 a share.Sales of eye drug Eylea increased 19% globally to $1.61 billion. In the U.S., Eylea brought in $975 million, up 14%. Outside the U.S., Eylea grew 28% to $637 million. The consensus had modeled $960 million in the U.S. and $578 million for the rest of the world, Raymond said.But Regeneron is no longer offering full-year guidance for Eylea sales. However, ""shaping their expectations for this drug's future is also of great interest,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Regeneron dropped 3.6% to 322.62. Shares earlier dipped as much as 3.8%. The broader biotech group plunged 4%.IBD'S TAKE: The 50-day moving average takes a stock's daily closing price for the past 50 days and averages them. So what does this line say about the stock's health? Head to the Investor's Corner for more.Eylea is Regeneron's biggest moneymaker. It's currently in Phase 3 testing as a treatment for non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, an early stage of an eye disease that affects diabetics. Regeneron could seek an additional approval in this use if the results are positive.Regeneron also has a regulatory filing for eczema drug Dupixent in asthma and is testing the drug as a treatment for nasal polyps. It will soon begin studies of Dupixent as a treatment for an allergic condition of the esophagus, as well as peanut and grass allergies, Porges said.During the quarter, Dupixent brought in $139 million in sales, which was 12% above analysts' view, Porges said. Sales of cholesterol-lowering drug Praluent rose 54% to $63 million, north of the consensus by 26%.Praluent is pegged for a readout in March of a study called Odyssey. The trial tested the drug's ability to improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with elevated ""bad"" LDL cholesterol and an acute coronary event in the last year.The data ""may have an impact on Praluent's market share,"" Porges said. Praluent belongs to a class of drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors where it most closely rivals Amgen's (AMGN) Repatha.The only black cloud over Regeneron's fourth-quarter report was Kevzara, a rheumatoid arthritis treatment that brought in $9 million in sales, lagging the consensus view for $15 million, Piper Jaffray's Raymond said.Kevzara is also slated to begin Phase 3 studies as a treatment for a blood vessel disease and a disease of the muscles and joints causing pain and stiffness, Leerink's Porges said.For 2018, Regeneron said it expects $450 million to $500 million in revenue from products where it partners with Sanofi and $1.23 billion to $1.33 billion in unreimbursed research-and-development costs. It sees a tax rate of 15%-19%.RELATED:Sanofi, Regeneron Dip As Eczema Drug Dupixent Lags In EuropeCan CRISPR And These 3 Small Biotechs Cure 10,000 Diseases?These Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: Analyst

17,REGN,"The major averages dusted off minor early losses and headed into the final hour of trading on Tuesday with modest gains.X The mild reversal from an opening decline is bullish for stock investors, but for now the current outlook, as noted in the Market Pulse in IBD's The Big Picture, remains at ""Market in correction.""At least seven members of the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1 point or more, hoisting the blue-chip index up nearly 0.4%. The Nasdaq composite is doing slightly better, rising more than 0.5% despite mixed action by the FAANG stocks.The S&P 500 rallied 0.4% to 2665, cutting its year-to-date loss to less than 0.4%. The large-cap benchmark rose 19.4% in 2017.Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), a closed-end fund that tracks the alternative digital currency, took a breather after rising five straight sessions, falling more than 4% to 14.23.While the fund showed nice support during last week's test of the 200-day moving average, it is still recovering after a climax run in December and a round-trip of all its gains following a Nov. 27 breakout past a 10.93 buy point in a very deep cup with handle.After that breakout, Bitcoin Investment Trust gained more than 254% to a peak of 38.75, ending that run with a near-vertical climb of 112% in just seven sessions. Stocks and funds that go into climax runs need a lot of time to digest those magnificent gains, form a new base, and set up a potential new breakout.So the right move right now for Bitcoin traders is to make no move and simply watch.IBD analyzes the market action by looking at the relative performance of 197 industry groups and subgroups. Today, at least 14 of these groups rallied 1.5% or more, sharply beating the major indexes. They include education and media software, solar power, department stores, trucking, cement, metal ores, computer networking gear, wood products and internet content.In the education and media software group, two thinly traded names stand out. Instructure (INST), which provides a cloud-based task management platform for schools and teachers, gapped up 14% to 42.60 in whale-like volume after briefly clearing a 36.70 buy point in a flat base last week. 2U (TWOU), a March 2014 IPO, gained more than 3% to 72.96 in light trading.2U has a sloppy earnings record, losing money in both Q2 and Q3 of 2017. But the provider of online learning software to universities is expected to post a 225% jump in fourth-quarter earnings to 13 cents a share. Revenue has grown 37%, 32%, 35% vs. year-ago levels in the past three quarters.Among large and megacap plays, Dow Jones industrial component Caterpillar (CAT) at one point gained nearly 3 points and got as high as 155.20 in below-average turnover.

18,REGN,"Biotech investors collectively pulled $1.2 billion out of the sector this week — but analysts said Friday that's the byproduct of a broader market correction, not malaise in health care-tied stocks.X For the week ended Feb. 7, health care and biotech funds saw $1.21 billion in net outflows, representing a 1.95% decrease in assets, Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond wrote in a note to clients. At the same time, all equities posted a 0.33% dip in assets.The reason: Biotech stocks tend to experience the worst of a market correction, said Brad Loncar, a portfolio manager who runs a cancer immunotherapy-based fund. Biotech stocks hit a multiyear high in late January but have since lost nearly 13%.""I believe this is totally normal and I think that biotech is just doing so terrible this week because it's a volatile sector and when the entire stock market has a bad week like this, biotechs are likely to do a little bit worse,"" he told Investor's Business Daily.Most pundits say the market correction is overdue. In general, the market experienced a very mild 2017 with gradual rising and few interruptions. Now, it's heading into a ""risk-off"" scenario as investors seek lower-risk positions, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat told IBD in an email.By the close on the stock market today, the biotech group eked out a small gain, paring earlier losses when it fell as much as 4.6%. For the week, the group was down nearly 5.5%.Among those hardest hit this week was Corcept Therapeutics (CORT), which lopped off 38% on a coming rivalry from Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) for a treatment for Cushing's syndrome, which affects the pituitary gland. Prothena (PRTA) dove 28% after its chief medical officer announced her departure.Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG) and Biogen (BIIB) all lost north of 8%. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) topped fourth-quarter views, but plunged nearly 5%. Gilead Sciences (GILD) toppled more than 4% as guidance missed.But among large-caps, fourth-quarter metrics and 2018 guidance was largely in line with expectations, Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young told IBD. She described the fourth quarter as a ""decent showing"" with ""no fires,"" unlike the strained third quarter.IBD'S TAKE: The Dow Jones industrial average toppled 4.1% lower on Thursday while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 tumbled 3.9% and 3.8%, respectively. Are bears taking a bite out of the bull market? Head to The Big Picture for more.""Hopefully that trend continues,"" she said. ""But this is biotech, it's a risky space and things happen.""Young and Loncar agree that the market correction isn't indicative of the outlook for the biotech group. Both say the fundamentals look strong and the group is poised for buying spree, which began late last year with Gilead's acquisition of Kite Pharma.In January, Celgene said it would buy Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Sanofi (SNY) announced acquisitions of Biogen spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) and Belgium's Ablynx (ABLX). Sanofi beat out Novo Nordisk (NVO) for Ablynx.Smart companies will go after assets when valuations go down, Loncar said. Many of the bigger players are facing payer scrutiny in saturated areas like rheumatology and diabetes. For Gilead, declining hepatitis C drug sales led to its Kite purchase. Celgene is facing competition in inflammation drugs.""No. 1, the larger companies have slowing growth so they need to buy growth and they need to buy innovation,"" he said. ""And No. 2, this tax reform deal that just passed kind of adds fuel to the fire and makes it much more easy for them to do these deals.""RELATED:Gilead Pops After FDA Approves Glaxo-Rivaling HIV DrugThese Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: AnalystAlexion Tops Quarterly Views But Guidance Lags; Alnylam Dips On Losses

19,REGN,"Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) lost a third of its value Wednesday after its LDL cholesterol-lowering drug underperformed bullish expectations in a late-stage study.But Needham analyst Chad Messer called the results strong. Esperion's drug, called bempedoic acid, lowered ""bad"" LDL cholesterol by an additional 20% in some patients when added to maximally tolerated statin therapy.""While 20% is at the lower bound of what we have seen in previous data, this was a much larger study,"" he said in a note. ""Data often revert to the mean in large studies, so we actually view 20% as a strong result in this context.""Investors disagreed vehemently. On the stock market today, Esperion crashed 35.1% to close at 45.75.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEsperion tested bempedoic acid in 2,230 patients. At 12 weeks, the drug lowered their LDL cholesterol levels by an additional 20% when added to maximally tolerated statin-based therapy.Patients also experienced a 22% reduction in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, or hsCRP. That protein is an important marker of underlying inflammation associated with cardiovascular disease.Messer noted that the study enrolled high-risk patients whose only other option would be injectable drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors. Amgen (AMGN) makes one called Repatha and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) with partner Sanofi (SNY) make another dubbed Praluent.These drugs ""cost tens of thousands of dollars a year,"" he said. ""Payers and patients alike have so far been reluctant to adopt these therapies in a significant way. Bempedoic acid is a once-daily pill that we anticipate will be sold for a few hundred dollars a month.""Notably, Regeneron and Sanofi said Tuesday they had struck a deal with Express Scripts (ESRX) to cut the net price of their drug, Praluent, in exchange for simplifying the patient-insurance process. Praluent and Repatha also work to lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol.Messer kept his strong buy rating and 94 price target on Esperion.Esperion also reported its first-quarter results. Losses of $1.73 per share narrowed from a $1.80 per-share loss in the year-earlier period. But that missed the consensus which projected a per-share loss of $1.56.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Next Nvidia?

20,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) tumbled to a four-year low Tuesday — prodding rival Amgen (AMGN) to also dip — after announcing a deal with Express Scripts (ESRX) to cut the net price of cholesterol drug Praluent.Express Scripts will list Praluent as its exclusive PSCK9 inhibitor on its national formulary as of July 1. In exchange, it will pay a lower price for the drug. PCSK9 inhibitors, like Praluent and Amgen's Repatha, work to reduce ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the blood. They also benefit cardiovascular outcomes.The move is in an effort to expand access to cholesterol drug Praluent, Regeneron and partner Sanofi (SNY) said. Some reports suggest 70% of prescription requests are rejected by insurers. That could be, in part, due to price. Praluent and Repatha go for north of $14,000 per year.Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer praised the deal in a written statement. He sees the agreement as setting a new standard model for medicines like Praluent.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""This paradigm-shifting agreement is designed to break the gridlock so that Praluent is finally able to reach patients most in need,"" he said. ""U.S. cardiologists have experienced unprecedented challenges in securing access for Praluent for patients who were clearly appropriate, but were denied coverage.""But investors weren't as keen on the deal. In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Regeneron slipped 0.8% to 301.22. Amgen dropped 3% to 169.28. Sanofi lost a fraction to 39.13.The agreement significantly reduces the documentation necessary to secure Express Scripts insurance coverage for the cholesterol drug, Regeneron and Sanofi said in a press release. Physicians will submit a simplified attestation form to confirm the patient is appropriate for Praluent.Express Scripts also agreed to pass a portion of the savings onto patients enrolled in other plans. Those patients should see lower out-of-pocket costs for their Praluent prescriptions, the companies said.Analysts were largely positive on the deal, though note the specifics of the price cut aren't public. It's likely Praluent will be priced in line with a recent report that suggested it would be cost effective for higher risk patients at $4,500-$8,000 annually, RBC analyst Brian Williams said in a note.The ""price for volume"" announcement leaves a lot of the financial benefit up in the air, Williams said. The PCSK9 market is particularly attractive given its massive size. But this type of deal could further incentivize insurers to implement complicated utilization processes, he said.Further, if the deal prices the cholesterol drug closer to the $4,500 annual target, it would represent a 50%-plus cut to the net price, Williams said.""Despite this, we do not view this as a pricing 'race to the bottom' given potential for annual compounding and lifetime treatment creating distinct differences vs. the 'price for volume' contracts in the curative one-time-treatment hepatitis C space,"" he added.Now, it's a battle for the other insurers, Williams said. Amgen is in negotiations with payers and will likely leverage its ""expertise in winning contracting agreements"" to seek deals with United Health (UNH), CVS Health (CVS), Anthem (ANTM), Aetna (AET), Cigna (CI) or Humana (HUM), he said.Amgen estimates the Express Scripts formulary decision will impact 2,000, or 6%, of Repatha patients, Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said in a report to clients. But he kept his model on Praluent intact until after the first-quarter earnings conference call on Thursday.""Just doing some back-of-the-envelope math, if all 2,000 Repatha patients switched to Praluent on July 1, this would be an $8 million tailwind for Praluent in the second half of 2018 on the formulary decision alone,"" he said.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

22,REGN,"AnaptysBio (ANAB) dragged rival Aimmune Therapeutics (AIMT) into the red on Tuesday after reporting its peanut-allergy drug improved symptoms in nearly half of all adult patients in a study.The trial tested a drug called ANB020 in patients with moderate-to-severe peanut allergies. Six out of 13, or 46%, could tolerate a cumulative 500-milligram dose of the peanut protein 14 days after a single dose of ANB020 vs. none of the placebo patients.But analysts were confused on the results and noted AnaptysBio excluded four patients with milder symptoms. This amplified ""the apparent activity of the treatment,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note.On the stock market today, AnaptysBio dropped 5.5% to close at 107.52, as shares of Aimmune toppled 3.8% to 30.07. Rival DBV Technologies (DBVT) rose 1%, near 22.80. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), another competitor, slipped 0.4% to 329.24.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAimmune and DBV also are working on treatments for peanut allergies. Aimmune is developing a drug called AR101. After a year, more than half of children treated with AR101 could tolerate a 100 times increase in exposure to the peanut protein.Comparing the two trials is a challenge, RBC analyst Kennen MacKay said in a report. The study from AnaptysBio appears to have enrolled a less severe group of patients. This seems to have driven AnaptysBio to exclude four milder patients.""We therefore see more questions than answers from this mixed dataset, and await more color on these areas of uncertainty from management,"" he said. However, ""we continue to like AnaptysBio for upcoming ANB020 data in asthma anticipated in the third quarter.""Leerink analyst Dae Gon Ha sees limited impact on DBV which is working on a peanut-allergy drug called Viaskin Peanut. Ha kept an outperform rating on DBV.""Whereas (ANB020) could ultimately become an effective agent, we see limited read-through to DBV's market opportunity at the outset of (Monday's) 14-day Phase 2 results,"" Ha said in a report to clients.The results also speak to the potential for Regeneron's allergy franchise, Leerink's Porges said. Regeneron makes an eczema drug called Dupixent. The firm is also looking at Dupixent in asthma and peanut allergies.Regeneron also has a drug called REGN3500 which is to the same drug class as ANB020. Both drugs are known as antibodies that inhibit the interleukin-33, or IL-33, cytokine. Investigators believe IL-33 has a connection to eczema, food allergies and asthma.In AnaptysBio's study, allergic symptoms that typically overlap with the peanut allergy occurred in four out of five patients, or 80%, who received the placebo, but in just one of 15 patients, or 7%, who received a single dose of ANB020.The reduction is encouraging, Leerink's Porges said. Regeneron isn't testing REGN3500 in peanut allergies, but rather in asthma. Though Regeneron is teamed up with Aimmune to test Dupixent and AR101 in peanut allergies.""But the analysis of ANB020's impact on the alleviation of concomitant allergy symptoms suggests to use that Regeneron deserves some credit for this potential of their IL-33 in diseases such as atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"" he said.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

23,REGN,"AstraZeneca (AZN), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are the likeliest targets of a biopharma ""detonation event"" in which tax reform spurs widespread mergers and acquisitions across the group, an analyst said Friday.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez calls the coming consolidation ""inevitable.""Products made by the likes of AbbVie (ABBV), Roche (RHHBY), Amgen (AMGN), Dow Jones stock Merck (MRK), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Shire (SHPG) are soon to face new competition and generic rivals.This follows ""an unprecedented period of innovation and new product launches within large biopharma,"" he said in a note to clients. ""Several of the largest companies will likely experience a substantial growth slowdown within the next five to seven years.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCelgene, Biogen and AstraZeneca would be most accretive to a potential acquirer, based on short-term financials, Fernandez said. Their average accretion in 2020 would be 25%, 14% and 13%, respectively.But Bristol, AstraZeneca and Vertex make the most sense long-term and strategically, he said. These three appear to be ""best positioned"" for longer-term revenue growth based on a look at consensus expectations for 2020-24.The last major consolidation period in biopharma occurred during the last decade, in which there were seven deals greater than $40 billion in value. The largest was Dow Jones stock Pfizer's (PFE) $93.8 billion acquisition of Warner-Lambert, at a 34% premium.Pfizer also paid the biggest premium, 38%, on Pharmacia, forking over $60.5 billion to acquire the firm. Merck paid a 34% premium to buy Schering-Plough for $45.7 billion. Since 2010, deals combining Pfizer with AstraZeneca and Allergan (AGN) and AbbVie with Shire have failed.Fernandez sees the next cycle as a seller's market. Pfizer is struggling with its late entry to the immuno-oncology market, whereas Merck has a strong immuno-oncology drug — Keytruda — but lacks a robust late-stage pipeline.Roche faces biosimilar competition for its top drugs: Avastin, Herceptin and Rituxan. Novartis (NVS) is still experiencing challenges in its Sandoz unit. AbbVie is strong in the near-term, but its key drug Humira will soon see competition in Europe and in the U.S. after 2022.Strategically, AstraZeneca would be a strong fit for AbbVie, Pfizer, Roche or Merck, Fernandez said. Bristol could fit in at AbbVie and Pfizer. Meanwhile, it's possible AbbVie could swing for Vertex.Through a financial lens, AstraZeneca, Vertex, Biogen and Bristol are the most compelling targets for their ability to enhance long-term sales, he said.Amgen could be an acquirer or a target with $70 billion in funds to buy something, Fernandez said. Assuming Amgen is looking to make a deal valued at less than $90 billion, Vertex rises to the top of the list among the potential targets, outlasting Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Shire.""Among the three, Vertex looks more interesting,"" he said.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityLong-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

27,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) won't unseat Amgen (AMGN) at the top of the PCSK9 cholesterol market, an analyst said Wednesday, suggesting Regeneron's Praluent will be similar to Amgen's Repatha in a heart study.X Both drugs — Amgen's Repatha and Regeneron's Praluent — aim to lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol by targeting a protein in the liver known as proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9, or PCSK9. Now, Regeneron is testing whether that will also reduce the risk of cardiovascular trouble.The study from Regeneron will be presented this weekend. RBC analyst Kennen MacKay expects Praluent to show a similar effect as Repatha. In Amgen's Fourier trial unveiled last year Repatha cut the risk of four major cardiovascular events by 15%. But it didn't have an impact on death.""We anticipate largely similar results, i.e., a 15% relative risk reduction of major cardiovascular events but little to no benefit on hospitalizations and cardiovascular-related mortality,"" he said in a note. He expects the drugs to ""remain largely undifferentiated from an efficacy perspective.""MacKay sees an 80% likelihood of Praluent having a similar effect as Repatha on cardiovascular outcomes.

Amgen stock could gain $3 while Regeneron loses $5.For a third, less likely scenario, MacKay models a 5% chance Praluent could top Repatha by either reducing the risk of four major cardiovascular events by at least 20% or improving the risk of cardiovascular-related death.""In this scenario, we anticipate that Regeneron captures 80% of the PCSK9 market, while Amgen's share decreases to 20%,"" he said. ""This scenario results in plus $45 per share to our Regeneron price target and minus $15 per share to our Amgen price target.""There are several differences between both trials that suggest Amgen's was more likely to succeed, MacKay said. Regeneron enrolled fewer patients and ran a longer trial. Some have suggested with more time, Praluent could show a greater benefit on cardiovascular outcomes.Praluent would need to show at least a 20% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular outcomes or a benefit on mortality to ""unambiguously claim"" that Praluent is superior to Repatha, MacKay said.""Additionally, given the striking similarities in LDL reductions seen from both agents after one year of therapy, we would view any incremental relative risk reduction improvements from Praluent treatment as a read-through to Repatha's likely similar long-term treatment benefits,"" he said.On the stock market today, Regeneron sank 0.3% to close at 334.41.

29,REGN,"Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) dipped early Thursday after announcing a collaboration with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) late Wednesday to research treatments for a form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.But Piper Jaffray analyst Edward Tenthoff was bullish on the partnership, which will marry Regeneron's discovery of a specific genetic variant associated with some chronic liver diseases and Alnylam's work in a type of therapy called RNA interference.""We see this deal as a positive as Alnylam's expertise in RNA interference delivery to hepatocytes (liver cells) complements therapeutic translation of Regeneron's discovery,"" he said in a note to clients.Alnylam and Regeneron are joining a wide field of biotechs and drugmakers working on treatments for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis including Gilead Sciences (GILD), Allergan (AGN), Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) and Novartis (NVS).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn the stock market today, Alnylam fell 2.6%, near 142.50, after breaking out of a consolidation earlier this month at a 147.73 buy point. Regeneron fell 2.1% to 327.69. Biotech stocks were up a small fraction.The deal between Alnylam and Regeneron is based on Regeneron's discovery of a variation in the HSD17B13 gene which is tied to reduced risk of, or protection from, various chronic liver diseases, the firm said in a press release.Regeneron's findings stem from a large-scale human genetics effort undertaken by the Regeneron Genetics Center. The new potential therapeutic target could be used to trim the risk of, or halt the progression of, some chronic liver diseases.Alnylam and Regeneron plan to look at potential treatments for a disease known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in which the liver suffers damage similar to that caused by alcohol. Patients are often obese or have type 2 diabetes.They plan to use Alnylam's expertise in RNA interference to target the HSD17B13 gene. RNA interference allows researchers to specifically target and silence any gene involved in the cause or pathway of human disease.Piper Jaffray's Tenthoff says the collaboration could expand into a co-development or co-commercialization deal. He kept his 182 price target and overweight rating on Alnylam.RELATED:How To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersThe Basics: How To Analyze A Stock's Cup With HandleShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

33,REGN,"Study results released over the weekend from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) validated the long-term benefits of lowering ""bad"" LDL cholesterol, but the two drug giants didn't exactly reap the rewards when trading opened Monday.X Instead, a relatively obscure biotech, Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) popped after initially falling once investors digested the impact of the trial, dubbed Odyssey Outcomes.The trial showed Regeneron and Sanofi's drug, Praluent, cut the risk of cardiovascular events like heart attack and stroke by 15%, with stronger benefits for patients with the highest risk. The findings come a year after Amgen (AMGN) tanked on a similar trial. As a result, Regeneron and Sanofi announced a plan to increase patient access to Praluent by offering additional rebates to payers who agree to ""reduce burdensome access barriers"" for high-risk patients, bringing the price of their drug well below that of Amgen's drug Repatha.But Credit Suisse analyst Martin Auster called the results a boon for Esperion, which is working on a drug known as bempedoic acid to lower LDL cholesterol. It differs from Praluent and Repatha which belong to a class called PSCK9 inhibitors.""We see positive results as further validation to the importance of LDL-cholesterol lowering, especially in higher risk patients, reinforcing bempedoic acid's approval path bed on LDL lowering in the Phase 3 program,"" Auster said in a note to clients.On the stock market today, Esperion surged 6.4% to close at 80.05. Earlier in the session, shares were down as much as 6% as investors struggled to realize who would benefit most from the study.Amgen fell 0.9% to 189.30. Regeneron gained 0.8% to 344.55. Sanofi was up 0.6% to 40.65.The Fourier and Odyssey results from Amgen and Regeneron/Sanofi, respectively, also should benefit The Medicines Company (MDCO) and Esperion, analysts say. Medicines is working on a drug called inclisiran, which uses a mechanism called RNA interference to trim cholesterol.""Despite the difference in chemical composition (RNA interference for inclisiran vs. antibodies for Repatha/Praluent), we view the positive results from two large outcomes data as derisking for inclisiran,"" Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz said in a note to clients.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportMedicines has a huge advantage as it preps for its own cardiovascular outcomes trial. It will take lessons from prior trials and has already recruited some of the key leaders in Amgen's and Regeneron/Sanofi's studies. Shares of Medicines climbed 3.3% to 35.48.""The Medicines Company is truly standing on the shoulders of giants that could materialize with results better than Odyssey,"" Schwartz said.Credit Suisse's Auster notes the Odyssey results support approval of bempedoic acid in 2020 and increase his confidence in Esperion's cardiovascular outcomes trial, expected to be released in 2022.Bempedoic acid is expected to cost roughly one-third or less than a recent analysis which suggested PCSK9 inhibitors like Repatha and Praluent would be cost effective at $4,500-$8,000 per year. Esperion's drug is expected to cost about $2,000 annually.In the 18,924-patient study, Praluent reduced the risk of major cardiovascular complications including heart attack and stroke by 15%. More surprising, Praluent was also associated with a lower risk of death across all patients.The benefit was strongest in patients with high LDL cholesterol despite taking high doses of cholesterol-lowering statins. In those patients, Praluent cut the risk of all cardiovascular events and death by 24% and 29%, respectively.Regeneron and Sanofi are now targeting this group of patients by offering a lower net price to payers who reduce access barriers to high-risk patients. This would bring the cost of Praluent in line with a recent analysis that found it cost effective at $4,500-$8,000 per year.Today, Praluent and Amgen's Repatha both cost north of $14,000 per year. Both drugs have had somewhat lackluster launches. RBC analyst Kennen MacKay called the commercial move ""long overdue,"" though he noted Amgen will likely have a counter-strategy.Repatha has about 70% of the PCSK9 inhibitor market, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. But Repatha didn't show the same benefit in high-risk patients, nor did it have an impact on mortality in a trial dubbed Fourier unveiled last year.""In the immediate future, we expect significant share recovery for Praluent based on Odyssey results,"" Porges said. ""The deployment of new contracts will take months, but should result in some further inflection in the pace of new patient starts for the class.""Amgen will likely match Regeneron and Sanofi's terms for the PCSK9 drug. This should help acceleration in the class, he said.RELATED:How Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?How To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersHow To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors Rich

35,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) is on deck to launch several drugs with blockbuster potential over the next few years, including a skin cancer treatment in 2018, an analyst predicted Thursday.X Argus analyst Jasper Hellweg kept his buy rating on Regeneron stock, though he cut his price target to 470 from 540. Regeneron climbed 1.8% to close at 382.60 on the stock market today.""Within Regeneron's pipeline, several products seem particularly promising,"" Hellweg said.The skin cancer drug, cemiplimab, is what's known as a PD-1 antibody. It would compete with others in the class including Dow stock Merck's (MRK) Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo.Regeneron officials said Tuesday they have seven trials ranging from Phase 1 to Phase 3 studying cemiplimab in cancer. In the third quarter, the Food and Drug Administration granted the drug breakthrough therapy status to treat some patients with a form of skin cancer known as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.IBD'S TAKE: Chief executives of large-cap biotechs have less experience today than they did in the past, according to an analysis from one analyst. Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on how this might impact the potential for mergers and acquisitions in 2018.On Dec. 13, Regeneron announced that a Phase 2 study of cemiplimab showed positive results in some patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. The firm plans to file applications next year for approval to treat the condition in the U.S. and Europe.Regeneron also announced earlier this month a collaboration with ISA Pharmaceuticals to study an immunotherapy drug known as ISA101 with cemiplimab as a treatment for cancer caused by the human papillomavirus type 16, also known as HPV16-induced cancer.""While the two companies will share clinical trials costs and exchange product supply, Regeneron will gain exclusive worldwide licensing rights for ISA101 in exchange for an upfront payment, an equity investment and future milestone payments,"" Hellweg said.ISA is far from Regeneron's only partner, though. Regeneron's antibody discovery agreement with Sanofi (SNY) is set to expire at the end of the year, but the two companies have an array of other deals. Regeneron also partners with Bayer (BAYRY).Under the antibody discovery agreement with Sanofi, the companies developed Praluent, Dupixent and Kevzara, as well as three unapproved drugs, including cemiplimab. Praluent is used to lower cholesterol. Dupixent treats eczema and is being investigated to treat asthma. Kevzara treats rheumatoid arthritis.These drugs are important to help Regeneron diversify beyond Eylea, Hellweg said. Eylea is approved to treat a pair of eye diseases and is marketed by Bayer outside the U.S. In the third quarter, Eylea brought in 63.5% of Regeneron's sales. But it's facing competition from Novartis (NVS).""We believe that the company's financial results will benefit from potential new indications for Eylea and Praluent, as well as from increased sales of Praluent, Dupixent and Kevzara,"" he said. ""Regeneron has the marketing and commercial ability to roll out drugs quickly, as seen in its recent product launches.""RELATED:Amgen, Regeneron Prep For Battle In 2018 Over Cholesterol DrugsWhy Biotech Stocks May Wait A While Before Feeling The LoveBeware: Price Wars For Big Pharma, Biotech Companies On Horizon

36,REGN,"European pharmaceutical firms AstraZeneca (AZN) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) pulled upgrades on Friday as analysts looked ahead to key 2018 clinical trial readouts in ovarian cancer and diabetes, respectively.X AstraZeneca rose 1.7% to 34.70 on the stock market today, while Novo Nordisk dipped a fraction to 53.67. JPMorgan analyst James Gordon upgraded AstraZeneca to an overweight rating. JPM's Richard Vosser boosted Novo Nordisk to a neutral rating.AstraZeneca's medium-term growth outlook is twice the European pharma sector, Gordon wrote in a note to clients. In 2018, he expects a return to topline growth with new launches being key, and he sees core earnings hitting a floor before rising in 2019.Gordon was bearish this year on a clinical trial testing a combination of immuno-oncology drugs in advanced lung cancer. In July, AstraZeneca said the regimen didn't shrink tumors. It had pinned its hopes on the trial, dubbed Mystic, and immuno-oncology in general.Now, the Mystic trial is continuing with a goal of improving overall survival, or OS.""Our bear key points in 2017 were an expectation for Mystic PFS (progression-free survival) failure and overly high base business and divestment expectations,"" he said. ""With Mystic PFS having failed and low expectations for the OS readout, we now see only modest downside.""AstraZeneca is also set to have data from a trial of its drug, Lynparza, as a first treatment for a form of ovarian cancer. There, it rivals Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Tesaro (TSRO), but Gordon sees a high likelihood AstraZeneca will be successful in the trial is calls Solo-1.IBD'S TAKE: Large-cap biotechs and drugmakers suffered mounting competition in 2017 from newer therapies and generic rivalries. That theme is likely to continue into 2018, analysts say. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at what that trend could mean for bigger players.For 2019-'22, Gordon forecasts AstraZeneca achieving a 13% compound annual growth rate in core earnings per share, more than twice the sector at 6%. The market will likely focus on five key product launches in 2018, which could beat consensus views by 8% in aggregate, he said.Among those, he expects sales of lung cancer drug Tagrisso to top expectations by 26% in the U.S. in 2018. His 2022 forecast of $1.9 billion in U.S. sales could be achievable if just half of 15,000 patients with a specific mutation receive the therapy as a first treatment.""Based on much higher penetrations of comparable therapies, and with no competitors on the horizon, we think even our own forecast could prove conservative,"" he said.Outside the U.S, he assumes 50% price cuts in Europe and Japan for patients who receive the drug as a first treatment. In China, he expects 20% of eligible patients to receive Tagrisso and assumes a similar price cut.Gordon expects sales of immuno-oncology drug Imfinzi to be in line and sees Lynparza, which treats ovarian cancer, to post a small beat in 2018-'19. But he sees downside in the long-term for both drugs.AstraZeneca is also launching Calquence as a treatment for mantle cell lymphoma but with only 2,000 patients in the U.S. he sees near-term downside. AstraZeneca is also looking at the drug in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which affects a larger group of patients.Fasenra was also recently approved as a bi-monthly treatment for a form of asthma. But the drug rivals GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) Nucala, which is administered monthly. In 2019, it's likely Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (REGN) and Sanofi's (SNY) Dupixent will get approval to treat asthma.For Novo Nordisk, 2018 will be a story of oral semaglutide, Vosser said. Oral semaglutide is being investigated in Phase 3 trials dubbed Pioneer as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. Oral semaglutide belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 receptor agonists.Currently, GLP-1 drugs are only available as injections. Novo Nordisk looks to be the first to market with an oral GLP-1. Oramed Pharmaceuticals (ORMP) is also working on an oral GLP-1 drug, but it's far behind Novo Nordisk.""Given we see the oral semaglutide data living up to expectations, we don't see the Pioneer program being a source of disappointment to investors in 2018 and see the market leaving the more difficult commercial questions around the product until after the clinical profile is nailed down by the clinical trial results,"" Vosser said in a note to clients.Novo Nordisk is testing oral semaglutide vs. its own Victoza, Dow stock Merck's (MRK) Januvia and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Jardiance in a series of trials.RELATED:Why Clovis' Good News In Ovarian Cancer Prodded These Rivals DownTesaro Takes A Swipe At AstraZeneca's Ovarian Cancer Drug SalesWhy Tesaro's $2 Million Cancer-Drug Miss Prompted Its Rivals To Topple

38,REGN,"Imagine editing one gene and curing a debilitating disease. Three small biotech companies with combined annual sales of less than $50 million — Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP), Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA) and Editas Medicine (EDIT) — say that soon could be a reality.X All three biotech stocks went public in 2016 to bet big on a simple premise: Altering specific genes can create curative medicines. An estimated 5,000 diseases could be cured by changing one targeted gene, says former Intellia Chief Executive Nessan Bermingham.The World Health Organization has a higher estimate for what are known as monogenic diseases and says it's actually north of 10,000.""People have been talking about (personalized medicine) for 20 years and yet we've never had a system to allow us to do it before,"" Bermingham told Investor's Business Daily before stepping down from his role on Dec. 31. ""And for the first time ever, we actually have a system to do it and that system would be based on your personalized genome.""That system is known as CRISPR, and it's where Crispr, Intellia and Editas are putting their chips. It's a cheaper and faster gene editing method and, according to Bermingham, the key to advancing personalized medicine. Some analysts think CRISPR technology could provide the platform for the next generation of giant biotech companies.CRISPR the technology — not to be confused with Crispr Therapeutics, the company — builds on a project that sequenced the human genome. The first map cost $2.7 billion and was completed in 2003.Since then, the cost to map an individual's genome has dropped precipitously and could come down to just hundreds of dollars in the next few years, Bermingham says. Large-data analytics also have a part to play in sifting through the genome.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech companies account for a large share of recent IPO stocks, yet investing in them before they have profits or sales can be risky. Learn to identify the best IPOs and how to trade them for potential big gains.  When the first human genome was mapped, investigators were ""absolutely horrified"" to find just 20,000 genes in the human body that code proteins, Bermingham says. That was down from estimates of 100,000. Essentially, these protein-coding genes serve as words in the genetic language.Investigators also found regions of DNA that were initially thought to have no purpose. These were controversially called ""junk DNA"" that does not code protein. But, as it turns out, these sequences do have a key purpose in regulating the expression of genes.All together, the better understanding of the human genome has allowed these biotech companies to utilize CRISPR, an acronym for the technology known as Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats.There is a caveat, however. In January, a paper published by bioRxiv said there may be evidence that human immune systems may fight off the major form of genome editing that uses an enzyme called Cas9, thus rendering the science ineffective. The paper, however, has yet to be peer reviewed.The process, developed at various universities, essentially uses specialized strands of DNA that act as molecular ""scissors."" Those scissors are capable of editing other DNA at specific points, and allow biotech companies to edit, add or remove faulty genes responsible for diseases.There are varying types of scissors. Crispr, Intellia and Editas are using the Cas9 CRISPR technology, ARK Invest analyst Manisha Samy told IBD. She estimates Cas9 can reach 70%-80% of the human genome. Developing new scissors can expand the reach into more genes and diseases, she says.Gene editing isn't new, she adds. Older techniques called TALENs and zinc finger nucleases have been around for some time. Notably, biotech company Bluebird Bio (BLUE) is using a variation of TALENs, and Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO) is using a method of zinc finger nucleases.She likens CRISPR technology to a word processor.""We think CRISPR gene editing is analogous to a DNA word processor with two functions: find and delete,"" she said in a January 2017 report. ""In addition, scientists are working on a rudimentary paste function, allowing CRISPR to insert appropriate DNA code to repair mutations.""Older technologies used by biotech companies are more like old-fashioned typewriters, requiring actual cutting and pasting, she says. CRISPR technology is also cheaper and easier to use than TALENs and zinc fingers, says JMP Securities analyst Mike King.""What's so powerful about CRISPR is it's so easy to use,"" he told IBD. ""High school students are doing experiments in the biology lab to knock out genes. Zinc fingers takes a lot of talent and time. You have to fiddle with them a lot. The systems created under CRISPR are quite robust.""In January, bioRxiv — an online archive and distribution service for unpublished reports in the life sciences field — published a paper casting doubt on the durability of CRISPR gene therapy over time, suggesting the body could build an immunity to it. Analysts and biotech companies are not worried, however, saying either this is a nonissue or there's time for the science to catch up.Many companies working in CRISPR are doing so using the Cas9 enzyme, short for CRISPR associated protein 9. Cas9 is derived from two bacteria that cause infections in humans at high rates, meaning some immune systems could have developed immunities to them.Would CRISPR gene editing, using that enzyme, work in those patients?It depends, Crispr Therapeutics said in a follow-up email to IBD. It's important to note the lead investigator and writer on the bioRxiv paper was Matthew Porteus, a scientific founder and advisory board member for Crispr Therapeutics.When the gene editing is done ex vivo, or outside the body, the Cas9 enzyme is degraded and, therefore, essentially gone by the time the cells are reintroduced to the patient, Crispr told IBD.For in vivo applications, when gene editing is done inside the body, Crispr Therapeutics says it uses several approaches to ensure transient expression of the Cas9 enzyme. Because of that, ""we do not expect pre-existing immunity to Cas9 to cause any issues,"" the firm said.Ark's Samy also noted that other enzymes are in use. Editas is also using the Cpf1 enzyme. This enzyme is derived from other bacteria and could overcome some of the immunity challenges involving Cas9.Intellia told IBD in a follow-up email that in clinical testing, its delivery system for treatment in rodents and non-human primates has yet to falter. Further, Intellia notes it's using an advanced form of Cas9 and none of the donors had a pre-existing immunity in its study.The data are still early. Editas has done its own work in immune responses to CRISPR genome editing and will present a paper in the future, JMP's King said in a Jan. 8 note to clients. Management has indicated it found immune responses to be ""much lower"" than those reported in the other paper.""Immune responses are not uncommon,"" Samy said. ""Scientists have worked for decades on evading immune recognition. There are numerous workarounds that can be implemented to reduce any potential side effects with Cas9 and we have proved this in a number of other therapeutic modalities.""Among the biotech companies, Crispr Therapeutics is ahead of the competition from a regulatory standpoint. On Dec. 7, the firm submitted its first application for a clinical trial testing its gene therapy, known as CTX001, in a blood disorder known as beta thalassemia.The company is working with Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) in beta thalassemia, as well as sickle cell disease. The therapies are part of Crispr's ex vivo programs, where gene editing is done on cells outside the body before they are reintroduced to the patient. Crispr is also looking at in vivo therapies for the liver, muscles and lungs.According to a Crispr news release, the trial is set to begin in Europe in 2018 in adult patients. This is expected to be the first in-human trial of a gene editing treatment based on CRISPR technology. Crispr also plans to file an application to begin testing for CTX001 in treating sickle cell disease in the U.S. in 2018.Intellia also has in vivo and ex vivo programs in gene editing, and also is working in sickle cell disease. It's furthest along in a partnership with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) for a therapy to treat what's known as transthyretin amyloidosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of abnormal protein deposits throughout the body.Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) also are working separately to treat the disease using different methods called RNA interference and antisense technology, respectively.Meanwhile, Editas is working on an injected treatment for an inherited eye disease known as Leber congenital amaurosis, which is characterized by severe loss of vision at birth. It is also using gene editing in sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia.Intellia and Editas also are expected to start in-human trials in 2018, analysts say, though Intellia has not said when it will begin testing.Regulators are getting more comfortable with the idea of gene editing, Crispr Therapeutics President Sam Kulkarni told IBD. The benefit of gene editing — and potential trouble with it — is that it's meant to be a permanent fix. The biotech companies are working to ensure they hit a bull's-eye every time out.""We've shown you we can make this edit and it's done in a precise fashion using (targets the industry calls) molecular ZIP codes,"" he said. ""We eliminate edits happening outside places you want them to happen. And we manufacture these in a high-quality fashion, understanding the pharmacology.""Both Kulkarni and Intellia's Bermingham — who was succeeded by John Leonard, a former AbbVie (ABBV) executive — say there's room for all three big players in the group.Sizing the market is a challenge, ARK's Samy says. No matter how you slice it, the numbers are big and a lot will depend on which diseases companies target and how they set pricing.If CRISPR is able to address all monogenic diseases diagnosed each year, that's a $75 billion market globally, she says. Addressing all these diseases for people already living with diagnoses would be a $2 trillion market.""One product is not going to cure everything,"" she said. ""Whenever you're seeing volatility between these three main CRISPR companies, it doesn't really make sense because there's room for all of them and more when it comes to CRISPR.""Kulkarni says it's unlikely the market will remain at just three publicly traded biotech companies with CRISPR technology in the long run. The technology is just that remarkable.""Once in a lifetime may be a little bit of a stretch, maybe not,"" he said. ""But it's definitely a once in a generation type of advance in the field. The last time this kind of excitement happened in the biotech field was when antibodies were applied as therapeutic modalities. On the basis of that, technology companies like Genentech (now owned by Roche (RHHBY)) were created.""He added: ""Here we have the basis of a CRISPR platform to create the next big biotech giants.""RELATED:6 Top Biotech Companies In Innovation Earn Recognition In New AwardsWhy Bluebird's Downgrade Sent These Two Rivals SkyrocketingFind The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch NowMeet The 5 Best Brokers Overall For Every Investor Need

39,REGN,"AbbVie (ABBV) could follow in the footsteps of Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG), an analyst suggested Monday after AbbVie guided to an unexpectedly low 9% tax rate in 2018.X ""We expect the narrative for this stock in the coming months to develop into a 'who will it buy?' story, similar to Gilead in 2016 and Celgene more recently,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients.The acquisition narrative follows AbbVie's fourth-quarter earnings. On Friday, the biopharma giant topped quarterly expectations and beat 2018 guidance predictions. It also guided to a 9% tax rate in 2018 and a tax rate around 13% in the near-term.It also follows announcements last week that Celgene would acquire Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Sanofi (SNY) would acquire Biogen (BIIB) spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV). Today, Sanofi also said it will buy Ablynx (ABLX).If AbbVie does seek an acquisition, it will likely be in neuroscience, early-stage immuno-oncology or solid tumor medicine, Porges said. AbbVie could seek deals to build onto or complement its early-stage Alzheimer's disease pipeline ahead of a key readout in 2019.So far, though, AbbVie is playing its cards close to its vest. The firm doesn't seem inclined to make ""large or disruptive"" transactions, Porges said. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan noted the firm is constantly looking at assets but believes it already has a strong pipeline.Further, ""they do not have a burning platform where they need to acquire an asset,"" he said. ""If there isn't a compelling need and the company is dealing with many other things, it probably is not the best time to do mergers and acquisitions.""IBD'S TAKE: Celgene and AbbVie have already reported their fourth-quarter earnings, but a slew of biopharmas are still slated to issue their reports. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at what analysts expect from the biotech and drugs groups.That puts AbbVie in a slightly different boat from Gilead and Celgene. Gilead acquired Kite Pharma in 2017 amid slowing hepatitis C drug sales. Last week, Celgene said it would buy Juno four years before it begins losing exclusivity on cancer drug Revlimid.Divan's comments follow a conversation with AbbVie's management post fourth-quarter earnings. Analysts suggested the lower-than-expected 9% tax rate means AbbVie will have extra cash on hand with which it could engage in mergers and acquisitions. AbbVie says it's looking at earlier-stage and single assets to build out its pipeline.""If they find anything in the 2019 or 2020 timeframe, even before the (neuroscience) readouts, they would not necessarily feel the need to wait,"" Divan said in a note to clients.Divan boosted his price target on AbbVie to 135 from 98 and kept his neutral rating. Porges also upped his price target to 127 from 105, though he downgraded AbbVie to a market perform rating from outperform.""At current valuations, we prefer Celgene to AbbVie among the larger cap names in our coverage,"" he said. ""Growth names such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) continue to offer more upside, in our view, than AbbVie.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, AbbVie dipped a fraction to 122.31.RELATED:Celgene Reverses In Fourth Quarter As Otezla Sales ReboundCould Sanofi's Ablynx Deal Spur A Biopharma Buying Spree?Will Biotech's Merger 'Spigot' Turn On After Juno, Bioverativ?

40,REGN,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are likely to beat fourth-quarter earnings estimates, an analyst predicted, but biotech guidance will be cautious despite the windfall of tax reform.X The fourth-quarter earnings reporting season kicks off next week with Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Novartis (NVS) weighing in Tuesday and Wednesday on the pharma side. Celgene (CELG) and Biogen (BIIB) are on deck early Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV) trailing on Friday.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges expects cautious predictions at the beginning of 2018, noting the example of Celgene's pre-announcement earlier this month. Uncertainties in payer dynamics, competition and U.S. drug access are likely to play into forecasts.""All these factors, along with an imminent return to a more challenging political environment, suggest that management teams will be more than typically cautious in the guidance that they first provide to the financial community on their earnings calls,"" he said in a note to clients.For the fourth quarter, Porges calls for Vertex's cystic fibrosis drugs Orkambi and Kalydeco, Gilead's hepatitis C and HIV drugs, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (REGN) Eylea and Dupixent — the latter two eye disease and eczema treatments, respectively — to surprise to the upside.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs suffered in the third quarter as high profile drugs missed expectations and smaller players took headlines by beating views. Head to the Industry Snapshot for more on what happened in the prior quarter and whether history is expected to repeat itself.But he sees older drugs from Amgen (AMGN), including psoriasis and arthritis med Enbrel, as at risk of disappointing investors. Biogen's multiple sclerosis drugs Avonex and Plegridy, and AbbVie's cancer med Imbruvica could also disappoint, he said.Needham analyst Alan Carr sees investors focusing on mergers on the fourth-quarter calls and throughout 2018. This week, rumors emerged that Celgene could be considering a takeover of Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), and Biogen could be considering putting in a bid on Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR).""We continue to believe pharma has a bias towards de-risked assets that are on the market or in some cases still under regulatory review,"" he wrote in a note to clients.In the first half of 2018, he expects the Food and Drug Administration to approve Vertex's cystic fibrosis regimen of Kalydeco and tezacaftor as well as an HIV combination from Gilead. AbbVie and Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) could also get the OK for a drug to treat severe menstrual pain.Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) is also likely to grab approval for patisiran, a drug to treat a condition in which abnormal protein deposits throughout the body can cause systemic problems. Achaogen (AKAO) and Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals (TTPH) are also nearing approvals for two antibiotics.RELATED:Why Celgene's Rumored Acquisition Of Juno Actually Makes SenseDow's Merck Does An About-Face, Releases Cancer Trial ResultsHow Hospitals Plan To Put Pressure On Generic-Drug Makers
"
41,REGN,"Invest in the disruptors.That's the advice from Wall Street, as giant biotech companies and the incumbents of Big Pharma are bracing to get crushed by more innovative — and cheaper — new drugs.X What started in 2017 will continue in 2018, analysts say. Generic drug approvals are rising and interesting new medicines are starting to take market share from the legacy makers of medications that consumers use frequently, including both Big Pharma and biotech companies.Blockbuster drugs representing an estimated $17 billion in annual sales are set to lose patent protection over the next decade, analysts say. Disruption will come as generic drugs and innovative new biologic alternatives come on the market.""It will be brutal,"" JMP Securities analyst Mike King told Investor's Business Daily. ""It will be a knife fight.""In the market for cholesterol-lowering drugs, King expects Amgen (AMGN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) to feel the heat from the likes of Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR), The Medicines Co. (MDCO) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY).Meanwhile, in anti-inflammatory treatments, Celgene's (CELG) Otezla, which gained blockbuster status in 2016, missed sales forecasts by a wide cut in the third quarter. Analysts say newly approved drugs to treat the same conditions from Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novartis (NVS) are taking market share.Gilead Sciences (GILD) is still feeling the pain from the maturing of its hepatitis C drug unit in the U.S. and Europe. The rapid pace of Gilead's hepatitis C sales decline is expected to slow down somewhat, but newer medicines like AbbVie's (ABBV) Mavyret are likely to swipe some of its sales.Big Pharma isn't getting any help from regulators either. Food and Drug Administration head Scott Gottlieb will continue to increase approvals for copycat drugs, stoking competition for both branded and generic drugs facing new rivals as firms try to undercut one another in price.Among the Big Pharma companies, Pfizer (PFE) will be at the forefront feeling the sting of generics taking sales. Earlier this month, Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) was allowed to launch a generic copy of the blockbuster erectile dysfunction drug Viagra.Generic drugs tend to be cheaper than their branded counterparts and Viagra is a pricey drug at about $70 per tablet, according to AccessRX. In 2013, after Pfizer lost exclusivity for Viagra in Canada and Europe, worldwide sales fell 8% to $1.88 billion.Today, generics in Europe have slashed the price of drugs containing the same active ingredient as Viagra by about 90%. Generic versions of Viagra cost about a third of the price in Canada. U.S. Viagra prices could also fall if the trend repeats itself with a generic on the market.Teva, meanwhile, is struggling with $34.7 billion in debt as of the end of the third quarter. On Thursday, Teva announced a plan to cut its workforce by more than a quarter, close several manufacturing facilities and suspend its dividend on ordinary shares.The firm is also planning to review its generic drug portfolio, most specifically in the U.S., to change prices or discontinue products.IBD'S TAKE: See how giant biotechs fared vs. smaller players in the third quarter by visiting the Industry Snapshot. Hint: The quarter was classified as ""alarming"" for one large-cap biotech which could be in trouble as they see more competition for their traditional moneymakers.Across the board, spending on prescription drugs in 2016 increased by just 3.8% per person, according to a report from Express Scripts (ESRX). That's down from a 5.2% rise in 2015, representing a 27% drop in the growth rate.That trend is likely to continue in 2018, FBB Capital Partners analyst Mike Bailey told IBD. He credits Gottlieb for the decline in generic prices. Gottlieb is running the FDA like a business, which allows for a cycle of more approvals, more competition and lower prices.Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could use their tools to influence pricing, it's unlikely President Trump will use his executive powers to enact sweeping drug-pricing reform such as allowing Medicare to negotiate prices or enacting outright pricing controls, Bailey says.""I wouldn't expect any major changes out of the Trump administration in pricing,"" he said. ""I think mechanically and politically it's difficult to get pricing law through the system. It's politically more acceptable to just get more generic drug approvals. It's a win-win.""JMP's King counts drugs that treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis as among those in the ""crowded areas."" In 2016, drugs in this class cost an average $3,588 per prescription and benefited from increases in utilization and unit cost, according to Express Scripts.But in the third quarter of 2017, things began to look dour for the likes of Celgene, which missed expectations for its inflammation drug Otezla by 26%. In the U.S., the lag was even sharper at 28%. One analyst suggested Celgene was forced to take a price concession.Celgene also cut its guidance for 2020 after terminating trials of a drug to treat Crohn's disease, a condition that results from chronic inflammation in the digestive tract. It now sees inflammation and immunology drugs bringing in a combined $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion in 2020, down from the $4 billion outlook it issued in 2015.Biotech companies and Big Pharma will need to ""get realistic"" on their pricing in these competitive arenas, King says. The same could be said for companies making treatments for hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis and high cholesterol. All are highly saturated markets.To the latter point, he expects prices for drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors like Repatha from Amgen and Praluent from Regeneron and Sanofi to be under the microscope. These drugs lower bad LDL cholesterol in the blood. Evidence shows they also have a benefit on some cardiovascular outcomes.Repatha is listed at $14,100 per year, while Praluent costs $14,600. But rivals are closing in. Medicines Co. and Alnylam are working on another cholesterol drug, known as inclisiran. Meanwhile, analysts expect bempedoic acid from Esperion to be cheaper.Some of these Big Pharma and biotech companies ""are probably going to get their arms twisted a lot,"" King said. ""The pricing umbrella has created opportunities for new companies to come in and scale market share. Be careful if you own incumbents. Invest in the disruptors.""Other areas are seemingly immune to pricing pressure, analysts say.In 2016, the price of multiple sclerosis drugs rose an average 7.4%. That's a continuing trend, FBB's Bailey said. The price increases have been so egregious that House Democrats launched an investigation in August, noting that many of these drugs carry price tags north of $85,000 per year.The investigation was launched by Reps. Elijah Cummings and Peter Welch and centers on Bayer (BAYRY), Biogen (BIIB), EMD Sereno, Novartis, Roche (RHHBY), Sanofi and Teva.Among those pharmaceutical and biotech companies, Teva's 20-milligram dose of Copaxone has increased the most, rising 1,002% since its approval in 1996 to an annual price of $91,401 today, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Novartis' Gilenya, approved in 2010, is the highest priced at $91,836.The investigation is ""10 years too late,"" he said. ""It's more difficult to push price control for specialty markets. Multiple sclerosis is a massive market now, but stakeholders view it as a specialty market.""Rare disease and innovative cancer therapies also seem immune to pricing controls, analysts say. For example, earlier this year Novartis and Gilead — via its acquisition of Kite Pharma — gained approval for CAR-T drugs known as Kymriah and Yescarta, respectively.CAR-T drugs are developed using a patient's own immune system cells. They are trained to seek out and destroy cancer cells. Kymriah goes for $475,000 per year and Yescarta is listed at $373,000, ARK Invest analyst Manisha Samy wrote in a recent post.""While gene therapies are beginning to cure cancer, they come at a price that can cause sticker stock,"" she said. ""That said, compared to traditional therapies that suppress, but do not cure cancer, the cost benefit analysis of gene therapy is compelling.""Pricing shock tends to tamp down on excitement for really compelling drugs, Bailey says. The prime example is Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals' (IONS) Spinraza, the first spinal muscular atrophy drug approved. It costs $750,000 in its first year and $375,000 in subsequent years.But sentiment for the biotech companies' shares is already down, he said. So drug pricing concerns shouldn't be a big stock killer in 2018.""In the past when biotech stocks go up quickly, they get new drugs and people are excited, a lot of times someone will throw in a grenade: 'What about drug pricing?'"" Bailey said. ""But sentiment is already down. Even if there's a concern about drug pricing, I see a little less downside.""IBD's 462-company Biotech industry group is now ranked No. 34 out of 197 groups tracked, and has fallen from first just two months ago. Shares collectively neared a two-year high in October, but have since shucked almost 7% from that point.Over that same time, Amgen and Celgene — among the biggest biotechs — have seen their share prices dive 9% and 26%, respectively. Regeneron has taken a 19% hit and Gilead has tumbled 14%.Meanwhile, Alnylam and Esperion, which look likely to rival PSCK9 inhibitor drugmakers like Amgen and Regeneron, have lifted 7% and 5%, respectively. AbbVie, which recently launched a rival to Gilead's hepatitis C franchise, is up 5%.But Novartis and Lilly, which are competing against Celgene to treat inflammatory conditions, have seen their shares retreat, though to a smaller degree. Respectively, their share prices are down 1% and 2%, matching a 1% dip in IBD's 42-company Ethical Drugs industry group.Generic drug stocks, ranked No. 105 out of 197 groups, have actually broadly risen 2% since mid-October. But that's against respective 8% and 5% dips for Teva and Mylan (MYL), its two biggest names.RELATED:Teva's Restructuring Plan: Another Case Of Been Here, Done That?Generic Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don'tTop 6 Biotech Companies In Innovation Earn Recognition In New Awards

Small caps got slammed as iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) tumbled 1.1%.Apple cleared a 176.34 flat-base entry on Friday, though in below-average volume. While the iPhone maker is still above the buy point, its relative strength has lagged and remains near its consolidation lows. Microsoft's RS line has been flat despite its recent advance to record highs.Among sector funds, real estate and healthcare and semiconductor led the upside in the stock market today. Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) rose 0.6% to a record high. Component stock Merck, which led the Dow industrials, popped 6% to retake its 200-day moving average. That marked its best level in nearly three months. The drugmaker's relative strength line is turning up but its RS Rating is a weak 16. Results showed a cocktail of Merck's Keytruda and two chemotherapy drugs stopped lung cancer from advancing and extended patients' lives.IShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB), which is featured later in this column, reversed lower as it builds the right side of a shallow cup-with-handle with a 111.47 buy point.Energy, retail and home construction lagged. West Texas intermediate crude prices slipped 0.6% to $63.89 a barrel.But SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares (IAU) held small gains, after rising to a four-month high on Friday. Gold futures edged 0.3% higher to $1,338.20 an ounce.Bitcoin extended its drop to 15%, to $11,523.95.56, according to CoinDesk, down from an earlier high of $13,601.43. Bitcoin, Ripple and Ethereum were all getting hit amid continued talk from South Korea about a potential cryptocurrency ban.Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) was down 10% after finding support at its 50-day line. It's 49% off its Dec. 19 intraday peak.Large-cap growth funds holding Apple and Microsoft are off to a solid start this year as they continue to stay ahead of the broader market.The top performer, based on its one-year return of 40.7% through Jan. 9, is iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor (MTUM). The $6.1 billion fund's 4.2% year-to-date gain puts it in third place based on that measure. The S&P 500 was up 3% as of Jan. 9, according to Morningstar Direct.MTUM's top five holdings, which made up 23% of assets, were JPMorgan (JPM), Microsoft, Apple, Bank of America (BAC) and Boeing (BA). Apple, which soared 46% last year, broke out past a 176.34 flat-base entry on Friday. It first cleared the buy point Dec. 18 ahead of a pullback to the 50-day moving average.Microsoft advanced 2% Friday on a price target upgrade from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Shares are at a record  high.PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ), which tracks the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 index, scored a one-year and YTD return of 34.1% and 4.4%, respectively. The 18-year-old fund, which counts Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet as its top five holdings, has amassed nearly $70 billion in assets.Third place went to iShares Russell 2000 Top 200 Growth (IWY), which has gathered $975.2 million in assets since its September 2009 launch. While IWY held the same top five names as QQQ, it was less top-heavy. The top five accounted for 28% of IWY's total assets vs. 39% for QQQ.All three ETFs have low expense ratios: 0.15% for MTUM, 0.20% for QQQ and IWY. They also earn five-star ratings from Morningstar, which indicates how well a fund's returns have compensated investors for the amount of risk it incurs. The ratings range from one to five stars with the best performers, based on risk-adjusted return relative to similar funds, receiving five stars.The three funds are trading at all-time highs and are extended from ideal buy points. In fact, the other ETFs in the accompanying table are also at record highs — not too surprising given we're now in the ninth year of a bull market.IBD'S TAKE: Making money catching ETF uptrends requires knowledge about how to read charts.

Shares advanced 13% from a June breakout from another shallow base to their Oct. 6 intraday high.The $10.3 billion fund, which tracks the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index, will mark its 17th anniversary next month. Biotech represented the biggest sector weight at 82% of assets, pharmaceuticals 11%, life sciences tools and services 6%, with smaller health care-related positions making up the rest.Its top five holdings as of Jan. 11 were Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN). The top five stocks accounted for nearly 37% of total assets. Most have outperformed the broader market so far this year: Gilead, Amgen and Biogen have gained 10%, 6% and 5%, respectively vs. the S&P 500's 4% return.IBB's one-year return of 20.4% slightly lags the S&P 500's 24.1% gain. The ETF's average annual return over the past three years lags the benchmark index but leads the S&P 500 during the past five, 10 and 15 years. IBB carries a 0.47% expense ratio.Friday's pick, PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV), remains in a buy zone from a Jan. 3 rebound off the 50-day line.RELATED:Apple, Microsoft Fuel Dow To Record; Will Bitcoin Rebound Last?Apple Rises While Bitcoin Dives; Time To Buy Nvidia, AI Stocks?China Hits Stocks; Buffett Vs.

43,REGN,"Amgen (AMGN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) will battle in 2018 after the latter unveils cardiovascular data for its cholesterol drug Praluent, an analyst said Monday after Amgen won approval for its rival drug to treat a broader set of ailments.X On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration approved for Amgen's drug Repatha to reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke and bypass procedures in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease.The approval is based on data from a trial called Fourier which showed a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular outcomes, but didn't demonstrate an impact on death. Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young says the bar for mortality is high.Next year, Regeneron and partner Sanofi (SNY) are set to unveil cardiovascular outcome data from a trial called Odyssey for Praluent. Young doesn't expect the trial to show Praluent reducing the risk of mortality as more follow-up will likely be needed.But the trial could set off a deeper rivalry between Amgen and Regeneron/Sanofi, she said in a note to clients. Both drugs belong to a class known as PCSK9 inhibitors, which work to lower bad LDL cholesterol.IBD'S TAKE: How did biotechs fare in the third quarter? Hint: Large-caps felt some pain. See why by visiting the Industry Snapshot.If Praluent shows a mortality benefit, it will put Amgen at a commercial disadvantage. But if Praluent fails to show a benefit in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events, she expects Amgen to get the majority of Praluent's 35% market share.""Although we do not think differing (effectiveness) between the two drugs would be a major surprise, we think that Amgen could manage since they have the benefit of a successful study on the label at this point,"" she said.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Amgen lifted 0.8% to close at 178.69. Shares of Regeneron rose 1.3% to finish at 378.37.

The conventional entry was 218.77. The weekly chart shows a lagging relative strength line, however, calling the quality of the breakout into question.Monday's move was fueled by news the company is teaming up with Volkswagen (VLKAY) and Uber on driverless car technology.Meanwhile, the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference kicked off in San Francisco on Monday. Headline flow was busy, but it wasn't a good day for iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB), which was down nearly 2% to 107.91.Biotechs were some of the worst performers in the Nasdaq 100, with names like Alexion (ALXN), Regeneron (REGN), Biogen (BIIB) and Shire (SHPG) showing losses ranging from 2.5% to 5%.Shares of Celgene (CELG) gave back nearly 2% on news it's planning to acquire San Diego-based Impact Biomedicines for up to $7 billion if certain milestones are hit. Impact is working on an experimental drug for a type of blood cancer called myelofibrosis.Among the bright spots, shares of Insulet (PODD) gapped out of a flat base, jumping 12% to 76.83.

45,REGN,"Beleaguered biotech investors likely will have to wait until 2018 to get some relief, though trial data and drug approvals could help stoke the embers of the formerly red-hot group.X That's the take from analysts, who say there may be some relief on the horizon. But don't expect anything earth shattering, they say.""The next quarter and a half is likely to feature significant disclosures for a number of companies in our coverage, but is unlikely to be a period of strongly stock-moving events,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a recent note to clients.Porges' view follows a third quarter in which large caps struggled as their historic moneymakers caught the double whammy of increasing competition and pricing concerns. Meanwhile, smaller caps crushed expectations.As a result, IBD's 462-company Biotech industry group, ranked first just a month ago, is now listed as No. 37 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks. Shares touched a 22-month high in October, but have since lost nearly 6%.""However, the flow of events is set to accelerate in early 2018, and the first quarter offers more opportunities for meaningful value inflection across biopharmaceutical companies and stocks,"" Leerink analysts wrote in a recent note.Despite frustration depressing biotech stocks, the group has posted an impressive number of new approvals this year, JMP Securities analyst Mike King said. According to the Food and Drug Administration, 140 original applications for drugs and biologics have been approved this year.""You need product approvals,"" he told Investor's Business Daily. ""Even the most jaded observer of the sector would have to say the sector as a whole has produced very satisfactory results when it comes to major trial readouts. I don't see any change in that regard.""Tacking on drug approvals and successful data readouts will be key for companies like Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), a pair of large biotech leaders facing a growing field of competitors for their moneymakers Revlimid and hepatitis C drugs, respectively.Celgene is set to have two readouts in a type of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and could have CAR-T developments from partners Bluebird Bio (BLUE) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO). CAR-T drugs treat cancer using a patient's own re-engineered immune cells.Both are important for Celgene, which has long enjoyed revenue gains from chemotherapy Revlimid. Analysts had been expecting generic competition from Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) in 2020. Recently, though, Dr. Reddy's missed a key deadline to file its generic.Still, it's less than ideal for Celgene to rely so heavily on one stream of revenue, FBB Partners analyst Mike Bailey said. Celgene had been preparing to replace some of its patent-challenged Revlimid sales with a Crohn's disease drug. But the firm said in October it won't initiate Phase 3 trials of that drug.""The bull case on Celgene previously was that they had these new drugs to limit the risk for Revlimid,"" he told IBD. ""If you take away the risk management piece, all of the focus is on this one drug which is going to go generic at some point.""Similarly, Gilead has an HIV combination using its drug bictegravir set to gain potential approval in February. This could accelerate HIV sales starting in the second quarter, Porges said. At the same time, ARK Invest analyst Manisha Samy says Gilead will likely get further into CAR-T in 2018. Gilead also announced Thursday its $567 million acquisition of Cell Design Labs, a privately held CAR-T player.In October, Gilead acquired Kite Pharma for nearly $12 billion. This followed the FDA's approval of Kite's drug, dubbed Yescarta, to treat large B-cell lymphoma in adults. Due to their individualized nature, CAR-T drugs aren't likely to rake in the same sales as Gilead's now faltering hepatitis C drugs.""But two or three years down the line, that could be a huge revenue maker,"" she told IBD.IBD'S TAKE: Big-caps struggled in the third quarter which isn't surprising considering a patent cliff over the next 10 years is set to hit some $17 billion in annual sales for blockbuster drugs, says one analyst. Head to the Industry Snapshot for more on how biotechs fared in the period.Yescarta won't replace Gilead's hepatitis C franchise at its peak, but it will grow steadily, Bailey said.""My guess is hepatitis C is going to shrink really quickly,"" he said. ""At some point I would expect CAR-T to replace hepatitis C sales, but no way at the peak. That was once-ever in terms of what Gilead did. It will never be that big.""In the next several months, Leerink's Porges looks for AbbVie (ABBV) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) to disclose pivotal trial or regulatory events, while Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) will report more ""value-confirming events.""AbbVie will have data for an anti-inflammatory treatment known as upadacitinib, he said. Those results could add more detail to the evolving landscape of what are known as JAK inhibitors that treat psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, among a number of conditions.Regeneron is on deck to file the results of its drug Dupixent in asthma. The drug is already approved to treat eczema. The firm could also report data for its eye drug, Eylea, and for its immuno-oncology drug, cemiplimab, in a type of skin cancer.Also, look for Vertex to provide Phase 2 data for two of its triple-pill combinations to treat cystic fibrosis. In total, Vertex is testing four potential regimens to bring into Phase 3 trials. The firm is also likely to gain approval for a two-drug combination in February.In the Big Pharma world, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez says there are few significant stock-moving catalysts left in 2017, but the first half of 2018 will be busy.Dow's Merck (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and AstraZeneca (AZN) all have immuno-oncology combo results in lung cancer, while Bristol and Merck/Incyte (INCY) are set to deliver results from their regimens in melanoma.Bristol could also offer interim data from a trial of its immuno-oncology drugs Opdivo and Yervoy as a first treatment for lung cancer.Outside those, ""major immuno-oncology catalysts should (thankfully!) be limited,"" he said. There's a high bar on Bristol's interim data, which require nothing short of stopping the study early on extreme effectiveness. That's unlikely, so expectations are probably low, he said.""Nonetheless, an early stop would be a major validation of Bristol's strategy — likely driving the stock up 15% in our view,"" he said. ""Continuation of the study would likely increase concerns over Bristol's strategy and the ultimate success of the study at the final analysis, possibly pushing the stock down 5%-10%.""PARP inhibitors, yet another class of cancer drugs, are set to have trial results as well. AstraZeneca will have results for its drug, Lynparza, as a first maintenance treatment in ovarian cancer.""I think the PARP space will be quite large,"" JMP's King said. ""It's hard to tell in the real world if doctors will see these drugs as better so they can start producing some satisfactory sales figures.""RELATED:Biotechs Sell Off In Droves — Are Investors Seeking Mergers?This Biotech Just Neared A 17-Year High On Strong Cancer RegimenThis Cancer Biotech Is Falling On Its $1.55 Billion Bayer Deal

48,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) dipped to a seven-month low Monday after a combination of its eye medicine Eylea and a drug from Bayer (BAYRY) failed in a pair of Phase 2 studies.X But analysts say the failure wasn't a total surprise. Regeneron's commentary regarding the regimen was bearish on the third-quarter earnings conference call, RBC analyst Kennen MacKay noted in a report to clients.Said Regeneron on the call: ""While we have not seen the data, we have been pretty clear about the high bar that Eylea (used by itself) sets for any potential combination studies."" These studies aren't central to Regeneron's strategy, the firm had said.On Monday, those bearish sentiments came to fruition. A regimen of Eylea and Bayer's angiopoietin2 failed to meet its goal in studies of patients with eye diseases known as diabetic macular edema and wet age-related macular degeneration.The combination was tested vs. Eylea monotherapy. The key goal was to improve upon best-corrected visual acuity between week 12 and week 36 as measured by what's known as the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letter score.IBD'S TAKE: Regeneron began a multiyear run in November 2010 and has enjoyed — as well as lost — long-term support at its 10- and 40-week lines. Visit the Investor's Corner for more on what you can learn by studying Regeneron's chart.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said he didn't include the combination in his model for Regeneron.""However, Regeneron's stock could come under pressure today due to the removal of this upside Eylea scenario and a second clinical failure this year after the discontinuation of suptavumab for respiratory syncytial virus,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Working on a combo treatment was Regeneron's response to increasing competition for Eylea, he said. Roche is working on an angiopoietin2 combination with data expected in 2018, though it has a low probability of success, Porges said.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Regeneron toppled 2.7% to finish at 374.53.RELATED:Regeneron Jumps After Issuing Street-Topping Revenue, Earnings6 Top Biotech Companies In Innovation Earn Recognition In AwardsRegeneron Advances Science To Attack Arthritis, Eye Disease, More

49,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) jumped Wednesday after crushing third-quarter expectations on continued uptake of eczema drug Dupixent and strong sales of eye drug Eylea, though cholesterol drug Praluent lagged.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Regeneron lifted 2.7% to finish at 415.17, after earlier rising as much as 7% to a two-week high. Shares of partner Sanofi (SNY) advanced 0.7% to end the regular trading session at 45.88, as the broad biotech market inched down a fraction.For its third quarter, Regeneron reported adjusted income of $3.99 per share on $1.5 billion in sales, growing a respective 27.5% and 23% vs. the year-ago period. Analysts had anticipated adjusted profit of $3.85 a share on $1.46 billion in sales.Eylea, Regeneron's biggest moneymaker, brought in $953 million in the United States, up 12%, and above consensus expectations which analysts with RBC and Leerink put between $933 million and $935 million.Dupixent, an eczema drug that Regeneron launched with Sanofi, accounted for $89 million in sales. That was 37% ahead of consensus expectations, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients. Sales of the drug are recorded by Sanofi, but the two companies share in profits and losses.IBD'S TAKE: Regeneron came out of a saucer base in May, soared past its buy zone, then faltered in September and now is below its 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages. It's now ranked 29th in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech Group, with Corcept Therapeutics at the top spot.Cholesterol drug Praluent, however, lagged forecasts by 5% with $49 million, Porges said.Regeneron confirmed its guidance for 10% growth of Eylea sales in 2017. The firm cut its guidance for Sanofi reimbursement to $350 million to $375 million, down from $370 million to $400 million previously. Regeneron also lowered its expense and tax guidance of the year.In 2018, Regeneron plans to file an application with the Food and Drug Administration to use Eylea to treat an eye disease called diabetic retinopathy. The biotech also plans to submit an application for Dupixent in asthma before year-end.Upcoming data include a study of Praluent and interim data from a trial of its immuno-oncology drug early next year.RELATED:Chart School: Using Regeneron's Five-Year Rally To Study SupportIBD Biotech Innovator AwardsRegeneron Advances Science To Attack Arthritis, Eye Disease, More

50,REGN,"IBD descriptions of stock charts will often say a stock is finding support, or testing support, or has lost support.XThe concept of support is not one of the first things you need to understand as an investor. But it quickly becomes a helpful asset in assessing the technical strength of a stock, and in identifying critical transitions in a stock's chart status.Support refers to levels in a stock's price that generally appear to trigger buying by institutions or other large investors. This support may occur around a specific price level, or along a moving average price line such as the 50-day or 200-day moving averages.When a stock is said to ""have support,"" powerful shareholders are either building positions or actively interested in seeing that the stock's chart maintains certain levels. In a stock's chart, this means a stock tends to hold above a certain price point, or above a key technical tool such as a 10-week moving average.When the stock dips back to a support level, the price will generally rebound, often with at least a mild increase in volume as one or more large-scale buyers step in to prop the price. This is the action that creates the follow-on buy opportunities called rebounds from support, or rebounds from the 10-week moving average.The study of support and resistance is also often applied to the study of behavior and timing of the overall market level, most notably in analysis-applying methods such as the Elliott Wave Principle or Fibonacci Retracements.A good example of a stock that enjoyed, and then lost, long-term support at its 10- and 40-week lines was Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN). The stock broke out to begin its multiyear run in November 2010.Regeneron lists many hundreds of finds among its shareholders. But it also includes among its major institutional shareholders French drugmaker Sanofi (SNY). Sanofi and Regeneron partnered on key drug development deals, in antibodies and immune-oncology, beginning in 2007. (The companies announced in August that they would end their antibodies partnership this year.)In addition to funding the partnerships, Sanofi invested heavily in Regeneron shares, reportedly holding as much as 22.5% of the company.As the Regeneron-Sanofi partnership developed, and as Regeneron marketed its core drug, the retinal treatment Eylea, outside the U.S. through its partnership with Germany's Bayer (BAYRY), the stock rode 10-week support early in 2011, dipping in two consolidations to find support at its 40-week moving average during the year.Shares trended higher, breaking out of bases in the months of January, August and November in 2012, and with the 10-week line cradling most of the run through 2012 and 2013. Late in 2013 and into 2014, Regeneron once more dipped back to test its 40-week line in two separate consolidations (1). It broke out again and rode support at its 10-week line to late August of 2015.The drugmaker by now had logged two quarters of declining earnings, although revenue growth continued to accelerate. Investors had carefully been monitoring its development pipeline, but all indications were that the company had a rich supply of new opportunities. Still, earnings continued to slip through the end of 2015, before rebounding sharply across 2016.In the third week of August 2015, Regeneron broke below support at its 10-week line in heavy trade (2), sending clear sell signals. Six weeks later, it dove through its 40-week moving average in even heavier volume, signaling investors that institutional supporters were no longer willing or able to prop up the stock in the face of heavy selling. Such action produced a valid double-bottom base. But as the weekly chart shows, Regeneron's breakout past a 557.97 entry point came in relatively low volume compared to the sell-off within the base.The stock eventually rolled over (3), triggering the golden rule of selling (cutting losses at 7% or less). That commenced a two-year consolidation and a battle to regain support at both its 10- and 40-week moving averages.IBD'S TAKE: CAN SLIM trading methodology holds that successful investing in growth stocks requires tracking and acting on the trends of ""smart money,"" institutional investors — the 'I' in the CAN SLIM acronym — such as hedge funds, banks, index funds and insurers, which drive large portions of the market's behavior.

51,REGN,"Shares of Medicines Co. (MDCO) dove to a 21-month low Wednesday after the biotech sold its infectious disease drug unit for $270 million which, at first glance, lagged more bullish views.X Under the terms of the deal, Medicines Co. is selling drugs known as Vabomere, Orbactiv and intravenous Minocin to Melinta Therapeutics (MLNT). The deal is for $215 million in cash and $55 million of Melinta common stock, Medicines Co. said in a news release.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Medicines Co. recovered much of its losses and was down only 4 cents to 30.17 when regular trading ended. But shares were down as much as 8% in earlier trades. Shares of fellow infectious diseases player Achaogen (AKAO), however, toppled 7.5% to close at 10.94. Melinta rose 1.3% to close at 15.20.Buy-side expectations called for Medicines Co. to get $400 million to $450 million for the assets, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a note to clients. But the $270 million price doesn't take into account tiered royalties of 5%-25% on sales of Vabomere, Orbactiv and intravenous Minocin that Melinta will have to pay to Medicines Co.Raffat said the deal also doesn't account for the value of milestones Medicines Co. will no longer have to pay for Vabomere. Medicines Co. acquired Vabomere and intravenous Minocin as part of a takeover of Rempex Therapeutics in December 2013.IBD'S TAKE: Large-cap biotechs struggled in the third quarter as competition mounted for their key moneymakers. Meanwhile, smaller firms smashed expectations. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a closer look at how the third quarter played out.Medicines Co. agreed to pay former Rempex shareholders up to $120 million in commercial milestones. Vabomere was approved in the U.S. in August to treat some urinary tract infections and upcoming submission in Europe would have triggered a $30 million milestone.All together, Raffat estimates the cash, stock, royalties and milestones Medicines Co. won't have to pay generate a net present value of $430 million for the biotech under the terms of the deal. That's in line with expectations, he said.The deal will serve to recalculate the value of infectious diseases drugs, Leerink analyst Paul Matteis said in his note to clients. Medicines Co. acquired Rempex for $474 million in 2013. In 2009, it bought Targanta Therapeutics — and got Orbactiv — for $42 million.Achaogen had already traded lower on anticipation of the upcoming deal, Matteis said. Still, he plans to use the transaction to set a more conservative target for valuing potential mergers and acquisitions in the infectious diseases space.But ""it's a single data-point, and we also believe that Medicines Co.'s high degree of motivation to sell by year-end 2017 was probably a factor in garnering upfront consideration that is below their initial cash outflow and, in our view, also below the intrinsic value of the asset,"" he said.Selling its infectious diseases unit will give Medicines Co. more wherewithal, and cash, to focus on inclisiran, a drug to treat high cholesterol, Matteis said. Previously, the company had looked at selling equity to raise the cash it needed to further develop inclisiran.""The upfront cash should remove near-term overhang of a dilutive capital raise and with the recently announced restructuring of the company should enable Medicines Co. to execute on its inclisiran clinical trials through 2019,"" he said.Inclisiran uses technology developed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY). If approved, it could rival similar drugs from Amgen (AMGN) and a co-brand effort from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY).RELATED:Teva's Restructuring Plan: Another Case Of Been Here, Done That?Dow's Merck Announces $10 Billion Buyback, Increases DividendRegeneron Dips To 7-Month Low After Drug Combo With Bayer Fails

52,REGN,"Its treatment for a common eye disease made Regeneron Pharmaceuticals a star. Now, a new dermatitis medication could bring superstardom to the fast-growing biotechnology company.XOther breakthrough Regeneron (REGN) drugs treat arthritis and cholesterol, and the company is developing promising asthma and cancer treatments.  Those are just some of the reasons that Investor's Business Daily named Regeneron a winner in the inaugural IBD Biotech Innovator Awards.Regeneron's financials back up the optimism. Earnings per share minus various items shot up 39% to $11.32 last year, impressive for a company that posted losses until 2012. Revenue has skyrocketed more than tenfold since 2011, to $4.86 billion last year.""Regeneron has been a fantastically successful company and story,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Edward Tenthoff.Tenthoff began covering the company in 2007, ""when the stock was $14 and change."" Now, he estimates 2017 total revenue of $5.68 billion and EPS of $14.38 a share, rising to $6.43 billion and $16.01 in 2018.How IBD Chose The Biotech Innovator Award Winners: IBD asked equity analysts, ETF and mutual fund managers, and university professors to identify the top biotech companies based on their innovative research. We asked them to focus on companies with pioneering drugs likely to launch in the next several years and reach blockbuster, or near-blockbuster, sales of $1 billion or more a year. The award winners selected by IBD editors are the six most-cited companies. To find profiles of all the award winners and details of their work, go to our full Biotech Innovators special report.)Even in 2007, Regeneron stock was rolling, having traded below 11 as recently as 2006. A meteoric decade-plus found shares peaking above 600 in August 2015. The stock hit a 20-month high of 543 in June but now trades near 445 after taking a hit from potential competition in eczema from AbbVie (ABBV). Tenthoff's price target is 557.Regeneron's ascent began in 2011 with the approval of its drug Eylea, which treats a disease called wet-eye age-related macular degeneration, the major cause of blindness in the elderly.A relationship with French drug giant Sanofi (SNY), a suite of key development tools, and a focus on pure science have enabled Regeneron to grow into a biotech titan.Its future? A family of antibody drugs, some that can be used to treat a number of common diseases and thus address multibillion-dollar markets.All humans have antibodies, proteins that fight disease. Antibody drugs are proteins manufactured to fight specific diseases.Science is at the heart of Regeneron's corporate culture and success, according to analysts and company executives.""They've taken on the mantle of the purest scientific company in the industry,"" said Geoffrey Porges, an analyst with Leerink Partners. ""They pride themselves on the rigor of their scientific enquiry.""He rates the stock outperform, or buy, with a price target of 511.Porges says Regeneron's commitment to its research and development is ""virtually unique in the industry.""In 2016, Regeneron spent $2.052 billion on R&D, 42% of its total revenue. That's well above the norm. The 10 largest pharma companies averaged 17% of revenue for R&D last year, according to an April report by the online newsletter Fierce Biotech.Tarrytown, N.Y.-based Regeneron has had help funding R&D thanks to relationships with other companies, including a 10-year relationship with Sanofi.Regeneron and Sanofi have agreements for the ongoing development of immunotherapy cancer drugs. But their agreement for antibody drug development and licensing will terminate at the end of 2017. Under that pact, Regeneron got R&D funding and Sanofi certain licensing rights. The end of that pact poses no problems, say analysts and a Regeneron executive.Regeneron has become ""so big that they really don't need Sanofi,"" analyst Tenthoff said. ""They can make the discoveries on their own and commercialize them.""True, says Regeneron.""We have become a very self-sufficient end-to-end R&D house,"" David Weinreich, Regeneron's senior vice president of global clinical development, told IBD. ""We are self-reliant on our own income stream such that we don't need the Sanofi contribution to research.""He says the termination of this Sanofi pact will enable Regeneron to set up ""more partnerships"" where it makes sense.Weinreich cites the company's development platform, built internally, as key to enabling it to rapidly identify therapies.Two of Regeneron's key drug-development tools are VelociGene and VelocImmune. The first aims for rapid, automated manipulation of mouse DNA to speed up the modeling of human disease. The other aims to help identify a multitude of optimized antibody drug candidates efficiently and directly from immunized mice.""This technology allows us to very quickly screen through lots of antibodies and find ones that have the characteristics we want,"" said Weinreich.""We're not a huge company in terms of overall size,"" he said. ""But these technologies allow us to go after a large number of targets simultaneously. And that's how you wind up with 16 drugs in the development portfolio.""Regeneron's science focus helps it attract top talent, he says.""We live our motto that the science comes first. … There are not many places out there like us,"" said Weinreich. ""Our scientists can take novel study approaches.""IBD'S TAKE: Industry Snapshot gives an in-depth look at some of the most popular industries, including this recent look at a rise in medtech and decline in pharma.Regeneron grants every employee stock options, he says, so all employees can share in the company's success.Regeneron takes on some of the biggest drugmakers, including Roche Holding (RHHBY), Novartis (NVS) and Amgen (AMGN).In August, the company reported a 21% jump in Q2 revenue, to a record $1.47 billion. Earnings per share minus items rose 48% to $4.17. Analysts polled by Zachs called for $3.18.For Q3, analysts polled by Zachs are calling for EPS of $3.79, up 21% from the year-earlier quarter.Eylea continues to drive financials, and its Q2 sales beat Wall Street views. Tenthoff says U.S. sales could end the year up 10%, at $3.65 billion. He sees Eylea's U.S. sales rising 5.5% in 2018, to $3.85 billion.Eylea is sold by both Regeneron and its partner on the drug, German drug giant Bayer (BAYRY). Regeneron has exclusive rights to U.S. sales of Eylea. Bayer has exclusive marketing rights outside the U.S. The companies share equally in the profits from sales of Eylea, except in Japan where Regeneron receives a royalty on net sales.But while Eylea is the present, many industry observers say Dupixent is the future. It is being sold to treat atopic dermatitis in the U.S., after gaining FDA approval in March.Now, Regeneron seeks EU approval for this treatment — but its hopes for the drug go much further.""(Dupixent) has potential in a number of other diseases,"" said Weinreich. It could be used to treat asthma, nasal polyps, multiple allergies (including peanut allergies), esophageal inflammation and more.""This drug could very well be a pipeline unto itself,"" Weinreich said.Regeneron is conducting Phase 3 trials of Dupixent to treat asthma and could seek FDA approval next year.""Dupixent could be as big as, if not bigger, than Eylea,"" said analyst Tenthoff, who rates Regeneron stock overweight, or buy.Just as a treatment for asthma alone, annual global sales ""could be $5 billion,"" he said.If Dupixent does well in the asthma study, it could be ""one of the most notable new drugs"" this year, Amy Brown, of research firm Evaluate Pharma, wrote in an August report.Others, though, temper their enthusiasm.""Dupixent is a big drug … but people have come to overvalue it,"" said Brian Skorney, an analyst at Baird Equity Research. Skorney downgraded Regeneron to underperform from neutral in August.Regeneron has other potential drug hits. This year, the FDA approved its drug Kevzara for treating rheumatoid arthritis. RA affects 1.3 million Americans, according to the Arthritis Foundation and American College of Rheumatology.Another Regeneron drug, Praulent, is used to treat high levels of bad cholesterol. But Amgen has sued, saying the drug violates patents for Amgen's competing drug, Repatha. For a time, an injunction prevented Regeneron from selling Praulent. But the injunction was stayed. A ruling on the lawsuit could come soon.Skorney says that ""if Praulent were pulled from market, that would still be a surprise to Wall Street.""Tenthoff is not worried, saying the lawsuit's risks are already baked into Regeneron's stock price.RELATED:Get The Details On All 6 Award-Winning Biotech Innovators And Their WorkReasons Behind A Recent Biotech Stock RallyRegeneron Pharmaceuticals Eczema Drug Rival Shows Promise

53,REGN,"Cure is a strong word when it comes to treating cancer and other deadly diseases, but Brad Loncar is among the biotech stock analysts and investors ready to employ the term.X""For the first time, biotech companies are not thinking about these technologies incrementally,"" said Loncar, portfolio manager of a biotech-focused ETF. ""They're not thinking about alleviating the symptoms of the disease, they're thinking about fixing the genetic mutations that cause the disease.""Loncar was speaking of cancer, but those comments could apply to other terrible diseases that claim thousands of lives, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Lou Gehrig's disease, multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy.Thirty-five years after the first FDA-approved biotech drug, the biotech industry is rolling out innovations at a breakneck pace. The new-drug pipeline is bursting with treatments in clinical trials, the industry is growing by leaps and bounds, and many biotech stocks are scoring superior returns for investors.To recognize the biotechnology industry's contributions to science and to patients' health, Investor's Business Daily has created the IBD Biotech Innovator Awards. In this inaugural edition, we name six award-winning U.S. biotech companies, chosen for their groundbreaking treatments recently introduced to the market or well along in the new-product pipeline.The six companies are Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Kite Pharma, Incyte (INCY) and Loxo Oncology (LOXO). The winners aren't ranked in any way; only companies with U.S.-traded shares were considered.All but Biogen have their sights firmly on curing cancer, among other intractable diseases. Biogen is targeting the likes of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and MS.How IBD Chose The Biotech Innovator Award Winners: IBD asked equity analysts, ETF and mutual fund managers and university professors to identify the top biotech companies based on their innovative research. We asked them to focus on companies with pioneering drugs likely to launch in the next several years and reach blockbuster, or near-blockbuster, sales of $1 billion or more a year. The award winners selected by IBD editors are the six most-cited companies. To find profiles of all the award winners and details of their work, go to our full Biotech Innovators special report.)The six companies are just a few of the players in a huge field closely tracked by investors. IBD counts 453 publicly traded companies in its biotech industry group, which doesn't include the many other companies with biotech operations that aren't their main focus. The 453 have a combined market cap of nearly $900 billion and sales for the most recent 12 months of more than $100 billion.Thanks to the biotech industry, the pipeline of new drugs of all kinds has exploded. Clinicaltrials.org counts more than 1,480 drugs filed for Phase 3, or late-stage, trials with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this year, and the FDA has more than 32,000 late-stage studies registered.IBD's biotech industry stock group has climbed 33% this year, shucking off the pains of the politically charged election season in 2016 and concerns that President Trump will work to lower drug prices. The group on Wednesday hit a 22-month high of 3,128 but is down from its all-time high near 3,900 in July 2015. It currently ranks No. 1 of the 197 groups tracked by IBD in terms of performance in the past six months.Boosting the group's performance are Celgene and Loxo, which recently hit new highs. Incyte touched a record high this year, while Biogen touched a 27-month high on Friday and Regeneron this year touched a nearly two-year high.The biotech-focused fund that Brad Loncar heads up is Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR), which tracks 30 biotechs working in immunotherapy. The exchange traded fund is nearing its two-year anniversary and is up 26% this year. His comments to IBD came amid a series of regulatory approvals and acquisitions in cancer treatment, including Gilead Sciences' (GILD) foray into cellular therapy with its August agreement to acquire Kite for nearly $12 billion. (The Kite purchase was completed Oct. 3 and Kite now operates as a wholly owned Gilead unit.)Count Loncar among the bullish. Today, drugs can teach the immune system to identify, fight and precisely target cancerous cells. Technology can turn off or edit genes to correct genetic conditions.Some trial data are ""jaw-dropping,"" he said. One example is CAR-T technology, in which Kite is among the leaders. The field is young, but biotech companies ""are taking patients who have weeks or months to live and, in some cases, are seeing complete remissions,"" Loncar said. ""I've never seen anything like that.""Loncar likens chemotherapy to a bomb — it kills the enemy and everything else in sight. Loxo is using smart bombs. Its precision medicine targets gene fusions in cancer, JMP Securities analyst Mike King explains.In cancer, some genes are called passengers and others drivers, King told IBD. When a driver becomes fused to a normal cell, that normal cell transforms into a cancerous one. Loxo identifies and targets those fusions.At the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in June, Loxo showed the impact of its work with a photo of a sarcoma protruding from a child's chest, King says. By targeting what's called the TRK fusion, Loxo was able to treat the cancer.The tumor ""shrunk away to nothing without surgery or radiation or any other therapy contributing to it,"" he said. ""It was remarkable. It was pretty staggering even for people in the audience who are kind of used to seeing these kind of things.""Among 50 patients, the drug dubbed larotrectinib was able to partly shrink tumors in 64% of them, with all signs of cancer disappearing in 12% of patients. The drug has breakthrough, rare pediatric disease and orphan drug designations with the FDA.Also grabbing headlines is immuno-oncology work from Dow component Merck (MRK) as well as Incyte, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Roche (RHHBY) and AstraZeneca (AZN). Besides Kite, CAR-T therapy is getting its due from the likes of Novartis (NVS), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE).Immuno-oncology and CAR-T are both methods of teaching the immune system to fight cancer. Immuno-oncology drugs do so by blocking specific interactions that would otherwise prevent an immune response. CAR-T drugs individualize that process by reprogramming a patient's own extracted immune cells.IBD'S TAKE: CAR-T drugs are snagging major attention after Gilead announced its plan to acquire Kite and Novartis got a major drug approval, opening up the sector for commercialization. Head to the IBD's Industry Snapshot feature for a closer look at the emerging CAR-T sector.Results have impressed, and immuno-oncology drugmakers are taking it a step further by combining their compounds in the hopes of seeing more robust responses. Merck has had success with its drug Keytruda, which has won approval as a first treatment with chemo in lung cancer.Incyte drug epacadostat is particularly intriguing, analysts say. It prevents some interactions involving the IDO enzyme. Merck and Bristol are pairing their drugs Keytruda and Opdivo — both belong to a class of drugs known as PD-1 inhibitors — with Incyte's epacadostat.Regeneron, too, is working on a PD-1 inhibitor, with its REGN2810. It's developing this in partnership with Sanofi (SNY). In June, Regeneron and Sanofi said 46.2% of patients with a form of skin cancer responded to treatment with REGN2810 in a Phase 1 trial.On the CAR-T side, Novartis gained FDA approval in late August for a drug to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to age 25. Its approval helped spike Gilead, which just two days before had announced its deal to acquire Kite.Kite is nearing approval for a CAR-T drug to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Juno is just behind with its drug called JCAR017, which would treat the same cancer as Kite's drug. Bluebird is working on a multiple myeloma drug.Juno and Bluebird both have partnered with Celgene on their programs. JMP's King calls it a ""best-in-breed"" approach, where Celgene will put its money on the line for potential innovation.Such partnerships are where Celgene excels, Wedbush analyst David Nierengarten told IBD.  ""They've had these innovative deals across sectors, from small molecules to cell therapy,"" he said. ""They're innovative, and they cast the net widely for new technologies and potential therapies.""Others are reaping the benefits of a decades-old project that mapped the human genome. The first human genome map cost $2.7 billion in 1997 dollars and took almost 15 years to complete. Today, it costs closer to $1,000 to map an individual's entire genetic makeup.Gene therapies and editing are having a ""renaissance,"" JMP's King said. Analysts point to Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP), which made its IPO a year ago, as a leader in this field.Crispr is also the name of the technology. Crispr Therapeutics, Audentes Therapeutics (BOLD) and Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA) also are making waves in the sector. The technology makes it much easier to edit genes, Needham analyst Alan Carr told IBD.BTIG analyst Dane Leone sees some of those companies entering the clinic in 2018.""This technology uses an enzyme that is actually from a bacterial organism to target areas of the genome or your DNA, where you want to make changes to the DNA,"" he said. ""What you can do using this enzyme complex is give it direction in terms of target, and insert it into a cell.""In the end, the enzyme complex attaches to DNA, where it can make alterations, he told IBD.JMP analyst King described Crispr technology as having the ability to ""repair broken genes, cut out and replace defective genes and insert functional genes where they're desired.""On the other side of the gene spectrum, RNA interference and antisense are responsible for cutting-edge drugs from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) and Biogen partner Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS). Biogen and Ionis in December won FDA approval for Spinraza, the first drug of its type approved to treat spinal muscular atrophy.Needham's Carr likened RNA interference as a way of ""turning off"" a gene. This has the potential to be more robust than gene therapy, which must alter all or most of the cells in the body to be effective.In September, Alnylam stock spiked 52% in one day after its drug, patisiran, proved effective in treating a rare disease known as hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. The disease results in the buildup of abnormal protein causing systemic problems. Patisiran uses RNA interference. Analysts call the late-stage data from Alnylam a ""big win"" for the concept.Bluebird is working in gene therapy to treat blood disorders.The list of innovations goes on and on in this era of biotech, but today's gains have been decades in the making.""It's usually a steady build and then you have these waves of innovation that kind of collide or emerge at similar points in time,"" JMP's King said. ""It's not like the traditional tech, where things can happen overnight.""RELATED:Get The Details On All 6 Award-Winning Biotech Innovators And Their WorkGilead-Kite Deal Boosts Biotech ETF As It Clears Buy PointHow Novartis' Cancer Approval Validates Gilead's $11.9 Billion Kite DealThe Cure For Cancer?

Roku then rose to a record high Friday. Roku ended the third quarter with 16.7 million active users on its content distribution platform, up 48% year over year. Average revenue per user grew 37% year over year to $12.68. Roku makes hardware and software for accessing internet video services like Netflix (NFLX), Hulu and Amazon (AMZN) Prime Video.Analysts tore into Snapchat-owner Snap (SNAP) after a third-quarter earnings report that missed estimates on many metrics, including revenue and user growth. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel acknowledged complaints that Snapchat is ""hard to use"" and said that the app will be redesigned. Shares crashed 16%, even with Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) buying a 12% stake in the social media firm.RELATED:Snap Slammed On Quarterly Results As Tencent Acquires A StakeThree China internet companies, Sina (SINA), Weibo (WB) and Autohome (ATHM), all reported quarterly results that beat expectations. Sina owns a controlling stake in Weibo.

J.C. Penney (JCP) reported better-than-expected Q3 results after recently slashing full-year guidance.Walt Disney (DIS) disclosed a surprise drop in Q4 profit and revenue amid reports of more upcoming ESPN layoffs, but CEO Bob Iger announced that there would be a brand-new ""Star Wars"" trilogy, gave its ESPN streaming platform a name and launch date, and said its Disney-only over-the-top service would be priced ""substantially below"" Netflix (NFLX), reversing shares higher late Thursday. Meanwhile, reports surfaced that 21st Century Fox (FOXA) had held talks to sell the bulk of itself to Disney. Iger refused to address ""press speculation"" on the call. Disney rose solidly more than 6%. 21st Century Fox, which reported solid results, shot up 15.5%.On Monday, oil prices rose to their highest levels since mid-2015 on political unrest in the Middle East. Crude closed the week with a 2.3% gain to $56.74 a barrel. Saudi Arabia arrested several members of the royal family over the prior week and said that a missile attack from Yemen and supported by Iran could be considered an ""act of war."" U.S. crude production rose to 9.62 million barrels per day, the highest since Energy Information Administration began tracking weekly data in 1983. Domestic crude supplies unexpectedly rose. Continental Resources (CLR), Diamondback Energy (FANG), Matador Resources (MTDR), and Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) topped quarterly forecasts, while Parsley Energy (PE) turned in mixed results as shale producers continued to stress capital spending discipline in their Q3 reports.RELATED:U.S. Crude Production Hits Record High, Stockpiles Unexpectedly RiseVideo game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) reported better-than-expected September-quarter results and guided higher for the holiday sales quarter after Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) recently gave disappointing guidance.

56,REGN,"AnaptysBio (ANAB) launched to a record high Tuesday after its eczema drug appeared to outperform Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (REGN) and Sanofi's (SNY) potential blockbuster, Dupixent, in a Phase 2 trial.XIn early trading on the stock market today, AnaptysBio more than doubled, skyrocketing by 101.2% to close at 70.41. Regeneron lost 1.8% to end the regular trading session at 461.13 while Sanofi dipped 0.6% to finish at 50.10.The drug, dubbed ANB020, was tested in 12 adult patients with moderate-to-severe eczema. First, patients received a placebo within 14 days of enrollment. One week later, patients received a single 300-milligram dose of ANB020.Onset was rapid. At day 15, nine of 12 patients saw their eczema severity and extent lessen by half. Ten out of 12 patients, or 83%, saw the same improvement at day 29. By day 57, nine of 12 patients still had a 50% improvement in eczema symptoms.To compare, in Phase 1 and Phase 2 tests, 59% of patients who received four weekly doses of Regeneron and Sanofi's Dupixent as a monotherapy achieved a 50% improvement in eczema symptoms, RBC analyst Kennen MacKay wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks recently hit a collective 21-month high on news from strong players like Zogenix, Bluebird Bio and Celgene. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at how the group spiked and whether it can maintain its speed.Importantly, the dosing schedule of ANB020 could be ""highly competitive"" with Dupixent's every-other-week injection schedule and the daily oral doses of other drugs known as JAK inhibitors, MacKay said.MacKay assumes AnaptysBio has a 30% chance of success with its eczema drug, up from his earlier view for 15%. He models an upside of 66 per share assuming AnaptysBio is successful, though kept his 40 price target and outperform rating on the stock.RELATED:Why Regeneron's Patent Win Is Worse For Amgen Than You ThinkRegeneron Pops After Judge Tosses Ban On Amgen-Rivaling MedGalapagos Pops After Eczema Drug Shows Promise Vs.

57,REGN,"Biogen (BIIB), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) will build on momentum in the biotech sphere to beat Wall Street expectations for the third quarter, an analyst predicted Friday.X""Large-cap biotech stocks have been strong as we head into the third-quarter reporting period,"" Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young wrote in a note to clients. She is focused on Biogen's Spinraza, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (REGN) Dupixent and Gilead's hepatitis C drugs.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Investor's Business Daily's 453-company Biotech industry group dipped a collective 0.8%. But the group is ranked first out of 197 groups tracked by IBD and hit a 22-month high earlier in the week.That momentum will likely continue into the third quarter for most large-caps, Young said. She calls for Biogen, Gilead, Sarepta and possibly United Therapeutics (UTHR) to beat on the top line.Biogen is set to report its quarterly results early on Oct. 24. Young calls for Spinraza, a spinal muscular atrophy drug developed with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), to beat the consensus view for $250 million. She forecasts $356 million in sales.The Cure SMA website reports that an estimated 2,000 U.S. patients have been dosed with Spinraza as of the third quarter, 450 of whom were in trials or expanded-access programs, Young wrote. That suggests that there were about 1,550 commercial U.S. patients as of the period. She sees 1,400 U.S. patients on Spinraza in the third quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks have trended north over the past several weeks amid a healthy dose of good news for several key players. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at which stocks helped send the group to a 22-month high.""We do think at some point Spinraza could surprise to the downside as patients switch to the much less expensive maintenance dose vs. the loading dose,"" she said. ""However, we think this quarter Spinraza will very much still be in its launch phase.""On the top line, Young models Biogen reporting $3.11 billion in sales and adjusted income of $6.08 per share. Both metrics top the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $3.03 billion and $5.68, respectively.The multiple sclerosis franchise is likely to face more headwinds, though. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. Tecfidera's total prescriptions fell 4% in the third quarter with no price increases. As a result, Young's model for Tecfidera is $35 million below the consensus view.Young forecasts Gilead beating third-quarter expectations on strong sales of drugs to treat hepatitis C and HIV — helping the biotech shuck off quarters of hepatitis C malaise. Still, AbbVie's (ABBV) new hepatitis C regimen could have an impact. Gilead is set to report late on Oct. 26.AbbVie's Mavyret gained approved in August to treat all genotypes of hepatitis C patients. It's typically dosed over eight weeks — a shorter duration than rival drugs — and is priced at roughly half the price of its competitors, on a wholesale basis.For that reason, Young dropped her 2018 forecast for Gilead's hepatitis C drug sales to $6.4 billion from $7.8 billion to factor in risk from AbbVie. But she remains bullish on the third quarter, where she models $6.57 billion in total sales, above consensus views for $6.37 billion.Her forecast is driven by consensus-topping views for $1.18 billion in sales of Harvoni and $1.12 billion in sales of Epclusa. But HIV estimates are largely in line with consensus views. She models a miss on HIV drug Truvada, with an estimate that's $125 million below the consensus due to the entry of generics outside the U.S.On the bottom line, Young calls for adjusted profit of $2.26 per share vs. the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks for $2.07.Young calls for Regeneron and Sarepta to narrowly beat Wall Street forecasts, benefiting from eczema drug Dupixent and Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug Exondys 51, respectively.Regeneron, which is set to report its earnings early on Nov. 8, could deliver a slight beat vs. the consensus for its Sanofi (SNY)-partnered eczema drug. Young models $86 million in sales of Dupixent, down from her earlier view for $111 million, but above the Street's $73 million.Dupixent's weekly total prescriptions are up an average 153% in the third quarter vs. the prior period. Dupixent ended the third quarter with 2,398 outstanding total prescriptions, Young wrote. She forecasts 155% quarter-over-quarter growth for the drug.But her third-quarter model for Eylea, approved to treat a number of eye conditions, is $920 million, which trails the consensus for $936 million.Sarepta could, again, surprise to the upside with Exondys 51. In the second quarter, Sarepta crushed expectations by $13 million. For the third quarter, Young calls for $43 million in Exondys 51 sales, above the consensus for $40 million.Further full-year guidance for $125 million to $130 million in sales is likely conservative, Young said, noting that ""management sounds upbeat about launch trends.""RELATED:AbbVie's New Hepatitis C Drug Chipping Away At Gilead's ShareThis Biotech Broke Out To An 11-Month High — Can It Keep Going?Why Regeneron's Patent Win Is Worse For Amgen Than You Think

58,REGN,"Dow component Merck (MRK) said late Wednesday that it won't submit applications for approval of a cholesterol drug, following a review of its clinical profile — prodding shares to fall in after-hours trading.XMerck's drug, anacetrapib, was being investigated as a treatment for high blood pressure and to prevent cardiovascular disease. In June, Merck said the drug proved effective in reducing major cardiovascular events in patients already receiving LDL cholesterol-lowering drugs.But Merck also found in earlier studies, as well as in the recently announced Phase 3 trial called Reveal, that anacetrapib accumulated in fat tissue.""We are deeply grateful to the researchers and patients who participated in the anacetrapib clinical development program, and in particular the Reveal outcomes study,"" Merck Research Laboratories President Roger Perlmutter said in a prepared statement. ""Unfortunately, after comprehensive evaluation, we have concluded that the clinical profile of anacetrapib does not support regulatory filings.""IBD'S TAKE: Merck has been in a base since March of this year, hovering between 61 and 67. Shares would have to reach 66.90 a share to be considered back in buy range.In after-hours trading, Merck fell 0.2% after closing down nearly 1.1%, at 63.78.Cholesterol-lowering drugs have been in the news frequently with Amgen (AMGN) and a partnership between Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) battling it out in patent court. Amgen argues that Regeneron and Sanofi infringed on its patents covering its drug, Repatha. Regeneron and Sanofi make a rival drug, Praluent.In August, Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) popped to a nearly two-year high after bumping up its timeline by a quarter — to file applications with the Food and Drug Administration for two cholesterol-lowering drugs in the first quarter of 2019.RELATED:Why Regeneron' Patent Win Is Worse For Amgen Than You ThinkHow This Biotech Rocketed To A 2-Year High After Breaking OutAll Eyes Will Be On This Dow Component's 'Star' Drug Next Week

59,REGN,"Amgen's (AMGN) patents covering LDL cholesterol-lowering drug Repatha are likely to be invalidated in the wake of a court battle with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY), an analyst said Friday.XOn Thursday, a federal judge tossed an injunction on sales of Praluent — Regeneron and Sanofi's rival drug to Amgen's Repatha — and remanded the case back to district court. There, Regeneron and Sanofi will argue that Amgen's patents are too broad.The judge's decision on Thursday effectively ended the ""antibody exception"" of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said. The exception grants to those who discover a new antigen the patent rights to both the antigen and the antibodies that bind to it.""This case was the first time that the (court) in clear language stated that the antibody exception had no justification in law, and that the rules for antibodies should be no different than the rules for small molecules, which require an adequate description of the specific structural features of the claimed molecule,"" he said.Both Repatha and Praluent belong to a class called PCSK9 inhibitors. They prevent the PCSK9 protein from binding to the LDL receptor to lower ""bad"" cholesterol in the blood.In its patents on Repatha, Amgen doesn't identify any structural feature common to the genus, but instead defines the genus based on where the antibodies bind, Regeneron and Sanofi say. They argue Praluent has a different sequence compared with Amgen's claims.Regeneron and Sanofi were prevented from presenting this evidence during the initial trial, the judge said Thursday. They will be allowed to do so during the remanded trial. Porges said in a note to clients that the trial could span just six to nine months given the narrower scope.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks are now ranked first out of the 197 groups IBD tracks, benefiting on the back of strong news for several players this month. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a breakdown on which stocks look strong right now.""Our specialist believes that Amgen's PCSK9 patents will be invalidated in the remanded district court trial,"" Porges wrote. This is based on ""the narrow higher standard for patentability now being demanded by the (court), and required of the district court.""As a result, patents for antibody medicines will now more closely resemble those covering small molecules, Porges said. Antibody drugs are targeted therapies, whereas small-molecule drugs rely on organic compounds to help regulate a biological process.""This decision means many granted broad antibody genus composition patents are at risk in future litigation, and it also suggests the USPTO will change its standards and practices in the near future to apply this standard to such patents filed in the future,"" he said.Further, future royalties between broad antibody genus patent holders and narrow single product infringers are likely to be decided in favor of the infringer, he said. This could put current royalties being paid on some drugs at risk.The case could also have legal implications for another broad antibody dispute between Amgen and Regeneron/Sanofi. They are likely to clash over antibodies that bind to the IL-4 receptor, Porges said. This is the mechanism behind Dupixent, an eczema drug from Regeneron/Sanofi.Already, Regeneron is seeking to invalidate a patent Amgen holds from Immunex, which it acquired in 2002. The patent covers antibodies that bind to the IL-4 receptor.""Our specialist argued that Amgen is less likely to prevail in this case based on (Thursday's) ruling, thus allowing Dupixent to be marketed without any threat of sanction or patent licensing obligation,"" Porges said.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Amgen sank 0.6% to 185.82. Regeneron lifted 1.4% to finish at 469.95. Sanofi dipped a fraction to end the day at 50.57.RELATED:Regeneron Pops After Judge Tosses Ban On Amgen-Rivaling MedWill Regeneron's Cholesterol-Buster Get Booted In Amgen Battle?Regeneron, Sanofi Claim Amgen's LDL-Buster Patent Too Broad

60,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Amgen (AMGN) stocks diverged early Thursday after a U.S. appellate court tossed out a ban on sales of Regeneron and Sanofi's (SNY) cholesterol-busting drug, Praluent, a rival to Amgen's Repatha.XThe decision came out of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., Reuters reported. Amgen had previously claimed Praluent infringed its patents.In January, a judge banned Praluent from the market, siding with Amgen in a patent battle. A month later, the court stayed that injunction pending the appeals process. On Thursday, the federal court ruled the jury was given improper instructions and ordered a new trial.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Regeneron lifted 1.6% to finish at 463.40 while Amgen slid 0.9% to end at 186.85. Sanofi rose less than 1.2% to 50.61.Both drugs involved belong to a class called PCSK9 inhibitors, which work to reduce ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the blood by targeting the PCSK9 protein. At the center of the case, Amgen's patents covers an entire antigen and describe where it binds. Regeneron says this is too broad.IBD'S TAKE: The remainder of 2017 is chock full of catalysts for the biotech sector, analysts say. Key trial data is due from the likes of AbbVie, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Vertex Pharmaceuticals and FibroGen. Visit IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at who could spike — or flop — in the aftermath.During oral presentations in June, Regeneron argued the jury's decision was based on insufficient information. Regeneron wasn't allowed to present evidence on how Praluent uses a different amino acid structure and a different binding site on the PCSK9 protein vs. Repatha.Ultimately, the appellate court sided with Regeneron on Thursday, agreeing that it should have been allowed to present critical evidence relating to its antibody in the original trial, RBC analyst Kennen MacKay wrote in a note to clients.""Specifically, the appeals court sided with Regeneron that critical evidence relating to its antibody's binding characteristics vs. those covered in Amgen's patents were improperly excluded, and that the jury was improperly instructed on the written definition,"" he said.The case will now be presented to a new judge and jury at the district court level. The process could take two to three years, MacKay estimated.Amgen expressed disappointment in the decision in an email to Investor's Business Daily. The biotech noted the court did affirm the claims covered by the patents were ""non-obvious,"" a general requirement for patentability. Regeneron and Sanofi had challenged Amgen on that point.""Our ability to discover and deliver new medicines that benefit patients depends on meaningful patent protection and enforcement that enable significant investments in drug development and clinical trials,"" the firm said. ""We are disappointed by the court's action in reversing and remanding the district court's decision with respect to the validity of our patents based on select pretrial rulings.""Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says the decision should help shift the market share trend ""back from the current state of Repatha dominance to a more equal market split long-term.""Porges notes the case also has implications across the ""antibody exception"" in U.S. patent law. The exception effectively grants to those who discover a new antigen the patent rights for both the antigen and antibodies that bind to it, according to a 2014 report by Harvard Law.""Innovators should expect more competition in antibody drug classes, and patent procedures and litigation decisions that look more like small molecule claims and decisions,"" he wrote in a note to clients. He expects patent claims in antibody cases to become narrower as a result.RELATED:The Surprising Reason Regeneron Toppled Despite Its Beat-And-RaiseWill Regeneron's Cholesterol-Buster Get Booted In Amgen Battle?Will 'Comeback Kid' Regeneron Survive Amgen's Cholesterol Squeeze?

In a Phase 1 trial, five out of six patients, or roughly 83%, treated with the highest dose saw their eczema symptoms improve by at least 50% by week four, the firm said in a news release.The results were maintained over two months after the last infusion. In patients treated with a placebo, only 17% achieved a 50% improvement in symptoms over the same time period. MOR106 will now advance to Phase 2 testing. Galapagos says it will consider switching the drug to an injection.RBC analyst Brian Abrahams noted MOR106 compared favorably with an approved drug called Dupixent from Regeneron and Sanofi. Analysts have predicted Dupixent could be a blockbuster for the two biopharma giants.IBD'S TAKE: Galapagos is also working in cystic fibrosis. But analysts say it lags Vertex Pharmaceuticals, a leading biotech aiming to eradicate cystic fibrosis as it's known today. Head to The New America for a deep dive on Vertex and its triple-pill approach to the lung disease.Dupixent, in combination with topical corticosteroids, helped 69% of patients achieve an improvement in symptoms of at least 75% by week 16, according to trial data on the drug's label. As a monotherapy, Dupixent achieved a similar improvement in 44%-51% of patients.Abrahams suggests MOR106 could also be used to treat inflammatory bowel disorder, which is already treated by drugs from Novartis (NVS) and Eli Lilly (LLY). These drugs belong to a similar class as MOR106. To be competitive, MOR106 would need to be an injection.RELATED:Biotechs On The Mend Even As Glaxo Backs Out Of Ionis DealVertex Hits Record High On Results Of Cystic Fibrosis TrialVertex Catapults 24% On Strong Trial For Cystic Fibrosis

Shares of partner Sanofi (SNY) fell 1.3% to close at 48.74, and biotechs broadly lost 0.2%.Dupixent is approved to treat eczema, but is being tested as a potential asthma drug because of its ability to treat the underlying causes of both. In a Phase 3 trial, Dupixent reduced severe asthma attacks and improved lung function when added to standard treatment, Regeneron said in a news release.At 52 weeks, 300-milligram doses of Dupixent every other week reduced severe asthma attacks by 46% in the overall population. In patients with medium and high levels of specific white blood cells, Dupixent cut asthma attacks by 60% and 67%, respectively.At 12 weeks, the overall population saw an average 9% improvement in lung function over a placebo. In subgroups with medium and high levels of specific white blood cells, lung function improved by an average 11% and 18%, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs could pop in September on a number of upcoming trial readouts. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a breakdown on who's on the line during this ""make or break"" month.But Dupixent had ""less activity"" in patients with a low number of specific white blood cells. This activity was lower than Regeneron's own earlier Phase 2 trial.

67,REGN,"A ""catch-up rally"" in the biotech sector could tack on another 15%-20% to some stocks with Celgene (CELG), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) leading the charge, an analyst said this week.XYear-to-date, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) is up 26%. Over the same time, the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) is up 43%. Both are currently in buy zones. Despite this strong performance, biotech multiples are only just above their historical all-time troughs, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says.But a recovery could be underway. Large-cap biotech stocks are up 15%-20% since April 1 and beat the market ""handily"" in the second quarter.Still, biotechs continue trading at a significant discount to their pharma and medtech brethren, Porges said in a note to clients.

69,REGN,"Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Bayer (BAYRY) will have an uphill battle in persuading doctors to add Xarelto to aspirin therapy for heart-disease patients, analysts said Monday after a trial showed some complications.XXarelto, a blood thinner, was tested alone and in combination with aspirin to cut down the risk of cardiac events in patients with some heart diseases. The combo reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, stroke or heart attack by 24% vs. aspirin alone.But it was also tied to more bleeding events. These events occurred in 3.1% of patients treated with the combination vs. 1.9% of patients treated with aspirin alone. Most of the bleeding occurred in the gastrointestinal tract, Johnson said in a news release.""Encouragingly, the trial found no difference in the rates of fatal bleeds, intracranial bleeding or symptomatic bleeding into a critical organ,"" RBC analyst Glenn Novarro wrote in a note to clients.The results appear sufficient for the Food and Drug Administration to approve Xarelto in combination with aspirin in this setting, Novarro said. Doctors commonly use aspirin-only therapy to help cut down on the risk of cardiac events in heart-disease patients.Novarro notes the benefit/risk profile could have a ""potential impact on peak sales for Xarelto."" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan, though, is more bullish. He notes the combo cut the risk of stroke and cardiovascular death by 42% and 22%, respectively.None of the bleeding in the trial proved fatal or occurred in the brain, he wrote in a note to clients. These results could ""drive a re-acceleration of growth for Xarelto as it expands the potential treatment population for the product by more than 50%,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks have seen better days. In July, the sector hit an 18-month high in anticipation of the second-quarter earnings season. Since then, long-term views for some companies have investors shaken. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at the setup.Fellow drugmaker Novartis (NVS) will be more challenged with its drug known as Ilaris, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a note to clients. In a Phase 3 trial, Ilaris cut down on the risk of major cardiac events in heart-attack survivors by 15% vs. a placebo.""We see these results, together with a lack of a significant benefit in cardiovascular mortality, as underwhelming and unlikely to result in a reasonable commercial opportunity for the drug in this overall population,"" he wrote.Overall, Ilaris showed a 24% relative reduction in the risk of heart attack and a 10% cut in the risk of cardiovascular death. In a subgroup of patients who hit a specific level of inflammation after the first dose, Ilaris resulted in a 27% cut in the risk of major cardiovascular events.Ilaris could have some legs in this group if Novartis can define the subgroup with regulators and negotiate with health insurers, Fernandez said.""Despite this, we believe the drug could still struggle to gain meaningful uptake based on the recent experience with anti-PCSK9 antibodies, and note that the current patent life of the drug extends to only 2024,"" he wrote.PCSK9 inhibitors are cholesterol-reducing drugs from the likes of Amgen (AMGN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)/Sanofi (SNY). Cutting ""bad"" LDL cholesterol has been shown to have a benefit on the cardiovascular side as well, but PCSK9 inhibitors have struggled to gain uptake.At the close on the stock market today, J&J ticked up 6 cents to 131.74.

Tecfidera, however, is expected to miss the Street by 1.3% and MS drugs Plegridy and Avonex are forecast to be light.This comes amid growing competition in the MS field from the likes of Roche (RHHBY), Novartis (NVS) and Sanofi (SNY). Roche's drug, Ocrevus, was approved earlier this year to treat both relapsing-remitting as well as primary progressive MS — a first for the industry.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks are ranked No. 6 out of 197 groups tracked, as sentiment ticks up ahead of the second-quarter earnings season. Make sure to bookmark IBD's Biotech Stocks To Watch And Pharma Industry News for the latest on the sector.Major drugs from Celgene are expected to top the consensus by 4.9% with chemotherapy Revlimid likely to come in 5.1% above the consensus, Porges wrote. Pomalyst, a drug to treat a blood cancer, is expected to be 5.8% higher than the consensus.Gilead is likely to be the biggest second-quarter surprise. Per IMS data, Gilead's sales could top by 10%, ""though this is largely dependent upon the reliability of recent hepatitis C data, which have been unreliable in the past."" Hepatitis C drug sales toppled in 2016 amid high cure rates.Without accounting for highly variable sales of hepatitis C drugs, Gilead's total sales would miss Porges' forecast by 0.1% and the analyst consensus target by 1.7%. At the same time, Gilead's Genvoya, an HIV drug, could beat the consensus by 7%-9%, Porges wrote in a note to clients.Amgen (AMGN) is most likely to match or slightly underperform the consensus, Porges said. Rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel is expected to be in line with consensus views, though it could top Porges' view by as much as 1.9%, per IMS data.Bone health drug Prolia and bone marrow stimulating Aranesp are projected to beat by 6%-7%, which could help offset expected sales misses by bone health drug Xgeva and other bone marrow stimulant drugs, Porges said.""However, the changing price dynamic for many of Amgen's products makes the IMS adjustment factors less reliable,"" Porges wrote. He calls for Amgen to hike some of its prices in July after bumping the price of cancer drug Kyprolis by 3.9% in April.On the adjusted profits per share side, Gilead has a chance to beat consensus views by 11.1%, Porges said. Regeneron and Vertex could also top expectations by 8.1% and 7%, respectively.But Biogen could miss earnings views by 10.6% due to a one-time research-and-development expense not fully recognized across analysts' estimates, Porges said. AbbVie, too, is likely to miss adjusted earnings per share by 3.2%, he said.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech group was down fractionally.RELATED:Could Q2 Surprise Spike This Beleaguered Biotech's Stock?Gilead Could Acquire This Biotech — But Vertex Is Still Better: AnalystWhy This Biotech Could Be Poised For A Run After Toppling 52% In June

79,REGN,"After a long absence, Apple (AAPL) made IBD's latest monthly list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds, as it gets ready to unveil its latest iPhone, with one analyst saying the launch may be delayed due to production issues.X The tech giant was joined by a slew of medical sector stocks, including managed care providers UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET), as well as leading biotech companies Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN).Defense contractors Boeing (BA), Raytheon (RTN) and Heico (HEI) also made the list, as tensions with North Korea and anticipated defense spending increases are expected to drive demand.Over the last three months, top fund managers invested over $1 billion each in four stocks on the list: UnitedHealth (99 funds, $1.39 billion invested), Apple (85, $1.36 billion), Electronic Arts (EA) (76, $1.25 billion) and Celgene (96, $1.07 billion).The heavy institutional buying has helped push Apple, Electronic Arts and Celgene into new buy zones, and has already lifted UnitedHealth beyond buy range.Seeing that stocks on your watch list are being bought by mutual fund managers with a proven track record of success is a positive sign, since it means they've done their due diligence and like what they see.But it doesn't mean the stocks are necessarily in or near a proper buy zone right now. More time may be needed for them to set up a proper buying opportunity.In addition to Apple and Celgene, stocks on this month's list that are forming a base or within buy ranges also include Boeing, medical software firm Cerner (CERN), and casino operator MGM Resorts (MGM).Apple has the distinction of making the new buys screen and also topping the list of new sells this month. The net number of funds selling Apple (151 selling minus 85 buying) was 66.Mastercard (MA) had the second-most net sellers (48), followed by NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) (45) and biotech giant Amgen (AMGN) (30).Despite the number of sellers, each of those stocks continues to show strength, and Amgen is testing a new potential buy zone.

80,REGN,"A late-stage failure by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) could bolster biotech rival AbbVie (ABBV) in treating infants infected with a serious lung disease, an analyst said late Monday.XRegeneron's drug, known as suptavumab, was being developed as a treatment for respiratory syncytial virus, a common virus that leads to mild, coldlike symptoms in adults and older children, but can be serious in infants.Suptavumab proved efficient in a subgroup of 1,149 preterm infants tested in the Phase 3 trial, but didn't meet its goal in the study, Regeneron said in a news release. Regeneron discontinued development of the drug.""Despite this finding, the company has decided to discontinue the development program, presumably based on a limited opportunity such a subgroup would offer, and the cost of conducting another pivotal trial,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said.Regeneron's failure is to AbbVie's benefit, Porges said. The drug was meant to be a more convenient option to AbbVie's Synagis which is given to patients before the virus season starts and every month during the season. Suptavumab was tested as a 30-milligram single dose, or two doses eight weeks apart.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 444-company biotech industry group is ranked sixth out of 197 groups after it spiked 1.4% higher on Monday. But biotech fever has chilled since the sector hit an 18-month peak in late July. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at what's affecting the sector.Porges cut his revenue forecasts for Regeneron by 1% to 3% and eliminated a potential 5% upside catalyst for Regeneron this year. He cut his price target to 552 from 580, but kept his outperform rating, noting the strength of Dupixent, an eczema drug.""We remain positive about Regeneron's stock based on our expectations of the long-term Dupixent trajectory, the positive upcoming catalyst of Dupixent asthma data and the (supplemental Biologics License Application),"" he said.Dupixent was approved as an eczema treatment in March. It was developed by Regeneron and Sanofi (SNY) in an agreement set to end this year. Analysts are bullish on Dupixent, which is also being looked at as an asthma treatment.Removing suptavumab from his forecast, Porges says his sales expectations for 2017 are still 1% ahead of the consensus. For 2018-19, Porges' revenue forecast is 5% and 12%-24% north of the consensus, respectively.At Tuesday's close, Regeneron had slipped 0.4% to 472.57 while AbbVie lost 0.7% to 70.34 on the stock market today.RELATED:Can Generic Drug Stocks Catch A Break After Mylan's Crash?Alnylam Reports Lagging Sales, Wider-Than-Expected LossesThe Surprising Reason Regeneron Toppled Despite Its Beat-And-Raise

82,REGN,"Coherus Biosciences (CHRS) stock plunged to a year low Monday after U.S. regulators asked for a reanalysis of data and more information regarding its copy of Amgen (AMGN) chemotherapy drug Neulasta.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Coherus shares fell 23.9%, to 15.73, as shares of Amgen lifted 0.5%, to 164.88, on the news. Mylan (MYL) stock fell 3% to 38.88. Mylan is also working on a copy of Neulasta.Neulasta is a bone marrow stimulant designed to reduce the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Coherus and Mylan are working on copies of the Amgen drug called biosimilars. Biosimilars are biological medical products and are nearly identical copies of the original drugs.But the Food and Drug Administration's request for more data Monday will be a speed bump for Coherus. The FDA is asking Coherus to reanalyze data showing its copycat drug can provoke an immune response, as well as more manufacturing information.Coherus noted in a news release the FDA is not asking for an additional trial in cancer patients for its biosimilar known as CHS-1701. An additional trial would prompt a much bigger delay in the drug's approval.""While we are disappointed in the delay that this additional request has caused, we remain confident in our ability to address the FDA's requests for the purpose of obtaining approval for CHS-1701,"" Chief Executive Denny Lanfear said in a statement.IBD'S TAKE: Amgen isn't just facing Neulasta competition. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) are rivaling the No. 1 biotech with a cholesterol-lowering drug. Head to IBD 50 for a breakdown of the litigation surrounding the three companies.Lanfear expects Coherus to be able to respond to the FDA with a definite path moving forward ""in the coming months."" If approved, he expects CHS-1701 to generate health savings costs in the U.S. Biosimilars are typically less expensive than their counterparts.Next up, Mylan has guided to late 2018 or early 2019 for its copy of Neulasta with its Indian partner Biocon, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a note to clients.Analysts broadly project Neulasta sales to topple over the coming years as biosimilars chip away. In 2017, the consensus models $3.92 billion dropping to $3.43 billion in 2018. By 2025, Wall Street sees just $1.74 billion in Neulasta sales.RELATED:Teva Pharma Ran A Migraine Trial — And Lilly, Amgen BenefitedBreakout Watch: Top Funds Buy This Biotech IPO With 196% GrowthHow This Small Biotech Could Ruffle The Market In Migraine Drugs

83,REGN,"Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi's (SNY) rheumatoid arthritis drug is 15% to 30% cheaper than rival drugs from Amgen (AMGN), AbbVie (ABBV) and Roche (RHHBY), an analyst said Tuesday after the duo's Kevzara grabbed Food and Drug Administration approval.Kevzara's approval comes seven months after the FDA delayed its approval on issues with manufacturing at a French factory where the drug is filled. The approval is for patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who don't respond to other anti-rheumatic drugs.""The approval came on time and with a label that more or less matches our expectations,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. Kevzara can be prescribed alone or in combination with FDA-approved methotrexate. It is a self-administered injection.Like Roche's Actemra, which belongs to the same class of drugs, Kevzara is associated with an increased risk of serious and minor infections, liver issues and injection-site reactions. But it's also at a 15% discount to Actemra at $39,000 annually.""With discounts, (it) should offer a cost-effective treatment option for payers in this setting,"" Porges said. Kevzara costs 30% less than Amgen's Enbrel and AbbVie's Humira, which are widely prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis, though belong to a different drug class.IBD'S TAKE: Regeneron could be among those leading a biotech resurgence this year, analysts say. Head to IBD's Technology page for a deeper dive on why Amgen, Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB) aren't expected to be at the forefront of the revitalization.Regeneron and Sanofi expect European approval to come later this year and see Kevzara hitting the market in the U.S. within a few weeks. But Porges sees the drug as a minimal driver and forecasts $37 million in sales this year, growing to $456 million in 2021.A number of drug classes address rheumatoid arthritis, he noted. The field is likely to become more crowded later this year when Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) adds its drug sirukimab to the lineup and as more in a class dubbed JAK inhibitors arrive in 2018-19.""Kevzara contributes approximately 11% of our expected sales of joint Sanofi-Regeneron products in 2018, but this falls to 5% long term as expected growth of (eczema drug) Dupixent and even (cholesterol-lowering drug) Praluent rapidly eclipse Kevzara's importance,"" Porges said.The consensus forecasts Kevzara sales at $56 million this year, growing to $705 million by 2020 and hitting $1.1 billion by 2025.On the stock market today, Regeneron stock rose 0.1% to 461.37, as Sanofi stock fell 0.2% to 49.07.

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 tested their 50-day moving averages on Tuesday but closed above that key level. Bank stocks broke through key support as Treasury yields hit postelection lows. Media stocks tumbled on warnings. But there were several breakouts and setups among leading stocks.United Technologies (UTX) announced it would buy aircraft supplier Rockwell Collins (COL) for $140 a share, with $93.33 a share in cash and the rest in stock. That's $23 billion, or $30 billion including assumed debt, making it one of the biggest aerospace deals ever. But Boeing (BA) indicated that it might try to block the deal as it looks to keep its share of the lucrative maintenance and repair business. Analysts said United Tech may sell its building business to help unlock more shareholder value. United Tech shares fell 7%.RELATED:Boeing May Challenge United Tech's Buyout Of Rockwell CollinsThe credit tracking service discovered the massive intrusion on July 29, disclosing the incident late on Thursday.

On Tuesday, Insmed (INSM) and Bellerophon Therapeutics (BLPH) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) popped on strong drug trial data. Cellect Biotechnology (APOP) lifted after the FDA granted orphan drug status to its treatment for organ transplant rejection. Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) hit an 11-month high on positive data in a Duchenne muscular dystrophy trial. On Thursday, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) sank after it suspending testing in a hemophilia trial, but Celgene (CELG) and AstraZeneca (AZN) rose despite the FDA putting several cancer trials on full or partial clinical holds. AbbVie (ABBV) rallied on positive trial data for an eczema drug, hitting shares of Regeneron (REGN), which has its own eczema treatment.The largest pure-play grocer narrowly topped sales and same-store sales forecasts, but earnings came in just below views as margins came under pressure. Kroger (KR) and other grocers are facing intense competition and long-threats about online deliver. Amazon (AMZN) has already cut prices at its just-acquired Whole Foods. Wal-Mart (WMT), the largest U.S. grocery seller, has been a key driver of food price deflation.

87,REGN,"Biotech stocks have shown a somewhat predictable pattern since 1980, when IBD first identified biotech stocks as an industry group. Because of the innovative power of new medicines, biotech stocks naturally have periods of steep climbs. They also have sharp sell-offs. The monthly chart is the easiest place to see the patterns. The most recent sell-off started after the June…

88,REGN,"September will be a ""make or break"" month for a number of biotechs, including Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY), Axovant Sciences (AXON) and Versartis (VSAR), which are expected to present Phase 3 data in the upcoming weeks.XBiotech stocks could be poised for another run, says Loncar Investments Chief Executive Brad Loncar. Year to date, they've risen 28% and hit a 20-month high on Sept. 1. Shares have risen following Gilead Sciences' (GILD) announcement that it would acquire Kite Pharma (KITE).All of that comes before an incredibly newsworthy September that will feature at least five major medical conferences, at least 10 big investor conferences and nearly a dozen Phase 3 trials expected to read out, Loncar told Investor's Business Daily.""This might be the most newsworthy month in biotech history,"" he said. ""What's so amazing this September is there are a ton of Phase 3 trials that are scheduled to read out. The company itself is either going to succeed or fail because of these trial readouts.""""I count seven of them that are make or break for the companies,"" Loncar said.Loncar counts 11 key trial readouts in September. But principal among them, he notes, is Alnylam, which is expected to unveil the results of a trial of a drug dubbed patisiran for a rare disease that causes the buildup of abnormal material called amyloid throughout the body.Success could be a major catalyst for the technologies known as RNA interference and antisense, which essentially turn off malfunctioning genes, Leerink analyst Paul Matteis wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: Novartis' IBD Relative Strength Rating was boosted Friday to 71 from 65 out of a best-possible 99. The grade shows how the stock's price moved over the past 52 weeks against all other stocks in our database. Head to IBD Data Stories to see how Novartis stacks up against its rivals.Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) is also working on a Phase 3 drug, known as inotersen, to treat the disease called TTR amyloidosis.Matteis calls for an upside of 5%-15% depending on the magnitude of success and safety, and a downside of 15%-20% if the drug proves effective but mixed on safety. He sees downside of 70% if Alnylam's drug fails completely in the trial.According to Loncar, ""Most people are convinced it's going to succeed."" He cited a note that saw the range of failure to success putting Alnylam's stock price at 25 to 105 per share. It closed at 86.80 on Tuesday.""For that company, that's a $7 billion window,"" he said. ""This is a bellwether biotech company. Everyone is counting on this one to succeed, and it probably will. But if that one trial fails, the stock will crash.""Behind Alnylam, Loncar notes that Axovant is expected to announce the results of its drug dubbed intepirdine in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Recently, Biogen (BIIB) stock broke out on strong Phase 1b data from an Alzheimer's trial.Axovant is working on a different theory of treating Alzheimer's. Intepirdine is known as a serotonin receptor antagonist, which has potential cognition, memory and learning-enhancing side effects. It was originally developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) but sold to Axovant.So far, nothing has worked in Alzheimer's, so there's always some excitement — and trepidation — around trial readouts for the disease, Loncar said. Last December, Eli Lilly (LLY) toppled when its drug, solanezumab, failed in a Phase 3 trial of Alzheimer's.""If Axovant does succeed, we could see a stock go from 20 to 100 in one day,"" he said. Axovant closed at 20.35 on Tuesday. ""That's extreme. But that's the kind of euphoria Alzheimer's can create.""He also notes trials from Versartis and Zogenix (ZGNX) in growth hormone deficiency and a form of epilepsy known as Dravet syndrome, respectively.But it won't just be September that's chock full of catalysts, Leerink analysts wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. After ""a solid year for returns of biopharma stocks"" there are still a number of catalysts in the back half of the year.Among large-caps, Leerink's Geoffrey Porges notes that AbbVie (ABBV) will have data from trials for anti-inflammatory and cancer drugs, and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) is expected to grab another approval for its drug Soliris to treat a disease in which the immune system attacks healthy cells.Amgen (AMGN) could update its label for LDL cholesterol-lowering drug, Repatha, to include its added benefit on cardiovascular outcomes. Meanwhile, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) are appealing a court decision vs. Amgen for their rival drug, Praluent.Celgene (CELG) will have readouts in ulcerative colitis and a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. FibroGen (FGEN) is expected to have data for fibrosis and anemia drugs. Analysts expect Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) to provide an update with data from its cystic fibrosis trials.Gilead-Kite's CAR-T drug will likely be approved to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in November. This would follow the approval of Novartis' (NVS) Kymriah, a CAR-T drug that treats a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to age 25.""We expect CAR-T to remain one of the most closely followed emerging areas in biotech in the second half of 2017,"" Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt wrote in a note. The launch of Kymriah should read through to drugs from Bluebird Bio (BLUE), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Adaptimmune Therapeutics (ADAP).RELATED:Biogen's Alzheimer's Drug Shows Promise — Could It Break Out?How This J&J Partnership Bit The Dust On Gilead-Kite CompetitionCelgene Breaks Out; These 2 Biotech Giants Close On Buy PointsHow Novartis' Cancer Approval Validates Gilead's $11.9 Billion Kite DealGilead-Kite Deal Boosts Biotech ETF As It Clears Buy Point

The S&P 500 and Dow industrials are less than 1% from their record levels.Biogen shot up 4.2% to 316.58 in Thursday stock market trading in nearly double normal volume, following a 3.5% gain Wednesday. Biogen soared past a 312.50 buy point in a consolidation going all the way back to early August 2016.The biotech's long consolidation amid strong market gains means that the stock's Relative Strength line has lagged, which is not a great sign.Biogen reported encouraging early-stage data on an Alzheimer's treatment earlier this week.The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF, better known by its IBB ticker, jumped 2.8% to 333.36, cresting a 330 buy point from a short flat base, really a base-on-base formation.IBB and other biotech ETFs such as SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) are a way to play the sector rally while avoiding company-specific blowups from weak earnings, failed drug trials and more.Bluebird Bio rocketed 11% in huge volume to 124.85, a 23-month high. That's a full point over a 123.85 cup base entry. Bluebird Bio, which is developing CAR-T gene therapy treatments for cancer has surged 28% this week on big CAR-T news. Gilead Sciences (GILD) is buying Kite Pharma (KITE) for $11.9 billion while Novartis (NVS) won the first-ever FDA approval for a CAR-T therapy.Supernus rose 5.2% on Thursday to 45.80, retaking a 45.05 flat-base entry as it rebounded from near its 50-day moving average. Supernus originally moved into a buy zone on Aug. 16, but has pulled back in a somewhat up-and-down fashion.Celgene rose 3.4% to 138.93, just below a 139.10 buy point from a flat base, another base-on-base formation. Celgene edged up to 139.50 in premarket trading Friday, suggesting a breakout at the open.Celgene is one of the bigger biotechs, but it's partners with CAR-T plays Bluebird Bio and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO).Amgen (AMGN), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) are among other notable biotechs setting up in new bases.RELATED:The Big Picture: 5 Reasons To Be Bullish NowBiogen's Alzheimer's Drug Shows Promise — Could It Break Out?Breakouts Prevail Among New Highs As Market Picks UpBiotech And Pharma Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

The Dow Jones industrial average was just above break-even a day after it slid more than 1.7% and pierced its 50-day moving average in heavy volume.Volume is up on the NYSE vs. the same time on Wednesday but slightly lower on the Nasdaq.The S&P 500 gained roughly 0.2%, boosted by strength in the biotech sector amid news coming from the well-followed ASCO conference. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Incyte (INCY), Sage Therapeutics (SAGE) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) were among the top gainers in IBD's biotech industry group.Among these four, Regeneron holds the best IBD Composite Rating at 96, and for good reason. Revenue has grown more than 10-fold over the past five years, from $446 million in 2011 to $4.86 billion in 2016. It is a recognized leader in treatments that reflect excellent science, and has changed the face of treatment for age-related macular degeneration.Regeneron stopped losing money in 2012, earning $4.66 a share in 2012. Earnings have grown almost every year since then, up 40% to $11.34 a share.The stock has bounced nicely since hitting a 52-week low of 325.35 in August last year, and may now be working on a first-stage bottoming-base pattern.The Street sees Regeneron's earnings lifting 12% this year to $12.67 a share and another 21% to $15.32 in 2017. Other rising industry groups in the stock market today include diversified operations, medical software, fabless semiconductors, chipmaking and fiber-optic gear.Shire Group (SHPG), meanwhile, advanced nearly 3% to 187.46 in heavy trading, further adding distance above its 50- and 200-day moving averages on positive data for a treatment for hereditary angioedema. Shire, part of the ethical-drugs industry group, and Regeneron are still in the early stages of forming the right side of potential new bases. It's important to have patience and see if these and other names in the two beaten-down medical industry groups can flex enough price strength to get in a proper position to break out.The market's general price-and-volume action, as noted in Wednesday's Big Picture column, represented a notable change in character among institutional investors compared with prior declines by the Dow to and below the key intermediate-term support line. Therefore, IBD changed its current outlook from ""confirmed uptrend"" to ""uptrend under pressure,"" meaning that new buys are permissible, but must be done with extra caution.The Dow industrials' Accumulation/Distribution Rating is now at C+, down from B- yet still positive. IBD's Accumulation rating covers 13 weeks' worth of price-and-volume action. A grade of C+ or higher indicates that mutual funds, hedge funds, insurers, pensions, banks and the like are overall accumulating equities.As seen in the general market indicators page, which is a PDF link found at the bottom of the Big Picture column each day, at least 17 names within the 30-member Dow Jones industrial average still have an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B or higher, a good sign. You can see all 30 stocks' ratings at the top of the Dow Jones daily chart on the link.Small caps also rebounded, yet rather meekly compared with Wednesday's carnage. The S&P SmallCap 600 rallied 0.1% after sinking 2.4%. It too fell sharply below its 50-day moving average; at Wednesday's low, the 600 was 5.5% below its all-time high of 866.In other financial markets, WTI crude oil continued to rebound amid a fading U.S. dollar, rising nearly 0.8% to $49.44 and hitting one-month highs. Gold futures on the Comex cooled nearly 0.4% to $1,254 a troy ounce, but have bounced more than 3% since hitting as low as $1,216 on May 9.The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond continued to sink, edging down 2.21%. Yet according to the latest analysis of fed funds rate futures at CME Group, the probability of a new 25-basis point hike in short-term interest rates at the Federal Reserve's June 14 meeting is still more than 69%.RELATED:What's The Market Direction?

93,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) look likely to catch the next wave in biotech, an analyst said Friday, suggesting after two years of underperformance that the sector could be slated for a boom.X But it won't be ""value stocks"" like Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB) driving the boom, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges told clients in a note.""These large caps drag down the performance of the indexes and (exchange traded funds), but the growth stocks already seem to be capturing sustained new investor interest,"" he said. ""Our advice to investors remains to identify and scrutinize evidence of competitive advantage and to look to management to maximize profitability of existing businesses first and foremost.""IBD's 431-company Biomed/Biotech industry group is up 10% for the first five months of 2017 after finishing 2016 down 25%. During the ""boom years"" of 2015 and 2014, the stocks tacked on 11% and 41% growth. The group closed down 0.9% on the stock market today.Such is the pattern in the biotech market, Porges says. Typical corrections run two to three quarters, followed by two to three years of sideways performance. Today, much of the excitement of mid-2015 has dissipated, leaving shares 40% below their long-term median relative multiples.Consensus expectations for biotech sales and profits have declined 14%-23% and 7%-12%, respectively, over the last two years.But the signs are getting better, Porges said. First-quarter results yielded ""a mixture of positive and negative results vs. (the) consensus, and prompted some additional negative revisions, but so far this quarter's estimates have been remarkably stable.""IBD'S TAKE: Regeneron stock outperformed a broad market plunge Thursday, topping a 456.06 saucer buy point. Head to IBD's New Highs list for a look at other strong performers.Political pressure is also beginning to subside, he said. President Trump has promised to introduce a competitive system that would cut down on escalating drug prices. Meanwhile, the industry has seemingly begun to self-regulate on drug pricing.There are exceptions. Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals' (IONS) Spinraza, a spinal muscular atrophy drug, debuted this year at $125,000 per treatment, or $750,000 in the first year. Porges sees the $37,000 price tag for Regeneron and Sanofi's (SNY) eczema drug Dupixent and the $65,000 price for Roche's (RHHBY) multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus as more reasonable.""Furthermore, manufacturers of established brands are taking more modest price increases and fewer of them, and are adopting voluntary price-increase limits (which remain too high but are a step in the right direction),"" Porges said.Approvals — many on time and some earlier than expected — have accelerated this year at the Food and Drug Administration, after hitting a five-year low in 2016. So far this year, 20 drugs have grabbed FDA approval, matching the total for all of last year. Those labels also appear broader, meaning drugs could have greater use.Porges sees a number of drug launches coming over the next 18 months that could outdo consensus views. Key among those are gene therapies for rare diseases, treatments for end-stage cancer, and therapies for severe diseases created via a process that harnesses RNA molecules to inhibit certain genes.""This process finally validates all the capital that was invested in these remarkable technologies during the 'boom years' and had seeming headed for disappointment at many points during the bust of the last 24 months,"" Porges said.RELATED:How Biogen's Takeover Prospects Soured In Mere MonthsWill 'Comeback Kid' Regeneron Survive Amgen's Cholesterol Squeeze?

94,REGN,"The major market indexes edged higher in morning trade Thursday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq aimed to extend its winning streak to 10 days as it set another record high, rising 0.1%. The S&P 500 inched up 0.1% to take a new high of its own, while the Dow Jones industrial average moved down 0.1%.X Among the Dow industrials, Nike (NKE) looked to break out again above a 59.10 flat-base entry in the stock market today. Shares moved almost 3% higher after Morgan Stanley upgraded the apparel maker to overweight from equal-weight. Initially, the stock broke out on June 30 after a solid earnings release.On the downside, Home Depot (HD) was the Dow's big loser on the day, declining 3.5% in heavy volume, possibly in response to a deal for Sears Holdings (SHLD) to begin offering its Kenmore appliances online via Amazon.com (AMZN). Sears shares shot up 19%, Amazon rose 0.2%. Home Depot shares have been consolidating since a break of the 50-day moving average on June 23.American Express (AXP) fell 1.3% after the company announced strong earnings results, but raised its loan-loss provisions in the second quarter. Despite today's fall, the stock is still holding about 3% above its 82.10 flat-base buy point.Among other companies reporting earnings, T-Mobile (TMUS) turned an early 3% gain into a slight loss after meeting resistance at its 50-day line. Late Wednesday, the cellular provider topped Q2 earnings and sales estimates.Meanwhile, mining giant Alcoa (AA) reversed from early losses to rise 1.5% after warning that higher input costs will reduce its full-year net performance. Shares are still building the right side of a potential cup-shaped base.Among other analyst actions, Tesla (TSLA) was initiated at neutral by Citigroup. Shares rose 0.6%, but remain stuck under their 50-day line.Among leading stocks, FANG member Facebook (FB) moved higher initially after reports indicated the company is planning to launch a subscription-based news product, but edged 0.1% lower. The social media giant is on track for another record high, having risen nine of the last ten trading days.Within the IBD 50, Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) and YY (YY) were early advancers, rising 1.5% and 2.6%, respectively. Regeneron is about 14% above a 453.06 cup-shaped base entry, while YY continues to add to its gains above a 61.62 flat-base entry.On the downside, flooring retailer Floor & Decor (FND) fell over 4% after the company priced its secondary offering at 40 — a discount to Wednesday's closing price of 40.96.

95,REGN,"Merck's (MRK) cholesterol-busting drug isn't as strong as Wall Street initially thought, analysts argued Tuesday, after the Dow component said it would hold off on filing an application to sell the medication with regulators.The drug, known as anacetrapid, reduced heart attacks, cardiac death and the need for certain heart surgery in patients already receiving cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins.But, Merck noted, anacetrapid continued to build up in fat tissue. The issue had been discovered in earlier studies and, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez says, could ultimately prevent Merck from filing the drug for approval.""We believe the mention of this (in the press release) highlights a potential long-term regulatory concern — one that we believe would require a very robust impact on key (cardiac) events, like death — for Merck to file anacetrapid,"" he said.Merck didn't look at anacetrapid's ability to cut down on strokes, which is typically a goal when examining the cardiac benefits of a cholesterol-lowering drug, Fernandez wrote in a note to clients.Before considering whether to file for approval with the Food and Drug Administration, Merck plans to unveil the full trial results during the European Society of Cardiology meeting in August.IBD'S TAKE: IBD 50 stock Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) has an approved cholesterol-busting drug with partner Sanofi (SNY) known as Praluent. But Praluent is facing competition and litigation from Amgen's (AMGN) Repatha. Head to the IBD 50 to see how Regeneron looks to fare in the court battle.Still, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat argued Merck should file for approval of the drug, which is known as a CETP inhibitor. Most analysts didn't expect the drug to succeed in the trial, with only 20% expecting anacetrapid to ""work,"" he said.""Ultimately, there is a need for added control beyond statins,"" he wrote in a research report. ""If you need modestly more benefit, you could consider (Merck's) Vytroin and now anacetrapid. ""Patients who need much more benefit, could consider using what are called PCSK9 inhibitors from the likes of Regeneron/Sanofi and Amgen, he said.On the stock market today, shares of Merck — a component of the Dow Jones industrial average — slipped 0.6% to end the regular trading session at 65.54.RELATED:Dow's Merck Is Still Beating Bristol, Roche In Immuno-OncologyBiotech Stock With 497% Growth, Positive Trial Results Nears Buy Zone

96,REGN,"Bellwether Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) second-quarter report bodes well for the biotech sector, an analyst said Tuesday, after the Dow component topped profit expectations and narrowly lagged sales views.On the stock market today, J&J stock climbed 1.8% to 134.46, as biotech stocks dropped nearly 1% as a group. Generic drugmakers inched down 0.3%.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges remains bullish on the biotech sector and Needham analyst Mike Matson says J&J's second-quarter results point to a stable period for medtech players like Boston Scientific (BSX), Medtronic (MDT), Stryker (SYK) and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH).During the quarter, J&J's drug sales grew 4.7% sequentially, though they fell 2.6% vs. the year-earlier period. Porges partially blamed a one-time positive rebate adjustment in 2016 which eliminated 4% of year-over-year volume/price growth in the second quarter.Sales of J&J's immunosuppressant Remicade declined 14% year over year. But rivalry from biosimilars contributed to just 5% of that decline, which is lower than guidance for a 10%-15% decline in 2017, Porges wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Cancer and rare-disease specialists are expected to do well in the second half of 2017 as positive sentiment returns to the biotech space. Visit IBD's Industry Snapshot for a look at who may outperform in the second quarter.J&J also expects currency headwinds to subside in the second half of 2017 and called for acceleration in its pharmaceutical unit as well as positive trends in sales outside the U.S. Based on the presumed currency impacts, the firm raised its outlook for adjusted profits to $7.12-$7.22 a share.Outside the U.S., drug sales grew 7% sequentially in the second quarter, beating views for 3% growth, Porges said.""(This) supports our expectations for sequential outside-U.S. revenue growth for our companies due to a weakening dollar in the second quarter,"" he said.Porges expects guidance increases for biotechs during the second quarter. Earlier in the week, he called for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) to easily beat June quarter sales views and for Gilead Sciences (GILD) to handily top profit expectations.""Our covered companies will not be negatively impacted by the same prior period adjustments as J&J, and those with current or imminent biosimilar competition may surprise consensus if the Remicade market dynamics can be viewed as a proxy,"" he said.AbbVie (ABBV) could see some pain, though. Sales of cancer drug Imbruvica grew 40% in the U.S. and 64% outside the U.S., J&J said. J&J is partnered with AbbVie on Imbruvica in the U.S. J&J typically books 40% of U.S. Imbruvica sales, Porges said. This translates to about $501 million for AbbVie's Imbruvica sales.This would be a ""miss vs. consensus of $514 million and our estimate of $537 million,"" he said. ""For AbbVie, Imbruvica is considered the largest growth driver beyond the Humira patent cliff, but continued missed consensus expectations repeated in the second quarter would be a negative for the stock.""RELATED:'Stars Align' For These Biotechs To Crush Earnings ConsensusThese 2 Drug Giants In Buy Range Just Beat Earnings ViewsHow Novartis' FDA Win In Cancer Also Could Be A Boon For Its Rivals

The $1.4 billion fund boasted a five-year average annual return of 21.6% vs. the benchmark index's 15.4%, according to Morningstar Inc.IHI, launched in May 2006, tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Medical Equipment Index.

100,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) stock popped to a six-month high Thursday after the No. 5 biotech reported sales that failed to meet view, but weren't as dire as some analysts feared for eye drug Eylea and cholesterol drug Praluent for the first quarter.At the closing bell on the stock market today, Regeneron stock leapt 6.7% to 434.31, touching a high last achieved in November, surpassing a potential buy point of 453.06.For the first quarter ended March 31, Regeneron reported adjusted income of $2.92 per share on revenue of $1.32 billion, up a respective 22% and 10%. Analysts had expected earnings of $3.07 a share on sales of $1.3 billion.Globally, Eylea sales grew 9% vs. the year-earlier quarter to $1.34 billion, below the consensus of $1.39 billion, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients. In the U.S., Eylea sold $854 million, missing analysts' views for $860 million. Outside U.S. sales lagged by 11%.But, Porges said, those sales were ""nowhere near the feared downside.""IBD'S TAKE: Biotech investing is oftentimes a matter of simply picking the right stock. Which catalysts should get the most attention? Head to IBD's Technology page for a better look at which stocks are poised to do well in 2017.Praluent was weak, though, with $36 million in sales coming in 39% below the consensus model of $59 million. Sales grew 177% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Praluent rivals Amgen's (AMGN) Repatha. Both are what's known as PCSK9 inhibitors.Regeneron blamed the adjusted earnings miss on higher-than-expected taxes. During the quarter, Regeneron paid $230 million in taxes, above consensus expectations of $180 million.The company also announced positive results for its eczema drug Dupixent in a Phase 2 trial for inflammation of the esophagus associated with chronic allergies and immune conditions. It will present the full results of that trial at a later medical conference.Dupixent will also be in two pediatric trials this year for moderate-to-severe eczema in 12- to 17-year-old patients, and in uncontrolled persistent asthma in 6- to 11-year-olds.For the year, Regeneron reaffirmed its guidance for single-digit growth of Eylea in the U.S. It also expects lower reimbursement from partner Sanofi (SNY) for commercialization expenses, guiding to $385 million to $425 million, down from earlier views for $400 million to $450 million.RELATED:Did Regeneron, Sanofi Just Launch A Blockbuster Drug?Amgen Trips Amid Rivals: Sales Miss By $100 Million, But Earnings TopAmgen Trumps Regeneron, Sanofi In Cholesterol Drug Sales

101,REGN,"Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) rocketed to a nearly two-year high Tuesday after bumping up its timeline to file applications with the Food and Drug Administration for two cholesterol-lowering drugs.XIn midday trading on the stock market today, Esperion popped 23.1%, near 55.60, hitting a high last seen in late August 2015. Shares broke out of a cup with a 48.31 buy point on June 28 and are now almost 16% extended from that point.Esperion said Tuesday that it plans to file applications with the FDA for bempedoic acid and a combination using bempedoic acid and ezetimibe by the first quarter of 2019, moving up its timeline by a quarter.Bempedoic acid is being studied in four Phase 3 trials as a method of lowering ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in patients at a high risk of cardiovascular disease. All four of these trials will be fully enrolled this month, Esperion said.The biotech also announced topline results of a Phase 2 trial of a bempedoic acid combo using ezetimibe and atorvastatin vs. a placebo in patients with high cholesterol. In a six-week study, the combo lowered LDL cholesterol by 64% from baseline vs. a placebo.Of those patients treated with the combo, 95% saw their LDL cholesterol lowered by 50% or more from baseline. Nine in 10 patients achieved LDL cholesterol levels of less than 70 milligrams per deciliter. Less than 100 milligrams per deciliter is considered optimal.Esperion noted no serious side effects of the combination, including no increases in liver enzymes. Needham analyst Chad Messer sees trial results like this helping to drive adoption of bempedoic acid by doctors with patients on statins.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 443-company Biotech industry group is now ranked fourth out of 197 groups tracked, gaining a spot from last week after a recent hot streak. What could send it higher? Head to IBD Industry Themes for a deep dive.Analysts also expect bempedoic acid to be competitive with a class of drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors. Amgen (AMGN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)/Sanofi (SNY) have drugs in this class. Bempedoic acid is expected to have a lower price.""We believe this represents the largest commercial opportunity for bempedoic acid,"" he wrote in a note to clients. Messer kept his buy rating on Esperion, and boosted his price target to 72 from 58.In related news, Esperion reiterated its desire to attract a large global or regional pharma partner to maximize the commercial potential of bempedoic acid, Messer noted. But the firm emphasized that it doesn't see itself as beholden to a timeline on a deal.Esperion wrapped its second quarter with $181.1 million in cash and guided to $105 million to $115 million in cash by year's end. It expects cash on hand to be sufficient into early 2019 and through readouts of its Phase 3 trials of bempedoic acid, Messer wrote.RELATED:Esperion Breaks Out On Cholesterol Tie-Up With Dow's MerckEsperion, Medicines Co.

102,REGN,"Mylan (MYL) hit a four-year low, taking generic drug stocks with it after reporting second-quarter metrics that lagged Wall Street and cutting guidance for the next two years, but then recovered to post a slight gain Wednesday.XOn the stock market today, Mylan ended the trading day up 0.9% to 32.08 after earlier falling as much as 7%, hitting a low last seen in June 2013. This is the sixth consecutive day Mylan has spent in the red following a disappointing report from fellow generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA).The crash initially sent IBD's 17-company Generic Drugs industry group down as much as 2.4%, but the sector recovered in recent trades, rising nearly 1% at the close. Still, Taro Pharmaceutical (TARO), Collegium Pharmaceutical (COLL) and Perrigo (PRGO) remained down 7.3%, 5.4% and 0.3%, respectively.For its second quarter ended June 30, Mylan reported $2.96 billion in sales, up 16% year over year, but that missed the consensus for $3 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.10 per share lagged by 9 cents and fell 5%.Revenue in North America was hit hardest, down 9%, as sales in Europe and the rest of the world grew 59% and 29%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier period. Sales of its EpiPen injection for allergic reactions declined due to increased competition.IBD'S TAKE: Mylan has an IBD Composite Rating of 46, meaning it performs in the bottom half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Get a look at better-rated stocks via IBD Stock Checkup.Mylan also cut its guidance for 2017 to $11.5 billion-$12.5 billion in sales and adjusted profit of $4.30-$4.70 a share. For 2018, it now sees adjusted earnings of ""at least $5.40,"" down from earlier views for $6. The new target would be 20% above 2017 expectations, at the midpoint.""Given the region's ongoing challenges and uncertain U.S. regulatory environment, we have elected to defer all major U.S. launches from our full-year 2017 financial guidance to 2018, including generic Advair and Copaxone,"" Mylan said in a news release.Advair is used to prevent asthma attacks and flare-ups of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It's branded by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), but Mylan and others are working on generic versions of it. In May, the Food and Drug Administration delayed Mylan's application for the drug.Mylan and others are also working on a generic version of Teva's multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone, which lost four key patents earlier in the year.The Medicines Company (MDCO) popped despite lagging second-quarter revenue, on losses that beat expectations and promising clinical updates, including an LDL cholesterol-lowering drug that could rival Amgen (AMGN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY).Medicines Co. noted during the second quarter that it came to agreements with regulators in the U.S. and Europe over its drug, inclisiran, as a cholesterol-buster. In total, it expects to enroll 3,400 patients in a Phase 3 trial designed to support the submission of applications for its approval.Inclisiran is what's known as a PCSK9 synthesis inhibitor, which has a slightly different mechanism than PSCK9 inhibitors from Amgen and Regeneron/Sanofi. Medicines Co. is also working on a study of 14,000 patients to determine whether there's a cardiovascular benefit from inclisiran.For its second quarter ended June 30, Medicines Co. reported $18.7 million in sales, down 66%. That missed the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $31 million in revenue.Adjusted losses of $1.02 per share widened from a 69-cent loss in the year-earlier period.

103,REGN,"Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) reported quarterly metrics that lagged views late Wednesday, but kept its 2017 guidance and announced its plan to file an application for a key drug before the end of the year.XIn after-hours trading on the stock market today, Alnylam lifted a fraction, near 80.70, after ending the regular session down 1.1%, at 80.52. Shares have been forming a flat base with a buy point at 87.02 since late June.For its second quarter ended June 30, Alnylam's revenue spiked 83% to $15.9 million, but missed analyst views for $22 million. Losses of $1.34 per share widened from a $1.05 per-share loss in the year-earlier period, and missed the consensus for losses of $1.18 a share.But 2017 ""is shaping up to be a pivotal year for Alnylam,"" Chief Executive John Maraganore said in a statement.In the next few weeks, Alnylam plans to announce top-line results of a Phase 3 study of its a drug called patisiran. Patisiran is being developed as a treatment for hereditary ATTR amyloidosis, a rare condition in which abnormal proteins build up on multiple organs, damaging and impeding them.If positive, the results will support Alnylam filing an application with the FDA for patisiran before the end of the year and its launch in mid-2018, assuming approval, Alnylam said in a news release.IBD'S TAKE: Alnylam has an IBD Composite Rating of 71 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms seven in 10 of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still lags IBD's Biotech leader, Celgene, with a CR of 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top-rated biotechs.Hemophilia drug fitusiran recently began a Phase 3 trial. Before year's end, Alnylam plans to begin a Phase 3 trial for givosiran in acute hepatic porphyrias, a series of disorders involving the buildup of chemicals in the body.With The Medicines Company (MDCO), Alnylam is also working on inclisiran, a drug to combat high LDL cholesterol. If approved, inclisiran could rival similar drugs from Amgen (AMGN) and a product jointly developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY).Alnylam maintained its guidance to end 2017 with more than $1 billion in cash, equivalents and fixed marketable securities, including $150 million in restricted investments.RELATED:Could Alnylam Have An Edge On This Smaller Biotech In Rare Disease?Are Gilead's Fortunes About To Change — Without An Acquisition?Biotechs Gained $1.7 Billion Last Week — Can They Keep It Going?

104,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) dove to a seven-week low Thursday as light revenue from eczema drug Dupixent weighed on the stock despite a broader second-quarter beat-and-raise.XThe Dupixent lag should have been baked in, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said. Late Monday, partner Sanofi (SNY) reported lighter-than-expected sales of Dupixent for the second quarter. Regeneron crashed 7.2% over two days after Sanofi's report.But shares continued to fall Thursday. On the stock market today, Regeneron toppled 2% to 467.11, after earlier falling as low as 463.30, a low last seen June 19. Sanofi, on the other hand, lifted 0.4% to 47.68.For the quarter ended June 30, Regeneron reported $1.47 billion in sales, topping the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $1.36 billion and growing 21%. Adjusted income advanced 48% to $4.17 per share, beating the $3.18 view.Sales of Eylea in the U.S. grew 11% year over year to $919 million, easily topping analysts' model for $878 million, Porges wrote in a note to clients. Outside the U.S., Eylea sales of $542 million narrowly missed the consensus view for $548 million.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts had tapped Regeneron as among the most likely to beat earnings expectations. Head to IBD's Technology page for other second-quarter biotech predictions.In the period, cholesterol drug Praluent nearly doubled to $46 million, which topped the consensus for $42 million, Porges said. Praluent is facing a patent battle with Amgen's (AMGN) Repatha. Both belong to a class of drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors.Dupixent sales of $29 million were in line with the consensus, though lagged Porges' model for $33 million. Earlier in the week, Sanofi reported about $30.8 million in Dupixent sales, which missed most estimates.Regeneron also noted its contract with Sanofi won't be renewed come 2018. Under the agreement, Regeneron and Sanofi have developed six drugs including Praluent, Dupixent and Kevzara, a rheumatoid arthritis drug approved this year. The companies will continue to develop and commercialize those drugs together after the agreement expires.Regeneron also boosted its 2017 guidance to 10% growth in U.S. sales of Eylea vs. earlier views for single-digit percentage growth. Regeneron now expects Sanofi to reimburse it by $370 million to $400 million. It also predicts a lower tax rate at 27% to 31% vs. its prior model for 32% to 38%.RELATED:Why Sanofi Earnings Spooked Regeneron Shares To A 6-Week LowTeva Pharmaceutical Misses On Q2 Earnings, Cuts Guidance; Stock DivesAllergan Boosts 2017 Outlook After Beating Q2 ForecastsWhy Clovis, Regeneron Are Leading A Biotech Deluge TodayThis Small Biotech Launched To A 9-Month High Today — Here's Way

105,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) tanked to a six-week low Tuesday in the wake of its partner Sanofi (SNY) reporting lagging sales of Dupixent — spooking investors who worry that prescriptions of the eczema drug are slowing.XOn the stock market today, Regeneron dove 4% to 472. Shares traded well below their 50-day moving average and fell below a flat base that began forming in late June with a 543.65 buy point.Regeneron is set to report its second-quarter earnings early Thursday. Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expect it to report adjusted income of $3.18 per share on $1.36 billion in sales. But Sanofi's second-quarter report could be telling about several key drugs.Sanofi reported about $30.6 million in Dupixent sales, which missed views of $38.8 million, according to Reuters. Sell-side analysts saw $36 million but buy-side analysts modeled $40 million to $50 million, Credit Suisse analyst Althea Young said.""Early signs of Dupixent's launch are encouraging in our view, but (the) key question will be if patient growth continues or whether there was a bolus upfront,"" she wrote in a note to clients.Physicians have written about 13,000 Dupixent prescriptions thus far, which should result in $92 million per quarter or $370 million for a full year. Young sees that number growing to 16,000 prescriptions by the end of the third quarter, and 20,000 by year's end.On the call, Sanofi said 5,100 prescribers out of 7,000 targeted by the two companies have written prescriptions for Dupixent. The lion's share of those prescriptions have been for the most severe patients, meaning there's still room to grow.""The key question over the coming months remains what will drive prescribers to put more patients on the drug,"" she wrote. ""It could be getting more comfort with reimbursement or using the drug.""IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs have been on a hot streak recently and are now ranked fifth out of 197 groups tracked by IBD, slipping a spot from last week. Mergers and acquisitions could send them higher, says one industry observer. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a breakdown.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges, on the other hand, says the Dupixent launch is ""indeed flattening."" Still, there are 300,000 U.S. patients with moderate to severe eczema, meaning Dupixent hasn't yet hit its ceiling. Sanofi also plans to launch Dupixent in Germany this year.Regeneron and Sanofi are also looking at Dupixent in asthma. Sanofi said it expects the final results of the asthma Phase 3 trial in the near future.Looking at the bigger picture, Regeneron stands a chance of narrowing the valuation gap with Sanofi over the coming years. The duo are ""joined at the hip"" in a partnership featuring Regeneron's research and development, and Sanofi's wallet.Sanofi has said it remains ""very, very committed to make Praluent a success."" Praluent is a PCSK9 inhibitor aimed at lowering ""bad"" cholesterol. But it's currently locked in a patent battle with Amgen (AMGN), which also has a PSCK9 inhibitor known as Repatha.The two are also finishing up a registration trial for a PD-1 inhibitor in a form of skin cancer, amid plans to file with the Food and Drug Administration early next year. The drug could possibly rival similar cancer medicines from Dow's Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).Regeneron and Sanofi are also looking at their PD-1 inhibitor in advanced lung cancer and in a second form of skin cancer. The duo also plans to combine their PD-1 inhibitor with another drug in several trials.RELATED:Why Clovis, Regeneron Are Leading A Biotech Deluge TodayHow AstraZeneca Failed Not Once — But Twice — In Cancer DrugsDow's Merck Crushed Keytruda Sales Views By $68 Million

108,REGN,"Biotech stocks reversed course Friday after a five-day run to a 17-month high with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) among those losing the most, though Cara Therapeutics (CARA) defied the trend.XOn the stock market today, Bluebird Bio stock toppled 5.5% to 112, with shares of Regeneron down 1.75 to517.33. But close off intraday lows and closed the week with strong gains.Cara stock, though, led the sector among biotechs trading above 10. The stock lifted 13.6% 22.59, after Cara won breakthrough designation for a drug to treat itching in chronic kidney disease patients.But the group sell-off didn't last long. IBD's 432-company Biotech industry group dipped intraday, but then closed up nearly 1%. That's after running up 9.3% since June 15. Analysts credited the rally to subsiding concerns that President Trump would tackle drug prices. One analyst sees another 15% potential upside for the sector.Bluebird stock plunged after it unveiled early results for its drug called LentiGlobin in patients with a pair of blood disorders characterized by either low production of or abnormal hemoglobin.One patient with reduced hemoglobin was able to discontinue blood transfusions a month after treatment with LentiGlobin, Bluebird said. In a separate study, patients with these blood disorders proved stable through 3.5 years of follow-up.It's exciting to see a patient ""who has gone from years of regular (blood) transfusions to 3.5 years without a single blood transfusion after a one-time treatment with LentiGlobin gene therapy,"" said Marina Cavazzana, an investigator on the study.IBD'S TAKE: The rally saw shares of Celgene and Regeneron break out, and helped Exelixis stock near a buy point. Head to IBD Industry Themes for the complete breakdown on how the sector benefited — and still could — from the rally.Regeneron's stock pitfall followed details of a royalty agreement with Novartis (NVS) on Thursday. Under a 2009 deal, Regeneron will receive a 4%-15% royalty on sales of Ilaris, an anti-inflammatory that had strong data this week in heart attack survivors.Cara stock, on the other hand, popped after it received breakthrough designation from the Food and Drug Administration for the drug known as CR845 in patients with chronic kidney disease who experience itching as a result of dialysis.The FDA denies breakthrough designation requests more often that it approves them, Janney analyst Ken Trbovich said in a research report.

109,REGN,"Cara Therapeutics (CARA) stock launched to a nearly two-year high Friday after its chronic liver disease drug grabbed breakthrough designation — beating the odds at the Food and Drug Administration.On the stock market today, Cara stock popped 13.6% to 22.59, after earlier rising as much as 18.5%, touching a high last seen in August 2015. Shares broke out of a cup-with-handle pattern Wednesday after hitting an 18.93 buy point.Only about one-third of all applications for breakthrough designation with the FDA are approved, Janney analyst Ken Trbovich said in a note to clients. Between July 9, 2012, and March 31, 2017, the FDA approved just 150 of 441 requests received.Cara's drug, known as intravenous CR845, received breakthrough designation to treat chronic liver disease patients who experience itching as a result of hemodialysis. Trbovich sees Cara's drug getting priority review now that it has achieved the new designation.Drugs under priority review are typically approved within six months vs. the typical 10-month review process.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts predicted a biotech surge with small caps and innovative techs leading the charge. Oncology-focused drugmakers like Kite Pharma were predicted for a run. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a closer look at why.Trbovich has a buy rating and 22 price target on Cara stock. On Friday, Cara shares defied a broad dive in the biotech sector which followed a five-day run-up on views that President Trump's pledge to reduce drug prices is merely ""lip service.""IBD's 432-company Biotech industry group rebounded from a morning retreat to climb nearly 1%.

123,REGN,"Wall Street is bullish on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (REGN) chances in selling an eczema treatment, but the ""comeback kid"" is seeing rival Amgen (AMGN) squeeze its opportunity in cholesterol medications, an analyst said Friday.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Regeneron stock dipped 1.2% to 429, its first loss in six trading days. Shares began forming a cup in November with a possible buy point at 453.06.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges classified Regeneron as the ""comeback kid"" and credited the firm with bringing growth back to the sector. He kept his outperform rating on Regeneron stock and raised his price target to 493 from 448.That followed Regeneron's early Thursday first-quarter report. Sales narrowly topped views at $1.32 billion and grew 10%. Adjusted income of $2.92 per share was up 22%, but lagged by 15 cents on higher-than-expected taxes.Eczema drug Dupixent saw a strong launch with 900 prescriptions written in the fourth full week and a nearly 50% increase in the number of prescribing physicians. Dupixent is the first injectable drug to treat eczema that is resistant to topical creams.Regeneron says the median time to filling written Dupixent prescriptions is approximately two weeks. This suggests the total filled prescription volume could grow substantially over the 600 that have been filled, according to health care tracker IMS.IBD'S TAKE: Having trouble navigating the volatile biotech sector? Porges and other analysts say it's a ""stock-pickers market."" Head to IBD's Technology page for some tips on picking better biotech stocks.Canaccord analyst John Newman upgraded Regeneron stock to a buy rating with a 484 price target, also noting enthusiastic Dupixent sentiment.He estimates 2017 sales of Dupixent in the U.S. will reach $148 million with non-U.S. sales hitting $67 million. That estimate includes only moderate-to-severe eczema suffers on immunosuppressants as the likely first candidates for Dupixent.Newman projects 20% share of the eczema at Dupixent's peak, or about $1.6 billion in sales.But, like Porges, he noted softness in other areas for Regeneron. Eylea sales in the U.S. were flat vs. the prior quarter, though grew 9% year over year to $1.34 billion. Still, that missed the consensus for $1.39 billion.""Eylea was a $3.2 billion elephant in the room on the Q1 call, missing consensus by $10 million, with only one question being asked about the drug,"" he wrote in a note to clients. ""Reaction from investors was relatively muted on the downside.""He added: ""However, given U.S. Eylea sales will constitute the vast majority of Regeneron revenues for at least the next one to two years, the revenue trajectory remains very important to watch.""And, Leerink's Porges notes, it looks like cholesterol-lowering drug Praluent lost quite a bit of share in the quarter. Regeneron reported $36 million in Praluent sales, missing the consensus by 39%.Regeneron and Sanofi (SNY), Praluent co-developers, are engaged in a patent battle with No. 1 biotech Amgen. A judge recently banned sales of Praluent, siding with Amgen, but stayed the ban pending an appeal.Several months after, Amgen unveiled the results of a 2.2-year study of its drug, Repatha. Over that time, Repatha was able to cut down on the risk of heart attack and stroke by lowering ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. Though it didn't trim the risk of cardiovascular death.The study has implications for other LDL cholesterol-lowering drugs — including Regeneron/Sanofi's Praluent and not-yet-approved drugs from The Medicines Company (MDCO) and Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR).But ""it appears that Regeneron and their partner Sanofi have lost significant share and possibly price to rival Amgen after the District Court decision and possibly associated with Amgen's positive (cardiovascular) outcomes data during the quarter,"" Porges said.RELATED:Regeneron Pops On 'Better-Than-Feared' Eye, Cholesterol Drug SalesDid Regeneron, Sanofi Just Launch A Blockbuster Drug?Amgen Trips Amid Rivals: Sales Miss By $100 Million, But Earnings Top

124,REGN,"If you're in the National Basketball Association playoffs, you want Steph Curry or LeBron James on your team. If you're managing a retirement account or taxable portfolio, why not tap into the Fidelity Investments' brain trust, which includes an army of analysts? Knowing cumulative stock moves in Fidelity's many mutual funds can help you choose your own buys and sells.Not all Fidelity funds make the same buys and sells, but it's instructive to see which leading stocks Fidelity overall bet more of its shareholders' money on the first quarter and where it lightened its weightings. Normally you'd have to track down and then sift through Securities and Exchange Commission filings by each of Fidelity's 358 stock and balanced funds. But CFRA, an independent research firm, has done that and crunched the numbers for you already.What CFRA found is that Fidelity's biggest sector weights were in information technology and consumer discretionary. By the end of Q1, Fidelity had nearly 27% of its shareholders' money at work in tech. It had more than 15% of its shareholders cash placed in consumer discretionary stocks.""Heading into 2017, economically sensitive information technology stocks were poised to benefit from a risk-on environment,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA's director of ETF and mutual fund research. ""Further, Fidelity offers a number of growth-oriented strategies that tend to favor tech stocks.""Among Fidelity's 75 largest stock positions across all of its stock and balanced portfolios, PayPal (PYPL) and Qualcomm (QCOM) were tech-sector stocks in which the Fidelity complex increased its Q1 share-count percentage the most.Fidelity added 6.4 million shares of PayPal, for a 16.8% increase. It added 4.3 million shares of Qualcomm, for an 8.3% hike.Fidelity's $110.7 billion Contrafund (FCNTX) — the firm's largest stock mutual fund — and $15.5 billion Magellan (FMAGX) were among the funds investing in PayPal as of their latest disclosures.Fidelity's $14.8 billion OTC (FOCPX) and $30.5 billion Balanced (FBALX) funds were holders of Qualcomm.Still, Fidelity made an even bigger percentage increase in its share count in LyondellBasell Industries (LYB). Adding 5.2 million shares across its funds, Fidelity's share count jumped nearly 31%.The Netherlands-based company makes chemicals and polymers that are used packaging, home furnishings and automotive components. A materials manufacturer like that stands to benefit from any global expansion in GDP, such as the one that appears to be underway.Fidelity's Magellan, Balanced and OTC funds were investors in LyondellBasell.Drugmaker Amgen (AMGN) had the third-largest Q1 percentage boost in share count by Fidelity funds. The 2.7 million share boost was a 9.9% increase.Amgen is a leading seller of LDL cholesterol-battling drugs. A judge recently sided with Amgen in a patent lawsuit against Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY). The ruling is under appeal.Fidelity's $9.4 billion Select Biotechnology (FBIOX) and $21 billion Blue Chip Growth (FBGRX) funds were Amgen holders.Fidelity's fourth-largest share-count percentage hike was for Charter Communications (CHTR). Fidelity's increase of nearly 800,000 shares was a 9.8% boost.Charter is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Telecom Services-Integrated industry group. Earnings per share rose 131% in the latest quarter on a 302% rise in sales. Its three-year sales growth rate is 54%.IBD'S TAKE: See how Charter's additional, easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against that of rivals at IBD's Stock Checkup.Fidelity's $7.4 billion Dividend Growth (FDGFX) and $1.6 billion Trend funds were Charter investors.Fidelity's build up of Qualcomm shares was the fund family's fifth-biggest increase. Its boosts in Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) were its next two largest percentage increases.Fidelity boosted its share count in Citigroup by 5.9 million shares, a 7.5% increase. Its step up of about 550,000 shares in Goldman Sachs was also a 7.5% increase.RELATED:Are Fidelity's Recent Stocks Buys And Sells Retirement Account Hot Sauce?P-s-s-st!

125,REGN,"Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi's (SNY) eczema drug Dupixent outstripped psoriasis drugs from rival companies in fourth-week prescriptions, an analyst wrote Monday, suggesting that 2017 consensus views for the drug are ""beatable.""On Friday, Sanofi said on its earnings call that 2,500 prescriptions had been written by 1,200 physicians in Dupixent's first month on the market. Health care tracker IMS suggests 200 prescriptions were filled in the fourth week after Dupixent's launch.By comparison, 52-60 prescriptions of psoriasis drugs Novartis's (NVS) Cosentyx and Taltz from Eli Lilly (LLY) had been written at this point following their launches. Celgene's (CELG) Otezla had 101 scripts.""The most successful of those drugs has been Otezla, and the fourth week of the Dupixent launch is double the prescription volume for Otezla,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients. He also noted two recent successful launches of cholesterol-lowering drugs Amgen's (AMGN) Repatha and Regeneron/Sanofi's Praluent saw 72-80 prescriptions.Otezla's estimated monthly net price over that period was $1,600 which is 40% below the likely net price of Dupixent, Porges wrote. Adjusting for only the higher price, Dupixent's 2017 sales would be $115 million based on Otezla's sales record.""However, if Dupixent indeed continues to see double the prescription volume of Otezla, the 2017 revenue could be closer to $230 million, or a 68% beat compared to consensus,"" he said. Though it's early post-launch, ""the information thus far is very encouraging.""IBD'S TAKE: How do you survive investing in a market where a relatively unheard of company like Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) can launch nearly 200% in mere months? It's all a matter of identifying the right catalysts, analysts say. Head to IBD's Technology page for more.Based on Sanofi's disclosure of 2,500 written Dupixent prescriptions in the first month, Porges models a 25% fill rate in April growing to a 45% fill rate by December as more payers open up access. That leads to potentially 300 prescriptions filled in the fifth week.This is ""not unreasonable given the prior week-over-week growth of 93 prescriptions,"" Porges said.Analysts broadly model $20 million in Dupixent sales for the second quarter, $48 million in the third, $70 million in the fourth and $137 million for 2017. Porges sees $206 million in Dupixent sales for 2017 growing to $1.13 billion and $3 billion in 2018 and 2019.Comparatively, Otezla and Cosentyx brought in $103 million and $210 million in this first four quarters on the market.""By comparison, Dupixent is more expensive than Otezla, but significantly cheaper than Cosentyx, and is entering a much less competitive category with more untreated patients and what appears to be faster access to major (pharmacy benefit manager) formularies,"" he wrote.Porges reiterated his outperform rating and 448 price target on Regeneron stock. On the stock market today, Regeneron stock was up 2% to 396.17. Sanofi stock fell 0.1% to 47.26.RELATED:Amgen Trumps Regeneron, Sanofi In Post-Trial Cholesterol Drug ScriptsAmgen Payer Pushback Likely To Sting Amid Battle With Regeneron, SanofiRegeneron, Sanofi Get Approval For Eczema Drug Priced At $37,000

126,REGN,"How do you get a handle on the biotech market when an unknown stock like Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) — up nearly 200% since January — outperforms the likes of the industry's top name, Amgen (AMGN)?Sure, Esperion has had some breakthroughs in cholesterol medication. But Amgen recently had its own moment with one of its cholesterol drugs, proving that decreasing ""bad"" LDL cholesterol also cuts the risk of heart attack and stroke. Still, Amgen isn't getting the respect that smaller biotech players are getting, up a comparatively paltry 11% this year.Don't get discouraged, though, analysts say. Just because Amgen isn't getting a lot of love, it doesn't mean other biotech stocks are slouches. It's really a question of navigating what can be a complex sector.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says biotechs have done well since the election, though the stocks are subject to the whims of political debate over drug pricing and health care.""We're worried about Donald Trump and health care reform ... we're worried about FDA reform and now we're worried about drug-pricing regulations,"" he said. ""And it just doesn't seem as though the accumulated worries are going to go away in a hurry.""The overall group, though, looks strong. It's now ranked No. 10 out of 197 groups tracked, and four weeks ago it was ranked No. 5.IBD'S TAKE: Among drugmakers, Allergan is sweeping the medical-aesthetics market. But Hologic wants to play. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a breakdown on that battle.Porges and Mizuho analyst Salim Syed call it a ""stock-pickers market."" Some biotechs are bound to do well in 2017 with a number of catalysts still ahead of them, while others are more likely to struggle with macroeconomics and politics.""There are still some pressures that investors need to be cognitive of, like drug pricing,"" Syed told IBD. ""Some folks thought that was a presidential platform topic, but it keeps coming up now in the postelection.""IBD's 425-company Biomed/Biotech industry group is up 12% for the year. Major exchange traded funds iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (IBB) and the SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) are up 12% and 20%, respectively.The top five biotechs include Amgen, Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN). Each has been in the news in 2017, but none on stock price. Amgen has gained the most at 11% with Gilead lagging, down 6% since January.Syed has buy ratings on Amgen, Celgene and Gilead stocks and a neutral rating on Biogen stock.But the smaller players and potential takeout candidates like Incyte (INCY) and Tesaro (TSRO) have seen big gains on Wall Street. Tesaro is likely to remain a stand-alone company, though, after grabbing FDA approval for ovarian cancer drug, Zejula. Its stock rose as much as 43% through mid-February but is now up only 3% for the year.Incyte, on the other hand, has tacked on 24% since January on rumors that No. 2 biotech Gilead could be looking to acquire it. Incyte would open Gilead up to the oncology world as its hepatitis C franchise struggles amid high cure rates.""Once again, we're starting the year with the best-performing stocks being those that were cheapest and more of takeout candidates,"" Porges told IBD. ""So (making predictions has) definitely been somewhat challenging.""Earlier this month, Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) stock hit an 11-year high on strong data for a pain pill that could be an alternative to potentially addictive Oxycodone. Nektar stock catapulted 43% in a single day. Shares extended 25% from a cup-with-handle formation in late March, but have since given back 20% of those gains. The stock remains up 58% for the year.Other big stock earners include Kite Pharma (KITE) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE), both of which are working on drugs that belong to a class called CAR T-cell therapies. These drugs engineer patients' immune cells to treat cancer. Kite stock is up a whopping 80%, leading a 42% rise in Bluebird stock.And as Esperion rocketed on Amgen's heart study, so too did The Medicines Company (MDCO). Shares are up 45% since January. Porges lists Medicines Co. as a stock to watch, noting its ""spectacular returns.""""If you have the right stock and the right set of events, then you can still generate incredibly attractive returns and that's the excitement of biotech,"" Porges said. ""These are companies that are approaching critical readouts of ongoing development programs where investors think there's a reasonable chance a critical trial or a critical milestone turns out positively.""Mizuho's Syed suggests looking at individual stocks and equities, rather than hoping for a broad biotech resurgence. He sees a ""good number of catalysts"" in 2017 for the market, but notes the drug-pricing debate is likely to still weigh on the market.President Trump has keyed in on the drug-pricing debate and, though limited on details, says he has plans for a competitive-based system that would bring down the prices of drugs. Trump's pick to run the FDA, Scott Gottlieb, has said drug-pricing needs to be more transparent.As that struggle unfolds, Porges laid out some rules for picking biotech stocks likely to have better returns.""You want to be in growth companies early in their life cycle treating very serious illnesses,"" he said. ""And if you follow those three rules, you are generally going to end up with a portfolio that's going to perform better than the average, better than the index, better than the benchmarks.""Under those rules, Porges says Epizyme (EPZM), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) are interesting. Epizyme stock is up 44% since January, having topped a 12.70 buy point out of a cup-with-handle formation in early February. Vertex stock has gained 23% this year.Alexion stock is actually down 3% year to date, but the stock fits the bill using Porges' rules. The rare-disease company is working on drugs to treat disorders of the central nervous system, blood diseases and genetic disorders.The worst thing to do in biotech investing is to sell just because a stock is up, Porges said. And don't hesitate to buy a stock for the same reason.""One of the axioms of investing in biotech is always you never want to say, 'I'm not going to buy the stock because it's up,' because this is an industry where you can routinely see five-to-tenfold increases in value over the cycle of the emergence of a product,"" he said.""So often we see a stock where investors say, 'It's up 50%, but it's only gone from a $500 million market cap to a $750 million market cap,' which in the scheme of things is pretty small,"" he said. ""If you have a real drug, you're going to be a $5 billion or $6 billion company.""RELATED:Esperion And Medicines Co.

127,REGN,"Major stock indexes were listless in late-afternoon trading Thursday, with the Dow Jones industrial average showing a small gain of less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both fell modestly, off 0.2%.XIn the stock market today, several earnings reports sparked bullish gaps up in price. Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT) vaulted over a 64.72 entry but pulled back a bit. Shares still soared 19% to 64.41. The telecom-infrastructure firm reported its fifth straight quarter of 20%-plus sales growth.IBD 50 component Stamps.com (STMP), meanwhile, gapped up and rose 31% to 198.60. After a breakout over a 136.10 buy point, the do-it-yourself postage firm was holding above the 50-day moving average ahead of earnings, but the stock is extended in price now. According to Nasdaq.com, about 4 million shares were held short as of July 14, or about 27% of the total float, so it's a good bet that part of today's surge is due to short covering.Tesla (TSLA) gapped above its 50-day moving average, rising nearly 7% to 347.46. Second-quarter sales more than doubled to $2.79 billion, above the consensus estimate of around $2.5 billion. By the end of this year, Tesla hopes to be building 5,000 Model 3 sedans a week and 10,000 by the end of 2018.Video game maker Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) surged past an 80.64 buy point after earnings and sales blew past analysts' estimates. Shares jumped 11% to 88.37.Tableau Software (DATA) gapped out of a flat base with a 67.19 buy point. Shares gained 8% to 69.37. While its technical picture is strong, fundamentals are a bit hazy after the company reported its second straight quarter of decelerating sales growth.It was a different story at biotech Regeneron (REGN) despite solid earnings and raised guidance.

128,REGN,"Stocks opened in tightly mixed trade and quickly faded to narrow losses Thursday, despite strong early moves by Wal-Mart (WMT) and Tesla (TSLA).XThe Dow Jones industrial average opened a fraction higher, then fell back to just below its breakeven line, fighting to hold above the 22,000 level that the index topped for the first time on Wednesday. The S&P 500 traded down 0.1% as drug distribution giant AmerisourceBergen (ABC) and CenturyLink (CTL) dropped more than 5% apiece after weak Q2 reports.The Nasdaq Composite notched an incremental decline, as Apple (AAPL) backed off 0.3% after its 5% breakout surge on Wednesday, and as all four FANG stocks posted early losses, led by Netflix's (NFLX) 0.6% slip.On the Dow, Wal-Mart and UnitedHealth (UNH) led the index. Wal-Mart jumped 1.1% at the open. UnitedHealth rose 1%. Caterpillar (CAT) opened up 0.3%, boosted by an upgrade to neutral, from underweight, by Atlantic Equities.Tesla shares racked up a 7% gain as the company's late-Wednesday report showed a smaller-than-forecast loss and above-forecast revenue growth. Tesla shares are consolidating and finding resistance at their 10-week moving average, but tight closes across the past three weeks suggest institutional support as the stock forms a possible floor to its basing effort.Online postage innovator Stamps.com (STMP) was an early hero, up 31% after reporting a solid beat, with second-quarter earnings up 61% and revenue soaring 38%, as management also lifted its full-year earnings and revenue guidance to above consensus views. The gap up gain left the IBD 50 stock extended after its first test of 10-week support since a breakout in late May.Another IBD 50 name, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), tacked on a 1% gain after reporting late Wednesday its second-quarter earnings swept past analyst targets. Revenue also topped views and management's sales guidance for Regeneron's Eyelea drug was better than expected.  The stock is working on the sixth week of a flat base, offering two buy points: at 526.22 and 543.65.Hotel operator Wyndham Worldwide (WYN) booked an early 3% gain. Single-digit growth in second-quarter revenue and earnings bested analyst estimates, and the company made official plans to split into two publicly traded entities. Wyndham shares were trading just below a 105.75 buy point in a five-week flat base.Aetna (AET) powered up 3% on strong second-quarter results, lifting shares easily to a new high.On the injured list, 3D Systems (DDD) fell 16% and Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) skidded 19% lower after weak second-quarter reports.Early jobs data was positive, with employers announcing the layoffs of 28,307 workers in July, down 9% from June and the smallest count since November, according to the monthly jobs report from consultant Challenger, Gray & Christmas. U.S. employers also announced 88,000 hirings, the best July total on record.First-time unemployment claims eased to 240,000 in the week ended July 29, the Labor Department reported. That was down 2% from the prior week's claims and below consensus views for 244,000 new applications. Claims have remained below 300,000 — generally considered the level showing a healthy jobs market — for 126 weeks.At 9:45 a.m. ET, IHS Markit delivers its service sector estimates for July. June factory orders numbers from the Commerce Department and the July services index from the Institute of Supply Management are due out at 10 a.m. ET.Overseas, markets across Asia booked broad losses Thursday with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo each falling 0.3%. In Europe, major indexes remained widely mixed in afternoon trade. London's FTSE 100 led with a 0.6% gain after the Bank of England elected to hold interest rates unchanged and trim its growth forecasts for the next two years.

129,REGN,"The major market indexes moved lower in early trading Thursday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&P 500 declined 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively, while the Dow Jones industrial average dipped less than 0.1%.XAmong the Dow industrials, Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) reclaimed an 80.58 cup-shaped base entry, rising 0.5% in early trade ahead of next week's earnings release.On the downside, chip giant Intel (INTC) dropped over 1% to give back some this week's gains that had lifted the stock back above its 200-day moving average line.Late Wednesday, Tesla (TSLA) exceeded its Q2 earnings forecasts with its revenues more than doubling to $2.79 billion. Shares — which had been languishing under their 50-day line — raced ahead over 5% as they attempted to reclaim that key level. The electric automaker is building the right side of a potential base, but no clear entry is evident.Among other companies reporting earnings, payment processor Square (SQ) fell 6% despite topping Q2 expectations and raising its full-year outlook. The stock has had a tremendous move so far in 2017 — up more than 50% from a 18.27 flat-base buy point at last week's highs. The stock is approaching its 50-day line.Video game makers were showing solid action in the stock market today. Take-Two Interactive Software's (TTWO) report solid Q2 earnings, sparking a 9% rally in shares. The stock jumped back above an 80.64 cup-base entry.Competitors Electronic Arts (EA) and Activision (ATVI) — which reports its own earnings after the bell Thursday — advanced 1.1% and 1.6%, respectively.Among leading biotechs, Regeneron's (REGN) Q2 earnings beat sent its shares surging over 4% initially before turning red, falling 0.5%. The stock had seen heavy selling pressure this week heading into the release, down over 6% through Wednesday's session.Meanwhile, recent spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) also beat the Street's targets Wednesday, sending shares 1.8% higher. The stock has moved back out of buy range from a 58.98 cup-with-handle buy point.Within the IBD 50, Stamps.com (STMP) was the clear winner, soaring almost 28% after beating Q2 top- and bottom-line estimates. The company also raised its full-year profit outlook.On the downside, Masimo (MASI) plunged over 9% despite topping the Street's Q2 profit and revenue forecasts. Shares had been building a cup with handle — viewed on the daily chart — with a 99.60 entry, but never broke out. Instead, the stock broke its 50-day line on huge volume.RELATED:Tesla Second-Quarter Results Beat As Model 3 Production RampsApple Set To Soar Into Buy Zone As CEO Teases PlansDow Jones industrial average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisBiotech Stocks To Watch And Pharma Industry News

130,REGN,"U.S. stock indexes gripped slender gains midday Thursday, as strength in biotechs offset weakness in chip stocks. Celgene (CELG) was among the leading big-cap biotechs that added gains after a recent breakout.The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average each rose between 0.1% and 0.2% at 12 p.m. ET. The small cap Russell 2000 added just over 0.2%. Volume in the stock market at midday was running higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq.The biotech industry group was on track for a fifth consecutive daily gain. Action within the group was bullish.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) pushed 3% higher. The stock is now 19% above a 453.06 buy point. Celgene headed toward its ninth gain in 10 sessions. The stock added almost 1% midday Thursday after clearing a 127.74 buy point Wednesday. The 5% buy zone is capped at 133.81.Bioverativ (BIVV) , a February initial public offering and a new member of Leaderboard, slowed to a 0.1% gain after breaking out Monday. The stock remains in the 5% buy zone from a 58.98 buy point.Bioverativ, Regeneron and Celgene have EPS Ratings of 93, 94 and 98 respectively, which means they are growing earnings faster than 93%, 94% and 98% of the entire IBD database of publicly traded companies. Some biotechs hustling higher in the past few days are still posting annual losses. While investing in a company that is losing money is not prudent, the action points to conviction for the group.Going into Thursday's market, the biotech group was No. 23 of 197 groups. Three weeks ago, biotechs were No. 45.Meanwhile, the chip designer, chipmaker and chip equipment maker groups were down moderately.Oil stocks were rebounding as West Texas intermediate crude oil popped 1.3%. The price of crude oil recently touched 10-month lows.Blue chips were about evenly split between up for the day and down for the day. Dow Jones industrial average component Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) dropped 1%, while UnitedHealth (UNH) rose about 1.5% ahead of news that the U.S. Senate is set to unveil a new plan to reform the Affordable Care Act.In the IBD 50, a proxy for leading stocks, medical software provider Medidata Solutions (MDSO) led with a 4.5% thrust.

131,REGN,"The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 index and Dow industrials all rose slightly Thursday, with more stocks setting up new possible entries within sound bases. Here are six big-cap stocks that are within 1% of buy points: Amgen (AMGN), General Motors (GM), Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), ASML (ASML) and PNC Financial Services (PNC).XGeneral Motors has a $54 billion market cap, and that's the smallest of the six, with Visa No. 1 at $200 billion. Amgen, GM, Mastercard and ASML all edged past entry points intraday, but closed beneath them.The market uptrend is under pressure, with earnings season kicking into high gear. So investors should be especially cautious about taking on new positions now.Amgen rose 1% to 175.04 in Thursday stock market trading. The biotech's stock rose as high as 176.20, briefly passing a 175.55 buy point in a cup-with-handle base, but couldn't hold that level. Volume was below normal, though the highest in three weeks.Amgen hasn't been a market leader lately. Its relative strength line is well off recent highs, as Amgen lags the S&P 500 index. And several other biotechs, including Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN), have already broken out.General Motors rose as high as 36.12 Thursday afternoon, briefly passing a 36.10 cup-with-handle entry. GM settled with a 1% gain at 35.86 in slightly above-average volume. Meanwhile, Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) cleared buy points Thursday, following a move by Ferrari (RACE) on Wednesday.General Motors' RS line has been lagging. Meanwhile, U.S. auto sales have peaked, though a shift to SUV and truck purchases is supporting profits.Visa climbed to 96.65 intraday, a new all-time high, but not quite triggering the 96.70 buy point from a flat base. Visa reversed to closed down 0.25% at 95.94.Mastercard edged up 19 cents to 125.47, rising intraday to 126.40, briefly topping the 126.29 flat-base entry.Volume was below average for both Visa and Mastercard, but their RS lines are near highs, reflecting their strong performance and short consolidations.However, several other payment stocks have broken out this week, including PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ).Visa has earnings next week, along with a few other card firms such as American Express (AXP), which is still in range from a June breakout.Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial could provide insight into credit card trends Friday with their second-quarter earnings reports and conference calls.The chip-equipment giant fell 0.1% to 136.85. But for the second straight day ASML inched past a 137.37 buy point in a flat base going back nearly two months. ASML's RS line is near highs, a good sign.ASML will report quarterly earnings next week.PNC Financial is a superregional bank. It may be overshadowed by the money center banks JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, but PNC is expected to deliver a 10% EPS gain, while its larger rivals deliver essentially flat profit. PNC rose 0.1% to 127.38, as it builds toward a 128.35 entry in a shallow cup-with-handle base.JPMorgan is still in range from a double-bottom base, while Citigroup is extended.

132,REGN,"X The Nasdaq composite on Wednesday deflected yet another pounding in crude oil futures and related companies in the stock market, moving moderately higher as the Dow Jones industrial average harbored light losses late in Wall Street's regular session.The Nasdaq composite, up 0.7% at around 3:45 p.m. New York time, is stretching its year-to-date lead over the S&P 500 (down fractionally Wednesday) and the Dow Jones industrials (down 0.2%) despite showing five distribution days over the past 25 sessions. Volume on Wednesday is running higher on the NYSE vs. the same time Tuesday and lower on the Nasdaq.IBD's Big Picture column tracks heavy institutional selling in the form of distribution days, as witnessed in the Nasdaq on Tuesday (down 0.8%, higher volume than on Monday); a sudden rash of big declines in heavier volume than the prior session is enough to kill a bull market.The Nasdaq is up nearly 16% since Jan. 1, towering over the S&P 500's 8.8% advance. The Dow Jones industrial average is also lagging after a 13.4% gain in 2016, up 8.3% so far this year.Buying in the biotech and software sectors continued unabated in the aftermath of solid quarterly results from the likes of Adobe Systems (ADBE) (extended after a breakout at 111.19 in January) and Red Hat (RHT) (also extended from an 81.24 early entry in a long, choppy first-stage base).In the biotech group, which jumped to No. 31 among IBD's 197 industry groups in terms of six-month relative price performance, Celgene (CELG), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) all pumped more than 5% higher in heavy turnover, showing the kind of action seen by iPhone giant Apple (AAPL) during its big runs in the mid-2000s and early part of the 2010s.Celgene has a market value of $103 billion, Regeneron is at $55 billion, and Vertex at $33 billion, vs. $760 billion for the iPhone, iPad and MacBook maker.When a stock breaks out, it tends to already be close to 52-week or all-time highs, already be trading above the 50- and 200-day moving averages, show a tremendous increase in share volume, and show strong finishes during its up sessions in prices.That's definitely the case with the three biomedical names mentioned above. All three are highly profitable developers of novel therapies to address difficult diseases and chronic conditions.Celgene ran 5% higher to 132.38 and powered past a 127.74 cup-base buy point in volume that is currently triple usual levels. The stock's 50-day average volume is 3.7 million shares. That cup could be seen as part of a long saucer base that goes all the way back to its July 2015 peak of 140.72.Notice on a weekly chart how Celgene had broken out of a three-month saucer pattern at 129.16 in July 2015, but did a hairpin curve lower and undercut the low of that base. Such action was a healthy shakeout of uncommitted investors and reset the base count back to zero. The Street sees first-quarter profit at the Summit, N.J., firm rising 24% to $1.78 a share. Celgene has posted EPS increases of 17%, 23%, 17%, 28%, 36% and 27% in the prior six quarters.Celgene sports an outstanding 98 Composite Rating and a 98 EPS Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. Watch to see if its 68 Relative Price Strength score improves in the near term.Regeneron (97 Composite Rating, 94 EPS Rating) is extended from a first-stage bottoming-base entry at 453.06 as shares have soared more than 13% so far this week to 521.71. However, notice on a weekly chart how the stock may run into some upside resistance in the 550 to 590 price level.Vertex (98 Composite, 79 EPS) surged 5% to 133.30 in fast turnover and is moving further past a recent handle on a long base, giving a solid entry at 122.06 (10 cents above the May 2 intraday high). In the handle, the stock sloped lower along the intraday lows and corrected no more than 7%.Back to Apple, the megacap tech is showing it still may have the wherewithal to recover from a sharp sell-off in the prior two weeks that triggered two key sell signals (read this Stock Market Today column to learn more about the exact sell rules).Apple gained around 0.6% to 145.59. Volume is light, but the stock is limiting its drop below the 50-day moving average to around 2%.Apple's Relative Price Strength Rating remains strong for now at 85, much better than the lowly 59 seen at the start of the year. However, keep in mind that the RS Rating covers 12 months' worth of price action vs. the rest of the market. Extra weight is given to the most recent three months' worth of action.There are plenty of reasons for long-term holders with a thick profit cushion to keep holding: 1) Apple is still well above its long-term 200-day moving average; 2) earnings picture is improving, with FY 2017 profit seen up 8% and FY 2018 profit up 18%; revenue growth in Apple's services unit is currently at solid double-digit pace; and 4) the likelihood of a major iPhone replacement cycle beginning in the fourth quarter of the current calendar year is very high.IBD's TAKE: One way to track emerging industry sector rotation within the market is to watch changes in the IBD 50.

133,REGN,"American Airlines (AAL) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) were upgraded Tuesday, while Regeneron (REGN) was downgraded and Rockwell Collins (COL) had its price target raised.American Airlines was upgraded to overweight from neutral and had its price target was raised to 61 from 52 at JPMorgan. The analysts also upgraded Spirit Airlines to overweight from neutral but cut the budget carrier's price target to 45 from 56.The analyst Jamie Baker wrote that American's management should have a more aggressive focus on revenue and doesn't expect a round of layoffs anytime soon as labor efficiency and productivity improve.On Monday, Cowen upgraded American, saying the airline's outlook for next year was ""compelling"" as it segments more of its products.Last week, American reported strong Q2 results but predicted weaker unit revenue, as did Spirit.American shares rose 1.2% to 51.06 on the stock market today. Spirit jumped 5% to 40.79.Baird downgraded Regeneron to underperform. Shares tumbled 3.4% Monday after French partner Sanofi said sales of eczema drug Dupixent fell short of expectations.Regeneron fell 4% to 472 on Tuesday, tumbling below its 50-day moving average.Rockwell Collins was upgraded to buy at Canaccord Genuity and had its price target raised to 125 from 108.But Rockwell could face increased competition from Boeing (BA) as Boeing enters the avionics space. On Monday, Boeing said it has already started work on building aircraft controls and electronics for military, civil and space vehicles. The aviation giant is just working on components for its own aircraft first but will eventually start selling to other aviation companies.Canaccord analyst Ken Herbert wrote that while the Boeing announcement ""could represent a long-term risk, we believe COL is relatively well protected in the markets"" and that Rockwell has a ""very strong reputation with both Boeing and Airbus as a top-preforming supplier.""Rockwell shares rose 4.4% to 111.18 to 107.30 after plunging 6.3% on Monday. Boeing fell 1.25%.Discovery's (DISCA) price target was lowered to 28 from 30 at FBR & Co., after announcing Monday that it would buy Scripps Networks (SNI) for about $11.9 billion, in a deal that would give the company nearly one-fifth of all ad-supported television.Discovery slid 0.9% to 24.38 after tumbling 8.2% on Monday.RELATED: The Risk To Facebook You Overlooked; Why American Air Is 'Compelling'

The drugmaker topped its earnings estimates, but fell short on the revenue-side. Shares have been consolidating in the mid-thirties for over two years.Longtime leading stock and FANG member Amazon (AMZN) advanced 1.6% in early trade as it attempted to recapture its 50-day line, which is lost on Monday in heavy volume.Under Armour (UAA) beat on top- and bottom-line estimates early Tuesday, but disappointed investors with lowered full-year guidance and a newly announced restructuring that will cut about 2% of its workforce.Shares fell nearly 6% and have languished around the 20 price level since late-January. The stock has fallen over 60% since its high in September 2015.Other apparel retailers also felt the burn with Foot Locker (FL) and Ralph Lauren (RL) declining 1.2% and 1.1%, respectively. Both stocks are trading under their 200-day lines.Among other companies reporting earnings, two leaders were breaking out in the stock market today. Cognex (CGNX) was breaking out of a cup-shaped base in the stock market today, rising 13% to blast beyond a 98.09 buy point. The machine-vision system maker beat Q2 estimates, while raising its Q3 revenue forecast.Meanwhile, Shopify (SHOP) jumped 7%, off session highs but above a 96.90 buy point.Finally, investors will turn their attention to Apple (AAPL) after the close when it releases its Q3 earnings.

135,REGN,"Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) were among some of the biggest biotech stock losers Monday on news related to clinical partnerships with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Sanofi (SNY), respectively.XIn early trading on the stock market today, Clovis toppled 13.5% to close at 84.81, after announcing an immuno-oncology partnership with Bristol-Myers to test combinations of their drugs called Rubraca and Opdivo to treat breast, ovarian and prostate cancers. Broadly, biotechs were down 1.4%.The decision comes on the heels of recent deals between Tesaro (TSRO) and Takeda Pharmaceuticals, and AstraZeneca (AZN) and Dow's Merck (MRK). Clovis, Tesaro and AstraZeneca all have drugs called PARP inhibitors, which are considered strong drugs used to battle ovarian cancer.But in Clovis' case, the pairing with Bristol-Myers closes the door on a near-term acquisition, Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said in a note to clients. Previously, Clovis had the only free PARP inhibitor not otherwise tied to a deal of the top three rivals.""Some investors may have hoped for an outright acquisition of Clovis by Bristol-Myers in the near-term, but we think this deal doesn't preclude a future acquisition of the company and in our view it increases the competitiveness and value of Rubraca,"" he wrote.Schmidt kept his outperform rating on Clovis stock and called the pitfall a buying opportunity.He sees Clovis benefiting more from its Bristol-Myers partnership than AstraZeneca will in its deal with Merck. AstraZeneca sold half its rights to PARP inhibitor Lynparza to get access to Merck's PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda. Clovis, on the other hand, keeps 100% ownership of its Rubraca.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks are now ranked fifth out of 197 groups tracked by IBD, slipping a spot from last week. But mergers and acquisitions could send it higher. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at who's potentially on a shopping spree.Both matchups have PARP inhibitors paired with PD-1 inhibitors — an immuno-oncological combination thought to generate a more robust response than each drug alone. Per the deal, Clovis will share half of the development costs for the combination with Bristol-Myers.""Importantly, Clovis gains access to one of the leading PD-1 inhibitors and clinical development expertise of Bristol-Myers,"" Schmidt wrote.Meanwhile, Regeneron tanked 3.4% to finish the regular trading session at 491.62 after French partner Sanofi reported sales of eczema drug Dupixent that missed some expectations, according to Reuters. In its first full quarter, Dupixent pulled in about $30.6 million, missing consensus views for $38.8 million.Analysts expect Dupixent to be a key drug for Regeneron and Sanofi. It's already approved in the U.S. and has received a positive recommendation from European regulators for approval. The duo is also looking at Dupixent in severe asthma.Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT), too, plunged 13.3% to 117.13, following its second-quarter earnings report. Adjusted losses grew to $3.46 per share, though that was better than analyst forecasts for a loss of $3.64. Sales of $30.89 million topped the $27.5 million view.Dynavax Technologies (DVAX), on the other hand, catapulted 71.4% to 15.85 at the close, after earlier rising as much as 86%, after a Food and Drug Administration panel voted 12 to 1 to recommend that the safety of a hepatitis B drug supports its approval to treat adults.Typical hepatitis B medications are administered in three doses over six months, Dynavax said in a news release. Its drug, dubbed Heplisav-B, is dosed twice over one month. Dynavax hopes to launch the drug in the U.S. in early 2018.RELATED:How AstraZeneca Failed Not Once — But Twice — In Cancer DrugsAstraZeneca Beats, But Stock Dives On Drug Failure; 4 More ReportDow's Merck Crushed Keytruda Sales Views By $68 Million

136,REGN,"JPMorgan Large Cap Growth Fund (SEEGX) is barreling down the fast lane. Manager Giri Devulapally's fuel? Lots of financial and technology stocks, including Morgan Stanley (MS), Mastercard (MA) and Applied Materials (AMAT).X (IBD)And amid a Friday rally by the broad market as of midday, key fund holdings are rising too.Chip gear maker Applied Materials was up 2.92%. Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) was up 1.77%. Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN), maker of the Eylea macular degeneration eye treatment, was up 1.35%. Consumer electronics colossus Apple (AAPL) was up 0.84%. And credit card provider Visa (V) was up 0.69%.The $12.5 billion fund was up 23.04% this year going into Friday, topping 94% of its large-cap growth fund peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., which averaged 15.66%. The S&P 500 was up 9.96%. The mutual fund's 23.23% gain the past 12 months topped 96% of its peers as well as the S&P 500.How has the fund achieved such eye-popping gains? It starts with the fund's investment approach. Fund literature boils it down to: ""Targeting companies with large markets, sustainable competitive advantages and strong price momentum, the Large Cap Growth Fund seeks to harness the return potential of America's fastest-growing companies.""The fund is rare in its naming strong price momentum as a trait sought in stocks and indicates acknowledgement that technical analysis plays an important role in its stock selection.Financials and tech were JPMorgan Large Cap Growth's largest sector overweights as of June 30 vs. its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth Index.Devulapally recently told shareholders that among financials he still has ""a positive view on companies with exposure to capital markets and interest rates."" His information technology overweight, he added, ""continues to be driven by a variety of industries, such as payments, semiconductors, video games, software and mobility.""That outlook has led Devulapally's fund to such holdings as money-center bank Morgan Stanley. The stock is up 9% so far this year.Brokerage Charles Schwab (SCHW), up 1% this year, benefits from the float on customers' cash. Float is profit on cash between the time a customer authorizes disbursement and when the cash actually leaves the account. Rising interest rates lift the profit on float.In the tech stock grouping, credit payment processor Mastercard is up 28% this year. Chip gear maker Applied Materials is up 38%.IBD'S TAKE: Applied Materials is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals.Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA), another member of the IBD 50, is up 49% this year. Earnings per share grew 40%, 70% and 343% the past three quarters. That's a nice rally from the prior two quarters, in which EPS fell.In the software space, digital media and marketing software firm Adobe Systems (ADBE) vaulted past Wall Street's estimates for its fiscal second quarter on June 20, reporting accelerating sales and earnings growth for the period. It also guided analysts higher for Q3. EPS grew 45%, 42% and 44% the past three stanzas.Its digital media segment provided 68% of total corporate Q2 revenue.And online payment processor PayPal (PYPL), an IBD 50 stock, is up 51% this year.Among other holdings, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) has an IBD Composite Rating of 98.Share price has soared 104% this year. Strong data for a triple-pill to treat the underlying genetic mutations tied to cystic fibrosis have been a key driver of the stock. The biotech company expects to spend more in research and development costs for the year as it continues development of its triple-pill.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), yet another member of the IBD 50, benefits from the shift toward more use of graphics processing units, away from regular CPU computer chips, because of their faster processing speeds in applications such as gaming, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars.EPS grew at a triple-digit pace in four of the past five quarters.Nvidia is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. It earned that spot in part by posting a 56% jump in sales last quarter and a 27.6% annual pretax margin. You can compare its other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.What else does the fund have going for it? Large-cap stock mutual funds have outperformed other U.S. diversified stock fund categories over the past six and 12 months as well as the past two, three and five years. Reflecting this fund's commitment to large-cap stocks, it owns four Dow Jones Industrial stocks: Visa, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple and Home Depot (HD).Visa, which is also one of the fund's payments stocks, is up 32% this year.Software titan Microsoft is up 17% this year.IPhone maker Apple, up 37% this year, is another one of Devulapally's mobility stocks.Home improvement retailer Home Depot fell nearly 3% on Tuesday. The company reported Q2 results that beat Wall Street expectations. But, as IBD reported, analysts see a potential slowdown in its stronger full-year outlook.After pulling back Thursday and Friday, shares were up 10% for the year.RELATED:Reynolds American Bolsters JPMorgan Large Cap Growth FundHow To Make Your Boss Add $76K To Your 401(k)

137,REGN,"Amgen (AMGN) stock toppled in after-hours trading Wednesday after reporting first-quarter sales that missed by $100 million on increased competition for two key drugs in its arsenal — immunosuppressant Enbrel and bone marrow stimulant Neupogen.The biotech giant said sales of Enbrel and Neupogen fell 15% and 31%, respectively. Meanwhile, sales of anemia drug Epogen fell 10% due to declines in net selling price.But higher demand helped sales spike for several drugs including Repatha, Amgen's ""bad"" LDL cholesterol-buster. Repatha sales popped 206% year over year to $49 million worldwide despite competition from the likes of Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY).For the quarter ended March 31, Amgen reported adjusted profit of $3.15 a share, up 9% vs. the year-earlier quarter and topping the consensus for $3. Sales dipped 1% to $5.5 billion and missed analysts' views for $5.6 billion.In after-hours trading Amgen stock was down 3.3%, after closing down a fraction, at 164.61, during the regular session. Shares are currently forming a flat base with a 184.31 buy point, though have traded below their 50-day moving average since mid-March.""We are well positioned for the long term with our newer products demonstrating value growth around the world and our tight operational expense management of the company,"" said Chief Executive Robert Bradway in a statement.IBD'S TAKE: Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) reported drug sales that advanced just 0.8%. See IBD's Technology page for how J&J's ""multiple issues"" could be a bleak harbinger for the sector.During the quarter, Amgen unveiled the results of a trial lasting more than two years, dubbed Fourier, of patients taking cholesterol-lowering medicine. Reducing ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the blood led to a decrease in the risk of heart attacks and strokes, Amgen found.But analysts have said Amgen is facing some pushback from payers who don't want to reimburse the wholesale acquisition cost of $14,523 for Repatha. Regeneron, Sanofi and Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) are working in the same area.He added: ""With robust Repatha outcomes data, we are working with payers to improve access to this important therapy for patients at risk for heart attacks and strokes.""Key spikes in the quarter included sales of bone drugs Prolia and Xgeva, up a respective 21% and 6%. Revenue from multiple myeloma drug Kyprolis grew 23%. Blincyto, a second-line treatment for a chromosomal disorder and leukemia, saw sales grow 26%.Amgen boosted its guidance for 2017 adjusted profits to $12-$12.60 a share, but that lagged the consensus for $12.94. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted profits would be up 5.6% at the midpoint of guidance. Sales guidance for $22.3 billion to $23.1 billion was reiterated.RELATED:Will Amgen's Rivals Pop On Its Cholesterol-Busting Drug?
"
138,REGN,"No. 1 biotech Amgen (AMGN) likely will have Wall Street tuned in during Wednesday's first-quarter earnings call to see whether a long-term cholesterol study could prompt stronger reimbursement trends.Amgen's first-quarter earnings are set for after the market close Wednesday. The Street broadly views sales and profits growing vs. the year-earlier quarter. Of particular note will be Amgen's comments on its study into the cardiovascular benefits of lowering ""bad"" LDL cholesterol.In a trial lasting more than two years, dubbed Fourier, Amgen found its LDL cholesterol-lowering drug, Repatha, cut down on the risk of heart attack, stroke and coronary revascularization, though it didn't reduce the risk of cardiovascular death.The results could have some read-through for the likes of Regeneron (REGN), Sanofi (SNY), Medicines Co. (MDCO) and Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR), all of which are working on LDL-busters. A drug from Regeneron and Sanofi, Praluent, is closest in mechanism to Repatha.Regeneron and Sanofi are embroiled in a patent battle with Amgen. A judge recently sided with Amgen, saying Praluent infringes on its patents for Repatha. But Praluent will stay on shelves pending the outcome of an appeals process.Analysts also could look for more color on the ongoing litigation.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech exchange traded funds were on fire in March. Can anything send them higher? Head to IBD's ETF page for a deep dive.Consensus: The Street widely expects Amgen to report adjusted earnings of $3 per share on $5.6 billion in sales, up 3.4% and 1.3%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier period.Guidance: For the second quarter, analysts expect Amgen to guide to $5.75 billion in sales and $3.11 in adjusted earnings per share, up 1.2% and 9.5%. Analysts see $23.01 billion in sales and $12.35 in adjusted earnings per share for the year.Stock action: In midday trading on the stock market today, Amgen stock was down a fraction, near 164.50.

139,REGN,"No. 1 biotech Amgen (AMGN) trumped Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) this week as prescriptions of LDL cholesterol-buster Repatha outstripped Praluent's figures, an analyst said Friday in an analysis of prescription trends.Repatha prescriptions rose 4% week over week as Praluent prescriptions fell 2%, Mizuho analyst Salim Syed wrote in a note to clients. Since March 17, when Amgen released the results of a study on the matter dubbed Fourier — conducted over a period of more than two years — Repatha scripts are up 11% to Praluent's 2%.But at the close on stock market today, Amgen stock fell 1% to 160.41. Shares of Regeneron lost 1.7% to 370.12 while Sanofi was off 1.6% to 44.09. Regenero and Sanofi are partnered on Praluent.The LDL cholesterol battle between Amgen and Regeneron/Sanofi stems from an ongoing patent lawsuit. A judge recently sided with Amgen, saying Regeneron and Sanofi infringed on a pair of its patents in a ruling that protected Repatha and banned sales of Praluent.Praluent will remain on shelves pending the appeals process. Praluent, like Repatha, is a PCSK9 inhibitor. It works by blocking the interaction between the PCSK9 protein and the LDL receptor to cut down on ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the blood.IBD'S TAKE: As earnings season kicks off, analysts are hesitant on the drug and biotech space after Dow component Johnson & Johnson announced its first-quarter drug sales advanced just 0.8%. J&J's report highlights ""multiple issues"" for the sector. Whom will it affect? Head to IBD's Technology page for a closer look.The Fourier study found that cutting down on that bad cholesterol led to a reduction in the risk of heart attack, stroke and coronary revascularization, but does not cut down on the risk of cardiovascular death.Still, Amgen is hopeful the study will help it persuade payers to reimburse patients for the costs of their cholesterol-reducing medications. Analysts are doubtful. Payers see $5,000 per year as a fair value for Repatha. Amgen charges $7,700 to $15,000.But Amgen's data could get some backup from Regeneron, Sanofi and Medicines Co. (MDCO). Regeneron and Sanofi are enrolling higher-risk patients in a similar trial over three to four years. Medicines Co. is also planning a heart study for its cholesterol drug.Syed has a buy rating and 195 price target on Amgen stock.RELATED:Regeneron, Sanofi Look To Crush Amgen, And Rivals Say They CanEsperion And Medicines Co.

China's weight in the benchmark will jump to upward of 40% from the current 26%. The move surprised the markets; MSCI had given a red light to mainland stocks or ""A shares"" on three previous tries.EQT Corp. (EQT) agreed to buy Rice Energy (RICE) for around $6.7 billion.

141,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) stock rocketed to a five-month high Tuesday despite the looming launch of a Novartis (NVS) drug likely to chip away at Regeneron's blockbuster eye-disease drug Eylea.On the stock market today, Regeneron stock popped 6%, touching 500 for the first time since early January before settling back to 495.33 for a gain of 5%. Shares hit a 553.06 buy point in mid-May out of a saucer that began forming in November. The stock is now 10% extended. Novartis was up 0.2% to 81.60.Early Tuesday, Novartis said its drug, known as brolucizumab, proved non-inferior to Regeneron's Eylea in a pair of Phase 3 trials examining patients with an eye disease that causes vision loss called wet age-related macular degeneration, or AMD.More than half of patients in both trials were able to be dosed every 12 weeks, less frequently than the eight-week schedule for patients on Regeneron's Eylea, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges noted in a research report. Brolucizumab will likely be ""highly competitive"" to Eylea, he said.The trials are a ""signal that (brolucizumab) would be able to gain a meaningful market share in the wet AMD segment through physician and patient preference for a less frequently administered medicine,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Regeneron stock is among four that should be on your ""watch list."" Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at what makes Regeneron and these three peers interesting right now.Brolucizumab also proved safe, allaying concerns of cardiac toxicity and severe vision loss, both of which cropped up in Phase 2 testing. The Phase 3 studies also looked at brolucizumab vs. Lucentis, which is marketed by Roche (RHHBY) in the U.S. and by Novartis outside North America.Porges noted that Novartis won't be able to file with the Food and Drug Administration until 2018. This should give Regeneron time to continue building Eylea sales. Eylea is the ""biggest value driver"" for Regeneron, Porges said.Outside Eylea, Regeneron is likely to continue to do well on its partnership with Sanofi (SNY) which has yielded the recent launches of eczema drug Dupixent and Kevzara, a drug to treat rheumatoid arthritis.RELATED:These Biotechs Are Leading The Sector To A 3-Month High TodaySmall Biotech Pops As Rival Novartis Struggle To Keep PaceCould Tesaro Overcome Clovis' Lead On Combos With Merck & Co.?

144,REGN,"Celgene (CELG), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) could lead the biotech sector to 15% more upside following the second quarter, an analyst said Thursday as shares trekked up for the fifth straight day.XAt the closing bell on the stock market today, IBD's 432-company Biotech industry group was up 1.3%, trading at a 17-month high. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges credited the lack of drug-pricing headwinds for the five-day uptrend.""The current rally reflects the lifting of perceived fears of pricing regulations, and a favorable tone from the FDA, but does not yet reflect more positive operating results, not to mention industry consolidation, which we still expect,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Porges expects the industry to tack on another 15% upside following what's likely to be a strong second-quarter earnings season. Biotech stocks have added 8% since June 15. On Thursday, leaders included a number of small caps trading below 10.Of the risers, Porges prefers what he calls ""growth stocks"" like Celgene, Regeneron, Vertex and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN). Since mid-May, Regeneron stock has added 16%, followed by 14% gains for Celgene and Vertex stock.""Gilead Sciences (GILD) performed the worst with only a 5% gain, which is still higher than the overall market,"" he said. Major biotech indexes have added 9%-14% over the last month as the broader market has only tacked on 2% growth.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts began predicting a biotech rally last month. What were the signs and who will benefit the most? Head to the Industry Snapshot for a closer look.Some analysts have said one reason for the sector's surge is that fears are subsiding over the prospect that President Donald Trump might take action to curb pricing. Some analysts now say that Trump's rhetoric to tamp down pricing appears to be ""lip service.""Wall Street expectations for Amgen (AMGN), Gilead and Regeneron's second-quarter earnings have dipped about 1%-2% over the last month and revenue views have been largely flat with a 1% decline for Amgen and Gilead.Large-cap biotechs will have to beat second-quarter views to gain that 15% upside, Porges said. Over the last five years, large caps have beat second-quarter expectations 60%-100% of the time with Amgen, Celgene and Gilead beating both views every time.Guidance increases are 85% more likely in the second quarter than the first, he said. With that, he expects the biotech sector could rally as much as 35%-50% compared to long-term relative multiples vs. the medtech and pharma sectors.RELATED:Could This Small Biotech Pique Interest Of Gilead And Others?Biotechs Surge As Generalists Return Amid Subsiding Trump WoesThese Biotechs Are Leading The Sector To A 3-Month High Today

During the regular session Celgene (CELG) roared into a buy zone, with Amgen (AMGN), Regeneron (REGN) and Biogen (BIIB) among peers showing bullish action.Investors should pay attention to sector rotations, because a stock's performance is closely tied to that of its broader industry. Stronger industry-sector performance may reflect improving business conditions for those companies. And there is a momentum shift as markets become more enamored or disenchanted with a group.Nasdaq 100 futures rose more than 0.1% above fair value, though off overnight highs. Futures for the Dow industrials climbed nearly 0.1% while S&P 500 index futures turn slightly higher.

Both XBI and IBB broke out of consolidations this week.Oracle reported much-stronger-than-expected earnings late Wednesday, with 3% revenue growth also edging past views. Shares of the business software giant shot up 11% to 51.35 in premarket trading on the stock market today. That would be a record high and well above a 47.09 buy point, though overnight trading doesn't always carry over into the regular session. Still, Oracle already topped an aggressive entry of 46.17 on Wednesday, rising 1.1% to 46.33 in heavy volume.In addition to desktop software names Microsoft, Adobe and Red Hat, which are all near long-time or all-time highs, several other business software stocks have been breaking out and hitting highs in recent months.

147,REGN,"Stocks opened to modest gains Monday, as tech merger and drug industry news powered some of the largest early moves.X The Dow Jones industrial opened to a 0.2% gain, with a strong early move by Merck (MRK) being partially held back by Intel (INTC), as Intel shares responded to the latest development in Broadcom's (AVGO) effort to take over Qualcomm (QCOM).The S&P 500 rose 0.1% higher, and the Nasdaq Composite opened to o a 0.3% gain, as Broadcom and Micron Technology (MU) led the index in early trade and Amgen (AMGN) and Intel fell to the bottom of the list.The market's uptrend got its groove back Friday, after a surprisingly strong February jobs report triggered a rally. Two of the three major indexes cleared key levels of resistance, and the Nasdaq shook off a distribution day. Monday's action will provide a test of how durable those gains — and the market's upgraded status — might be.Merck advanced 1.2% to lead the Dow in opening trade. The New Jersey-based drugmaker last week announced it would invest up to $5.8 billion to jointly develop, with Japan's Eisai, the Lenvima-Ketruda combination cancer treatment which, in January, earned the Food and Drug Administration's 'breakthrough' designation as a kidney cancer treatment.Intel posted one of the Dow's few early losses, down 2.6% after reports on Friday that the company was considering a takeover bid for Broadcom, as a means to upend Broadcom's effort to merge with Qualcomm.  Broadcom opened more than 3% higher.

The Boise, Idaho-based storage chip leader broke out past a 49.99 buy point in heavy trade a week ago, and ended Friday beyond buy range and 9% above the entry.Amgen slipped more than 1%, the worst early decline among Nasdaq 100 stocks. Amgen and other competitors to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (REGN) cholesterol drug Praleunt fell after Regeneron announced plans to lower prices for the drug. Regeneron shares rose 0.2% at the open.Initial public offerings also played a part in early action, as China-based Qudian (QD) popped 6% on stronger-than-forecast results for the fourth quarter, including a 53% surge in its number of borrowers, to 6.9 million, and a 70% increase in its total transactions, to $3.9 billion, during the period. Shares ended Friday 40% above a November low, but still 34% below the stock's October IPO price.Tech unicorn Dropbox filed an updated prospectus, announcing its plan to offer 36 million shares at an IPO between 16 and 18.

148,REGN,"Eczema treatment dupilumab could add $604 million to Regeneron's (REGN) top line in 2018, multiplying expected 2017 sales by a factor of five, on an estimated 19% of patients who can't be treated with topical ointments, RBC analyst Adnan Butt said Tuesday.In a survey of 51 U.S. dermatologists who treat an average 4,300 patients per month, RBC found 17% and 40% of patients, respectively, suffer from severe and moderate eczema. A majority of surveyed doctors said they have a pool of patients who could benefit from dupilumab immediately.A minority expect to prescribe dupilumab to pediatric patients ahead of approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which could provide another upside, Butt wrote in a research report. In total, he estimates a market of 2 million patients.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs have nearly returned to pre-Donald Trump election levels on worry that the president-elect will make good on recent promises to go after spiking drug prices. Could your biotech pick get caught up in the fallout?""We estimate that there are roughly 5 million patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, of whom about 40% will have failed treatment with topical (treatments), arriving at an addressable market of about 2 million patients,"" he wrote.Butt expects Regeneron to pull in $123 million in 2017 sales, dependent on its Prescription Drug User Fee Act date, set for March 29, though manufacturing issues at a drugmaker partner Sanofi's (SNY) factory could snag approval for dupilumab and rheumatoid arthritis treatment sarilumab, he says.Regeneron stock closed down more than 1%, at 382 in the stock market today. as it works through a deep price correction. On Monday, shares jumped 3.8% to 387.10 after rival Ophthotech (OPHT) reported its blurry-eye drug failed in a late-stage trial. Analysts see Regeneron as the default winner in the battle.Sanofi stock climbed nearly 1% Tuesday as it also goes through a long consolidation.Regeneron is in IBD's biotech industry group, which is in the top 50 of 197 groups.

Regeneron stock, on the other hand, rose 3.8% on its rival's news, retaking its 50-day moving average.The news had little impact on Roche (RHHBY) and Novartis (NVS), though. Novartis acquired the rights to ex-U.S. sales of Genentech drug Lucentis in 2003 before Genentech was acquired by Roche. Ophthotech's trial tested Fovista in conjunction with Lucentis.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech and drug stocks are underperforming a recent rally on Donald Trump's election after the president-elect said he would go after rising drug prices. Get the full scoop on IBD's Technology page.Novartis and Roche stocks dipped 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively, Monday. The duo would have split outside-U.S. sales of Ophthotech's Fovista, which aims to treat wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Ophthotech tested Fovista plus Lucentis vs. Lucentis alone.Patients on the combination regimen gained a mean 10.24 letters of vision on the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart after a year of monthly treatments. Their counterparts on Lucentis monotherapy gained an average 10.01 letters.The results weren't statistically significant, Ophthotech said. On the secondary endpoint — change from baseline — 24.2% of combination patients gained 20 or more ETDRS letters at the 12-month mark compared with 22.1% of Lucentis monotherapy patients.Following Ophthotech's flop, RBC's Butt posited Regeneron's rival treatment, Eylea, would become the standard of care for wet AMD and diabetic macular edema. Butt has an outperform rating and a price target way up there, at 626, on Regeneron stock.""Overhang was that Fovista success and approval could disrupt the market for Eylea as more doctors tried combining nearly free Avastin (off-label) with Fovista to improve outcomes with patients,"" he wrote in a research report.Still, other overhangs persist, Butt wrote. Regeneron remains in patent litigation over LDL-buster Praluent, developed with Sanofi (SNY), against Amgen (AMGN). Amgen's Repatha was approved in summer 2015 and also belongs to a class of drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors.Manufacturing concerns linger regarding eczema treatment dupilumab and rheumatoid arthritis med sarilumab, Butt noted. Sarilumab was developed in conjunction with Sanofi and could compete against AbbVie's (ABBV) Humira, currently the No. 1 drug in sales.RELATED:Ophthotech's Eye Disease Med Could Beat Down Rival RegeneronRegeneron Pharmaceuticals Falls As Combo Therapy Worse Than Eylea Alone

152,REGN,"Biotech stocks have nearly ""round-tripped"" their Donald Trump-inspired rally, but RBC analyst Michael Yee sees an upcoming U.S. Food and Drug Administration appointment, and data from Roche (RHHBY) and Biogen (BIIB) acting as catalysts.The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) and SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) exchange-traded funds are down 6.6% and 3.1% following a rally on Trump's election. On Wednesday, Trump dumped water on analysts' theory he would be less likely to go after spiraling drug prices.""I'm going to bring down drug prices,"" he told Time Magazine. ""I don't like what has happened with drug prices.""Trump's commentary sent biotech stocks tumbling on Wednesday. IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group closed down 3.1%. The iShares and S&P Biotech ETFs ended the day down 2.9% and 4%, respectively.After sinking more on Thursday, biotech stocks managed to climb out of the hole on the stock market today, IBD's 421-company biotech group was up fractionally as were the ETFs.IBD'S TAKE: Can biotechs recover from Trump's pledge to curb drug prices? Get the deep dive on IBD's Industry Themes.Yee noted Trump's effect extends far beyond his commentary. Trump has appointed Georgia Rep. Tom Price as his Health and Human Services secretary. Price has said he favors a major overhaul of the Medicare system, and has advocated against the Affordable Care Act.His next appointment, though, could light a fire under biotech stocks, Yee wrote. On deck, Trump is prepping to announce his next commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Media reports target Jim O'Neill and Scott Gottlieb as leading candidates.O'Neill is a former venture capitalist and managing director at Peter Theil's Mithril Capital. He has advocated for relaxing FDA regulations for drug approvals. Gottlieb is a VC partner and practicing physician who has served at the FDA and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.The decision will follow Congress' approval late Wednesday of a bill to speed up FDA processes.And Trump? His commentary on drug pricing is far from set in stone, Yee wrote in a research note. He notes the Republican Congress next year is unlikely to break from conservative dogma to work on easing drug prices.""Despite the worries about Trump mentioning drug pricing, we'd remind investors that he has said a lot of things over the past year and seems to negotiate in the public eye but hasn't necessarily been truly perceived to actually want to do a lot of them,"" Yee wrote.Outside Trump, biotechs have suffered industry-specific injuries including Eli Lilly (LLY) missing key Alzheimer's data, and lagging Q3 metrics from Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) and Medtronic (MDT), Yee wrote. But Biogen and Roche have upcoming data that could help the industry.Biogen has phase 1 and 2 data for Alzheimer's drug aducanumab due Friday. Roche's phase 3 hemophilia data is due ""imminently,"" Yee said. The Prescription Drug Free User (PDUFA) is due Dec. 28 for Roche's multiple sclerosis drug ocrelizumab. And Regeneron (REGN) rival Ophthotech (OPHT) has phase 3 data coming soon.Meanwhile, M&A looks imminent for the sector. Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) is in talks to buy European biotech Actelion. Sanofi (SNY) is rumored to have informal interest in Actelion, insiders say. M&A could pull generalist investors back into the space, Yee wrote.There's a ""perception of no major near-term catalysts in biotech other than 'it's cheap' and we need much more M&A to get the stocks rallying again,"" he wrote.RELATEDCould Trump Tax Cut Plans, Republican Congress Spur Biotech M&A?Could Trump 'Make Drug Development Great Again'?

154,REGN,"Stocks stuck very close to home on Thursday as mixed economic data and earnings reports frayed any attempts to build momentum.Better-than-expected weekly jobless claims and June consumer confidence numbers were positive, but a sharp drop in manufacturing growth reported by the Philadelphia Fed before the open helped stoke investor concerns. Investor response to earnings reports cut sharply in both directions, although mostly in soft trade, throughout the session.The result gave the Nasdaq a technical win: another new high and its 10th straight gain. But the increase was less than 0.1%, and in weak trade — no mean feat with Check Point Software (CHKP), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and Qualcomm (QCOM) all turning in broad losses, and Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) ending with minor losses on the day.Drugmakers Mylan (MYL) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) led the Nasdaq 100. Mylan jumped 3% on positive Phase 3 trial results reported late Wednesday. IBD 50 stock Regeneron also swung up 3% in weak trade as it works through a new consolidation.The S&P 500 slipped a fraction, backing away from a new high notched intraday. Drugmakers were key leaders also, with Perrigo (PRGO) and Mallinckrodt (MNK) each posting 4% gains, although trade was weak.The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.1%, despite the valiant efforts of Nike (NKE), which bucked up more than 2% for the day. The stock has fallen below its 59.10 buy point, but the breakout at that entry remains in play.Home Depot (HD) fell 4%, ratcheting up the drag on the Dow. The catalyst appeared to be an agreement by Sears Holdings (SHLD) to sell its respected Kenmore-brand home appliances via Amazon.com (AMZN). The news sent Sears shares to a nearly 11% gain. Amazon sketched out a 0.2% advance.Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) led the IBD 50, up more than 3% in above-average trade. That was sufficient to take out a new high, although shares were already extended after an early July rebound from the 10-week moving average. The chipmaker plans to report its fiscal third-quarter results on Aug. 1.On the down side, Floor & Decor (FND) tumbled 6% in fast trade, falling back below its 10-week moving average. The company priced a 10.7 million-share follow-on offering at 40, just below Wednesday's closing price.

155,REGN,"The stock market wasn't doing much in afternoon trading Thursday, mixed and mostly unchanged, as Wall Street weighed more earnings reports.In economic news, weekly jobless claims were lower than expected and the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index slightly missed expectations, but the news didn't move the stock market much.XSmall caps led the way with the Russell 2000 up around 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite were near the flat line. Volume on the NYSE was tracking about 10% higher than Wednesday's levels. Nasdaq volume was on pace to be slightly lower in the stock market today.In the biotech space, Regeneron (REGN) jumped more than 3% to 524.25. The stock first broke out in early May, but another interpretation is that the stock is working on a big cup-with-handle base with a 543.65 buy point. So another breakout is in play. Separately, recent Biogen (BIIB) spinoff and Leaderboard name Bioverativ (BIVV) gained 2% to 62.24. It's approaching an alternate entry of 63.33.Nike (NKE) outperformed in the Dow, rising nearly 2%, helped by a Morgan Stanley upgrade to overweight from equal weight. Shares of Nike surged 11% on June 30 on news that it's going to start selling on Amazon.com (AMZN).Elsewhere, Sears Holdings (SHLD) gapped up over its 200-day moving average and the 10 price level but was near session lows on news it'll start selling Alexa-enabled appliances on Amazon. Shares were up 14% to 9.90. The Sears news wasn't good for shares of Dow component Home Depot (HD) or Best Buy (BBY), two large sellers of appliances. Both names lost around 4% in heavy volume.In earnings news, Check  Point Software (CHKP) gapped below the 50-day moving average, falling 7%, after the company reported better-than-expected earnings but issued a weak outlook. Group peers Fortinet (FTNT) and Proofpoint (PFPT) held up well despite the news. Fortinet, which reports next week, was down 1% but near session highs as it works on a base with a 41.43 buy point. Proofpoint also reports next week. Shares dipped 0.09 to 93.08. It's also carving a base with a 94.43 buy point.Inside the IBD 50, Momo (MOMO) added 1% to 42.49 as it works on the right side of later-stage, cup-shaped base. The buy point for now is 46.05.Microsoft (MSFT) reports earnings after the close. Shares were mostly unchanged ahead of the results at 73.81. Microsoft recently cleared a base with 72.99 buy point in light volume.RELATED:These 2 Financials Are In Buy Range With Earnings TonightAmazon Teams Up With Sears, And A New Retail Group TumblesPayPal Stock At Record High On JPMorgan Deal As Online Payment Sizzles

156,REGN,"Biotech investors will likely be keyed in on the launches of Biogen's (BIIB) Spinraza and Regeneron's (REGN) Dupixent as first-quarter results roll around, an analyst said Wednesday in a sector preview.IBD's 424-company biotech industry group is ranked No. 6 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 42 just 13 weeks ago. But the first quarter will be ""choppy"" amid inventory and seasonality challenges, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said Wednesday.""Our analysis suggests that Q1 is not going to be a breakout or particularly impressive quarter for the large-cap names in our coverage universe, but neither is it going to be the disaster that the slowing results in Q4 might suggest,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Given the flux in shipping days and inventory levels, investors are likely to pay most attention to key launches already underway or anticipated for 2017.Biogen's spinal muscular atrophy drug with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) is likely to be scrutinized amid recent payer pushback. Meanwhile, investors will be looking for commentary on how Roche's (RHHBY) multiple sclerosis drug, Ocrevus, might hurt Biogen's MS franchise. Celgene (CELG) is also working on an MS drug, ozanimod.Expectations are still high for Regeneron and Sanofi's (SNY) Dupixent, an eczema injection that launched at the end of the first quarter.""Initial feedback from the company and physicians after a month of commercialization will be critical to assess the launch sales trend, especially any anecdotes about the accessibility for patients after the price announcement,"" he wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead Sciences is suffering from a slowing hepatitis C drug franchise. Could it buy itself out of the decline? Head to IBD Industry Themes for a better look at what Gilead may have its sights on acquiring.Amgen (AMGN) and Regeneron are also likely to get questions on reimbursement changes for their medicines that lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. Amgen showed in a recent study that lowering LDL cholesterol reduces the risk for heart attacks and strokes, and the Street is hoping that will push payers to reimburse for the drugs.In upcoming filings, investors will look for Amgen commentary on migraine drug erenumab and romosozumab, a drug to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) is working on immunosuppressant Soliris in a neuromuscular disease. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) is testing its tezacaftor in cystic fibrosis.Gilead Sciences (GILD) is likely to comment on its HIV drug, bictegravir. Gilead is pushing its HIV drugs as a potential replacement for declining sales of hepatitis C drugs. The company's hepatitis C unit raked in north of $44 million in three years before falling in 2016.RELATED:Will Gilead's HIV Franchise Plan Be Dashed On TrumpCare?How Gilead Is Paying The Price For Actually Curing A DiseaseBiotech ETFs Defy Trump Tweets To Rally, But What Can Send Them Higher?

157,REGN,"No. 1 biotech Amgen (AMGN) will face pushback on cholesterol-busting drug Repatha, an analyst said Wednesday after 86% of payers surveyed said a recent study on the drug wouldn't prompt reimbursement policy changes.Jefferies analyst Eun Yang surveyed 22 payers, each representing 2 million patients. Nearly nine in 10 said Amgen's recent study showing Repatha cuts down on the risk of heart attack and stroke wouldn't prompt them to change their reimbursement policies for the drug.""Its (cardiovascular outcomes) data was thought to be a major event, unlocking significant sales potential,"" Yang wrote in a report to clients. Half of those surveyed viewed the data as incrementally positive, 32% positive and 18% neutral. But none said game-changing.In midmorning trading on the stock market today, Amgen stock fell 1.3% to 162.24, after Yang downgraded the stock to a hold rating from buy. She also cut her price target on Amgen to 180 from 194 following the poll.Payers view $5,000 per patient per year as a fair, value-based price for Repatha, she said. Amgen charges between $7,700 to $11,200 per year. Only 35% of those surveyed expect an improvement in reimbursements. But six in 10 do not.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech exchange traded funds traded up in March. Head to IBD's ETF page to find out what can send them higher.""Main reasons for initial reimbursement rejections included unjustified cost/benefit (41%), patient not a candidate based on cardiovascular risk profile (23%), insufficient evidence from physicians (23%) and a lack of cardiovascular outcomes data (9%),"" Yang's report said.The latter point could change. Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi's (SNY) Odyssey Outcomes trial enrolled a higher-risk patient population likely to experience more events over the three- to four-year trial. Medicines Co. (MDCO) is also planning a heart study for its cholesterol drug.RELATED: Regeneron, Sanofi Look To Crush Amgen, And Rivals Say They CanAmgen Tanks On Heart Study; Shares Of Other Drugmakers Tumble

158,REGN,"Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi's (SNY) Dupixent grabbed FDA approval Tuesday and will be priced at $37,000 annually for patients with moderate to severe eczema, the companies said.Shares of Regeneron closed down 0.3% at 382.55 on the stock market today, after earlier falling as much as 1.9%. Sanofi stock dipped 0.1% to 45.35. The FDA approval removes ""pricing overhangs,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said after the news.Earlier in the day, Porges suggested that Regeneron and Sanofi could price Dupixent at $30,000 annually. He expected the FDA to approve Dupixent, allowing for ""recent manufacturing overhangs"" to be lifted. The approval means Dupixent could be available commercially as soon as next week, he said.Now he expects Regeneron and Sanofi's sarilumab, for rheumatoid arthritis, to grab FDA approval in the second quarter. Both Dupixent and sarilumab will be filled at Sanofi's French facility. Issues at that facility delayed sarilumab last year.Reactions to the announced price have been mixed, Porges said. But ""we expect the decision to result in significantly higher demand, faster than if the company had hewn to their traditional premium price strategy,"" he added.There are hundreds of thousands of eczema patients. In this setting, Porges says it's most important for Regeneron and Sanofi to ensure access and, at this price, payers will likely open access to most eczema patients. This price is also within earlier analysis that compared Dupixent prices with psoriasis treatments.On average, gross prices for comparable injectable psoriasis treatments run from $29,000-$50,000 per patient per year, Porges wrote in an earlier note to clients. He saw this as a good starting point for Dupixent and Pfizer's (PFE) Eucrisa.Leerink analysts also looked at the measure of disease burden on quality and quantity of life. Using that scale, analysts found patients with severe eczema were willing to pay $75,100 per year. Patients with moderate eczema were willing to pay $125,500.IBD'S TAKE: On Monday, Regeneron was among three medical stocks that gained big. See the other biggest point-winners on the Stock Market Today.""At both levels, the cost ... was below the usually accepted willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000,"" Porges said. ""Regardless of the price, the investigators found that Dupixent would be likely to improve health outcomes compared to usual and existing care, but would do so with additional cost.""Porges reiterated an outperform rating and 448 price target on Regeneron stock.RELATED:Regeneron, Sanofi Look To Crush Amgen, And Rivals Say They CanEsperion And Medicines Co.

This exclusive rating from Investor's Business Daily identifies market leadership with a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score. The score shows how a stock's price performance over the last 52 weeks holds up against all the other stocks in our database.Decades of market research reveals that the stocks that go on to make the biggest gains typically have an 80 or higher RS Rating at the beginning of a new run.Bioverativ is still in buy range after breaking past a 58.98 buy point in a cup with handle. On Wednesday, the stock was down fractionally for the day, but still about 4% above the entry. Once a stock moves more than 5% beyond the initial buy point, it's considered out of buy range.While revenue growth fell last quarter from 47% to 35%, EPS grew 64%, up from -6% in the prior report.The company holds the No. 7 rank among its peers in the Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group.

160,REGN,"Things are looking up for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY), an analyst said Monday, suggesting the duo's eczema drug Dupixent could easily outperform Wall Street models for the second quarter and for 2017 overall.""After 10 weeks, the prescription launch trajectory remains very robust,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. Despite confusion as to how much drug is sold in each prescription, Porges expects Dupixent sales to top expectations.For the second quarter, analysts model just $16 million in Dupixent sales, below Porges' view for $31 million. For the year, Porges projects $200 million to $300 million in revenue vs. $135 million to $140 million in consensus expectations.He expects cumulative total prescriptions volume to grow to north of 10,000 by the end of the second quarter and to more than 50,000 for the year, after hitting 4,400 as of June 2, according to health trackers.""Should the pace of new starts continue, reported full-year sales could be even higher than this estimate,"" Porges said, reiterating his outperform rating and 493 price target on Regeneron stock.IBD'S TAKE: Regeneron stock is what's known as an IBD 50 stock which tracks a list of premier growth stocks. Head to IBD 50 for a breakdown of the list as well as a look at who's strongest today.Porges' view comes a day after Regeneron and Sanofi announced strong data for their cholesterol-buster Praluent in a late-stage trial of patients with diabetes.

161,REGN,"Shares of cancer-focused biotechs Bluebird Bio (BLUE), Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Kite Pharma (KITE) popped Tuesday, leading a sectorwide boom that eventually settled toward the close.At the close on the stock market today, IBD's 433-company Biomed/Biotech industry group ticked up 1% , hitting a high last seen in mid-March.Bluebird stock lifted 0.3%, near 113, continuing a strong run that began in the first week of June when the small-cap biotech presented data with Celgene in a trial of patients with a blood cancer known as multiple myeloma.The drug, known under the temporary name of bb2121, showed a headline-grabbing 100% objective response rate across all 15 patients, meaning every patient saw some tumor shrinkage. Nearly three-quarters, or 73%, achieved a score of ""very good"" in partial responses to the drug.Kite stock, too, continued a run-up that it began earlier this month during the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting with strong data in adults with a blood cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Kite shares were up 2.2% to 91.21. The stock hit an 88.68 buy point on June 9 out of a consolidation period that began in mid-March.IBD'S TAKE: Drugs from Bluebird and Kite belong to a class known as CAR-T therapy in which immune system cells are extracted from the body and then reprogrammed to fight cancer. Could they stoke the sector to rally? Head to the Industry Snapshot for a deep dive.Fellow cancer biotech Clovis gained 0.9% to 88.68, continuing a trend that began Monday when shares rocketed 46.5% on a strong trial in ovarian cancer rivaling the likes of Tesaro (TSRO) and AstraZeneca (AZN).Loxo Oncology (LOXO) stock rose 4.1% after the Food and Drug Administration said it will simplify the approval process for drugs that treat genetic mutations that can cause tumor growth. Loxo is working in this arena and had strong results earlier in June.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) stock popped 5% to 495.33 despite a trial from rival Novartis (NVS) that showed its drug, known as brolucizumab, is not inferior to Regeneron's blockbuster drug Eylea.But analysts remained bullish on Regeneron, with investment bank Piper Jaffray boosting its price target on the stock to 557 from 446. The bank has an outperform rating on shares.Novartis won't file brolucizumab with the FDA until 2018, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research report. That gives Regeneron's Eylea plenty of time to continue building its sales war chest.RELATED:This Small Biotech Soared On Its Celgene-Partnered TrialCould Tesaro Overcome Clovis' Lead On Combos With Merck & Co.?Can AstraZeneca Keep Up As Clovis, Tesaro Unveil Blockbuster Drugs?

162,REGN,"Small-cap biotech Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) should trade up in 2017 if cholesterol-buster drug data from Amgen (AMGN) and Regeneron (REGN) come out positive, RBC Capital Markets said Friday.Amgen and Regeneron are slated to report data on their PCSK9 inhibitors in 2017. The new drugs target and inactivate a specific protein on the liver, reducing the amount of harmful LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol in the bloodstream, as described by Harvard University.Esperion won't have LDL-cholesterol data until 2018, but has completed 14 phase one and phase two studies on ETC-1002, bempedoic acid. ETC-1002 aims to treat the side effects associated with LDL-lowering therapies, Esperion says.Data from Amgen and Regeneron ""should be positive and confirm the LDL hypothesis and increase investor confidence around FDA's view on LDL as a surrogate for approving drugs,"" RBC analyst Michel Yee wrote in a research report Friday.Though it's highly unlikely that Amgen's PCSK9 will fail, that would prompt Esperion stock to topple, Yee wrote. Amgen's report is a ""fundamental derisking"" for the LDL thesis, he said.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group is down 22% for the year. Other groups have been stronger. Continental Resources and Parsley Energy hit buy zones this week. Check out the deep dive on Industry Themes.Esperion is seeking a potential partner outside the U.S. for upfront cash ahead of its phase three trial in 2018, Yee wrote. But if Esperion reaches fall 2017 without solidifying a partner, Yee says the company should hold off until after its phase three trial.It's ""better to just get the data since value of program goes way up then and it would be easier to raise capital on the back of that data,"" he wrote.Yee kept his sector weight rating and 10 price target on Esperion stock. In afternoon trading on the stock market today, shares rose 3.65% to 11.07. But before Friday, Esperion stock had tumbled 52% this year.RELATED:

166,REGN,"Biotech stocks will likely close 2016 down by double digits, but 2017 is filled with catalysts, and at least one Wall Street firm is keyed in on Aerie Pharmaceuticals (AERI), Intra-Cellular Therapies (ITCI), Medicines Co. (MDCO), Regeneron (REGN), Seattle Genetics (SGEN) and Tesaro (TSRO).""All these companies have important clinical (phase three/pivotal) or regulatory events coming up,"" RBC analyst Adnan Butt wrote in a research report Thursday. ""Coincidentally, some of these could also be the names in our coverage with the greatest likelihood of being takeout candidates.""Butt notes 10 companies slated to release phase three/pivotal data and 13 with proof-of-concept data expected in 2017.IBD's 421-company Medical/Biomed-Biotech industry group is down 22% year to date and fell 1.9% in the stock market today, a rough day for tech and drug stocks. Still, there are two potential catalysts remaining this month: the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease conference that starts Dec. 8 and the American Society of Hematology conference that starts Saturday.Among those launching drugs, Regeneron and Sanofi's (SNY) dupilumab and Tesaro's niraparib will be key in 2017, Butt wrote. Dupilumab is a topical treatment for moderate to extreme eczema, and niraparib is an oral PARP inhibitor used to treat breast and ovarian cancers.IBD'S TAKE: Sucampo Pharmaceuticals leads the biotech industry group with an IBD Composite Rating of 97, meaning it performs in the top 3% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Do your biotech bets stack up? Find out on IBD's Stock Checkup.Regeneron, Sanofi and Tesaro also land on the list of companies awaiting approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, alongside Medicines Co. and Ocular Therapeutix (OCUL). Prescription Drug Free User Act (PDUFA) dates will be important for all four, Butt says.Similarly, Aerie and Ocular are prepping to refile their New Drug Applications on, respectively, glaucoma med Rhopressa and Dextenza, a drug treating post-ocular surgery pain. Aerie withdrew its NDA in October on manufacturing issues. Ocular said in August it has one issue remaining in its NDA.Intra-Cellular Therapies is also waiting on FDA approval to file an NDA on ITI-007, a schizophrenia drug. In September, ITI-007 missed its primary endpoint of a change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), but safety was good. But it was shown to improve sleep maintenance and antipsychotic efficacy.Outside FDA actions, seven firms are nearing a point they could seek a bigger biopharma partner on late-stage drugs, or potentially become M&A candidates, says Butt. Butt named Aerie, Curis (CRIS), Intra-Cellular, Medicines Co., Ocular, Seattle Genetics and Tesaro.RELATED:Aerie Pharma Dips On 'Minor' Glaucoma Setback And Q3 Miss

Europe's Brent crude benchmark also traded up more than 4%, just below $57.Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) rose more than 2% on the Dow.Transocean (RIG), Marathon Oil (MRO) and Ensco (ESV) rose more than 5% apiece. Parsley Energy (PE) and Diamondback Energy (FANG) — two energy leaders near buy points — rose 5% and 3%, respectively, in premarket trade.Outside the energy sector, shares of Lockheed Martin (LMT) dropped 5% at the open after President-elect Donald Trump tweeted that the company's F-35 fighter jet program's costs are ""out of control.

Ophthotech reported its Fovista treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration failed to meet target end points in a phase 3 trial.

168,REGN,"U.S. stock indexes booked solid gains Wednesday afternoon, but biomed stocks dived on President-elect Donald Trump's vow to bring down drug prices.The Nasdaq advanced 0.7%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1% and 1.4%, respectively. The small cap Russell 2000 rose 0.5%. Volume in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges.Medical stocks struggled after Trump said in a Time Magazine interview that he doesn't like ""what's happened with drug prices"" and would bring down prices. Trump made no mention of investment in research and development, which is never free. Companies such as Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) put 40% of revenue into research and development, while Big Cap 20 stock Incyte (INCY) put 63% of revenue into R&D last year. Without strong growth in revenue and profits, R&D budgets would shrink, and the odds of developing new drugs would also fade.High-end biomeds, which rely the most on R&D, led the retreat Wednesday with the group down about 4%.Meanwhile, for the rest of the market it was business as usual.Bank stocks, which have led the Trump rally, were little changed. The exchange-traded fund PowerShares KBW Bank (KBWB) inched up 0.7% to 47.05. The bank ETF has gained about 21% since its Election Day close.Steel has been another area of strength in the stock market and that continued Wednesday afternoon. Gainers among steel producers included United States Steel (X), up 5.4%; AK Steel (AKS), up 3.7%; and Nucor (NUE), up 1.7%. Steel alloy stocks also showed strength. Carpenter Technology (CRS) popped 4.5% as it retook its 50-day line. Allegheny Technologies (ATI) rose 1% as it tried to clear a base.In economic news, the Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey was little changed in October. Layoffs slipped, but so did the rate of hiring. The job openings gauge is one that Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen watches closely. CME Group's FedWatch Tool was unchanged Wednesday with a 94.9% chance of an interest rate hike in December.RELATED:Trump Targets Drug Prices, Apple, Seeks '5 Minutes' With Offshoring Firms10 Chip Stocks Get Buy RatingsSouthwest Air, Delta Break Out Of Bases

169,REGN,"Stocks are showing an impressive rebound after Monday's opening sell-off, with the Nasdaq composite turning a near 1% loss into a 0.2% gain.The Nasdaq 100, reflecting resilience in large- and megacap techs, rose 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average is turning a drop of nearly 1% into a loss of just 0.2% after falling more than 1% last week.Early Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average briefly clipped its 50-day moving average for the first time since it fell to the south side of the key support and resistance line Sept. 9. Back then, it took nearly two months for the 30-stock Dow to rebound back above the 50-day line.Helping the Dow were DuPont (DD), which was the sole component to rise 1 point or more. At 80.66, the diversified manufacturer is a legitimate leader in the stock market today, up 9.9% since Jan. 1. Shares also are up by 13% from a recent breakout on Nov. 30, past a 71.19 flat-base buy point.The S&P 500 was down less than 0.2%.IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards: View The Winners By CategoryAmong new issues, Snap (SNAP) is getting plenty of attention on the back of positive comments from analysts and new buy ratings. Shares strode more than 6% higher to 24.18, possibly setting up its highest close in more than two weeks.On its market debut, the Snapchat social media site operator leapt past its 17-per-share IPO to finish at 24.48, then catapulted another 20% to as high as 29.44 before coming down to earth. Over the next 10 sessions, Snap slid 36% to a low of 18.90. In a normal cup or double-bottom base, the decline usually runs no more than 33% to 35% from high to low — based on IBD's research of big winners over the past 22 bull- and bear-market cycles. So, in Snap's case, the decline is on the heavy side, especially given the fact that the gain from the 17-per-share IPO did not exceed 100% or more.Despite recent positive Wall Street comments, Snap is on course to lose money in 2017 (consensus estimate of a net loss of 45 cents a share) and 2018 (-$0.32).Still, the stock deserves a close watch if the rebound continues and the stock gets to within 5% to 15% of its 29.44 peak.In most excellent cup-with-handle patterns, a stock tends to form the handle — the last final shakeout of uncommitted holders before a big breakout to new highs — while trading no more than 15% off its 52-week or all-time high.While the Trump-supported American Health Care Act never saw the light of day Friday, investors should continue to watch leading names in the medical and health care services industry groups. Celgene (CELG), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) were among the day's biggest point-winners.Celgene ranks No. 1 in the Big Cap 20; see the whole list in the latest IBD Weekly on page B19.The failure of the American Health Care Act, and future changes in former President Obama's Affordable Care Act, are unlikely to suppress demand for superior medicines to treat patients with deadly diseases such as multiple myeloma. Celgene is No. 1 in that field, and also is becoming a force in the treatment of chronic illnesses such as psoriasis.Celgene gets a wonderful 98 EPS Rating from IBD Stock Checkup due to its consistent pattern of long-term profit increases and solid gains in the short term as well. Over the past six quarters, earnings per share rose 27%, 17%, 23%, 17%, 28% and 36% vs. year-ago levels. That's an average EPS gain of 24.7%, which is outstanding for companies with market caps of $15 billion or higher.Celgene has a $96 billion market value and 775 million shares outstanding, which is large but not excessively so. As a point of comparison, Pfizer (PFE) has 5.95 billion shares outstanding.The Street sees fiscal year 2017 profit rising 22%, to $7.22 a share, on an 18% lift in revenue to $13.29 billion. Revenue rose 24%, 27% and 26% vs. year-ago levels in the prior three years.Intuitive, meanwhile, remains top of the hill in the field of robotic surgery systems. Wall Street sees earnings rising 12% to $4.93 a share in the current quarter, which would accelerate the 3% increase seen in Q4 2016.Sales are seen rising 13% to $670.2 million in Q1, up from 12% growth in Q4.Intuitive presented two buy points in 2017 so far. On Feb. 21, the stock spurted past a 72.35 cup-base entry in volume expanding nearly 40% above its 50-day average,  a sign of healthy demand by mutual funds, large investment advisers, pensions, insurers and the like. But go to a daily chart, and you'll also see a very narrow handle that formed from Jan. 26 to Feb. 1, creating a hard-to-see 700.52 early buy point.Add 10 cents to the highest price within any handle to obtain a handle entry point. Notice on a daily chart how the stock gapped up in huge volume on Jan. 25 in reaction to decent fourth-quarter results (EPS up 3%, revenue up 12%).Intuitive currently gets a solid 93 Composite Rating, better than Regeneron's 80 score. Watch to see if Regeneron musters the strength to rise back above the 50-day and 200-day lines, create some space above those key resistance lines, and earnest start forming the right side of a new base pattern.RELATED:How To Invest: Add The 10-Week-Line Pullback To Your Trading PlaybookHow To Invest: The Keys To A Great Cup-With-Handle BaseStock Market Today: Do These 7 Leading Chipmakers Deserve A Spot On Your Watch List?Inside IBD 50: What Do These 5 Big Winners Have In Common?Tech News At IBD: Why Snap Is Getting Some Love On Wall Street

170,REGN,"Regeneron (REGN) expects to top No. 1 biotech Amgen's (AMGN) cholesterol drug with its own medication in reducing the risk of heart attack, stroke and angina — and it's getting a vote of support from some unexpected corners.Regeneron is teaming up with Sanofi (SNY), and their upcoming study results on the drug Praluent hope to blow Amgen's Repatha out of the water. Repatha disappointed in its own recent heart-drug testing.What's unusual is that rivals from The Medicines Company (MDCO) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) agree Regeneron and Sanofi have a better chance of succeeding. The reason is Regeneron and Sanofi tests are lasting much longer.""This suggests that the apparent effect size and the magnitude of the risk reduction could be greater in Regeneron's study,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a recent note to clients. ""Regeneron will achieve their results later, but appears to have high confidence in their likely result.""At Leerink's recent Biotech Mountain Meeting in Snowbird, Utah, representatives of Regeneron, The Medicines Company and Alnylam delved into the impact of Amgen's recent Fourier study on the cholesterol and statin space.Panelists agreed Regeneron and Sanofi's Odyssey Outcomes trial enrolled a higher-risk patient population likely to experience more events over the three- to four-year trial vs. Amgen's 2.2-year trial, Porges said.Regeneron and Sanofi are looking at Praluent's effect on reducing the risk of heart attack, stroke and unstable angina requiring hospitalization in patients age 40 and above with elevated ""bad"" LDL cholesterol and an acute coronary syndrome event in the last year.All panelists agreed, though, that Amgen's recent Fourier study should help in getting payers to reimburse patients for the costs of cholesterol drugs in what is known as the PCSK9 inhibitor class. These drugs work to reduce ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the blood.Releasing its long-anticipated Fourier results late last week, Amgen said it showed reducing harmful LDL cholesterol cut the risk of heart attack by 27%, stroke by 21% and coronary revascularization by 22% in the first year. In the second year, the drug cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes by 33%.IBD'S TAKE: Among biotechs, Celgene had a strong week last week, breaking out after unveiling strong results for a trial of Otezla in patient with moderate plaque psoriasis. Head to IBD Stock Analysis for the deep dive.But Amgen said its drug, Repatha, didn't make a difference in reducing the risk of cardiovascular death. That caused shares of Amgen, Regeneron, Sanofi, The Medicines Company, Esperion (ESPR) and Pfizer (PFE) — all of which work on cholesterol drugs — to fall sharply.""Amgen's gambit meant that they delivered their outcomes trial result earlier than their competitor, but also undermined the effect of their treatment intervention, which was materially greater in the second year of exposure than the first,"" Porges said.Regeneron should have ""an even more robust effect size"" based on the length of its trial. It expects to have data in December, which likely would be presented in early 2018.Esperion and The Medicines Company recovered this week. Analysts note Esperion's drug, bempedoic acid, will likely be priced lower than Amgen's Repatha. Repatha goes for about $8,760 per year net price per patient in the U.S., Porges said.The Medicines Company also plans a cardiovascular outcomes trial for its drug, inclisiran, which is being developed with Alnylam. But Porges doesn't expect data in that trial until 2021 at the earliest.RELATED:Esperion And Medicines Company Recover From Amgen-Induced PitfallEsperion's Dive On Amgen Heart Study 'Counterintuitive' On PricingAmgen Tanks On Heart Study; Shares Of Other Drugmakers Tumble

172,REGN,"The largest biotech ETFs served up a reminder in March that investors in this high-growth industry should expect a bumpy ride. They hit their best levels in a year early on, then took a nasty tumble before bouncing back smartly from those losses.On Tuesday, SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) and iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) were modestly lower but holding above the 10-week moving average — a bullish sign after a recent test of that critical marker of support. And despite a stumble in March so far, they are holding on to double-digit gains for the first quarter, vs. 12% for the S&P 500.That's a nice turnaround from a plunge of more than 10% for many biotech exchange traded funds the prior quarter, which coincided with hawkish election rhetoric about price-gouging in the drug industry.The latest rally comes despite major setbacks this month, including Trump tweets on drug prices and serious blows to big-name biotechs Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB), which cast a pall on the entire industry.Biotechnology ETFs rallied sharply in January and February as higher beta names swung into favor after President Trump's shock election win. Plus, investors saw these stocks as a ""value play in a growth industry,"" said Matthew Bartolini, head of research for SPDR Americas.Some market analysts still see fair-to-attractive valuations in the sector, despite its year-to-date outperformance, helping IBB earn an upgrade recently.In light of improving valuations, however, two things will be key to the next leg up for this industry, in Bartolini's view.First, biotechs have to deliver on their promise of growth.Many smaller firms like Kite Pharma (KITE) and Esperion (ESPR) are unprofitable or have no sales, and even industry bellwethers such as Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Incyte (INCY) are in earnings slumps.However, earnings momentum for the sector as a whole is starting to look more favorable, some analysts say. Top biotech Celgene (CELG), which earns an extremely high EPS Rating of 98 from IBD, has scored upward revisions in forward estimates.Secondly, mergers and acquisitions must come to fruition to boost share prices. Intercept (ICPT), Regeneron (REGN) and Biogen are three names being bandied about as takeover targets.XBI has outpaced peers in 2017 so far, as it has consistently over the past three-, five- and 10 years. It is up 17.9% year to date through March 27 vs. a 10.6% gain for its iShares rival, which is cap-weighted and skews toward larger companies.Bartolini considers the SPDR biotech to be well placed looking ahead as well. An equal-weighted indexing method gives it a small-cap tilt. That may be beneficial in an industry such as biotechnology, where smaller and more speculative companies have strong potential as long-term growth plays, he said.Plus, relative to cap-weighted rivals, XBI is less tied to the fortunes of the largest names in the industry. On the one hand, that makes the SPDR ETF more immune to single-stock risk and ""tweet risk,"" in Bartolini's words. However, it also will benefit less from a big price gain for the industry giants.A Trump tweet on drug pricing hit XBI and IBB hard on March 7.RELATED:Which ETFs Are Making Big Moves?

177,REGN,"Janus Henderson Forty Fund (JACAX) is about as hot as Kevin Durant was in the NBA Finals. That is, very!Thirty-two of the fund's 40 stocks had double-digit percentage gains so far this year going into June 14, according to Morningstar Inc. Three of those — electric car maker Tesla (TSLA), video game publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and railroad CSX (CSX) — were up more than 50% for the year. As a result, going into Wednesday the fund's 19.38% year-to-date gain topped 90% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., all of which averaged 14.77%, and the S&P 500's 10.03% gain.The $751 million fund got more good news on Friday. Its No. 8 holding Amazon (AMZN) was up nearly 3% in the afternoon while the broad market measured by the S&P 500 was down roughly 1%. The Amazon boost reflected the market's thumbs-up vote in favor of the internet giant's takeover of Whole Foods Market (WFM), which was announced in the morning. That put Amazon up 32% for the year. Investors appeared to believe that Amazon will be able to sweeten up Whole Foods' revenues and earnings.Thomson Reuters ranked the deal as Amazon's biggest of all time and the 11th biggest global retail deal ever.Already, the fund was outperforming 81% and 99% of its direct rivals over the past one and three years respectively. Lead manager Douglas Rao has been at the helm since June 1, 2013. Nick Schommer has been a manager since Jan. 12, 2016.The fund is growth oriented. And it is concentrated. True to its name, the fund limits its portfolio to its 40 best ideas. And, yes, that concentration can make the fund more volatile than its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth Index.For example, in the fourth quarter the fund lost 1.47% vs. a 0.27% loss for the Russell bogey and a 3.82% gain by the S&P 500. The fund was hurt in part by the market's rotation away from the secular growth stocks it likes, toward companies with potential for improving cyclical prospects, the managers explain in their recent semiannual report. Cyclicals in energy, materials and industrials, for instance, benefited from the Trump Bump — a surge in bets on companies that could gain from increased spending on U.S. infrastructure.The fund's top performers have trended higher through the market's indecisive seesaw between cyclical and secular growth stocks in recent months.Look again at the fund's top performers. As IBD's Gillian Rich reported Tuesday, Tesla was upgraded to a buy at Berenberg and had its price target raised to 464 from 193. Despite efforts by BMW, Kia and General Motors (GM), analyst Alexander Haissl said no other automakers are currently building electric vehicles for the mass market that can compete with Tesla's offerings. The Model 3 is expected to go into production this year. Haissl also said the company's free-cash-flow potential is superior.Tesla is in IBD's Automobile Manufacturers industry group, which ranks No. 2 among 197 groups. Tesla closed at record highs in six of the eight trading sessions through Wednesday. Trading around 380, the stock is extended, outside its buy range for investors looking for optimal entry points.Also, some yellow caution flags are flapping around the stock's earnings. After posting a third-quarter profit, the company resumed losses the next two quarters, and the narrowing of the losses from year-earlier periods has slowed. And recent earnings-estimate revisions have been downward.Activision is also extended, trading in the high 50s. The stock is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals.Last month, Activision's first-quarter sales and earnings topped estimates. The company's Q2 revenue forecast topped expectations, but its EPS outlook was below analysts' views.CSX runs rail systems in 23 states, the District of Columbia and two Canadian provinces. Its services include intermodal and rail-to-truck transload processes. Unlike those of Tesla and Activision, shares of CSX have slipped back into a buy range above their 50.41 entry.EPS grew 21% and 38% the past two quarters after four quarters of declines. Energy shipments and a stronger economy have boosted the rail firm's revenue.IBD'S TAKE: CSX ranks No. 1 in IBD's Transportation-Rail industry group. It has a 25.8% annual pretax margin. See how its additional, easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' data at IBD's Stock Checkup.Among other holdings, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) is another member of the IBD 50. Trading around 468, it has slipped back within a buy range from a 453.06 entry on a long cup base.EPS grew between 22% and 36% in each of the past four quarters. The drugmaker's Eylea macular degeneration treatment has been driving its growth. But that's not the only piston in Regeneron's engine. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges recently wrote to clients that Dupixent, an eczema treatment marketed by Regeneron and Sanofi (SNY), could easily outperform Wall Street models for the second quarter and for 2017 overall, IBD's Allison Gatlin has reported.Aerospace and defense stock General Dynamics (GD) is trading around 200, so it is still within buy range of a 194.10 buy point. EPS grew 7%, 9%, 9% and 19% the past four quarters.The company is positioned to benefit from President Trump's budget proposal, which would boost defense spending by 9.5% in fiscal 2018. And the company was one of several defense contractors — the others were Raytheon (RTN), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) — that signed memorandums of understanding with Saudi Arabia as part of last month's U.S.-Saudi Arabia arms deal.A merger between Janus Capital Group and U.K.-based Henderson Group closed May 30, creating Janus Henderson Group (JHG). Shareholders in what had been Janus funds should watch to see if the combined entity creates economies of scale that it can pass along in the form of lower mutual fund fees.Shareholders should also keep their eyes peeled for any manager departures from their funds. In some cases at other companies, veteran managers with ownership stakes cash out or leave. Some don't want to deal with culture clashes or fallout from corporate integration. Others are pushed out due to performance or cost cutting.The Janus-Henderson merger makes sense from a distribution viewpoint, since each asset manager has larger footprints in different geographic areas, according to Morningstar Inc.Both firms pared their fund lineups in the run-up to the merger. Janus merged two of its funds into other funds it ran (including Janus Twenty into Janus Henderson Forty) and one into a Henderson portfolio. It also closed one fund. Henderson made comparable moves. In addition, Janus Henderson is in the process of merging what had been two other Janus funds.RELATED:Janus Forty Managers Win With Bets On Proven Champs, Up-And-Comers And Calculated RisksHow To Turn A Glass Of Wine Into A $173,000 Bump In Your IRA

180,REGN,"Tense, late-stage maneuvering at the White House and the Capitol kept markets on edge straight to Friday's close, with major indexes ending mixed and the Dow Jones industrial average chalking up its worst week since the Nov. 8 presidential election.The Dow lost 0.3% Friday and 1.3% for the week. Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) took what were far-and-away the Dow's worst losses for the week, down 6.5% and 4%, respectively.Also in the Dow 30, Apple (AAPL) and McDonald's (MCD) each managed modest gains for the week and Nike (NKE), which on Wednesday dived more than 7% after a weak earnings report, on Friday trimmed its decline for the week to less than 3%.The S&P 500 sagged 0.1%, ending the week with a 1.3% loss — also its worst week since just before the election. Heavy engineering, steel and suppliers of construction materials took the S&P 500's heaviest hits on Friday. Vulcan Materials (VMC), Martin Marietta (MLM), Fluor (FLR) and Nucor (NUE) each dumped more than 2% in Friday's session. It's well-worth noting that all of those losses occurred in light trade.Micron Technology (MU) and Under Armour (UA) pegged the S&P 500's best gains.Micron spiked 7% as earnings rose to 90 cents a share, up from a penny in the year-ago quarter. Revenue soared 58%. But the industry took particular heart in Micron's Q3 outlook, which placed the midpoint of earnings guidance 61% above consensus views. Micron shares ended the week up 11% and at a new high, extended from a February rebound from 10-week support.Under Armour popped 4% following an upgrade to buy, from hold, by Jefferies.

181,REGN,"Sanofi (SNY) makes sense as an acquirer for Flexion Therapeutics (FLXN), an analyst said Friday on rumors that Flexion accepted a $1 billion offer from the French drugmaker — though Flexion investors were dubious.Flexion stock, which jumped 33% Thursday, tumbled as much as 3.3% on the stock market today, then rallied as much as 4.8%, before closing up 3.9% at 27.27. Sanofi stock edged up 0.3% to 44.63.RBC analyst Randal Stanicky sees Flexion as 40% likely to be taken out, he wrote in a research report. Sanofi makes sense given it sells Synvisc, an injection that supplements the fluid in a patient's knee to relieve osteoarthritis.Flexion is now working through the FDA approval process for Zilretta, a joint injection with an extended release formulation steroid for knee pain. Stanicky sees Zilretta as well positioned to take meaningful share from the existing steroid and hyaluronic acid markets.""Pre (FDA)-approval timing would allow Flexion to avoid sales force ramp (about 100 reps) and for Sanofi to allow it to participation in launch activities which, per Flexion, is expected to be $500,"" he wrote. The market is about 5.2 million people in the U.S. and worth $3 billion in size at branding marketing.Cantor analyst Chiara Russo sees Flexion as capable of launching Zilretta without help and says the rumored ""mid-30s"" per share takeover price — according to an unidentified source commenting to FiercePharma — is too low.""With significant changes in the competitive landscape over the past year giving Zilretta the sole new voice in the space, we see a mid-30s price as being a little low for a strategic buyer,"" Russo wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Flexion has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 58, meaning it underperforms more than four in 10 of all stocks. A better biotech bet would be Celgene with a best-possible CR of 99. Visit the Stock Checkup for a list of the strongest leaders.Russo maintained a 34 price target and maintain rating on Flexion stock. She expects Zilretta to take significant market share.RBC's Stanicky sees a $37-$38 per share takeover price as reasonable but notes ""we see support for a deal north of $35 and perhaps closer to $50."" Though, he added, specialty valuations have come down recently and the deal is pre-Zilretta approval.He has an outperform rating and 44 price target on Flexion stock.The rumored bid comes just three months after Sanofi lost out on a contentious battle for Swiss biotech Actelion. Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) scooped that deal. Before that, another member of the Dow Jones industrial average, Pfizer (PFE), beat out Sanofi to acquire Medivation.Sanofi has also been rumored to have considered deals with BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) and The Medicines Company (MDCO) in the aftermath of a judge's ban on its cholesterol drug, Praluent, with Regeneron (REGN). The ban has been stayed pending an appeal in the case against Amgen (AMGN).Both Flexion and Sanofi declined to comment to IBD.RELATED:Did Sanofi Just Bag This Biotech For $1 Billion?Johnson & Johnson In Exclusive Talks To Acquire Actelion After Sanofi FrayCould Sanofi Acquire BioMarin In Wake Of Amgen LDL Brouhaha?

182,REGN,"The sell-off Friday on Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) stock in light of Amgen's (AMGN) heart study results was unwarranted, an analyst said, arguing that Esperion's drug will likely be priced much lower.Needham analyst Chad Messer said in a note to clients that Esperion's drug, bempedoic acid, has a different method of reducing ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. But it will be offered at a much cheaper price than Amgen's Repatha, at $14,100 per year, as well as Praluent, an alternative jointly developed by Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) that sells for $14,600.""Bempedoic acid will likely be priced more in line with other oral cholesterol therapies (about $3,000 per year),"" he wrote. ""We see a negative read through to Esperion as counterintuitive.""The drug is currently in phase three testing. Unlike Amgen's drug and the Regeneron-Sanofi treatment — both of which are injectable — bempedoic acid is an oral therapy.By midday trading on the stock market today, Esperion stock fell hardest of all the companies developing cholesterol drugs similar to that of Amgen's, tumbling 20.2%to close at 23.67.Shares of the Medicines Co. (MDCO) also took a beating, down 8%to 48.38, though its loss was much higher earlier in the day. Like Amgen, the Medicines Co. also is working on a drug to reduce ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. It's also an injection with a similar PCSK9 function.Amgen stock was down 6.4%, to end the day at 168.61. Regeneron fell 3.1% to 380.29, while Sanofi slipped 0.6% to 44.30.IBD'S TAKE: In other biotech news, Gilead Sciences could be nearing a deal with a small but powerful biotech. Did an analyst's pleas for Gilead to buy something pan out? Head to IBD Industry Themes for the scoop.Early Friday, Amgen announced that its cholesterol drug Repatha reduced the risk of heart attack, stroke and coronary revascularization by a respective 27%, 21% and 22%. But shares toppled when Amgen said the drug had no effect on cardiovascular death.Patients with existing cardiovascular disease saw a 15% reduction in the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events such as hospitalization for unstable angina, coronary revascularization, heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death.""Based on previous trials, investors had been expecting a reduction more in the 20%-25% range,"" Messer wrote in his report. ""It was hoped that an impressive reduction in events would get payers to start paying for Repatha.""Despite the disappointing results, Amgen proved the thesis that a reduction in ""bad"" LDL cholesterol has a clinical benefit on cardiovascular health. While that might not help Amgen, Regeneron and Sanofi, which are working on drugs classified as PCSK9 inhibitors, it should help Esperion, he said.Management from the Medicines Co. is bullish on their drug, Inclisiran, Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz said in a separate report. The company criticized Amgen's design for the trial, which included changes in health that ""are less modifiable by LDL cholesterol lowering.""The FDA has already given the Medicines Co. positive feedback on its proposed phase three trial design, Schwartz said. The trial will be longer than Amgen's with the minimum follow-up around 3.2 years.Schwartz has an outperform rating on shares of the Medicines Co.RELATED:Amgen Tanks On Heart Study; Shares Of Other Drugmakers TumbleAmgen Tops Heart Study As Rivals Regeneron, Sanofi Chill In CourtAmgen Could Boost Rivals On Positive Heart-Disease Study: Analyst

A judge earlier found that Praluent violated Amgen's patent on fellow PCSK9 Repatha. Both drugs remove ""bad"" LDL cholesterol from the blood.Regeneron stock finished 1.9% higher at 360on the stock market today, though it closed down 1.2% on Wednesday and then was momentarily halted ahead of news in the Amgen case. Sanofi rose 3.6% to 42.70 Thursday, while Amgen dipped 0.4% to 167.47.Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young said the movement for Regeneron and Amgen stocks was likely on the ""headline news,"" but noted that the stay would help lift negative sentiment on Regeneron. The appeal will likely span a year to 18 months, she estimated, though a settlement is still possible.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts have suggested the patent on Amgen's Repatha, which reduces bad LDL cholesterol, is too broad. See what that could that mean for Regeneron and Sanofi shares in the long run.

Dupilumab, Regeneron and Sanofi's eczema drug is nearing approval, and an outcomes study for Praluent is due later this year, RBC analyst Michael Yee said. Though, the PDUFA date has been pushed three months, Sanofi has said.The duo is also working to iron out manufacturing issues surrounding its rheumatoid arthritis drug, sarilumab. Last year, the Food and Drug Administration refused to approve sarilumab following an inspection of the Sanofi Le Trait facility, in Normandy, France, where the drug is filled.Yee also expects an update on Regeneron and Sanofi's Eylea in combination with an anti-ang2 to treat wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema, both diseases of the eye. The duo is also looking at dupilumab in asthma.But Q4 was a mixed quarter, he noted. Regeneron reported $1.227 billion in sales and $3.04 earnings per share ex items, up 12% and 36% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Sales lagged the consensus for $1.3 billion, but EPS narrowly beat the $3.03 view.And guidance for single-digit Eylea growth in 2017 fell short of consensus views for 12% growth, RBC analyst Michael Yee said in a research note. Evercore analyst Mark Schoenebaum noted in a research report that Regeneron tends to offer conservative guidance.""The guidance appears to imply roughly flat to slight growth in 2017 over (the second half of 2016) annualized, though would note also that Regeneron tends to guide conservatively,"" Schoenebaum wrote.

186,REGN,"A federal judge granted Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi's (SNY) request to stay a ban of their LDL-buster Praluent late Wednesday, meaning the drug can stay on shelves — and continue rivaling Amgen's (AMGN) Repatha — pending the appeal process.In after-hours trading, Amgen stock dipped 2% after closing up a fraction, at 168.12, in Wednesday's regular session. Regeneron stock trading was halted after hours, ahead of the news, but closed the regular session down 1.2%, at 353.25. Sanofi stock was down a fraction after hours, following its 2.4% gain, to 41.21, during the regular session after its Q4 report early Wednesday.Wall Street had largely expected the federal judge to deny Regeneron and Sanofi's request, making Praluent the first branded drug to be pulled from the market as a result of patent litigation. Now, the duo has the chance to make their case before an appellate court. The ban on Praluent, which treats high cholesterol, was set to go into effect Feb. 21.Regeneron and Sanofi argue that Amgen's patents on Repatha are too broad. In its patents, Amgen didn't identify any structural feature ""common to"" the genus, but rather defined the genus based on where the antibodies bind, they say.Amgen is not about to back down, though.""While we respect the court's decision in staying the injunction pending the appeal, Amgen remains confident in the validity of our patents and the correctness of the jury verdict and district court's judgment,"" Amgen said in a statement via email. ""We look forward to presenting our case on the lack of merit in defendants' appeal.""But Regeneron and Sanofi have already jumped a high hurdle. A Leerink analyst wrote in a Jan. 13 report that of 158 permanent injunctions in federal or district courts since 2006, only 23% were granted a stay.IBD'S TAKE: Regeneron has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 62, meaning it performs in the top half of all stocks in terms of key metrics like sales growth.

191,REGN,"Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average turn higher Friday after the Nasdaq composite closed Thursday below its 50-day moving average. Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) fell back below their 50-day lines, joining Apple, Netflix and many others. Some stocks, such as Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN), are holding support. But they are fighting against the tide.Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.4% vs. fair value after falling for much of the overnight session. Futures for the S&P 500 advanced 0.4% and Dow futures climbed 0.35%. Crude futures rose nearly 1% after gaining for several days in a row.XThis year's broad tech rally was fueled by several big trends: FANG+ (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet, plus Apple), China internets, chipmakers, optical gear plays and, more recently, enterprise software firms.But more and more stocks are breaking 50-day lines or round-tripping on breakouts.Apple tumbled below its 50-day moving average on June 10 and hasn't found a way back. Even with recent struggles, including Thursday's 1.5% loss, Apple is still up 24% in 2017, the third-best performer in the Dow Jones industrial average.Microsoft and Alphabet on Tuesday closed just below their 50-day lines and bounced back on Wednesday. On Thursday, both Microsoft and Google's parent fell more decisively below that key support line. Microsoft and Alphabet are among the biggest cloud-computing rivals to much-larger Amazon Web Services.IBD'S TAKE: The market direction is still uptrend under pressure, which means investors should be cautious about taking new positions and ready to take profits and cut losses quickly. Pay attention to the leading stocks and major averages and read The Big Picture daily.Facebook traded below its 50-day line intraday for the fifth time in June, but once again closed above that line. Facebook announced this week that it has topped two billion monthly users. What makes that even more amazing is that the social giant is blocked in China, the world's largest internet market.Amazon has pulled back toward its 50-day line but has found support so far. Amazon continues to roil the retail, apparel and broader consumer fields, with Nike (NKE) confirming in its Thursday night earnings call that it will sell some shoes directly via the e-commerce giant.Weibo (WB) and Momo (MOMO) have fallen below their 50-day lines. NetEase (NTES) is once again round-tripping its late-stage breakout. And Tencent (TCEHY) pulled back into its three-weeks-tight pattern.But Alibaba (BABA) remains strong, and YY (YY) found support above its 50-day and is still in buy range.IBD's semiconductor manufacturing and semiconductor fabless groups have fallen below their 50-day moving averages, a few days after the chip equipment group undercut that level.Apple iPhone chipmakers in particular are struggling. Broadcom (AVGO) finally fell below its 50-day line on Thursday after several other Apple chip plays did the same, including Skyworks (SWKS), Qorvo (QRVO), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Analog Devices (ADI).A slew of top-rated chip equipment makers, including Lam Research (LRCX) and Applied Materials (AMAT), are below their 50-day lines.Nvidia (NVDA) remains a standout.Fiber-optic stocks have been volatile leaders over the past year, as internet giants ramp up data centers, China beefs up infrastructure and Verizon (VZ) expands its high-speed metro broadband networks.But the Telecom-Fiber Optic group has fallen through its 50-day line. Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI), one of the hottest stocks in the group, is finding resistance there this week. Lumentum (LITE), which is seen as a possible Apple iPhone 3D sensor play, is close to round-tripping.Salesforce (CRM), Shopify (SHOP) and SAP (SAP) are all below their 50-day moving averages.Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE), which both had strong earnings last week, are holding up well so far.While many techs are weak, financials are making gains, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) a notable breakout this week. Big banks announced huge dividend hikes and stock buybacks late Wednesday after passing the second round of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests. Meanwhile, higher Treasury yields, while a negative for the broader stock market (and housing stocks in particular), also are giving a lift to financials.Meanwhile, biotechs have been big winners in June. Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN) are two big-name breakouts, but there have been others.Defense and aerospace firms like Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) have held up well, either within buy range or just extended.In Asian markets, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.9% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 1.7% but China's Shanghai composite rose 0.1% 0.2%.

192,REGN,"Apple (AAPL) continued to prove its rally from a bottoming base breakout in both October last year and in January may not be over yet, while biotechs and select chip stocks helped sustain the rebound in U.S. stocks Wednesday.The Nasdaq composite rallied more than 1.1% as of 2:30 p.m. ET, outperforming gains of 0.8% by the S&P 500 and 0.7% by the Dow Jones industrial average. Small caps are doing even better; the S&P SmallCap 600 gained 1.5%.X Turnover is running mildly lower vs. the same time Tuesday on both main exchanges. As noted in the latest Big Picture column, IBD downgraded the outlook on the market to ""Uptrend under pressure"" due to the sell-off on the Nasdaq in higher volume on Tuesday, known as distribution. A flurry of big distribution days is enough to halt a bull-market advance and even turn it into a bear market.Despite the lower turnover with less than two hours remaining in the stock market today, volume has been above average in all but one of the past 14 trading sessions for the Nasdaq.Banking stocks, meanwhile, resumed their advance following comments from Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen that appeared to indicate that another hike in short-term interest rates is in the cards for the rest of the year. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury benchmark bond edged to around 2.23%, the highest since May 29. WTI crude oil futures added more than 1% to $44.78 a barrel. Silver futures rose 1.1% while gold edged fractionally higher to nearly $1,250 a troy ounce on the Comex.Apple, up nearly 1.5% to 145.85, is still holding on to a large portion of its gain since its Jan. 6-9 breakout from an excellent cup with handle. That base furnished a 118.12 buy point, 10 cents above the handle's high of 118.02. Apple then gained as much as 32.5% in the space of just four months.A further rebound by the iPhone giant would produce a new buy point if shares were to hop back above the 50-day moving average, currently near 149. Watch to see if the stock can retake that line.The Street sees Apple's sales rebounding 5% to $226.6 billion in the current fiscal year ending in September, following a rare 8% slide in FY 2016. Profit is expected to climb 8% to $8.94 a share. Apple holds a 1.8% annualized dividend yield.IBD's TAKE: While Apple is getting a boost on the top line in recent quarters due to strong demand for its services, some observers question whether Apple will need to make an acquisition to fuel continued revenue gains in that area of business and fulfill its goal of doubling that business by 2020. Read IBD's latest tech team coverage on this increasingly vital part of Apple's business model. As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Apple's Relative Price Strength Rating continues to be positive at 84, meaning it's now beating 84% of all publicly traded companies in terms of 12-month relative price performance.Meanwhile, the biotech industry group is showing that it's not intending to backtrack from a leadership position in the stock market today. Some of this large industry group's biggest names, Celgene (CELG), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), are all behaving well and all three are trading above their respective 50-day moving averages, a sign of strength.Celgene, up more than 2% to 134.11, is wiping away losses from the prior two sessions. It broke out of a cup base with a 127.74 buy point last week. The 5% chase zone goes up to 134.12.Celgene sports a highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, a 98 for Earnings Per Share Rating, and an A+ for Accumulation/Distribution, which means that over the past 13 weeks, the stock has shown evidence of heavy share accumulation by mutual funds, banks, insurers, pensions and the like.Regeneron and Vertex are extended for now, but could provide follow-on buy points in the future. Watch for mild pullbacks to the 50-day or 10-week moving averages. Make sure that IBD's current outlook is showing either ""Confirmed uptrend"" or ""Uptrend under pressure,"" signifying the odds of making money on a breakout are higher.Vertex, up more than 1% to 131.05, is now extended more than 7% past a recent breakout past a 122.06 entry in a long, deep first-stage base, similar to that of a bottoming base pattern. In that base, Vertex crumbled 50.2%, creating a massive shakeout.In the chip sector, Broadcom (AVGO) and Nvidia (NVDA) are also showing leadership-quality gains. The former is also finding continued support along its 50-day line after a recent flat-base breakout at 227.85.Nvidia (98 Composite, 98 EPS) is extended from a May 10 breakout at 121.02. It has yet to challenge holders with a test of the 50-day moving average, which has been climbing sharply for more than six weeks.The Street sees fiscal second-quarter earnings jumping 68% to 69 cents a share, which is very impressive in light of the fact that Nvidia scored a 720% increase in adjusted EPS in the year-ago quarter, according to research by William O'Neil + Co.RELATED:How To Buy And When To Sell: The Latest In Investor's CornerWhen Did The Current Market Outlook Go To 'Uptrend Under Pressure'?

193,REGN,"Amgen's (AMGN) LDL-buster met key endpoints in a widely-anticipated cardiovascular study, the No. 1 biotech said Thursday, helping further separate it from Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY), which were recently banned from selling rival drug Praluent.The biotech leader also crushed Wall Street's Q4 and 2016 expectations, leading Amgen stock to spike 4% in after-hours trading, after ending the regular session down a fraction at 159.58. Shares of Regeneron and Sanofi jumped less than 1% after hours.For Q4, Amgen reported $6 billion in sales and $2.89 in earnings per share ex items, up a respective 8% and 11% vs. the year-earlier period. Both metrics topped the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $5.7 billion and $2.79.Amgen wrapped 2016 with $23 billion in sales, up 6%, and $11.65 EPS minus items, up 12%. Both figures topped views for $22.77 billion and $11.55.Guidance for $22.3 billion to $23.1 billion in 2017 sales was light, with the high end of Amgen's outlook missing the consensus for $23.3 billion in sales. Amgen also guided to $11.80-$12.60 EPS ex items, bracketing the consensus for $12.46.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead Sciences reports next week. Analysts have been bearish on Gilead, but have said Amgen could post a strong Q4 (it did). Grab more from the biotech leader sphere on IBD's Industry Themes.The Fourier results showed ""unequivocally the connection between lowering LDL cholesterol with Repatha and cardiovascular risk reduction, even in a population already treated with optimized statin therapy,"" Dr. Sean Harper, executive vice president of Amgen R&D, said in a release.Repatha met two key endpoints showing a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or coronary revascularization) in patients with clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.Amgen will present the full results during the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 66th Annual Scientific Session Late-Breaking Clinical Trials on March 17 in Washington, D.C.RELATED:Regeneron, Sanofi Could Appease LDL-Frustrated Buyers On Eczema DrugGilead Clobbered On Hep C; 'Too Little' Value In 'Too Late' NASH, HIV Units

194,REGN,"Shares of The Medicines Company (MDCO) outperformed Amgen (AMGN) early Friday, rocketing after No. 1 biotech Amgen said its LDL-buster Repatha curbs cardiac events — lending credibility to rival drugs, RBC analyst Michael Yee said.Amgen stock bounded up 5%, nearing a four-month high at 167.53 at the close on the stock market today. Shares flew into a buy zone Friday after hitting a 161.10 entry point out of a cup-with-handle formation.But The Medicines Company did better. Shares soared 21% to close at 45.96. The strong data from Amgen is likely to boost rival LDL programs from the likes of The Medicines Company, Gempshire Therapeutics (GEMP) and partners Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY), Yee said.Regeneron stock slid 0.6% to 358.26, on the news. Its partner Sanofi saw shares rise 0.3%, near 40.63.A Fourier study looked into whether Amgen's Repatha could help reduce CV events in at-risk patients. Late Thursday, Amgen said the drug met primary and secondary endpoints, but wouldn't elaborate pending the American College of Cardiology conference in March.Repatha's positive study ""keeps open the possibility that regulators could continue to approve drugs that lower LDL-cholesterol, especially ones that work via a similar pathway, prior to outcomes data reading out, such as The Medicines Company's inclisiran,"" Yee wrote in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead Sciences is slated to report its Q4 earnings and offer 2017 guidance next week. RBC is calling for Gilead to have a slow 2017 outlook on declining sales of hepatitis C drugs. Check out IBD's Industry Themes for a better picture.LDL-busters from Amgen and Regeneron/Sanofi belong to a class of drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors. The PCSK9 enzyme binds to LDL-cholesterol receptors, which stops LDL from being removed from the blood. PCSK9 inhibitors block the enzyme, allowing more LDL receptors to get to work.But The Medicines Company's inclisiran is a different class of PCSK9 inhibitor. It blocks PCSK9 synthesis in the liver via RNA interference. The difference is important. Last month, a judge banned Regeneron and Sanofi from selling Praluent, saying it infringes on Amgen's patents for Repatha.Amgen likely will be able to expand its label on Repatha in the aftermath of the Fourier study, Yee said. The efficacy specifics will be key. He expects 20%-25% efficacy, though anything better than that would be ""an outright, unequivocal positive.""Late Thursday, Amgen also announced its Q4 and 2016 results — crushing the consensus. Though 2017 sales guidance was a bit light and earnings per share minus items just met, there's still a lot in the air on Repatha vs. Praluent, Yee said.Regeneron and Sanofi are appealing the decision and asked for a stay of the injunction pending the ongoing litigation. Guidance includes a range of PCSK9 dynamics, which could be a $200 million to $500 million ""swing factor,"" Yee said.RELATED:Regeneron, Sanofi Could Appease LDL-Frustrated Buyers On Eczema DrugAmgen Could Gouge 'Top Pick' AbbVie With Humira Biosimilar: JefferiesBiotech Stocks Might Catalyze, Or Plunge, On 4 Key Sectors In 2017

195,REGN,"Though Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi's (SNY) LDL-buster lost in a patent battle with Amgen (AMGN), the duo could appease investors with an on-time approval of extreme eczema drug dupilumab, says RBC analyst Adnan Butt.Butt expects dupilumab to beat expectations and turn momentum positive. The latter is particularly important after a U.S. District Court judge on Jan. 6 sided with Amgen in a patent battle pitting Amgen's Repatha against Praluent. In her decision, the judge banned Regeneron and Sanofi's Praluent.Regeneron stock toppled 6% that day, and Sanofi shares dipped 3%. Since then, Regeneron shares have fallen an additional 3%. Praluent is slated to be pulled from shelves Feb. 21 if a federal circuit judge doesn't grant a stay on the injunction pending the appeal.Analysts have already largely removed Praluent from their expectations for Regeneron, Butt wrote in a research report Monday. Fortunately for Regeneron and Sanofi, an on-time approval for dupilumab to treat extreme atopic dermatitis looks likely, he says.""The FDA deemed the Sanofi facility 'acceptable' and Regeneron has a backup third-party facility it can use if it needs to,"" he wrote in a research report. ""We forecast sales of $123 million while consensus for 2017 is $177 million to 196 million.""IBD'S TAKE: Analysts are largely cautious on biotechs entering Q4 earnings season. But Incyte is grabbing bullish views on its slew of potential blockbuster drugs. Get more on The New America.Butt kept his outperform rating and 598 price target on Regeneron stock. In the stock market today, though, Regeneron stock slipped 0.58% to 344.50, and Sanofi edged up a fraction to 40.Regeneron's pipeline ""has delivered more than disappointed,"" Butt said.Besides dupilumab, he's bullish on Eylea, an injection for wet macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion. There, Regeneron faces competition from Novartis (NVS).On its Q4 earnings conference call with analysts last week, Novartis noted Phase 3 data for its wet AMD drug, RTH258, is due in Q2. Novartis is seemingly aiming at fewer objections, Adnan wrote. But ""Eylea sets a high bar,"" he added.""What would be worth watching is if RTH258 dries patients who remain nonresponsive to Eylea, similar to how Eylea gained share over Lucentis and Avastin,"" he wrote.This month, Regeneron preannounced $858 million in Q4 Eylea sales. Sequentially, growth has slowed over the past two quarters, but the consensus still sees year-over-year growth of 12% in 2017. A guide of 10% in 2017 could be well-received, Butt wrote.RELATED:Regeneron, Sanofi Claim Amgen's LDL-Buster Patent Too BroadOdds Are Against Regeneron, Sanofi In Amgen Patent Battle: LeerinkRegeneron, Sanofi Hammered After Judge Bans Amgen-Rivaling LDL-Buster

197,REGN,"Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) argue that Amgen's (AMGN) patents covering LDL-buster Repatha are too broad. And on Friday, the duo asked a federal judge to stay a permanent injunction of their rival drug, Praluent, pending the appeal.The ban on Praluent is set to go into effect Feb. 21. Regeneron and Sanofi argued in their request that the injunction is likely to be invalidated on appeal based on ""numerous flaws in the underlying judgment,"" which include the validity of Amgen's patents.In its patents, Amgen didn't identify any structural feature ""common to"" the genus, but rather defined the genus based on where the antibodies bind, Regeneron and Sanofi wrote. Like Repatha, Praluent prevents PCSK9 from binding to the LDL receptor. But Praluent is a different antibody with a different structure.""Remarkably, however, the district court precluded appellants from presenting evidence of Praluent's own structure, thereby preventing appellants from showing the jury that ... Repatha is more structurally similar to antibodies to influenza and the rabies virus than it is to Praluent,"" they wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Drug stocks took a beating last week on commentary from President-elect Donald Trump that he will require new bidding procedures to curb spiraling drug prices. Get the scoop in IBD's Industry Themes.In their argument, Regeneron and Sanofi say the injunction will cause them irreparable harm, whereas a stay pending the appeal would not irreparably harm Amgen.An injunction on Praluent is counter to public interest, Regeneron and Sanofi said, citing a case involving eBay (EBAY). That case set a number of prerequisites for issuing a permanent injunction. This case involves thousands of patients and shouldn't be the first in which the court grants a ban against public interest.""Put simply, this is not a case about cellphones and tablets; it is about heart attacks and strokes,"" Regeneron and Sanofi wrote. ""It is no exaggeration to say that the injunction will take lifesaving medicine away from thousands of patients and leave them with no adequate replacement.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, Regeneron stock had toppled hardest, down 1.3% to 363.24. Sanofi stock followed, down 1.2% to 40.96. Amgen stock dipped a fraction, closing at 154.80.RELATED:Could Sanofi Acquire BioMarin In Wake Of Amgen LDL Brouhaha?Regeneron, Sanofi Hammered After Judge Bans Amgen-Rivaling LDL-BusterAmgen, Regeneron 2017 LDL-Busters Could Boost This Small-Cap Biotech

198,REGN,"No. 1 biotech Amgen (AMGN) will likely triumph in a patent battle with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY), requiring the duo to pull LDL-buster Praluent from the shelves — an unprecedented first, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said Friday.Regeneron and Sanofi have asked a federal circuit judge to grant a stay of the injunction beyond 45 days. That would allow them to market Praluent during the appeal, which typically runs up 16 months, Porges wrote in a research report Friday.But the odds don't look good. Specialists believe ""regardless of the ultimate merits of Regeneron and Sanofi's case, they will face an unprecedented (and probably first) branded pharmaceutical product withdrawal in the middle of this quarter,"" he wrote.The most important catalyst will be whether the Federal Circuit extends the stay, Porges says. Of 158 permanent injunctions (PIs) granted in federal or district court since a 2006 case involving Ebay, only 37 parties (23%) were granted a stay.IBD'S TAKE: Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and The Medicines Company have a different-enough LDL drug that shouldn't touch Amgen's patents, analysts say. The Medicines Co. presented data at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Check out five key take-aways from the meeting.In Regeneron and Sanofi's case, though, it would be the first time a branded drug would be pulled from shelves as a result of patent litigation. They have made the argument that public interest would not be served by pulling Praluent, which offers a lower dosage than Amgen's Repatha.Examining medical-device cases, the district court has stayed a PI in five cases. But at the federal level, the PI was affirmed and not extended, resulting in the removal of those products from the market. Those precedents appear to be ""stacked"" against Regeneron and Sanofi, Porges said.To Regeneron and Sanofi's public interest argument, Porges noted that public interest is actually better served in siding with the patent holder, thus encouraging the risky investment required in bringing an innovative product to market.Porges also looks at several outcomes. It's possible that the case could be remanded to the district court. The federal circuit could also require Amgen, Regeneron and Sanofi to seek settlement assistance via the Circuit Mediation Office. But that process only happens in 10%-20% of cases.Amgen, the No. 1 biotech firm by market cap, is unlikely to settle, he wrote. The company ""notoriously takes the stance to never settle IP disputes and vigorously defends the company's IP, as evidenced by the blockage of market entry for Roche's Epogen competitor Mircera until the infringed patent expired.""In the stock market today, Amgen stock rose 0.49% to 156.12, but Regeneron rose 1% to 368.16 and Sanofi rose 2.1% to 41.47.RELATED:Could Sanofi Acquire BioMarin In Wake Of Amgen LDL Brouhaha?Regeneron, Sanofi Hammers After Judge Bans Amgen-Rivaling LDL-Buster

199,REGN,"Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) stocks were hammered Friday after a district judge banned their LDL-buster, Praluent, from selling in the U.S., ruling that it infringes on a pair of patents from No. 1 biotech Amgen (AMGN), which saw its shares jump.In the stock market today, Regeneron stock toppled 5.5% to 359.99, and Sanofi stock fell 2.7% to 40.37. Amgen stock, on the other hand, rose 2.5% to 157.15, hitting its highest price since late October. Regeneron and Sanofi have said they plan to appeal the decision.Amgen CEO Robert Bradway praised the injunction in a statement late Thursday: ""Protecting intellectual property is essential to our industry as it reinforces the incentives for the large and risky investments we make in innovation to bring forward new medicines to treat serious diseases.""Like Amgen's Repatha, Praluent is a PCSK9 inhibitor that lowers ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the blood. In their defense, Regeneron and Sanofi argued that more than 80% of patients on Praluent are able to hit acceptable LDL levels on the low 75-milligram dose.IBD'S TAKE: Bradway discussed Amgen's 2017 expectations in an exclusive interview with IBD.Amgen argued that it suffered irreparable harm and said that monetary damages would be insufficient. The judge sided with Amgen while noting that the public interest would be served by having the low dose of Praluent available to patients.The injunction sets up Praluent's removal from U.S. shelves, but it won't go into effect for 30 days, giving Regeneron and Sanofi time to either appeal or seek a settlement with Amgen. Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez doubts that Amgen will cave on its stance against a settlement.""We believe a stay of the injunction pending the outcome of the appeal is the most likely outcome — in our view,"" he wrote in a research note. ""Amgen's firm stance against a settlement suggests this could drag out for some time.""If the permanent injunction goes into effect by the end of January, which is unlikely, it could actually be earnings positive for Sanofi, Fernandez noted. PCSK9 sales have been lackluster, and Sanofi could add .03-.05 euros in earnings per share ex items in 2017-18 by eliminating Praluent marketing, he says.Fellow Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says Regeneron and Sanofi have been ""overspending"" on Praluent, a product associated with a $200 million per quarter loss. Those losses are increasing as the companies work to promote Praluent outside the U.S., he noted.Fernandez kept his outperform rating on Sanofi stock.RBC analyst Michael Yee estimates long-term peak sales of Repatha could hit $3 billion to $4 billion worldwide, up from $2 billion, as a result of Praluent's removal from the U.S. market.""Bottom line: important development today that could significantly improve visibility on long-term peak sales for Repatha,"" he wrote in a report. But in the medium-term, Amgen investors still want to see better visibility on Enbrel pricing and the Neulasta biosimilar from Coherus Biosciences, he said.Yee maintained his outperform rating on Amgen stock. Fellow RBC analyst Adnan Butt cut his price target on Regeneron stock to 598 from 626, though he kept his outperform rating. Chances of a reversal are low, he wrote, but Regeneron still has strength on Eylea and dupilumab.Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison called the ruling a win-win for Amgen. He expects an expedited review process to run three months, though other analysts expect Amgen to drag out the appeals process for up to two years. Harrison has an in-line view on the biotech sector as a whole.""At worst Amgen should now receive a likely sizable royalty on Praluent sales and at best if the injunction stands, Amgen would be a monopoly player in a large market,"" he wrote in a note. ""Either scenario would allow Amgen to accelerate its sales ramp for Repatha.""RELATED:Regeneron, Sanofi LDL-Buster At Risk After Judge Upholds Amgen's PatentsWhich Top 5 Biotech Stocks In 2016 Are Slated For Triple-Digit Gains?

202,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) went to the ""heart of the debate"" on Tuesday, questioning the validity of Amgen's (AMGN) patent on its LDL cholesterol-busting drug, Repatha, an analyst said following a court hearing.But Wall Street was split Wednesday on where the appeals court process would land. Analysts from investment bank Evercore expect Regeneron and Sanofi (SNY) to triumph, whereas a counterpart from Mizuho says there's a 55% chance of Amgen succeeding.On the stock market today, Regeneron rose 0.9% to 482. Amgen climbed 1.3% to 161.66. Shares of Regeneron partner Sanofi were down 1.75% to 48.34.On Tuesday, Regeneron and Amgen battled it out in a 45-minute appeals court hearing. At stake is the fate of Regeneron/Sanofi's drug, Praluent. A judge previously sided with Amgen, saying Regeneron/Sanofi's Praluent infringed Amgen's patent on the drug Repatha.The judge stayed an injunction on Praluent pending the appeals court process. But this is likely the end of the line if the appeals court sides with Amgen, Mizuho analyst Salim Syed said in a note to clients. The Supreme Court takes on very few patent cases.This decision will have broad implications for future patent struggles, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in an audio recording following the meeting. Amgen's patent covers an entire antigen, describing where it binds. Regeneron says this is too broad.""What Regeneron did was they went to the heart of the debate. They said, 'You know what? This patent shouldn't be valid to begin with,'"" he said. ""All Regeneron is saying is (Amgen's) patent should focus on what the invention is, not what it does.""Amgen says Praluent is too similar to its drug Repatha. If antibody patents can be circumvented by ""tweaking an amino acid,"" then there's no point in investing $2 billion in drug development if the return won't be realized, Syed said.IBD'S TAKE: Bioverativ (BIVV), a Biogen (BIIB) spinoff, has a three-year average return growth rate of 196%. See why it could be a smart investment by visiting IBD Stock Analysis.Regeneron noted Dow's Pfizer (PFE), at one time, tried unsuccessfully to develop a similar drug, also belonging to the PCSK9 inhibitor class. If Pfizer held all the intellectual property on PCSK9 inhibitors, neither Repatha nor Praluent would exist.""This example illustrates that even if similar, antibodies are different,"" Syed said. Raffat noted in his report Eli Lilly (LLY) and several others filed a brief in support of Regeneron.It's important to note if Praluent is booted from the market, Amgen's Repatha would be the sole PCSK9 inhibitor on the market. So the case will boil down to policy vs. emotions, Syed said.""If Amgen wins and Praluent is taken off the market, there could be pushback about only having one PCSK9 in the market and lessened competition,"" he said. ""If Praluent was to beat the injunction, that could signal that patents are not as relevant as one may think.""So the judges really seem to be considering the ""ramifications"" of their decision, Evercore analyst Akash Tewari said in the recording. Amgen's strategy of patenting an antigen — broader than an antibody — has yet to be tested in court.RELATED:Regeneron, Sanofi Undercut Amgen, AbbVie In Rheumatoid ArthritisTeva Pharma Ran A Migraine Trial — And Lilly, Amgen BenefitedHow Two Biotechs Fell On Cancer Partnerships With Bristol-Myers

206,REGN,"Biogen (BIIB) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) stocks popped Thursday after the European Commission approved an application for their costly spinal disease drug Spinraza, five months after the drug launched in the U.S.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Biogen stock climbed 1.9% to 252.38 as shares of its partner in Spinraza, Ionis, jumped 5.3% to finish the regular session at 48.23. Those increases outperformed IBD's 432-company Biomed/Biotech industry group, which rose just a fraction.European regulators approved Spinraza to treat the most common form of spinal muscular atrophy, affecting 95% of patients, Biogen said in a news release. The drug costs $125,000 per treatment at a cost of $750,000 in the first year. Spinal muscular atrophy is caused by the degeneration of certain cells, leading to the wasting of various muscle groups.The approval came under the European Medicines Agency's accelerated assessment program. The program, like a similar effort from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, aims to expedite access to drugs for patients with unmet medical needs.Access to Spinraza will vary by country, per local reimbursement and pathways, Biogen said. The company has been working with health systems and government agencies across Europe to open up access to Spinraza.IBD'S TAKE: U.S.-domiciled biotechs and pharmas will benefit the most under President Trump's proposed tax plan. That list includes Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen. Head to IBD's Technology page for a closer look at the potential winners and losers under tax reform.In the U.S., Spinraza is approved for three types of spinal muscular atrophy, but analysts have worried that payer pushback could hurt sales.But in the first quarter following its launch, Spinraza sales hit $47 million, Biogen said in April. That helped Biogen and Ionis stocks pop 3.6% and 4.7%, respectively.Ionis' website says that in 2016 Biogen exercised its rights to Spinraza and became responsible for its marketing, development and commercialization.

210,REGN,"Shares of The Medicines Company (MDCO) continued a nine-day uptrend Wednesday, splitting from partner Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) after the duo unveiled robust phase 2 results for a cholesterol-busting drug.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, The Medicines Co. stock climbed nearly 4% to close at 38.23, at a nearly two-month high. The stock is up 18% since its upswing began Nov. 4. Biotech stocks have benefitted from the election of Donald Trump, who is seen as less likely to tackle high drug prices.But Alnylam stock finished down more than 5.3%, to 45.67, falling for the second straight day. Still, shares are up 34% over the past two weeks.On Tuesday, The Medicines Co. and Alnylam revealed strong results for inclisiran, which belongs to a class of LDL-lowering drugs called PSCK9 inhibitors. PCSK9 is an enzyme that binds to LDL cholesterol, preventing LDL from being removed from the blood.Rival PCSK9 inhibitors include Repatha from Amgen (AMGN) and Praluent from Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY).IBD'S TAKE: Biotech and drug stocks have benefited from the election of Donald Trump, but worry lingers over whether he'll appeal the Affordable Care Act. Get the full scoop, including potential winners and losers, on IBD's Industry Themes.Inclisiran reduced LDL cholesterol by 51% at day 60 and by 45% at day 90 for patients who received one 300-milligram dose. In patients trialed for 180 days, inclisiran cut LDL by 59%, 50% and 43% at days 60, 90 and 180, the companies said.Patients who received doses at days 1 and 60 saw LDL reductions of 57% at day 120 and 52% at day 180. RBC analyst Adnan Butt estimates patients will likely not have to be dosed more than three times a year.Butt says safety questions have been addressed. A single patient died of a heart attack, but he says The Medicines Co. and key opinion leaders say inclisiran wasn't to blame. Liver enzyme elevation in a single patient was attributed to statin therapy.""Importantly, there does not appear to be any dose dependent relationship in any of the safety parameters,"" Butt wrote in a research report. He has an outperform rating on The Medicines Co. stock, and boosted his price target to 52 from 45.Still, payors block 80% of PCSK9 prescriptions, RBC analyst Michael Yee wrote in a separate report. Adjusted for payor hurdles, The Medicines Co. pulls in $1.6 billion in annualized sales up from $1 billion in Q2 and $585 million in Q1, Butt said.Based on the percentage of PCSK9 prescriptions blocked and sales from Amgen and Regeneron, the duo would be printing a $1 billion run rate if restrictions were opened up, Yee wrote. That could happen in Q1 2017, if Amgen presents positive cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) data in Q1.That ""should be a incremental positive fundamental and sentiment driver for PCSK9, and help move the needle in getting payors to open up access over time, change guidelines and drive more usage,"" he wrote.Yee has an outperform rating on Amgen stock, which was up a fraction Wednesday afternoon, near 148.RELATED:Which Four Biotechs Are Derisked, Buyable Ahead Of Election Day?Medicines Co.

211,REGN,"IBD's Medical-Biotech/Biomed group continued its post-election advance on Monday, rising nearly 2% intraday. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) was among the few big-cap biotechs moving heavily in strong volume. But a slew of smaller biotechs with big gains or losses, including Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN),  Corbus Pharmaceuticals (CRBP), Dynavax Technologies (DVAX) and Puma Biotechnology (PBYI).Regeneron Pharmaceuticals rose 6% to 444.94 on the stock market today, nearly hitting a nine-month high on the stock market today. Best known eye-care drug Eylea, Regeneron has surged since hitting a 2-year low of 325.35 on Nov. 4, when it reported quarterly earnings.Supernus Pharmaceuticals leapt 10.65% to 23.90, crossing back above its 50-day moving average. Supernus has rallied for six straight sessions, regaining its 200-day last week. The stock broke out of a short consolidation in September, hitting a record high on Sept. 28. But Supernus broke down, rendering its old buy point moot.Supernus, which develops drugs for central nervous system diseases, on Monday said Q3 sales rose 44% to $55.1 million.Corbus Technologies shot up 52% to 8.90, back above its 50-day line. Corbus rose as high as 10.30 intraday, near last month's peak of 10.78.Corbus announced positive stage 2 clinical trial results for Resunab in treating diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis was safe and exceeded company expectations.On the downside, Dynavax Technologies cratered 65% to 4.10, hitting its lowest level since December 2008. The FDA didn't approve its Hepatitis B treament, requesting additional information in a complete response letter.Puma Biotechnology lost 20% to 40.10 as the stock struggles to make headway after crashing from its 2014 peaks. Puma Bio announced that breast cancer patients taking its experimental treatment neratinib will need two drugs, not one, for deal with serious diarrhea as a side effect.
"
212,REGN,"IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group surged Monday, topping broader Nasdaq and S&P 500 markets ahead of Election Day, but only four names are derisked and buyable now, says RBC analyst Adnan Butt.Butt suggests investors zero in on shares of Aerie Pharmaceuticals (AERI), The Medicines Co. (MDCO), Seattle Genetics (SGEN) and Tesaro (TSRO), which all recently completed strong trial results and are less risky than other drug stocks while also potential M&A candidates.None of the four is in an IBD buy zone. Most recently, Seattle Genetics stock achieved a cup-with-handle formation July 20, but then gained more than 20% by early September, so investors were encouraged to take at least some profits.All four stocks closed higher on the stock market today. Aerie stock rose 3.8%, Seattle Genetics gapped up 6.2%, Tesaro added 2,8% and The Medicines Co. gained 1.7%. Collectively, the biotech industry group rose 3.8%.But Medicines sank 9% after hours when it said it discontinued the development of MDCO-216, a potential cholesterol drug.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech Ionis is up more than 18% on a key spinal muscular atrophy drug study with partner Biogen. But neither is on IBD's Stocks On The Move list. So, who's really speeding today? Check it out.Last week, Aerie pulled its new drug application from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Rhopressa, a glaucoma drug, after its third-party manufacturer said its facility wasn't prepared. But the extension gives Aerie time to include successful data from two additional trials.The stock is ""derisked with Rhopressa phase 3 data making it appear approvable for glaucoma,"" Butt wrote in a research report Monday.Carbavance for urinary tract infections and a cholesterol-busting PCSK9si from The Medicines Co. look good, Butt wrote. Seattle has Adcetris for Hodgkin lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma and the opportunity to expand into other cancers.Meanwhile, Tesaro is likely to expand niraparib outside ovarian cancer to lung, breast and prostate cancer, Butt says. Niraparib is battling against already-approved Lynparza from rival AstraZeneca (AZN). But analysts say AstraZeneca's olaparib appears to be capable of treating a much smaller patient population than niraparib.In Butt's second ""bucket"" of drug-stock picks, some risks still remain for Aptose Biosciences (APTO), Curis (CRIS), Gempshire Therapeutics (GEMP), Intra-Cellular Therapies (ITCI), Nabriva Therapeutics (NBRV) and Synthetic Biologics (SYN). The valuation appears ""very cheap"" for Aptose with two anti-cancer drugs that could start phase 1 trials in 2017, he says.For ArQule (ARQL), Endoctye (ECYT), Ocular Therapeutix (OCUL), BioPharma (PDLI), Regeneron (REGN), Scynexis (SCYX), Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (SPPI) and Xoma (XOMA), ""buying is a matter of timing,"" Butt wrote. ""Upcoming data or events could be considered an overhang for one reason or another, or there is simply not enough data available.""RELATED:Tesaro Bolts On Ovarian Cancer Win Vs.

213,REGN,"Down, down and down. That was the ETF market story this week as election uncertainties jangled investors' nerves. Voters head to the polls Tuesday to elect the next president of the United States.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) wobbled on the stock market today before closing lower for the fourth straight trading session.This exchange traded fund, a proxy for the broad U.S. market, sits 5% below its August high of 219.60 after posting a 1.9% weekly loss. It closed almost even with the 40-week moving average, a support level.Every sector of the S&P 500 fell this week. Materials fared relatively well, falling 0.7%, in a week when gold broke resistance at the $1,300-an-ounce level and gave mining companies a boost.Technology fared worst, tumbling 2.7% in a week when Facebook's (FB) forecast of slower revenue growth sent the stock sharply lower.On Friday, some of the biggest gains among nonleveraged ETFs came from biotechs.SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) jumped nearly 3.0% but posted a 3.5% weekly loss in big volume.Shares of Regeneron (REGN) popped after the drugmaker soundly beat earnings estimates. That was not enough to keep the stock from falling for the sixth week in a row.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) gave up early gains of more than 9.0% to close up 1.2%, continuing its post-earnings surge. It too booked a weekly loss.United States Oil (USO), a commodity exchange trade investing in crude futures, fell for a third consecutive day. It posted a 9.4% weekly loss.West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell sharply amid concerns over U.S. inventories as well as the ability of major oil producers to strike a deal to curb output.IBD'S TAKE: The best stocks tend to have high margins that are steady or growing, so look for companies that have the pricing power to withstand rising wages.

214,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) stock bounded Friday on a 42-cent Q3 earnings beat, but shares are largely muzzled on a pending court decision pitting Regeneron and Sanofi (SNY) against No. 1 biotech Amgen (AMGN).In the stock market today, Regeneron stock rose 1.6% to 341.39, earlier rising as much as 4.7%. Shares, though, are down 37% this year, and IBD's 241-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group has fallen 29% amid the volatile election season high high-drug-prices controversies.Several disruptors in 2017 could rout Regeneron's stock, RBC analyst Adnan Butt wrote in a research note.Regeneron and Sanofi are awaiting a Delaware court's decision after Amgen filed a lawsuit saying their cholesterol drug, Praluent, violated its patent on Repatha. Both are PCSK9 inhibitors (Pfizer (PFE) just ended development on a similar drug). In its suit, Amgen is asking that Praluent be taken off the shelves.IBD'S TAKE: The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF jumped on Regeneron's Q3 earnings beat and Alexion Pharmaceuticals' continued Q3 wave. To get your feet wet in ETFs, visit the ETFs and Funds page.Good data from rivals Ophthotech (OPHT) and Novartis (NVS), which is working on a phase 3 trial for Fovista, could also be painful for Regeneron, Butt noted. Fovista, a drug to combat wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), would compete with Regeneron's bread-and-butter drug Eylea.During Q3, Eylea pulled in $854 million in sales, up 16% vs. the year-earlier quarter. That edged views for $853 million, and Regeneron raised the low end of its 2016 U.S. Eylea guidance. It now sees 23%-25% growth over 2015, which would be about $3.29 billion to $3.45 billion in sales.Praluent came in with $38 million vs. $40 million from Amgen's Repatha. That was in line with the consensus, Butt wrote. For the year, the consensus expects $135 million in Praluent sales. Sanofi reimbursement for Praluent is expected to dip $5 million at the high end of guidance.Early Friday, Regeneron posted $3.13 earnings per share ex items on $1.22 billion in sales for Q3, up 9.8% and 7.3%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. EPS topped the consensus of 25 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $2.71, but sales missed the $1.29 billion expectation.Updated guidance implies Regeneron will end 2016 with $10.89-$12.19, Evercore analyst John Scotti estimated in a report. That would be down 4.4% at the midpoint.RELATED:Align, Incyte, GrubHub Among Best R&D Stock Plays: Goldman Sachs

215,REGN,"Shares of drug giant Pfizer (PFE) fell Tuesday after the company said it would end development of a cholesterol-lowering drug projected to be a blockbuster, reduced its earnings outlook for the current quarter and posted Q3 EPS that just missed Wall Street expectations.Pfizer stock fell 2.1% to 31.06 in the stock market today. The member of the Dow Jones 30 industrials is trading at a nearly seven-month low, after touching a 12-year high above 37 on Aug. 1.Ceasing work on the injection drug, called bococizumab, was unexpected. The company said it proved to have unexpected side effects and was becoming less effective.Wall Street had modeled $1.5 billion in peak annual sales for bococizumab, Evercore ISI analyst John Scotti said in a note to clients. ""PFE was clear that they do not see this attenuation of benefit in competitive data"" from Amgen (AMGN) and Regeneron (REGN), he wrote. The problem ""appears to be bococizumab specific,"" Scotti said.IBD'S TAKE: Pfizer's megadeal to buy Allergan went bust in April. Could AT&T's $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner go the same direction?For Q3, the drugmaker said revenue rose 8% from the year-earlier quarter, to $13.05 billion, while earnings per share inched up 2% to 61 cents. Revenue met views, but EPS missed by a penny, according to Evercore ISI analyst John Scotti.For 2016, Pfizer now guides to EPS of $2.38-$2.43, down from its earlier guidance of $2.38-$2.48, and to sales of $52 billion-$53 billion, vs. earlier guidance of $51 billion-$53 billion.Pfizer attributed the miss to higher-than-expected COGS, cost of goods sold, tied to foreign exchange rates, Scotti said. Sales of breast cancer drug Ibrance were ""marginally below consensus,"" Scotti said, but ""Prevnar delivered a small beat."" Sales of Prevnar, a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, missed forecasts in Q2.""Our Innovative Health business executed strongly behind the latest product launches, and our two recent acquisitions — Medivation and Anacor — are providing new near-term opportunities to potentially drive incremental growth for the business as its product pipeline continues to mature,"" Pfizer CEO Ian Read said in the earnings release. ""We see this business as highly focused on those therapeutic areas where it is best positioned to deliver value to patients.""By maintaining our overall high level of financial flexibility and discipline, we are in a strong position to support the strategic initiatives for each business and will remain opportunistic to business development activity in addition to continuing to actively manage our cost structure.""In August, Pfizer announced its agreement to acquire Medivation, maker of prostate cancer drug Xtandi, for $14 billion. This came after New York-based Pfizer and Ireland-based Allergan (AGN) in April called off their planned merger, which would have been the industry's largest ever, after U.S. regulators set up roadblocks to so-called tax-inversion mergers, where U.S. companies looked to set up headquarters in lower-tax regions such as Ireland.In September, Pfizer said it would not split into two separate companies, a move it had mulled for several years. It had been expected to separate its Essential Health business, consisting of older, off-patent medications, and its Innovative Health business, which is dedicated to newer drugs.RELATED:Surprise Twist: Pfizer Won't Split UpLilly, AbbVie Lead 2017 Rankings, Pfizer Challenged

220,REGN,"A federal judge sided with No. 1 biotech Amgen (AMGN) late Tuesday, upholding a pair of patents related to LDL cholesterol-buster Repatha and dealing a blow to Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY), which make a rival drug.But RBC analyst Michael Yee says it's unlikely that U.S. District Court Judge Sue Robinson will issue an injunction to pull Regeneron and Sanofi's Praluent from the shelves — that would create a hole sized in the billions for Amgen to fill.""Importantly, we estimate a 75%-plus consensus view that Sanofi/Regeneron will not be blocked from the market,"" Yee wrote in a research report Wednesday. ""If they were, we think Amgen stock could go up more than 5-7% pretty quickly given billions of revenue at risk for the competitor.""IBD'S TAKE: In an exclusive interview with IBD, Amgen CEO Robert Bradway touched on the anti-CGRP migraine, Alzheimer's and oncology markets.The decision Tuesday was just one of four steps to resolve the matter. If Robinson orders an injunction on Praluent, Regeneron and Sanofi could appeal to a higher court. But it's more likely that she will determine a royalty, potentially 5%-8%, to be paid to Amgen, says Yee.""Most investors believe the courts would not block a second drug because Regeneron would add competition and this supports the public good,"" he wrote.The suit began in October 2014 when Amgen accused Regeneron and Sanofi of violating a patent by also targeting the PCSK9 protein to block bad cholesterol. The Food and Drug Administration approved Praluent, Regeneron and Sanofi's, drug in July 2015.In March, a jury agreed with Amgen. Regeneron and Sanofi asked Robinson to begin a new trial.In the stock market today, Amgen stock rose 1.4% to 152.87, while Regeneron stock rose 0.9% to 383.11. Sanofi stock, however, fell 0.41% to 40.85.Yee kept outperform ratings on Amgen and Regeneron stocks.RELATED:Which Top 5 Biotechs In 2016 Are Slated For Triple Digit GainsRegeneron Likely To Jump On Amgen LDL-Buster, But Expectations Too High

221,REGN,"Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) could eye BioMarin (BMRN) and The Medicines Co. (MDCO) in the wake of a U.S. judge's ban on their Amgen (AMGN)-rivaling LDL-buster, RBC and Leerink analysts suggested Friday.Late Thursday, a district judge ruled that Regeneron and Sanofi's Praluent infringes on a pair of Amgen patents for Repatha, a PCSK9 inhibitor that lowers LDL, or ""bad,"" cholesterol in the blood. The decision sent Regeneron and Sanofi stocks into the red.In the stock market today, Regeneron stock fell 5.5% to 359.99, while Sanofi stock fell 2.7% to 40.37. Amgen, which had its patents reaffirmed, enjoyed a 2.5% gain, to 157.15.IBD'S TAKE: The biotech sector suffered a raucous election year in 2016, but five leaders ended the year with triple-digit gains. Were your stock picks on that list? Get the deep dive on IBD Industry Themes.BioMarin Pharmaceutical stock rose 0.65% to 86.85, and The Medicines Co. jumped 1.4% to 36.23, on the suggestion that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals or Sanofi could issue a bid on them to make up the $1 billion to $2 billion lost on the potential removal of Praluent from the U.S. market. BioMarin has a market cap near $15 billion, while The Medicines Co. has a cap near $2.5 billion.France-based Sanofi, which has a market cap near $104 billion, has been particularly vexed in recent years on M&A. It lost out on Medivation and its blockbuster cancer drug, Xtandi, in a battle with Pfizer (PFE) last year. Last month, Sanofi was said to be jockeying with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) for Swiss biotech Actelion Pharmaceuticals.""The revenue loss may theoretically cause Sanofi to continue to increase its M&A activity and we have written BioMarin makes a good fit because of its pure play orphan franchises, which are synergistic with Sanofi's orphan franchises,"" RBC analyst Michael Yee said Friday in a research note.Yee estimates BioMarin as a $20 billion to $21 billion deal, slightly above Sanofi's acquisition price of Genzyme for $20 billion several years ago. He has an outperform rating and 125 price target on BioMarin stock.Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz sees The Medicines Co. appealing to Regeneron, Sanofi or any parties interested in the PCSK9 space. The Medicines Co. and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) have partnered on inclisiran, a drug aimed at lowering LDL cholesterol.Schwartz notes in the aftermath of the Praluent injunction, set to go into effect in 30 days, that inclisiran is ""second in line to come to market in the PCSK9 space."" A New England Journal of Medicine article describes inclisiran as an RNA interference therapeutic inhibitor of PCSK9.In November, The Medicines Co. and Alnylam delivered strong results for inclisiran in a phase two trial. Investors should expect more clarity on phase three testing in Q1, Schwartz wrote. He has an outperform rating on shares of The Medicines Co.RELATED:Regeneron, Sanofi LDL-Buster At Risk After Judge Upholds Amgen PatentsMedtronic Downgraded On Increased Boston, St. Jude, J&J Rivalries

223,REGN,"Investors who want to sharpen their selling skills in growth stocks should always pay attention to what's happening on a chart. This is IBD's philosophy: The daily and weekly charts can truly be your best friends in the stock market.Why? They give you facts, not the opinion of just one investor or two.Now, to use charts correctly, you don't have to sit there and watch every tick. You can view a daily chart after the session's close to determine if any red flags have been raised. The weekly chart provides the most insight on supply vs. demand toward the end of the week.One big red flag to help time your exit: Watch out for downside price reversals that close near or at their session lows, especially when volume soars well above normal levels.A downside or negative reversal takes place when a stock runs up sharply intraday, then changes course and ends down in price or flat for the day.While reversals can take place on a daily chart, they can appear on weekly and monthly charts. Reversals occur in individual stocks, as well as in market indexes like the Nasdaq and S&P 500.Not all downside reversals are a cause for concern. A high-priced stock that turns tail and ends a point lower in average volume isn't necessarily worrisome.But after an intraday boom to bust takes place and a stock doesn't resume its rally, keep close watch. It may mean that institutional investors are not enthusiastically coming in to grab shares.A negative reversal and close near the day's price low is especially bad if it follows a long, sharp run. Many times, turnover will be sharply above its average level over the past 50 trading sessions. (All IBD daily charts feature a red line running across the volume bars to signify the 50-day moving average. On a weekly chart, the red line represents the 10-week moving average in volume.)Sometimes the reversal marks a failing breakout from a late-stage base. In such a case, sell fast to cut losses or take profits.A big downside reversal can coincide with a climax run, which is another key sell signal. Bad reversals may involve the heaviest daily volume since the start of the stock's big move, the largest one-day point loss, or the widest daily or weekly price spread ever.Solar stocks were red hot in 2007. SunPower (SPWR), one of the best performers, recovered from a third pullback to the 50-day moving average following its initial breakout in December 2006. In September 2007, the stock ramped to new highs.On Nov. 8, SunPower surged as much as 13% intraday, hitting an all-time high of 164.49. At its best levels that day, the stock was up more than 100% since the start of its rebound two months ago.But SunPower then showed a big change of heart and ended 2% lower in huge volume (1).The price spread from high to low was nearly 20%. SunPower fell 68% by March 2008 and kept sliding until last year. It traded in single digits before rebounding.Does the same signal happen today? Certainly. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) posted a sharp reversal on Aug. 4 last year. Even though the stock rose 4.8% that day in big volume and hit a new high of 605.93, the daily chart shows it finishing in the lower half of the intraday trading range.The stock cooled off, formed a two-month double-bottom base, then broke out on Oct. 27, running past the 557.97 pivot point. However, just a week later, the biotech staged another unsavory price reversal. On Nov. 4, Regeneron rose as high as 588 but closed down more than 2% at 564. Volume jumped sharply. The rally quickly unraveled. Shares are now at 362, down more than 40% off it's all-time high.In the gold mining industry group, Randgold (GOLD) presented a very rare ""island top"" formation as it peaked on July 6 this year. That day, the stock rallied more than 2% in volume that more than doubled to 2.3 million shares; that was also one of its heaviest sessions since Jan. 1. However, Randgold finished in the lower half of its intraday range after creating a price gap in which the day's low of 124.28 exceeded the prior day's high of 122.98.Note how the stock was already rising in a nearly vertical, climax run-like state on its daily chart from June 24 to July 5.(Editor's Note: This column originally published in the May 9, 2013, edition of IBD.

224,REGN,"President-elect Donald Trump and a Republican Congress are likely to create an M&A-friendly tax scenario, prodding more acquisitions from the small- and mid-cap biotech pool, RBC analyst Adnan Butt said Thursday.Early in his campaign, Trump proposed cutting the tax to repatriate cash stashed abroad to 10%. Some big drugmakers and companies such as Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) avoid higher U.S. taxes by keeping billions of dollars overseas.A similar effort under former President George W. Bush in 2004 brought $312 billion back to the U.S., according to Fortune. In 2016 and 2017, M&A in the biopharma sector could seen a boon under Trump's proposal, Butt wrote in a research report.""The pace could accelerate if changes in the tax code support this trend by facilitating the repatriation of cash 'trapped' overseas for bigger biopharma companies,"" he wrote, adding the trend would be especially beneficial for truly innovative biotechs.Cancer drug companies like Aptose Biosciences (APTO), ArQule (ARQL), Endocyte (ECYT), Curis (CRIS), Seattle Genetics (SGEN) and Tesaro (TSRO) have the advantage of boosting progression-free survival (PFS) with their drug candidates, he wrote. Curis' oral checkpoint inhibitors could be truly disruptive, he says.IBD'S TAKE: Uncertainty lingers in the drug and biotech market on concerns Trump could upend American health care by repealing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Check out Industry Themes for more on what this could mean for those sectors.Seattle Genetics and Tesaro are working in areas of keen biopharma interest, he wrote. Seattle has trials in Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia and several solid tumor types. Tesaro is working to treat ovarian, breast, lung and prostate cancer.Butt also sees promise in Aerie Pharmaceuticals' (AERI) glaucoma drug and Regeneron's (REGN) wet/dry age-related macular degeneration/diabetic macular edema. The Medicines Company (MDCO), Nabriva Therapeutics (NBRV), Scynexis (SCYN), Synthetic Biologics (SYN) and Xoma (XOMA) are working to treat unmet medical needs.Gempshire (GEMP) and Intra-Cellular Therapies (ITCI) are looking to treat high cholesterol and schizophrenia, respectively, using new mechanisms.More broadly, RBC analyst Michael Yee calls biotech a ""coiled spring"" in the post-Trump-election world. Biotech stocks have suffered uncertainty amid Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's call for tighter controls on drug prices and a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into alleged collusion.But it's a long play in biotechs, Yee says. Generalist investors aren't totally ready to jump back into biotechs -- IBD's 421-company Medical/Biomed/Biotech industry group is down 19% for the year despite climbing nearly 10% Wednesday on postelection hype.In the stock market today, the biotech group again rose, this time more than 2%. Among larger biotechs, the leaders were Axovant Sciences (AXON) and Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical (RARE), up 9.6% and 9.8%, respectively.""In a new environment where biotech is not as much a bullseye with a Republican Congress and (Sen. Bernie) Sanders/Clinton losing their 'bully pit,' we think future rhetoric doesn't mean much of anything for now, making biotech more 'investable' for folks,"" Yee said.RELATED:Which Four Biotechs Are Derisked, Buyable Ahead Of Election Day?Tesaro's Ovarian Cancer Drug Has Edge Vs.

225,REGN,"Biotech stocks climbed for the third consecutive day Tuesday, with mid-cap Tesaro (TSRO) forging the way, but among the largest companies, Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG) are buyable now, says Mizuho analyst Salim Syed.Syed initiated coverage Tuesday on Amgen, Gilead and Celgene stocks with buy ratings. He also initiated on Biogen (BIIB), but with a neutral rating on the lack of near- or medium-term catalysts and uncertainty after former CEO George Scangos resigned in July.""To be clear, we still think Biogen has some good programs and it could be a matter of time before we get excited again ... just not right now,"" Syed wrote in a research report. He has a 290 price target on Biogen stock, which slipped 2 cents Tuesday to 295.60.IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group lifted a fraction on the stock market today. But the volatile election season has strangled shares, causing the group to topple 16% over the past seven weeks.IBD'S TAKE: Syed has a neutral rating on Biogen stock, but shares are looking better after Biogen and Ionis announced early efficacy in phase 3 testing of a spinal muscular atrophy drug. Check out Industry Themes for the full take.Syed likened Amgen to a jogger. He has a 164 price target on the stock, down a fraction to 138.45 on Tuesday.""Before Amgen's most recent Q3 call, we thought of Amgen largely as a 'ho-hum' steady stock, a jogger if you will,"" he wrote. ""However, since Amgen's Q3 call (about 1.5 weeks ago), the stock has come down about 12%.""Enbrel commentary during the Q3 call spooked investors, he says. Sales of the immunosuppressant were flat at $1.45 billion and, given contract negotiations, Amgen expects ""relatively little benefit from net selling price changes in 2017"" for Enbrel.Wall Street has been predicting a decline in Amgen's legacy businesses for some time. But Syed sees a silver lining in new drugs, like Amgen's Repatha, a cholesterol-busting PCSK9si rival of Sanofi (SNY) and Regeneron's (REGN) Praluent.Repatha already has U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, but sales have suffered on restricted access, Syed wrote. Repatha is currently in phase 3 testing to treat cardiovascular outcomes and, in September, met primary and secondary endpoints in a phase 3 test for coronary artery disease.CV data are expected in Q1. Syed calls this ""the most important data event for Amgen."" A positive event could pull Amgen stock out of the dumps. Shares hit a two-year low Friday, though they managed to close up fractionally for the day.Gilead managed the impossible in 2013-14 after it launched Hepatitis C (HCV) drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni and tripled its revenue to become a $30 billion company, Syed wrote in a separate report. But the duo are cures for HCV and, therefore, won't last forever.""The flip side of developing a cure is eventually the disease will be eradicated,"" he wrote. ""While great for patients, this means declining revenues over time. This has been weighing on Gilead's stock as the answer of slope of decline isn't exactly clear.""For Q3, Gilead's hep C trio -- Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa -- brought in $3.3 billion in sales, down 31% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Epclusa, which launched in June and July in the U.S. and Europe helped to offset declines in Sovaldi and Harvoni.Syed models 10% year-over-year declines in HCV sales for Gilead.But Gilead is working on its next leg of growth, Syed says. He has an 88 price target on Gilead stock. Its nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and Hepatitis B (HBV) drugs are still too early in their pipelines. Plus, Gilead is facing NASH competition from Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) and Allergan (AGN).Gilead isn't ""a table-pounding buy,"" but the stock is undervalued and the company will likely perform over time, rewarding patient investors, Syed wrote.Gilead stock rose 4 cents Tuesday to 74.04.If Celgene is a castle, chemotherapy drug Revlimid is its moat, Syed says. During Q3, Revlimid sales grew 30% vs. last year to $1.89 billion, driven by new market share gains and increased duration. Revlimid is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), multiple myeloma, and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).Revlimid ""allows Celgene to grow its next sources of revenue,"" Syed wrote in a separate report. ""(Revlimid is) still a growing part of the business and a value add to Celgene, but this part of the business is fairly well established and mature.""Inside its moat, Celgene has cancer drugs durvalumab and CAR-T in conjunction with AstraZeneca (AZN) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), respectively. Celgene is also working on its next-generation replacement for Revlimid, which is expected to go generic in 2022 and be fully generic in 2026.At its core, Celgene has ozanimod, currently in phase 3 testing for multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis, and GED-301, an investigational Crohn's disease drug. These are central to Celgene's investment thesis, says Syed. He has a 130 price target on Celgene stock, which rose 0.89% Tuesday to 108.45.RELATED:Which Four Biotechs Are Derisked And Buyable Ahead Of Election Day?Amgen, Gilead, Eli Lilly Eat Into AbbVie's Humira Sales: AnalystGilead NASH Drug 'Active And Promising,' But Lagging InterceptAllergan Challenges Intercept With Tobira NASH Drug

226,REGN,"Major stock indexes held big gains in afternoon trading Monday, cheered by news over the weekend that the FBI closed its investigation of Hillary Clinton's email issues for a second time.Various polls still point toward a tight race, one day ahead of Election Day. The latest IBD/TIPP poll shows Republican Trump at 43.1%, Democrat Clinton at 40.7%, Libertarian Gary Johnson at 6.3%, Green Jill Stein at 2.2%. The margin of error in the poll is plus or minus 3.1%.The Nasdaq composite rallied 2.3%, helped by strength in biotech stocks.  The S&P 500 rose 2% and the Dow Jones industrial average added 1.9%. Volume was tracking slightly lower than Friday's levels in the stock market today.JPMorgan (JPM), UnitedHealth (UNH) and Microsoft (MSFT) outperformed in the Dow with gains of around 3%. Apple (AAPL) lagged, rising 1%, after KGI Securities said iPhone shipments are likely to drop in the first half of 2017, primarily due to weak demand in China.Biotechs led the Nasdaq 1oo as names like Biogen (BIIB), Regeneron (REGN) and Incyte (INCY) showed gains of 5%-7%.Twenty IBD 50 components rose 3% or more, including Nvidia (NVDA), which reports earnings Thursday after the close. It's extended after a recent breakout from a flat base with a 63.59 entry. Group peer Inphi (IPHI) also did well Monday, rising nearly 4%. It's back above its 50-day moving average after a failed breakout over a 44.64 buy point.Ferrari (RACE) thundered 7% higher to 54.84 after scoring a strong third-quarter beat and raised guidance.

227,REGN,"Total prescriptions of Pfizer (PFE) eczema drug Eucrisa have flattened out over recent weeks as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi's (SNY) Dupixent has picked up steam, according to data from health care tracker MS.After a meteoric rise to 3,500 prescriptions nine weeks after Eucrisa's launch, scripts of the topical eczema ointment have tallied between 3,000 and 4,000 over the past eight weeks. Injection Dupixent has yet to see a dip, hitting 807 prescriptions by week nine.Pfizer attributes the flatter trend to a decrease in free trial vouchers for Eucrisa, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a research report. Pfizer estimates a third of total scripts for Eucrisa are from the free trial vouchers.Still ""Eucrisa total prescriptions excluding free trial vouchers are growing well — up 13% in the most recent rolling four weeks vs. the previous four weeks while free trial voucher prescriptions were down 18% in the same period,"" Raffat said.IBD'S TAKE: At least one analyst is predicting another boom in biotech. But it won't be the big names leading the charge, he says. Head to IBD's Technology page for a closer look at which stocks look strong this year.But demand looks likely to continue on an upward trend for Dupixent, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said, citing four physicians working in dermatology.""The biggest takeaways from our discussions were the consistent suggestion that these physicians believe the moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis population is as large or larger than the moderate-to-severe psoriasis population,"" he said.Each physician interviewed expects to start 10-15 patients on Dupixent by year's end.""Physicians would not comment if Dupixent's use in (eczema) could be similar to the percentage of patients who receive biologics treatment for psoriasis,"" he said. ""But (they) believed it had huge potential as physicians gained comparable experience.""Overall, an average 60%-70% of eczema patients seen by the four doctors were adults. But Dupixent has the potential to be a game-changer in pediatric eczema, Porges said. Children are likely to be on the drug longer-term than adults.""The physicians believed 30% of moderate-to-severe (eczema) pediatrics experienced continuing disease into adulthood which they now recognize is associated with more complex multisystem disease than they previously appreciated,"" he said.Dupixent is currently approved only for adults, though is in clinical testing in children.RELATED:IBD 50 Stock Veeva Flies To Record High On 'Another Exceptional Quarter'Regeneron, Sanofi Undercut Amgen, AbbVie in Rheumatoid Arthritis

228,REGN,"With the official start of summer just a few days away, mid- and large-cap funds have turned in some of the best performances so far this year.Small caps and techs went on early break, taking a beating during the week and contributing to the market outlook's downgrade to market uptrend under pressure. But the Dow Jones industrial average has continued climbing to new highs.Leading among U.S. diversified stock funds was iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor (MTUM), with a one-month gain of 4.5% through June 13, according to Morningstar Inc. The $3.1 billion ETF boosted its year-to-date return to 18.9%, well ahead of the S&P 500's 10% advance. It's also captured an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 74, second best among the top-performing U.S. diversified stock ETFs.Other top performers for the one-month period included Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG), up 3.5%; Guggenheim S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG), up 3.1%; and  VanEck Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat (MOAT), up 3%.Click Here To See A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2017What are expectations for earnings as we head into the second quarter?""2017 earnings momentum is strong,"" Richard Turnill, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, wrote in a June 12 note. ""Prospects of tax reform have been fading, but depressed expectations lower the bar for positive surprises. We like value, financials, technology, selected health care and dividend growers.""He also has a positive view on overseas earnings in Europe. The European Central Bank recently maintained its dovish policy stance, he points out, lifting its growth forecasts and trimming its inflation outlook.""We see global reflation and an improving earnings outlook supporting cyclicals and exporters, particularly industrials and multinationals with emerging-market exposures,"" he said. ""We see the level of support for populism in European elections partly shaping investor sentiment.""Here are three ETFs in key asset classes that have produced big gains so far this year and in the past month.MTUM, mentioned above, came in first among U.S. diversified stock ETFs. Its top holdings include blue chips such as Apple (AAPL), Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan (JPM) and Microsoft (MSFT). Despite a heavy tech presence (31%), its biggest sector weighting, MTUM is still near all-time highs and is well extended from a February breakout and the subsequent bounce off its 50-day line.The fund, which turned four years old in April, has outperformed the S&P 500 over the longer haul. Its three-year average annual return was 14.4% vs. the benchmark index's 10.3% gain.Though tech stocks got battered recently, tech-focused funds were among the top sector performers, with social media, robotics and semiconductors making a showing. Medical tech play SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) rose 2.9% for the month, bringing its YTD return through June 13 to 21.8%, thanks in part to big recent gains from stocks such as AbbVie (ABBV) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN).The $3.3 billion fund, launched in January 2006, has produced solid returns for the respective three-, five- and 10-year periods: 14.4%, 22% and 15.8%. Shares are near a 72.68 flat-base buy point after climbing past the entry intraday Wednesday.In the foreign-stocks space, SPDR S&P China (GXC) gained 4.3% for the month, for a YTD return of 23.7%. The 10-year-old ETF, which has attracted $890.1 million in assets, counts among its top holdings Tencent (TCEHY), Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD).While recent economic data show signs that China's economy is slowing down, BlackRock's Turnill doesn't expect a hard landing.""There may be good news in China's slower growth,"" he said. ""A modest slowdown from the first quarter's unexpectedly strong 7% pace is welcome, in our view, as China rebalances its economy and downshifts to a more sustainable pace of growth less reliant on credit.""RELATED:Strategist's 3 Best Picks Include These Bond, Emerging-Market ETFsSocial Media, China Internet Stocks Fuel Top ETFs In May

229,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB) would benefit the most among biotechs under President Trump's proposed tax reform, a measure that would cut the corporate tax rate by 20%.Under Trump's proposal ""no business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom-and-pop shop to a freelancer living job to job, will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes,"" making corporate inversions unnecessary."" The U.S. corporate tax rate is currently 35%.That means Regeneron, Gilead and Biogen — all of which have guided to adjusted tax rates at or above 25% in 2017 — could see a serious boost in cash if Trump's proposal passes. Though, analysts say, it's all about compromise inside the Beltway, so that 15% rate is still up in the air.Trump's approval rating jumped to 39% in May from 34% in April, and he gained 7% in the IBD/TIPP Presidential Leadership Index after unveiling his tax reform proposal. It was the first month-over-month increase since Trump became president.But that doesn't mean Big Pharma and biotech are totally sold on Trump's proposal — a four-page document released April 26. Shares of biotechs and drugmakers collectively lifted less than 1% that day, though generic drug stocks popped 2.8%.Gilead Chief Executive John Milligan noted uncertainty in Washington is the norm.""So I think we've kind of learned to filter that out and focus on the things that are right for the company,"" he said on Gilead's May 2 first-quarter earnings conference call. ""There may be tax reform. There may be repatriation. But you can't count on it and you can't wait for it, either.""Trump's plan would slash the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15% from 35%, benefiting companies whose consolidated tax rates remain well above that level. Consolidating taxes allows a firm to treat a group of wholly- or majority-owned companies as a single entity for tax purposes.U.S.-domiciled drugmakers typically pay 37%-40% in consolidated taxes, Canaccord analyst Dewey Steadman told Investor's Business Daily. But companies that acquire a foreign firm can move their tax domicile outside the U.S. to the acquired company's often lower-tax homeland.When Mylan (MYL) acquired a generics manufacturer from Abbott Laboratories (ABT) in 2014, it kept its operational headquarters in Pennsylvania, but reincorporated in the Netherlands. In March, Mylan said it expected to pay a 16.5%-18.5% tax rate in 2017.Similarly, Allergan (AGN) guided in February to a 13.5% adjusted tax rate in 2017. Allergan's corporate headquarters are in Ireland. In April 2016, Pfizer (PFE) scrapped its $160 billion attempt to acquire Allergan a day after the U.S. Treasury unveiled new rules to curb inversions.Former President Barack Obama called global tax avoidance a ""huge problem"" and urged Congress to close the loophole for good. Trump, on the other hand, says his tax reform proposal would make inversions unnecessary ""by making America's tax rate one of the best in the world.""Regeneron, Gilead and Biogen would be among the biggest winners of this cut, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in an April 26 report. Regeneron has guided to an effective tax rate of 32%-38% in 2017. Gilead sees 25%-28%. In the first quarter, Biogen paid 23% in adjusted taxes.Among drugmakers, Pfizer, Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) all guided to effective tax rates between 20%-25% for 2017. Canaccord's Steadman and Mizuho analyst Salim Syed told IBD everything in politics is subject to negotiation.""Smaller biotechs say it's obviously positive for the future, but everyone is taking a wait-and-see approach,"" Steadman said. ""A 20%-22% rate is probably what's going to happen, but they're not changing their capital expenditures or organizational structure in the meantime.""IBD'S TAKE: Looking for the latest on biotech and drug news? Be sure to bookmark IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.A second facet of Trump's plan would allow the one-time repatriation of corporate cash parked overseas at a discounted 10% tax rate. This would be followed by an end to the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad.Evercore's Raffat says Amgen (AMGN) would benefit the most among drugmakers under this provision. Amgen has $34.4 billion in cash stashed overseas. That's money Amgen could use to help boost its war chest amid generic rivalries and a battle with Regeneron/Sanofi (SNY) on the cholesterol front.The same could be said for Gilead — $27.4 billion in overseas cash — which is facing dwindling sales in its hepatitis C drug franchise. Gilead had been under pressure for months amid analyst chatter that it should buy something to bolster sales. Incyte (INCY) is a likely candidate, analysts say.According to Raffat, Merck and Pfizer have a respective $21.9 billion and $15 billion in cash outside the U.S. Lilly, Bristol, Celgene (CELG), Biogen and AbbVie (ABBV) each have under $10 billion parked overseas. That cash could be repatriated for research and development, or used to fuel M&A.Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read offered a similar view as Gilead's Milligan on the company's May 2 first-quarter earnings conference call. Though he expects industry consolidation to continue over time, the political atmosphere remains a major deterrent.""I believe there is simply too much redundancy and fragmentation, both globally and in the U.S., for the sector to continually efficiently deliver medicines to society,"" he said. ""However, there is a lack of clarity on potential tax reform, health care policies of the U.S. and uncertainties in the European markets.""Canaccord's Steadman doesn't expect a wave of M&A even if Trump's tax reform passes muster with Congress. There's no need to attempt Pfizer-Allergan-like mergers for inversion purposes, he said. Though the appetite for U.S. biotechs looks healthy.""We'd see a decline in those big inversion-type mergers that were not necessarily strategic, but you could see an appetite for U.S. biotech assets just because the tax picture looks better,"" he said. ""The net result is actually a decrease in large mergers but maybe an increase in valuations for biotech, but I don't think it drives much more M&A.""There's much that's still murky in Trump's tax proposal, analysts say.""The general theme is tax reform would be a good thing for biotech,"" Mizuho's Syed told IBD. ""But we don't exactly know what tax reform is going to be. There are still a lot of pieces moving around. Repatriation? A border tax? We don't have all the components of it.""A border tax, though, could be an extreme drawback for U.S. companies with manufacturing in less expensive countries. Such an adjustment could exempt exports from taxation, while taxing imports, PwC analysts Doug Strang and Kathy Michael wrote in a Feb. 6 report.In a January speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said a tax would eliminate the tax incentives for U.S. companies to move their manufacturing overseas.""Coupled with the new lower GOP tax rates on local businesses and ending double-taxation of U.S. earnings overseas, this establishes America as a 21st century magnet for new jobs, technology breakthroughs and headquarters,"" he said. ""The GOP tax plan is already driving companies to ask themselves, 'How soon can we bring our suppliers back to the U.S.?'""For most companies, relocating their operations back to the U.S. would be a ""paperwork nightmare,"" Canaccord's Steadman said. In the current plan — which doesn't include a border tax provision — there's nothing to incentivize companies to bring operations back to the U.S.But it could be enough to keep newer and smaller companies from re-domiciling overseas, he said.""It's probably enticing future companies to not leave the U.S., I think that's the core goal of what they're trying to do,"" he said. ""If they were U.S.-domiciled at a lower rate, they wouldn't have to leave cash in a foreign subsidiary and that cash would be based in the U.S. which would encourage investment in the U.S.""RELATED:Did Gilead Just Provide Some 'Incyte' Into A Potential Deal?Dow's Pfizer Tops Earnings Views But Sales Come Up ShortHow Lilly's New Drug Could Spark A Deeper Rivalry With Pfizer, Novartis

231,REGN,"Eli Lilly (LLY), Pfizer (PFE) and Novartis (NVS) are pitted in the battle to treat breast cancer, but Wall Street struggled Thursday to compare the effectiveness of their drugs after Lilly unveiled new data.All three drugs belong to a class called CDK4/6, which work to inhibit specific proteins to prevent the over-proliferation of cancer cells. Pfizer's Ibrance was the first approved in this area. But Novartis' Kisqali grabbed approval this year and Lilly's abemaciclib looks promising.In a Phase 2 trial, Lilly's abemaciclib, combined with chemotherapy, increased progression-free survival to a median 16.4 months vs. 9.3 months for a placebo-chemo combo. Hazard ratio, which measures the likelihood of death, was 0.55.Pfizer's drug Ibrance was combined with chemo in an earlier trial. The combo had a lower hazard ratio at 0.46 — meaning there was a lower risk of death — but it only extended progression-free survival to a median 9.5 months vs. 4.6 months in placebo combo.Comparing the two boils down to which Wall Street sees as a ""better"" effectiveness metric, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a report. He notes that the trials studied different populations of breast cancer patients, making an apples-to-apples comparison tricky.Still, diarrhea remains a concern for Lilly's abemaciclib — 86.4% of patients experienced diarrhea vs. 24.7% of patients on the placebo-chemo combination. Lilly advises patients to begin an anti-diarrheal medicine at the first sign of diarrhea.IBD'S TAKE: Want to keep tabs on the market during the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting next month? Bookmark IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.The results were presented late Wednesday ahead of the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in June in Chicago. Other abstracts uploaded Wednesday include those from Merck (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Roche (RHHBY), Tesaro (TSRO), Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY).Incyte (INCY) stock spiked to a month-high Thursday after its epacadostat proved effective in combos with Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo, outdoing Roche's Tecentriq with NewLink Genetics' (NLNK) rival to epacadostat.But that wasn't Merck's only note of interest. Merck also offered a pair of updates in its ""famous"" trial, dubbed Keynote-024, which has found that Keytruda is better than chemo as a first treatment for advanced lung cancer.The hazard ratio for Keytruda dropped to 0.69 from 0.9, Merck said. Although this is ""not statistically significant, the favorable trend may have helped them in recent FDA approval,"" Evercore's Raffat said in a note.Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo are what's known as immuno-oncology drugs. They work to block the interaction between a PD-1 protein on an immune system cell and a PD-L1 protein on a cancer cell to help the immune system identify the cancer.In its Keynote-024 trial, Merck also found lung-cancer patients treated with Keytruda in their initial round saw continued benefit from Keytruda in the second round if the cancer progressed. This cements ""the role for PD-1 (inhibitors) in first-line (treatment) even further,"" Raffat said.In a Phase 1 trial, Regeneron and Sanofi found their PD-1 drug, known as REGN-2810, had a benefit rate of 52% for patients with a common form of skin cancer. The drug had a 70% control rate, ""which is very encouraging in this disease setting,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said.The American Cancer Society estimates that 5.4 million patients are diagnosed with and 20,000 die of basal and squamous cell skin cancers each year in the U.S. Longer term, there might be potential for REGN-2810 to treat patients with advanced, but not necessarily fatal, skin cancers.Of the 26 patients enrolled in Regeneron/Sanofi's trial, one showed a complete response of 19 months — meaning all discernible signs of cancer disappeared. Porges kept his outperform rating on Regeneron stock.Though there was ""little of note"" in Tesaro's abstract ahead of the conference, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez says the most interesting data presented next month will be a combination trial of Tesaro's Zejula and Merck's Keytruda in breast and ovarian cancer.Zejula competes vs. AstraZeneca (AZN) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) in a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors which works to block a specific enzyme to treat ovarian cancer. PARP inhibitors are currently being investigated in breast cancer as well.Combining a PARP inhibitor and an immuno-oncology drug like Merck's Keytruda is thought to be more potent in treating cancer. Tesaro is also looking at Zejula plus a PD-1, like Keytruda, in advanced lung cancer.The company is slated to present data from a dozen patients treated with Zejula and Keytruda. Fernandez notes that the bar is fairly low to outperform. Alone, PD-1 inhibitors have a 10%-15% response rate in this group of patients. PARP inhibitors have a mid-20% response rate.""Although recently published data from a small trial of AstraZeneca's Imfinzi (a PD-L1 inhibitor) plus Lynparza (a PARP inhibitor) showed a somewhat disappointing 17% response rate in 10 ovarian cancer patients, Tesaro believes the combination of a PD-1 antibody plus Zejula will be superior,"" Fernandez said.RELATED:Incyte Teams Up With Dow's Merck To Trounce Roche In CancerDid AstraZeneca Rival Just Launch A Potential Blockbuster Drug?

That means that nearly 50% of a winning stock rally's strength borrows from the stock's industry and economic sector.Industries can also move on new economic trends, such as housing and retail gains driven by recovering consumer spending. It may also be a significant structural shift or technical advance within an industry.This might be shale gas and oil development, or advanced safety technology on new automobiles. You can follow industry trends by reading the daily Industry Themes columns in IBD and at Investors.com.The biotech and ethical drug industry produced a welter of leading stocks in the 2012-2015 period.Smaller biomedical firms saw an influx of investment from Big Pharma as the industry saw a historic lapse of patent protection on aging blockbuster drugs.Larger firms found themselves needing to bulk up to compete. Many seized on overseas acquisitions. Some shifted their headquarters overseas in order to sidestep U.S. tax burdens.When Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) broke out of a four-month cup base in April 2013 (see chart), the stock already had been climbing for four years. But Tarrytown, N.Y.-based Regeneron only managed to pull its earnings growth together through 2012.Some of its prior bases were volatile and produced numerous pullbacks.

236,REGN,"Ophthotech (OPHT) could temporarily beat down shares of rival Regeneron (REGN) if phase-three testing of its wet age-related macular degeneration drug proves fruitful by year's end, RBC analyst Adnan Butt said Thursday.Regeneron makes Eylea, where Ophthotech manufactures Fovista. The drugs compete to treat wet AMD, a chronic eye disorder in which vision is blurred or marred by a blind spot.But Ophthotech's pressure will likely be short-lived, Butt said. He expects Regeneron's Eylea to gain share in the wet AMD and diabetic macular degeneration markets over the next two years.""If it is successful, we see it more as an overhang removed vs. a permanent cap on Regeneron shares since the degree of success will also matter,"" Butt wrote in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Regeneron stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 79, meaning it performs in the top 21% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But Supernus Pharmaceuticals tops IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group with a 99 CR. Get the Stock Checkup.Regeneron, too, has pressured Ophthotech stock. Late last month, Ophthotech stock was strangled after Regeneron's Eylea failed to show an improvement in patients with wet AMD when combined with the antibody Rinucumab.Regeneron stock was hit 1% on that news, but Ophthotech fell 15%, ahead of the results of its phase-three testing for Fovista, due by year's end.Still, Eylea is expected to be important for Regeneron in 2017, Butt says.Outside Eylea, Regeneron's and Sanofi's (SNY) Dupilumab drug for atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema, appears promising for 2017, Butt wrote. Dupilumab ""has the highest market potential of the approved or late-stage drugs"" in the Regeneron and Sanofi pipelines, he wrote.Butt trimmed his price target on Regeneron stock to 633 from 648 to reflect a slower-than-expected ramp for Dupilumab. He kept his outperform rating. U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of Dupilumab is expected in March.Similarly, Sarilumab is moving swimmingly through the FDA approval process. Regeneron and Sanofi co-developed the drug, which battles rheumatoid arthritis.The consensus puts Sarilumab sales at $243 million for 2017, far above RBC's $117 million expectation, Butt wrote. Wall Street's broader views could be reduced on Sarilumab, he says.In the stock market today, Ophthotech stock fell 3.5% to 43.70. Regeneron stock fell 1% to 388.60.

237,REGN,"An election year has added to the pressures that hit biotechnology stocks hard, but a look under the hood of two sibling biotech ETFs is revealing. It shows the more speculative companies in this extremely heterogeneous industry caused much of the hurt.BioShares Biotechnology Products (BBP) is down 1.4% year to date through Oct. 20 and invests in established companies that have brought at least one drug to market.The 35 stock holdings in this exchange traded fund include Biogen (BIIB), Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Regeneron (REGN).IBD'S TAKE: The largest, cap-weighted biotech ETFs stand to benefit most if these five top companies climb the ""wall of worry"" that has built around the industry.BioShares Biotechnology Clinical Trials (BBC) is down 31.0% so far in 2016 and invests in young and smaller companies whose drugs are in the experimental-testing stage.Its portfolio includes Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT), whose shares rocketed in September after the FDA approved its drug to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy. That approval means Sarepta will move to the BBP portfolio when the two BioShares ETFs next rebalance in December.This ETF pair allows investors to decide ""how much to mix,"" in terms of combining more-risky with less-risky biotechs, said Paul Yook, founder of BioShares.BBP's focus on household names makes it a relatively less volatile fund. In contrast, BBC holds the riskiest biotechs — highflying companies whose shares could double or triple overnight, and may crash and burn just as well.Yook describes BBP and BBC as the only exchange traded funds to separate clinical-trial companies and product companies into two distinct and stand-alone investments.Investors don't seem much enamored with the idea of custom-tailoring risk. The funds are extremely small and thinly traded, nearly two years after their debut. They have, however, seen a combined $5.8 million in net inflow over the first three quarters of 2016.The BBP fund is the best performer among biotech ETFs so far this year, and BBC the worst.Meanwhile, bellwether iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) has given up 20.8% year to date and sits 21% below its December high.Biotechnology ETFs crumbled over the past year, coming under pressure from lackluster earnings as well as negative scrutiny for health care peers Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Mylan (MYL) in a politically charged season.Despite the ""wall of worry"" around this industry group, at least one analyst has a favorable outlook for biotechs after the Nov. 8 presidential elections.Yook points out another promising sign: a pickup in M&A, with mouthwatering sticker prices for target companies. Allergan (AGN) announced in September that it would acquire Vitae Pharmaceuticals (VTAE) for roughly $639 million — a 159% premium per share.Biotechs are attractively priced too. This is one rare corner of the stock market where valuations are cheaper than they have been historically, Yook told IBD in a phone interview.While many ETF investors are waiting to buy biotechnology stocks until after the November election, he believes the fear of a Hillary Clinton presidency is priced in.The Democratic presidential contender's remarks on drug price-gouging had triggered sharp biotech declines.Yook added: ""Most of the political scrutiny will be faced by specialty pharmaceutical companies such as Valeant, Mylan and Horizon (HZNP), which our BioShares funds avoid.

238,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  (REGN) disclosed that a combination therapy including its blockbuster drug Eylea didn't perform as well in treating wet age-related macular degeneration than Eylea alone. That sent Regeneron shares sharply lower on the stock market today, with a wet AMD rival also tumbling.Regeneron had combined Eylea with rinucumab, an anti-PDGFR-beta antibody. Patients taking the combo therapy in phase 2 trial saw 5.8 letters on an eye chart test after 12 weeks. But Eylea-only patients saw a gain of 7.5 letters.Regeneron shares fell 1.1% to 402.02 Friday after sinking as low as 390.56. On Thursday, Regeneron sank 3% undercutting its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Eylea, codeveloped by Bayer (BAYRY), has been a big seller for Regeneron.Meanwhile, Ophthotech (OPHT) crashed 14.8% to 46.13. Ophthotech is working on a combo therapy for wet AMD that combines its own antibody with Lucentis from Roche (RHHBY). But that combo therapy is in a phase three trial after providing superior performance to Roche's Lucentis alone in a phase two trial.The biotech ETF iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) rose 1.2%, closing just below the 50-day line after IBB tumbled 3% on Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: Drug and biotech stocks have been pressured in 2016 on concerns that government will impose price controls.

239,REGN,"A California ballot initiative requiring the state's Medicaid arm to buy drugs at comparable prices to what the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs pays could backfire, thus preserving sales for the nation's biggest drugmakers, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Thursday.Proposition 61, the California Drug Price Relief Act (CDPRA), sounds good in theory, Yee wrote in a research report. But that's assuming drugmakers don't simply eliminate the steep discounts already provided the VA.After all, he says, that's what happened in 25 years ago.""Congress passed a 1991 law requiring drugmakers to grant Medicaid similar discounts given to manufacturers' larger customers,"" he wrote. ""But the law ultimately prompted manufacturers to raise prices paid by larger customers, including the VA.""That will likely be the fate for the CDPRA, he wrote.Californians appear to overwhelmingly support the initiative. Early this month, a University of Southern California and Los Angeles Times survey found 66% of 1,900 respondents approve of the CDPRA. A San Francisco firm's poll in July which found 73% in support.For drugmakers like Amgen (AMGN), Gilead (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB), Regeneron (REGN) and Vertex (VRTX), the CDPRA offers merely a headline risk, Yee wrote. Assuming a large 20% price cut to Medicaid, 2017 and 2018 sales and earnings would decrease by 2%, as only 10%-20% of the companies' U.S. products are exposed to Medicaid.If all 50 states enacted such a measure, it could mean a 2%-3% earnings per share risk for large-cap players, Yee wrote. This year, though, California is alone with its initiative. An Ohio proposition didn't make it to the ballot.""However, VA price discounts would then probably become nonexistent since lower VA prices would lead to reduced Medicaid prices,"" he wrote, noting Medicaid already gets a 23% discount.To date, CDPRA opposition has only spent 5% of $87 million in donations. Yee expects that spending to ramp up significantly ahead of the Nov. 8 ballot. RBC research shows 100% of all propositions in 2014 were won by the side that had the most funding. CDPRA supporters have raised only about $9.5 million.Supporters, which include former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, say the CDPRA could save 5 million Californian taxpayers $5.7 billion in 10 years, since the VA pays 20% to 25% less than other government agencies for prescription drugs.Opponents argue the CDPRA could invalidate existing contracts between the state and drugmakers, forcing increased state drug prices and reducing funding for Medi-Cal. The initiative could also increase state expenses as employees spend time and resources matching state prices to what the VA pays.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group ranks No. 6 out of 197 groups tracked, having climbed from No. 160 just 13 weeks ago. Stocks have heated on Wall Street expectations of major Big Pharma M&A action. However, on the stock market today, the group closed down 3.6%, hurt by Intra-Cellular Therapies' stock plunge.

The request likely hampers baricitinib, produced in partnership with Incyte (INCY), by at least a year.Though other analysts have said baricitinib is likely delayed by a year, Fernandez sees the Lilly/Incyte drug delayed by 18 to 24 months to late 2018 or 2019. He cut his annual global sales forecast for the drug by $200 million.But sales of diabetes drug Trulicity and psoriasis drug Talz will more than offset the delay for baricitinib, Fernandez said. He raised his peak sales for Trulicity and Talz to $4.5 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively.Overall, the consensus of analysts polled by Yahoo (YHOO) expects Lilly to report $5.2 billion in sales, up 7.1% vs. the year-earlier period, and adjusted earnings of 96 cents a share, up 15.7%. Fernandez is more bullish, at $5.3 billion and 98 cents. He boosted his price target on Lilly shares to 93 from 91.Fernandez expects Sanofi and Novartis to deliver in-line revenue as each firm's basal insulin diabetes franchise faces pricing pressure. These drugs include Lantus and Toujeo for Sanofi and Levemir and Tresiba for Novartis.IBD'S TAKE: Eli Lilly has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 53 based on key growth metrics like earnings and sales performance. Better stock bets include the likes of Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ), which has a CR of 86 out of a best-possible 99. Head to the Stock Checkup to see how your picks stack up.Lantus and Toujeo prescriptions are performing better than expected in the face of the launch of Basaglar from Lilly, Fernandez said in a note to clients. Still, he sees a 15% year-over-year pricing decline for Lantus.The silver lining for Sanofi is Dupixent, an eczema-treating injection in conjunction with partner Regeneron (REGN). The drug was approved in March so it won't have sales in the first quarter. The consensus sees Sanofi's sales dipping 5.5% in the first quarter to $8.88 billion.For Novartis, Fernandez notes Victoza is still growing and Tresiba ""uptake is on track,"" but pricing pressure is likely to weigh on both diabetes drugs through at least the end of the third quarter.Broadly, analysts expect Novartis to report 0.7% sales growth to $11.68 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.13 a share, down 3 cents vs. the year-earlier period.Sanofi fell 2.4% to close at 44.45 on the stock market today. Lilly dropped 1.4% to 81.20. Novartis dipped 0.5% to 72.93. That followed Johnson & Johnson's lackluster first-quarter results, which saw drug sales eke out a 0.8% gain.RELATED:Can Lilly Survive Rheumatoid Arthritis Flop With Breast Cancer Drug?Dow's Johnson & Johnson Sets Up Lackluster Results For Sector

242,REGN,"X The major indexes rose to a mixed close Thursday, as a successful health care reform vote in Congress outweighed the negative effects from a sharp dive in oil prices.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rebounded from midsession lows to grasp fractional gains at the closing bell. The Dow Jones industrial average fought a good fight, also rising from lows to end with the thinnest of losses. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 ending down 0.2%.A 217-213 vote in the House of Representatives moved the GOP health care reform bill — the American Health Care Act — through to the Senate, moving Congress closer to its pledged repeal of the Affordable Care Act.Oil prices clearly hindered the session, with West Texas Intermediate crude dropping nearly 5% to below $46 a barrel — its lowest price since Nov. 29.

244,REGN,"SAN FRANCISCO — Less than an hour after President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the drug industry as ""disastrous,"" Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) CEO Randall Schatzman classified the tone at the 35th annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference as ""cautiously optimistic.""That's a wide departure from the 2016 event. At that time, he said, sentiment was decidedly pessimistic as the U.S. entered what turned out to be a raucous election year. The drug-pricing debate is alive, but biotech sentiment is growing stronger this year, Schatzman told IBD in an interview at the conference, one of the drug industry's major events, held this week in San Francisco.""Talking about the biotech industry as a whole, I think it's finally come to maturity,"" he said. ""Over the last two years, almost 70 drugs have been approved that have come from innovation in biotechnology, not large pharma. So the dollars there are really paying us back, and we're seeing some real game-changers.""Among those, Schatzman included Alder's anti-CGRP migraine drug, which competes directly with similar meds from Eli Lilly (LLY), Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Amgen (AMGN). The migraine market is big enough that all four could grab a sizable share when their drugs hit shelves, likely in 2019.But he acknowledges Trump's comments didn't help stock prices. Holding his phone, Schatzman pulled up a screen of biotech stocks, red arrows indicating their descent. To that point, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (IBB) (an exchange-traded fund) fell 3% Wednesday. It rose a fraction both Thursday and Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Trump's commentary sent drug stocks into a tailspin on Wednesday. Get the deep dive on what it means for your drug and biotech picks on IBD's Industry Themes.So any rally Wall Street expected from the JPMorgan event didn't unfold. But here are five key takeaways investors could note for 2017 as Trump takes office, drug firms look to sidestep Lilly's Alzheimer's flop and M&A gets an early start.Trump isn't alone in his fixation on drug prices. Celgene (CELG) CEO Mark Alles parried back when a reporter questioned whether the No. 3 biotech would follow in Allergan's (AGN) footsteps, applying a so-called ""social contract"" to not raise prices more than 10% annually.Celgene has offered free access programs for years, Alles said, estimating the No. 3 biotech gives away 6% of its drugs each year for free. Drug-prices increases help fund R&D for new drugs, he added. CFO Peter Kellogg estimates Celgene reinvests 35% of its funds into R&D, when accounting for partnerships.Alles says Celgene goes through a ""thoughtful process,"" accounting for innovation and spending to bring a drug to market before it prices a new med. Schatzman used the same words to describe Alder's plan to price out its anti-CGRP drug, once it nears FDA approval and heads to market.But HealthPrize Technologies CEO Tom Kottler called pricing spikes the easy way out for drug companies. HealthPrize is a software-as-a-service firm that marries behavioral economics and consumer marketing to analyze and improve patient adherence to prescriptions.Pharma leaves about $637 billion in worldwide revenue on the table each year by not pushing patients to take their meds, Kottler told IBD. To bridge the gap, companies can bring new products to market, prompt doctors to write more prescriptions or raise prices. Typically, they choose the latter.They're missing out on easy money, Kottler says. But raising prices ""is the easiest thing for them,"" he said.Drugmaker Merck (MRK) announced its immuno-oncology (IO) drug Keytruda in combination with chemo — Eli Lilly's Alimta — had won priority review from the FDA in non-small cell lung cancer and has a Prescription Drug Free User Act (PDUFA) date of May 10.Meanwhile, Merck and Incyte (INCY) are moving Keytruda and epacadostat into phase 3 trials of four tumor types (non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck). Incyte stock jumped 9.4% Jan. 9 on the news.But Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) is on Merck's tail, analysts say. Bristol-Myers is testing a combination of Opdivo and Yervoy, both IO therapies, in NSCLC. Analysts expect the Bristol-Myers readout in the first half of 2018. IO combos are likely to be more effective and durable than IO plus chemo, some say.On Monday, Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical put down a $24 per share bid on Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIAD), an oncology firm based in Massachusetts. Ariad stock flew 73% on the news, helping shares of oncology firm Tesaro (TSRO) lift 3.7%.Tesaro stock and four IPOs led IBD's 420-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group in 2016, with each of those stocks seeing triple-digit gains. Tesaro jumped 157%, where the group overall fell 24% amid the painful election cycle.Now, analysts wonder if Tesaro's success and an oncology-minded atmosphere — reiterated by Takeda's offer on Ariad — could garner a bid for Tesaro. Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez sees a potential takeout price of $170 per share of Tesaro stock, which closed Friday at 156.41 after rising 6.4%.""While Tesaro remains well positioned to grow independently, a validated PARP inhibitor like niraparib (an ovarian cancer drug still in development) could offer a durable and strategically important product opportunity for multiple suitors,"" Fernandez wrote in a research report Jan. 9.Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) are asking a federal judge to stay a ban on their LDL-busting drug, Praluent, in the aftermath of a patent battle that landed in a win for No. 1 biotech Amgen. Praluent infringes on Amgen's patent for PCSK9 inhibitor Repatha, the judge said.Meanwhile, an LDL-buster from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) and The Medicines Co. (MDCO) is slowly advancing. On Jan. 9, The Medicines Co. announced a 180-day interim analysis from a study examining PCSK9si inclisiran. The data showed inclisiran significantly lowered LDL up to day 210.RBC analyst Adnan Butt expects six-month data to be similar on efficacy and safety. Details are expected during the 2017 American College of Cardiology conference in March in Washington, D.C. Inclisiran should do well on strong data despite the patent litigation for Amgen and Regeneron/Sanofi.""Inclisiran is differentiated and has no patent litigation overhang,"" Butt said in a research report Wednesday.Axovant (AXON) CEO Vivek Ramaswamy says the biotech and drug industry has ""utterly failed"" in Alzheimer's. Oncology, inflammation, cardiology — they've all seen significant advancements in the last 10 years. Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and dementia, including those with lewy bodies, haven't, he says.""If we don't find a treatment, it's a major threat to society,"" he told IBD in an interview Wednesday. ""This is the single area in health care we have failed to deliver a major advancement in, in the last decade.""Ramaswamy says he was rooting for Eli Lilly in December. But Lilly's highly-lauded solanezumab failed to meet its primary endpoints in a late-stage trial, causing Lilly stock to plunge 10.5% the day of that announcement. Lilly's drug and a drug in development by Biogen (BIIB) work to remove plaque buildups in the brain associated with Alzheimer's.But that's a ""silver bullet"" theory, and Ramaswamy doesn't buy it. Instead, he sees it necessary to treat the various behavioral, psychological and neurological pieces of Alzheimer's and dementia. Axovant is aiming to build new therapies on top of older ones.Axovant is next is the Alzheimer's field to deliver a readout. Data are slated for Q3, he said. Ramaswamy is looking for just one major piece of news in Alzheimer's advancement. Says Ramaswamy, ""A rising tide will lift all boats.""

A day earlier, in its first action in its similar investigation, the U.S. Justice Department charged the former CEO and president of privately held Heritage Pharmaceuticals with price fixing.IBD'S TAKE: An event such as a news conference from a president-elect can move stocks. See IBD's Stocks on the Move to learn the latest big movers, both up and down, with a number of drugmakers currently on the moving-down list.In an interview with Time, when named that magazine's Man of the Year, Trump pledged to bring down high drug prices, but Wednesday marked his first substantive comments on the subject.""Pharma has a lot of lobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there's very little bidding on drugs,"" he said at the news conference. ""We're the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don't bid properly, and we're going to start bidding, and we're going to save billions of dollars over a period of time.""Actavis had boosted the price of its hydrocortisone tablets by 9,500% over a number of years, while Mylan's EpiPen to treat allergic reactions saw a 700% price increase in six years ended last year. Both products treat potentially life-threatening situations.The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) ETF fell 3% in the stock market today to 277.94 and falling back near its 200-day line.Already depressed, shares of Mylan and Teva fell 4.3% and 2.6% respectively on Wednesday, while Valeant tumbled 6.5%.IBD's 421-company biotech industry group fell 3.1%, again falling to its 50-day and 200-day lines.Among larger biotech stocks, Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) fell 8.1%, Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) plunged 7.4% and United Therapeutics (UTHR) fell 6%.Among larger drugmakers, Amgen (AMGN) ended the day down 1.4%, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) fell 3.6% and Gilead Sciences (GILD) fell 1.7%, with Biogen (BIIB) tumbling 3.6%.RELATED:Trump: Drugmakers 'Getting Away With Murder'Mylan, Teva Sued For Alleged Price-Fixing

246,REGN,"Data from No. 1 biotech Amgen's (AMGN) LDL-busting drug could boost Regeneron (REGN) in 2017, but disappoint the too-high expectations of Amgen investors, Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young said Tuesday.Young upgraded Regeneron stock to an outperform rating and upped her price target to 485 from 481, citing the April launch of dupixent, an eczema drug with Sanofi (SNY). But PCSK9 data from top rival Amgen due in Q1 also could also be a catalyst for Regeneron's own PCSK9 drug, she wrote in a research report.Amgen investors, however, have set their expectations too high on Repatha, Amgen's PCSK9 inhibitor, following successful data from a study in September, she said. In that coronary intravascular imaging trial, Repatha met its primary and secondary endpoints in coronary artery disease.""We still see some upside into Repatha outcomes data in 1Q17,"" she wrote in a research note. ""We think the risk/reward is unfavorable since expectations are pretty high after success of the GLAGOV study.""IBD'S TAKE: Will Trump break with Republicans to pressure drug prices? It's looking more and more likely he will. Will biotechs survive the political pressure?Young downgraded Amgen stock to a neutral rating and cut her price target to 180 from 200. She sees Amgen's base business — rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel — becoming weaker and trimmed her total product-sales view by $670 million.Enbrel sales came in flat in Q3 at $1.45 billion amid contract negotiations. Next year, Enbrel sales will be driven on volume rather than net selling price, the company said on its Q3 earnings conference call with analysts. Though the company upped its 2016 guidance at that time.Celgene (CELG) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) top Young's 2017 biotech watchlist. She is cautious on 2017 in general, however, given comments from President-elect Donald Trump that he will go after escalating drug prices. In the six weeks following his election, biotech and drug stocks have nearly round-tripped, first rising and then falling.IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group hit a six-week high on Nov. 14 after Trump's election, but is down 9% since then. Still, shares remain 5% above their close on Nov. 8, rising 0.85% in the stock market today. Amgen stock fell 0.35% Tuesday to 147.22, while Regeneron stock slipped 0.20% to 371.02.""We don't expect drug pricing chatter to moderate, especially considering comments already made by the president-elect,"" Young wrote.

247,REGN,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration could approve a breakthrough adult eczema treatment from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) as soon as March 2017, the drugmakers said Monday, though shares plodded lower on a down day for the market overall.In a joint release, Regeneron and Sanofi said the FDA accepted for priority review the biologics license agreement (BLA) for Dupilumab, a treatment for mid-to-severe eczema. There's no cure for eczema, a rash, but it's typically treated with corticosteroids.IBD'S TAKE: Pfizer, too, is working on an eczema treatment via its acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals. Early Monday, Pfizer said it had decided against splitting up, ending years of speculation.Dupilumab inhibits signaling of interleukin 4 and interleukin 13, the companies said. IL-4 and IL-13 are cytokines, proteins that signal cells and are tied to immune response. Clinical studies frequently link IL-4 and IL-13 to eczema and asthma.In 2014, Dupilumab was granted breakthrough drug designation. Now, it's on the path to receive a Prescription Drug User Fee Act target activation date on March 29, 2017. That would allow the FDA to collect fees from drugmakers to fund the approval process.The BLA for Dupilumab contains data from phase-three testing, which included more than 2,500 patients whose eczema wasn't controlled by topical treatments like cortisone cream. Regeneron and Sanofi evaluated Dupilumab as a singular treatment and in conjunction with corticosteroids.Pfizer (PFE), Roche (RHHBY) and AstraZeneca (AZN) are on Regeneron and Sanofi's heels with treatments for acute dermatitis as well. To that end, Pfizer acquired Anacor in June for $4.5 billion, giving it access to Anacor's nonsteroid gel to treat eczema, crisaborole.Despite the announcement, Regeneron stock was down 1.5% to 404.12 on the stock market today. A hot stock from mid-2009 until late 2015, Regeneron shares are down about 25% this year. Sanofi stock was down 0.8% to 38.04.RELATED:Regeneron-Sanofi Drug For Rheumatoid Arthritis Beats AbbVie's Humira

248,REGN,"Biotech Gilead (GILD) is most likely to scoop up Incyte (INCY) over the next 12 months, according to a survey of 244 industry watchers by Evercore ISI investment bank, ahead of the presidential election pitting Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.Of those surveyed, 16% say they'd most like to see Gilead purchase Incyte, and 14% identified Incyte as the biopharma most likely to be acquired over the next year. Nearly 12% and 10%, respectively, see Biogen (BIIB) and BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) as targets.Gilead, Acadia Pharmaceuticals (ACAD), Celgene (CELG) and Kite Pharma (KITE) are least likely to be targeted, with only 2% of industry experts identifying each as a likely takeover candidate. That's a departure from Needham's analysis last week identifying 11 potential suitors for Acadia.An Incyte takeover would likely come at a heavy price. As of June 30, Gilead had $24.6 billion in cash, equivalents and market securities on hand. By market cap, Gilead is the No. 2 biotech, trailing only Amgen, but it's widely viewed as among the big biotechs that most needs to be active on the M&A front. Incyte has a $17 billion market capitulation. Smaller coalitions, 10% and 8%, say Gilead could buy Vertex (VRTX) or Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).Outside M&A, the lion's share of experts (52%) expect biotechs to outperform the broader markets over the next six months, whereas 54% of respondents say biopharmas will merely be in line. Both will trade up after the election, say 65% of experts.But IBD's 241-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group is down 16% this year, but those losses were early in the year, when the overall market tumbled. The group is up more than 25% since late June and now ranks No. 6 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 160 just 13 weeks ago.At the close on the stock market today, the group was up more than 1.4%, bucking a two-day downtrend.IBD'S TAKE: The latest Industry Snapshot explores biotech M&A and promising new drugs, and which stocks are leading the biotech sector.Drug pricing initiatives could rout stocks this year, an RBC analyst said Thursday. Though he acknowledged drugmakers like Amgen (AMGN), Gilead, Celgene, Biogen, Regeneron (REGN) and Vertex could easily find loopholes to skirt new regulations.Still, fewer than 1% of the people polled by Evercore expect the government to take meaningful action on drug pricing in 2016. Nearly 44% (the largest chunk) say the government won't ever push for a reduction in drug prices.Other predictions stem around specific companies. Only 14% expect Eli Lilly's (LLY) Alzheimer's drug, Solanezumab, to hit cognition and function endpoints. More broadly, 42% say it will hit cognition but miss on function.More than half (51%) say Celgene's Phase 3 testing for GED-0301, an oral mongersen treatment for Crohn's, will fail to reach the overwhelming efficacy seen in Phase 2 testing. During Phase 2, 67% of patients taking 160 milligrams were in clinical remission on day 15.A small 7% say Celgene will see better results in Phase 3 testing. Only 3% expect the study to fail entirely. If the results show endoscopic improvement, 64% of respondents say Celgene stock will pop. A third expect shares to remain stagnant.RELATED:Gilead 'Paralyzed' On Likely Hep C Share LossAmgen, Biogen, Gilead Could Spike VA Pricing To Skirt California MeasureRegeneron Pharmaceuticals Falls As Combo Therapy Worse Than Eylea Alone

249,REGN,"Strength in biotech stocks buoyed the Nasdaq composite Wednesday, but a strong showing by Apple (AAPL) didn't help the Dow much, and some afternoon selling reminded investors why the market uptrend is under pressure.At the close, the Nasdaq rose 0.4% and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2%. The S&P 500 fell less than 0.1%, despite another sell-off in oil and gas stocks. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in lower than Tuesday's levels.Solar, oil & gas and airline stocks underperformed.In the stock market today, Dow component Apple surged past a 110.33 buy point in heavy volume, rising nearly 4% and extending gains after Tuesday's move, which was fueled by news of strong preorders for the iPhone 7.Skyworks (SWKS) and Broadcom (AVGO) outperformed in the Nasdaq 100, along with several biotech names like Alexion (ALXN), Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN).Several recent IPOs outperformed as names like Impinj (PI), Penumbra (PEN) and Lumentum (LITE) all rose around 3% or more.Inside the IBD 50, 13 names rose 1% or more.

251,REGN,"Big biotech Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) closed down 1.8% on the stock market today after reporting a mixed quarter and guidance.Earnings of $2.82 a share beat analysts' consensus, while revenue of $1.21 billion was lighter than expected. The shortfall was due to less collaboration revenue from Sanofi (SNY), which ""is difficult to model and interpret,"" noted Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum in an email.Wall Street generally judges the company's health more by product sales, and on that front Regeneron beat expectations. Sales of flagship eye drug Eylea rose 27% year over year in the U.S., and the company affirmed its previous guidance of 20% to 25% growth for the full year. Year-old cholesterol drug Praluent missed consensus again at $24 million while doctors and payers await data on its cardiovascular effects, expected early next year.IBD'S TAKE: The N in CAN SLIM is for New -- which is Regeneron's challenge right now. Eylea is 5 years old and its sales growth is slowing, so all eyes are on new drugs such as Praluent and dupilumab to see if they can also turn into blockbusters.Regeneron doesn't provide earnings guidance, but it raised its expense guidance, which has been a recurring theme of the last few quarters. Schoenebaum wrote that the implied EPS guidance still brackets consensus of $10.91.Regeneron also announced that it had filed for approval of its atopic dermatitis drug dupilumab -- one of the fruits of its Sanofi partnership -- with the FDA's decision deadline at Oct. 30. On its earnings conference call, Regeneron executive said dupilumab's launch should be faster than Praluent's, since atopic dermatitis is a large unmet need.Shares of the drugmaker briefly rose at the open Thursday, touching a six-month high of 443.99, but Regeneron stock closed at 433.40 Thursday.
"
252,REGN,"Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) stock recovered Monday from last week's Amgen (AMGN)-induced pitfall to touch an 18-month high after Esperion outlined its path to FDA approval for its cholesterol-busting drug, bempedoic acid.Shares of The Medicines Co. (MDCO) also got a jump-start Monday after it and partner Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) reported strong results for cholesterol-drug, Inclisiran, in a midstage trial.On the stock market today, Esperion shot up 74.1% to 41.20. The Medicines Co. stock lifted 6% to 51.26. Amgen stock edged up 0.35% to 169.21, on a price target cut.Esperion said Monday it's seeking to have bempedoic acid approved to lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. The proposed label would allow bempedoic acid to be used as an adjunct to statin therapy.The FDA said an ongoing phase three trial in patients with elevated ""bad"" LDL cholesterol would be sufficient for approval. Esperion is also planning to look at the cardiovascular benefits of bempedoic acid in reducing heart disease in patients intolerant to statins.On Monday, the FDA and Esperion settled on a definition of statin intolerance as ""the inability to tolerate two or more statins, one at the lowest approved daily dose, due to an adverse effect.""For those patients, Esperion hopes to have bempedoic acid approved as an adjunct therapy. The biotech plans to enroll 12,600 patients with hypercholesterolemia and a high risk of cardiovascular disease in the cardiovascular outcomes trial.The biotech expects to report top-line safety and tolerability data by the second quarter of 2018 and have efficacy data by mid-2018. Esperion expects to file applications for bempedoic acid in the U.S. and Europe in the first half of 2019.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene stock broke out last week on strong results for Otezla. For a breakdown of the factors that led to Celgene's breakout, head to IBD Stock Analysis.Late Friday, The Medicines Co.and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals said Inclisiran cut ""bad"" LDL cholesterol by an average 52.6% and by up to 81% at day 180 at the optimal starting dose regimen.Inclisiran was well tolerated with no material safety issues in the 497-patient trial, The Medicines Co. said in a news release. Inclisiran belongs to a class of drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors.PCSK9 inhibitors work by blocking the interaction between the PCSK9 protein and the LDL receptor. Doing so, cuts down on the ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the blood. Drugs from Amgen and Regeneron (REGN)/Sanofi (SNY) have a similar mechanism.Shares of Alnylam, which is partnered with The Medicines Co. on Inclisiran, were up 8.1% to 59.71.No. 1 biotech Amgen saw more fallout Monday from its disappointing Fourier results early Friday. Investment bank Goldman Sachs cut its price target on Amgen stock to 202 from 208 on lower estimates for cholesterol-drug Repatha. The bank kept its buy rating on Amgen stock.Following Fourier, Amgen said it plans to offer innovative contracts with pharmacy benefit managers and payers. The goal is to expand insurance coverage of Repatha for the cardiovascular benefit, not just to lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol.There were some positive points in the data that Amgen presented Friday, Goldman Sachs analyst Terrence Flynn said. Then, Amgen said Repatha cut down on major adverse cardiovascular events by 15%. But analysts broadly expected 20% or better, he said.""Some investors have pointed to the lack of benefit on cardiovascular death,"" he said. ""But physician feedback suggests this was not a realistic expectation as the trial was not powered to demonstrate this and it took statins a long time to demonstrate a benefit here.""Amgen's results sent shares of Esperion and The Medicines Co. into a tailspin Friday. Shares of Esperion closed down 24.9% with The Medicines Co. stock losing 8.4%. Amgen stock closed down 7.1%.RELATED:Esperion's Dive On Amgen Heart Study 'Counterintuitive' On PricingAmgen Tanks On Heart Study; Shares Of Other Drugmakers Tumble

253,REGN,"XAmgen (AMGN) stock crashed Friday after announcing that its cholesterol drug Repatha, in a long-awaited study, didn't significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular death — prompting shares of rivals to tumble as well.Amgen's study, known as Fourier, found no difference between Repatha patients and those taking benign placebos in terms of cardiovascular death. Repatha, however, cut down on the risk of heart attack by 27%, stroke by 21% and coronary revascularization by 22%.The announcement came during the American College of Cardiology annual meeting in Washington. On average, participants in what was known as Amgen's Fourier study were 69 years old with two-thirds taking moderate statins to lower their cholesterol.Following the results, Amgen stock tanked 6.5% to 168.41 on the stock market today, but found support at the 50-day line.The results of Amgen's Fourier study could be telling for drugs from rival companies, and showed up in stock action Friday. Shares of rival The Medicines Company (MDCO) dove nearly 21% at one point but settled back for an 8% loss. Nearly half of analysts see Medicines Company's cholesterol drug, Inclisiran, as having a cardiovascular benefit.Esperion (ESPR) stock tumbled more than 30% at one point, but recovered somewhat and closed down 20.2. Only 6% of analysts expect its cholesterol drug, bempedoic acid, to have a cardiovascular benefit, according to investment bank RBC.While Repatha disappointed on one front, Amgen did meet its main goal, or primary endpoint, in reducing the risk of a major adverse cardiovascular event by 15%. This includes hospitalization for unstable angina, coronary revascularization, heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene stock broke out this week after unveiling strong results for a trial of Otezla in patients with moderate plaque psoriasis. For a breakdown on Celgene's strong suits — and similarly well-positioned companies — head to IBD Stock Analysis.And when added to optimized statin therapy, Repatha was successful in reducing the combined risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death by 20%, in line with broad views for a 15%-24% reduction.Further, by week 48, Repatha cut ""bad"" LDL cholesterol by 59%. Cholesterol stayed at that level throughout the 2.2-year study, Amgen said. Cholesterol dove to 25 milligrams per deciliter. Less than 100 milligrams is considered a good level.Repatha's effect grew over time. In the first year, Repatha cut down on major adverse cardiovascular events by 16%. That grew to 25% in the second year. Repatha reduced the risk for heart attack by 33% beyond the first year, up from 19%.""We now show for the first time in a dedicated outcomes study that decreasing LDL cholesterol with PCSK9 inhibition (from cholesterol drugs) results in clinically meaningful cardiovascular benefit,"" said Dr. Marc Sabatine, chairman of the TIMI Study Group, who led the study.Repatha works by blocking the interaction between the PCSK9 protein and the LDL receptor. Doing so cuts down on the ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the blood. Praluent, from Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY), has a similar mechanism.The three companies are battling it out in patent court where a judge recently sided with Amgen, saying partners Regeneron and Sanofi had infringed on its patents protecting Repatha. But an injunction on Praluent has been stayed pending the appeal.In sympathy, Regeneron and Sanofi stocks toppled 3.1% and 0.6%, respectively.Bullish analysts had called for a 20%-25% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular benefits, RBC analyst Michael Yee noted in a research report. That ""would be really compelling,"" he noted.""We appreciate there is some short-term profit-taking given data wasn't above expectations,"" Yee said, noting that Amgen stock has run up 22% since the beginning of the year. ""We think (the) stock may pause short term given such a big run, but will recover and grind back higher over the year.""The Fourier data is a short-term disappointment and Amgen stock remains relatively cheap, he said. Plus, the reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events is likely to improve over time. Statins have more than five years of data to back them; Repatha-plus-statins in Fourier had just 2.2 years.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges was more bearish.""These results are at the lower end of the investors' expectations, and commentators have already pointed out there was no effect on cardiovascular or overall mortality,"" he wrote in a report. ""On the other hand, the benefit in terms of cardiovascular event risk was 20%.""So, there is a tie between lowering ""bad"" LDL cholesterol and cardiovascular health, he said.""For this high-risk patient group it seems likely that such medicines will become standard of care, virtually regardless of LDL level,"" he said. ""However, for lower risk patients, this study still leaves payors with significant ammunition to restrict access.""Repatha costs just north of $14,000 per year. Regeneron and Sanofi's Praluent costs $500 more.RELATED:Amgen Tops Heart Study As Rivals Regeneron, Sanofi Chill In CourtAmgen Could Boost Rivals On Positive Heart Disease Study
"
254,REGN,"No. 1 biotech Amgen (AMGN) is prepping to unveil the results of a key cholesterol study later this week as its only rival, a drug from Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY), remains entangled in patent court.On Monday, Amgen offered top-line results of a separate study. It examined the effect of Amgen's drug, Repatha, in reducing LDL cholesterol.Repatha met its primary endpoint, reducing the need for apheresis, a medical procedure in which blood is filtered outside the body. It also met its secondary endpoint: a reduction in cholesterol levels by week four.Amgen is expected to release full results of its Fourier study at 9 a.m. ET on Friday during the American College of Cardiology annual meeting in Washington. Fourier looked at Repatha's ability to reduce heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular disease in patients with ""bad"" LDL cholesterol.Repatha belongs to a class of drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors that work to reduce ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in a patient's blood. It competes directly with Praluent, a drug from Regeneron and Sanofi. The Medicines Company (MDCO) has a rival drug with a slightly different mechanism.IBD'S TAKE: As Amgen, Regeneron and Sanofi duke it out in patent court, Gilead is facing its own slew of issues arising from slowing sales of hepatitis C drugs. But could one analyst's call for Gilead to buy something have paid off? Head to IBD's Industry Themes for more.Earlier this year, a judge banned sales of Praluent, saying Regeneron and Sanofi had infringed on Amgen's patents for Repatha. Last month, a judge stayed the ban pending Regeneron and Sanofi's appeal, meaning that they can continue selling Praluent for now.If Amgen is successful, it will be the first time a branded product is yanked off the shelves as a result of patent litigation. Amgen is unlikely to settle, analysts say. Regeneron and Sanofi argue that Amgen's patents are too broad.Amgen shares fell 0.2% to 181.05 on the stock market today. Regeneron rose 0.2% to 388.88 while Sanofi dipped 0.2% to 43.84.RELATED:AbbVie Stronger Bet Than Gilead, Amgen — At Least Until 2020: LeerinkRegeneron, Sanofi Temporarily Stave Off Ban Of Amgen-Rivaling LDL-Buster
"
255,REGN,"The spectacular rise and even more spectacular collapse of Valeant Pharmaceuticals had multiple causes, but at the heart of the story was how much the biotech company relied on big drug price increases for growth.Not only did those price hikes make Valeant (VRX) politically unpopular, but they also meant the business was ultimately unsustainable. Money managers prefer biotechs and pharmas that produce drugs with growing customer demand, as signaled by growth in sales volume.""As you would think, the preferable avenue for revenue growth is through volume, as significant price increases (like we have seen over the past two years) can only be repeated for a few years,"" Leonard Yaffe, health care portfolio manager at Kessef Capital, told IBD in an email. ""The more the revenue increase is due to volume, the more value is assigned to the drug.""If you're hunting for big growth stocks, and biotechs catch your eye, looking past the headline revenue numbers can help you see which companies might have more sustainable -- and even accelerating -- growth. If volume growth lags sales increases, the company is leaning on price, which might not last.Most price increases are far more moderate than Valeant's 525% and 212% price hikes for heart drugs Nitropress and Isuprel, respectively. But many companies regularly lift their prices well past the inflation rate, which can prop up revenue but disguise actual demand.IBD'S TAKE: Big caps can deliver still deliver big gains, often with less volatility than smaller-cap stocks. That's also true in biotech, which has some strong big-cap companies. Amgen and Biogen are among current residents of the IBD Big Cap 20.Comparing volume and revenue is worthwhile for another reason: If volume growth was more than overall revenue growth, this signals that a company is having to rebate more of its list price than it did last year to move product, and/or is rolling out the drug in countries that extracted a lower price (as is often the case in Europe). Investors don't like this either, because it signals that insurers and other payors are putting the thumbscrews on the company.""Payor mix obviously is very critical as well, as large, consolidated payors which cover many many lives have negotiating power and can pick/choose/rationalize products based on price, efficacy, alternatives etc.,"" Thomas Vandeventer, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management, told IBD in an email.Second-quarter earnings reports and conference call comments revealed that while some biotech giants and hot stocks relied almost solely on price increases for growth, others expanded mostly on volume increases, and still others credited a mix of both.Amgen (AMGN) was a classic example of leaning on price: Q2 revenue rose 6%, but volume growth was zero.Much of this stems from the age of Amgen's leading drugs. Its top-seller, rheumatoid-arthritis drug Enbrel, is over a decade old, and its volume shrank 2% in the quarter. But it still contributed 10% growth thanks to pricing.Two drugs that are even older, Epogen and Neupogen, shrank in both price and volume because they're facing new biosimilar competition. Newer drugs Prolia and Xgeva made up the difference by growing on both fronts. But this is one reason why, despite the fact that it beat Q2 estimates and raised guidance, Amgen stock initially dropped after the earnings report.In contrast to Amgen, Celgene's (CELG) revenue rose 22% in Q2, and 16 of those percentage points came from volume growth, according to the company. It didn't break the percentages down by individual drug like Amgen did, but the company said demand was good across the board.Celgene also beat forecasts and raised guidance for future sales and profit, and its stock jumped 3% after the report.Medivation (MDVN) demonstrates the sneaky power of rebating. The list price of prostate-cancer drug Xtandi -- for now, Medivation's only marketed drug -- rose 6% during the second quarter. But while revenue overall rose 17% -- a bit less than analysts expected -- volume grew 18%.""The growth in underlying demand for Xtandi was partially offset by a lower net price for Xtandi due to a year-over-year increase in the gross-to-net rate,"" said CFO Jennifer Jarrett on the Q2 earnings conference call, gross-to-net being industry-speak for the rebate level.Xtandi has been in a tight competition with Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Zytiga in the prostate-cancer market, and J&J has been undercutting its price. CVS Health's (CVS) recently released 2017 drug formulary passed over Xtandi for Zytiga for this reason.Following their Q2 reports, here's a rundown of how the other big biotechs are faring on the price vs. volume question:""In the United States, the lion's share from a change (on a) year-over-year basis is price, and is pretty stable unit trends on Tecfidera, pretty stable unit trends on Tysabri and modest, gradual decline on the interferon franchise (which includes Avonex and Plegridy),"" Clancy said. ""Ex-United States, we are not seeing any pricing (increases) on a year-over-year basis, and all of the gains are attributable to volume and unit expansion.""Biogen's overall revenue rose 12% in the quarter, beating expectations.Lead drug Soliris provides the vast majority of revenue, and its volume rose 15% on a 10% hike in sales. The rest of the top line came from newly launched drugs that have no year-over-year comparison.Incyte's revenue jumped 51% year over year, beating expectations.RELATED:Are Biotechs Making A Comeback: 5 Stocks To WatchBiotechs Are Making A Case For Leadership, But Is It A Good One?

256,REGN,"The jobs report pushed stocks toward fresh all-time highs in a busy week. Tesla Motors (TSLA) announced a deal to buy SolarCity (SCTY) as tech M&A was strong. General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) fueled a sell-off in consumer-related stocks, while oil prices briefly undercut $40 a barrel. Also, the Bank of England cut rates and revived bond buying.The major averages were little changed through Thursday, but rallied Friday on the strong jobs report. The Nasdaq climbed 1.1% for the week for a record close Friday and just 10 points below its July 2015 intraday peak. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, hitting a fresh intraday best. The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.6%. Energy stocks fell as oil undercut $40 early in the week, but rallied as crude recovered somewhat.The U.S. economy added 255,000 jobs in July, the second straight month of much-better-than-expected hiring, allaying fears about the economy. ISM's manufacturing index and nonmanufacturing index fell a little more than forecast, but still pointed to growth. Strong hiring and wage gains should support consumer spending and housing demand, despite many consumer-related firms reporting stalling demand.Tesla took a step closer toward acquiring SolarCity for $2.6 billion as a special committee of ""independent and disinterested"" SolarCity board members evaluated the proposal and alternatives, stating its approval of the merger. The deal still needs to be approved by shareholders and regulators.Tesla reported Q2 earnings that missed estimates but showed improvements in electric-car production. Its production is on track to support about 50,000 deliveries in the second half of 2016, which reaffirmed previous guidance.The electric-car company's losses ballooned to $1.06 a share from 48 cents in the year-earlier figure, much greater than the 52-cent loss estimate. Tesla reported non-GAAP revenue of $1.56 billion, up 33% but missing the consensus of $1.62 billion.Tesla fell 2% for the week, while SolarCity lost more than 7%.Ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies is selling its Chinese operations to Apple (AAPL)-backed rival Didi Chuxing Technologies, capitulating on an expensive battle for a foothold in China. The deal has Uber swapping its Chinese business for a 20% stake in Didi, making the former foe the largest stakeholder in Didi. In turn, Didi will become the de facto ride-hailing leader in China, valued at more than $35 billion. Uber's most recent valuations put it north of $68 billion.Verizon Communications (VZ) agreed to buy Fleetmatics (FLTX), a vehicle tracking system maker, for $2.4 billion, or $60 per share. The acquisition expands Verizon' push into web-connected vehicles, part of the Internet of Things. Ireland-based Fleetmatics' mobile-software platform lets businesses manage commercial fleets by providing data on vehicle location, fuel usage, speed and mileage.Verizon fell 3.2% for the week, dropping below a buy point and its 50-day moving average. Fleetmatics jumped 38.5% to 59.50.Time Warner (TWX) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) both turned in mixed results, but Time Warner's move to buy a 10% stake in Netflix (NFLX) rival Hulu – joining current co-owners Walt Disney (DIS), Fox and Comcast (CMCSA) -- stole headlines. Viacom (VIAB) reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, as did Lions Gate (LGF), which posted a surprise Q1 profit.U.S. oil prices fell below $40 per barrel early in the week, following July's 14% tumble, as OPEC production climbed on strong output from Nigeria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia continued to pump out oil near record highs. U.S. crude stockpiles rose in the latest week, according to the Energy Information Administration, but U.S. production dipped and gasoline supplies fell. Shale producers Continental Resources (CLR), Oasis Petroleum (OAS), and Laredo Petroleum (LPI) all lifted their output forecasts. Oil closed the week higher, at $41.80.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) plunged 16% Friday after its cancer drug Opdivo ended a string of clinical-trial successes with its failure in a trial as a single therapy of newly diagnosed lung-cancer patients. Merck (MRK) had succeeded with a similar patient group in a trial of its competing drug Keytruda, though it was aiming at a smaller potential market. Merck stock jumped 10.4%, hitting its highest level since June 2001.Earlier, Merck was reported to be talking with Biogen (BIIB) about a possible Biogen buyout, as was Allergan (AGN). This further boosted Biogen's stock a day after its partner Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) announced the unexpected success of a clinical trial of nusinersen, a treatment for a rare spinal disease with blockbuster potential. Biogen rose nearly 9% for the week.Meanwhile specialty drugmakers Mallinckrodt (MNK) and Shire (SHPG) rose 19% and 3.5%, respectively, after they beat estimates and raised guidance, while Pfizer (PFE), Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) slipped after they beat Q2 numbers but issued so-so guidance. Animal-health company Zoetis (ZTS) also rose after beating and raising.General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) led auto stocks lower after reporting slower U.S. sales for the month of July, with Ford projecting U.S. industry sales to fall in 2016 and 2017 after years of big gains. Department stores, grocery stores, restaurants and airlines also declined, but recovered somewhat by week's end.The sell-off among consumer stocks triggers a warning for the broader U.S. economy amid falling business investment and homebuilder spending. Consumer spending rose at a strong 4.2% annual rate in Q2, but if that falters, the economy may not be able to match its anemic Q2 GDP growth of 1.2%.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) beat Q2 earnings estimates, with EPS up 57% to 47 cents, but revenue growth of 12% to $508.8 million missed views. The steakhouse chain also said early Q3 same-restaurant sales growth had slowed from Q2.The outlook comes amid growing worries about the restaurant sector overall. Starbucks (SBUX) and McDonald's both recently reported weak U.S. comps amid warnings from analysts about the retail sector.But pizza delivery chains including Papa John's (PZZA) are bucking the trend. Papa John's said EPS jumped 30% to 61 cents to top views, and raised guidance for the rest of the year. Also, chicken-themed El Pollo Loco (LOCO) and Wingstop (WING) rallied on their results, while Jack In The Box (JACK) soared on its earnings.Separately, Monster Beverage (MNST) reported weaker-than-expected earnings growth, but topped on revenue forecasts. Monster Beverage, a Leaderboard stock, rallied Friday, hitting a new high.IBD'S TAKE: Investors should look for growth stocks clearing proper buy points. IBD Leaderboard is a premium service that provides detailed chart analysis of leading stocks. See what other top-rated growth names are at or near buy points.The Bank of England cut interest rates by a quarter-point to 0.25%, as expected, as the U.K. economy slows in reaction to the Brexit vote. But policymakers went further, reviving government bond purchases and announcing that the BOE would buy corporate debt. They also signaled that a rate cut to near-zero is likely by year-end, but BOE Gov. Mark Carney said he's opposed to negative rates and ""helicopter"" money.Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), which makes crushed stone, sand and other aggregates used in construction, fell short of second-quarter forecasts. Rival aggregates supplier Vulcan Materials (VMC) also badly missed. In the related ready-mix concrete market, U.S. Concrete (USCR) reported that Q2 EPS plunged 59% to 54 cents, missing by 41 cents. Revenue rose 12.7% but also missed. All three blamed bad weather and said they expect better results in the second half. Martin Marietta CEO Ward Nye cited ""record or near-record rainfall and its attendant effects in many of our key markets."" Shares of the trio fell hard on the earnings misses but recovered some lost ground by the end of the week.Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported a 7% decrease in passenger unit revenue for July, saying the drop was in line with its expectations. But investors appeared worried about the tone the results set for the third quarter, during which Delta said the key metric of operating efficiency would fall 4%-6%. German carrier Lufthansa warned that terror attacks and economic uncertainty would affect travel also hurt the sector. Delta stock fell 2.8%. American Airlines (AAL) and  JetBlue (JBLU) also sank but United Airlines (UAL), Southwest (LUV) closed the week higher. .Aetna (AET), Humana (HUM) and WellCare (WCG) all put out estimate-beating quarterly results this week. However, Aetna said it would abandon its 2017 expansion plans in ObamaCare exchanges. Humana recently said it will exit most ObamaCare exchange markets next year, following UnitedHealth (UNH). Aetna and Humana trying to overcome antitrust objections to a merger.With safety and security concerns on people's minds in the wake of a series of officer-involved shootings, both of police officers and by police of unarmed civilians, sales of Sturm Ruger (RGR) firearms grew 19% in the second quarter to $167.9 million, down from Q1's 26% rise. Earnings climbed 34% to $1.22 per share. The FBI reported that firearm background checks, seen as an indicator of future gun sales, rose 3% in July from June and were up 37% from July 2015. Shares fell 4.5% the day after earnings as Ruger's CEO said he was stepping down but closed the week down only 1.2%.Meanwhile Taser International (TASR) said Q2 EPS fell to 7 cents a share from 11 cents a year ago. But that beat forecasts by 3 cents a share. Sales popped 26% to $58.8 million, easily topping views for $54.42 million. The stun gun maker said bookings for its Axon body cameras soared 135%.Taser stock rose 1%, hitting a 1-year high.

257,REGN,"Leerink offered a mostly bullish preview of the coming earnings season for big biotechs Wednesday, offering hope for a lagging sector.Analyst Geoffrey Porges raised his Q2 estimates on Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN).He wrote that prescription data from IMS Health (IMS) indicates a ""flat to slightly up"" trend over Q1, with Celgene standing out with 62% year-over-year volume growth driven by its new psoriasis drug Otezla. But on top of that, drugmakers evidently shrugged off recent political criticism and raised prices on a number of products.""The WAC (wholesale acquisition cost) price of Celgene's Otezla increased in April by 7.9%, following an 8% raise in January and, before that, an increase of 9.9% last June -- representing a year-over-year cumulative increase of 28%; Celgene also raised the price of Abraxane in April, a 10% year-over-year cumulative increase,"" Porges wrote. ""Other Q2 price increases included: Amgen's Kyprolis (8% YoY); Biogen's Tecfidera (16%), Avonex (16%), and Plegridy (16%); and Medivation's (MDVN) Xtandi (6%).""Leerink nonetheless lowered its estimates for Medivation, based on lower Xtandi sales, as well as a lower royalty on sales outside the U.S. He also modestly lowered his forecasts for Amgen (AMGN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), though he added that he was still above consensus on both companies.Celgene stock climbed 4.3% to 104.60 on the stock market today. The stock may also have been helped by anonymously sourced reports that it was one of the companies which signed non-disclosure agreements with Medivation ahead of a possible buyout.Regeneron stock climbed 3.3% to 371.57. Alexion advanced 3% to 121.12. Biogen rose 2.3% and Gilead 2.2%.Vertex stock rose 3.6% to 89.66 after it announced a licensing deal with Moderna Therapeutics to develop a cystic-fibrosis treatment using Moderna's messenger RNA technology. Vertex agreed to $20 million in cash and a $20 million investment upfront, with up to $275 million in milestone payments if the drug succeeds.

258,REGN,"Type 2 diabetes is battled by some of the best-selling drugs from some of the world's biggest drugmakers, but these companies are eyeing even bigger sales with a new generation of treatments.While changes in this field have proved more evolutionary than revolutionary, several events in the next few months -- starting as soon as Monday -- could eventually move billions of dollars, make compliance with treatment easier, and even prevent death from heart disease.Diabetes drugs provide the single best-selling products for Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Merck (MRK), while almost all of Novo Nordisk's (NVO) $16 billion in annual revenue comes from diabetes treatments. Health care research firm GlobalData says diabetes treatments will bring in nearly $60 billion by 2025.""We're getting better and better at managing diabetes in general,"" said Les Funtleyder, health care portfolio manager with E Squared Asset Management. ""We have more options. ... The next phase is going to be getting people to adhere to regimens that work.""For diabetes patients -- and Type 2 diabetes is one of the world's most common diseases -- sticking to their treatments can be difficult because the medication routine gets increasingly complicated as the disease progresses.If diet and exercise fail, patients go on oral drugs, starting with cheap generics such as metformin. If that proves insufficient, doctors can add newer, branded oral medicines, which come in two classes: DPP4 inhibitors, led by Merck's Januvia, and the more recent SGLT2 inhibitors, led by J&J's Invokana. The two classes work by different mechanisms but are sometimes combined.If yet further intervention is required, patients move to injectable drugs. Nowadays, the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs are usually the first line of attack, a class including Novo Nordisk's Victoza and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Trulicity.IBD'S TAKE: Eli Lilly stock had a nice five-year run that ended about a year ago. Now, it sports weak Composite and Relative Strength Ratings of 34 and 39, respectively, and shouldn't get much of your stock-picking attention. But the company aims to rebound, as the CEO told IBD in an exclusive Q&A this year.After that comes the most familiar treatment for diabetes: insulin. Modern insulins come in different varieties, including long-acting versions like Sanofi's (SNY) Lantus and Novo's Tresiba, which need to be injected only once a day, and faster-acting ones for use at mealtimes, such as Lilly's Humalog and Novo's NovoLog.With this pile-up of meds, patients can have trouble keeping up. So one approach to simplifying the routine is creating combination drugs, as was done successfully with the HIV market.Both Sanofi and Novo Nordisk are awaiting FDA decisions on their combinations of insulins and GLP-1s, after back-to-back FDA advisory panels in May recommended approval. Novo's Xultophy won unanimous support, while Sanofi's LixiLan had a couple of dissenters due to safety issues related to the pen injector used to administer the drug.The FDA's deadline for deciding on Xultophy is Monday. The Sanofi decision is due next month, but it hasn't revealed the specific deadline.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez sees blockbuster potential in both drugs, though he expects they'll take 10 years to hit peak sales.""As we have seen with other recent major primary-care launches such as PCSK9s (Sanofi/Regeneron (REGN)/ Amgen (AMGN)), Entresto (Novartis (NVS)), and Breo Ellipta (GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)), we expect a slow initial launch of this class in the first few years,"" Fernandez wrote in a May 26 research note.""In our view, Novo's Xultophy could have a slight upper hand in the drug/device profile and positioning in the treatment algorithm that could lead to better physician acceptance and market uptake,"" he said. ""In our overall diabetes model, we forecast $5 billion peak sales for Xultophy and $1.5 billion to $2 billion peak sales for LixiLan.""Another FDA decision much anticipated on Wall Street is on an already approved drug, Lilly's SGLT2 inhibitor Jardiance. Last year, Lilly stunned the industry when a large, five-year trial showed that Jardiance significantly extended the lifespans of diabetes patients, reducing the death rate by 32% and death from cardiovascular causes by 38%. It also sharply reduced hospitalizations for heart failure.Some analysts said Jardiance should see an instant uptick in sales, so spectacular were the results. When that didn't happen, Lilly closely studied the issue, says Enrique Conterno, president of Lilly Diabetes.""For us to realize that potential, two things need to happen,"" Conterno told IBD. ""The first is that we need the data on our label. And the second is we need new treatment guidelines to be established.""Canada's already made changes in the relevant medical societies' treatment guidelines, Conterno says, and he expects the same in the U.S. early next year.Getting the label changed means that Lilly's sales reps will be able to talk about the cardiovascular benefits to customers, which is important since the primary-care doctors who write most of the diabetes prescriptions aren't always up on the specialist research.Lilly has applied to expand the label to include that information, or at least put the clinical-trial results in the packaging.Approval, however, isn't quite the slam-dunk one might expect from the trial results. That's because of the way Lilly designed the trial. Its primary endpoint, which is normally the most important one to the FDA, was a composite of different measurements of cardiovascular health, and that produced mixed results. The specific findings in heart failure and overall deaths were ""exploratory"" endpoints.Thus, the FDA advisory panel only narrowly recommended changing the label when it met on June 28. Changing the label on the basis of a secondary endpoint would set a precedent, so it remains so unclear what the FDA will do that one analyst compared it to a coin flip.""We view approval for an actual CV death indication as having coin-flip odds, given the unprecedented nature/results of the trial,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum in an email on June 29. ""That said, we also feel that there's a better chance the FDA would allow this data to be added to the label.""It also remains to be seen how the competition will shape up.Last month, Novo Nordisk reported that its GLP-1, called Victoza, also reduced cardiovascular death, though not quite as much as Jardiance. Since Jardiance is oral and Victoza is injectable, they occupy slightly different positions in the treatment regimen.But Jardiance's most direct competitor, J&J's Invokana, is also the subject of a cardiovascular outcomes trial due for completion in February, with initial results possibly coming out earlier.Because of all these different variables, the companies that will do best in diabetes are those with the broadest portfolios, Funtleyder says. He cites Lilly and Novo Nordisk has having particularly comprehensive programs.""That gives them some advantages on a salesforce leverage basis -- the same sales guy can sample multiple drugs,"" he said. ""They have some benefits with payers (because) they can bundle the drugs together (on) one big bill instead of PBMs (pharmacy benefit managers) having to negotiate separate pills.""Eli Lilly shares rose 1.5% on the stock market today to their best levels since late January. Novo Nordisk climbed 1.1%. J&J dipped 0.1%.

259,REGN,"Amgen (AMGN) could haul up shares of The Medicines Company (MDCO) and Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) on Friday if its LDL cholesterol-buster Repatha shows a cardiovascular benefit in a long-awaited study, an analyst said Tuesday.Amgen, the No. 1 biotech, is set to release the results of its Fourier study at 9 a.m. ET on Friday during the American College of Cardiology annual meeting in Washington. Fourier examines Repatha's ability to reduce heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular disease.Repatha is already approved to reduce ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. It competes against Praluent, a drug from Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY). A judge recently ruled that Praluent infringes on Amgen's patents for Repatha. But an injunction on Praluent has been stayed pending the appeal.Meanwhile, Amgen is facing mounting pressure from the likes of The Medicines Company, Merck (MRK) and Esperion. Repatha and Praluent both work by blocking an enzyme that degrades the receptors responsible for removing ""bad"" LDL cholesterol from the blood.The specific market for Amgen's and Regeneron/Sanofi's drugs — which belong to a class called PCSK9 inhibitors — could grow to at least $3 billion to $5 billion in worldwide sales over the next five years, RBC estimated. There's a theoretical 5 million patients in the U.S.IBD'S TAKE: Amgen might lead by market cap, but it trails Celgene in terms of key growth metrics. Amgen has an IBD Composite Rating of 96, out of a best-possible 99. But Celgene leads with a CR of 99. Visit the Stock Checkup for a breakdown of the top five rated biotechs.Drugs from The Medicines Company, Merck and Esperion have slightly different mechanisms, but could also help reduce cardiovascular disease, according to doctors surveyed by investment bank RBC.Those surveyed say Amgen's data will be strong if Repatha can reduce cardiovascular disease by 15%-24%. Nearly half think Inclisiran from The Medicines Company will have a cardiovascular benefit. Nearly a third think Merck's anacetrapib will be able to reduce cardiovascular disease.Esperion, on the other hand, ""still needs to get out there and build awareness,"" RBC analysts wrote in a research report. Only 6% of doctors expect Esperion's bempedoic acid to meet its goal of reducing LDL cholesterol and showing a cardiovascular benefit in studies.""We still think that stock can grind higher given small market cap and wholly-owned rights and phase three data starting in 2018,"" RBC said.Amgen shares fell 0.5% to 180.12 on the stock market today.RELATED:Amgen Tops Heart Study As Regeneron, Sanofi Chill In CourtAbbVie Stronger Bet Than Amgen — At Least Until 2020: Leerink

261,REGN,"The first half of 2016 was an exceptionally difficult one for drug stocks, not just because of overall sentiment but because of a relative dearth of good news compared with the previous few years.The second half of the year, however, will bring some very important clinical-trial news from several leading players, with the potential to move stocks sharply. Here's a look at some major events ahead:• Probably the most anticipated data drop of the year is Eli Lilly's (LLY) initial report on its Alzheimer's disease drug solanezumab, expected in December. With almost 50 million sufferers worldwide, Alzheimer's is one of the largest diseases that doesn't have a current treatment. And the many companies that have attempted to create one have a long history of failure.The phase-two trials suggest that solanezumab isn't a miracle cure -- it only created a statistically significant improvement when Lilly parsed the data to focus on early-stage cases. Lilly created a patient pool for its phase-three trial, Expedition 3, composed entirely of such cases. In an interview this year, Lilly CEO John Lechleiter told IBD that Alzheimer's will probably be treated by more than one product, ""not unlike the way diabetes is treated today, not unlike the way cancer is treated.""Lilly at first had two primary endpoints for the trial: improvement in cognitive decline and improvement in functional decline. However, in March it demoted the functional-decline measurement to a secondary endpoint, which analysts took as a sign that Lilly thinks it might miss that one. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan noted that pooled data from the previous two trials showed a 34% impact in slowing cognitive decline, but only a 17% impact in slowing functional decline.""From a regulatory perspective, however, being able to show signs of a functional benefit remains important, and on this point we are now incrementally more cautious,"" Divan wrote in a March 15 research note.Biogen (BIIB) and its investors will be among the interested spectators of Lilly's report. Biogen's earlier-stage drug aducanumab is based on the same theory as solanezumab, that reducing the amyloid plaques that form in Alzheimer's patients' brains will slow the disease progression. So far, this hypothesis hasn't been definitively proven.• Gilead Sciences (GILD) also has a risky but potentially high-reward program in the works, though it's garnered somewhat less attention. After all but conquering hepatitis C with its drugs Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa, Gilead has turned its attention to hepatitis B, a virus even more common than hep C and with only a 5% cure rate with current treatments.In a June 23 report, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said Gilead Chief Science Officer Norbert Bischofberger is placing the most confidence in GS-9620, which this year will read out its first data in humans.""Dr. Bischofberger explained that the first cohort for these studies is always virally suppressed patients, and the data should be available for these patients for presentation during November's American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) conference; data from the second cohort, virally naive patients, should be available at next year's European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) conference,"" Porges wrote.• Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and its big-pharma partner Sanofi (SNY) could report the first data on whether their cholesterol-lowering drug Praluent can reduce death from cardiovascular disease. Full results from the trial aren't expected until next year, but Regeneron will do an interim analysis to see if results have achieved ""overwhelming efficacy"" that would justify stopping the trial early.Initially, Amgen (AMGN) was expected to be the first to report such data on a PCSK9 inhibitor, the class of drug to which Praluent and Amgen's Repatha belong. In early June, however, Amgen pushed that report to early 2017.Praluent and Repatha have both underperformed expectations since they launched last year, but Regeneron and Amgen have warned that sales would likely be slow until they could prove to payers that their drugs actually improve patients' health. In its Q1 earnings report in April, Amgen said that 77% of Repatha prescriptions were rejected at the pharmacy because they require prior authorization from the insurer.Biogen shares rose 1.3% on the stock market today. Gilead Sciences climbed 1.7%, Regeneron 2.65% and Amgen 1.4%.IBD's Take: Biogen, Gilead and Regeneron are all trading well off their highs, below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages as investors worry about slowing growth and drug pricing pressures from regulators and politicians.

262,REGN,"Swiss pharma giant Novartis (NVS) cut a licensing deal with California biotech Xencor (XNCR) on two early-stage blood-cancer treatments that could be worth up to $2.41 billion, the companies announced Tuesday.Novartis agreed to pay $150 million upfront, with the rest in clinical, regulatory and sales milestones should the two drug candidates, XmAb14045 and XmAb13676, make it to market. The two candidates, for acute myeloid leukemia and B-cell malignancies, are both set to begin clinical development this year.Novartis will pay a royalty on foreign sales, while Xencor retains U.S. commercialization rights. Novartis also has the right to select four more candidates for development and to use Xencor's bispecific antibody technology to develop up to 10 more drugs.Bispecific antibodies are fragments of two different antibodies used to direct the body's immune system to attack cancer cells by deploying the body's T cells. It's a new technology being pursued by several companies, including Amgen (AMGN), which made its own licensing deal with Xencor in September, as well as AbbVie (ABBV) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN).""We view the favorable terms received by Xencor as consistent with our thesis that bispecific antibodies are poised to play a more important role in cancer immunotherapy,"" wrote Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt in a research note praising the ""great economics"" of the deal for Xencor.The deal also enlarges Novartis' toolkit in blood cancer. The company has been one of the leaders in developing the much-watched chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapies, its most advanced candidate being CTL019 for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Xencor stock catapulted by 32.1% at the close on the stock market today, to 16.56, after touching a nine-month high of 18.19. Novartis stock was up 3% to 79.59.
"
263,REGN,"Biotech stock analysts pondered the potential impact of the Brexit Friday morning, finding that most big U.S. biotechs have low exposure in the U.K. but could run into other headaches.Exposure to the European Union in general ranged from 9% for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) to 37% for Celgene (CELG), according to Jefferies. Celgene nevertheless told Evercore ISI that less than 1% of its revenue comes from the U.K.Gilead Sciences' (GILD) EU exposure is 19%, while its U.K. exposure is 2.9%, according to Evercore's calculations.Vertex Pharmaceuticals' (VRTX) EU exposure is 29%, with 2.5% in Britain, but RBC Capital Markets notes that's expected to grow as Vertex's latest cystic-fibrosis drug Orkambi is supposed to get reimbursement in the U.K. next year. RBC analyst Michael Yee said in a research note that it's ""not clear whether these (reimbursement) negotiations will be impacted in any way.""However, Edison Investment analyst Maxim Jacobs opined in a research note that these measurements of exposure were ""looking at the wrong kind of risk. The risk is if a global bear market kills biotech funding.""Needham analyst Alan Carr wrote that Britain's separation from the EU will also bring regulatory complications down the road.""The European Medicines Agency (EMA), which conducts a centralized drug review process for Europe, is based in London,"" Carr wrote in a research note. ""If Article 50 (the withdrawal clause) is invoked, the EMA will need to move, and the U.K. will need to establish a new, separate regulatory organization.""Although we do not expect a meaningful impact on companies with drugs now under review by the EMA, Brexit will lead to a less efficient, more expensive, and potentially lengthier regulatory process for companies seeking approval in the EU and U.K.""Biotechs were hammered along with the rest of the market on the stock market today. Celgene fell 4.3% to 96.29, Regeneron was off 4.9% to 339.48 to its lowest level since October 2014. Gilead faltered 3.5% to 80.47, a 2-year low. Vertex shed 7.1% to 81.90. IBD's biotech industry group plunged 4.5%.
"
264,REGN,"The Treasury Department's annual financial review of Medicare found that its growth rate won't trigger a cost-cutting panel this week, sending drug stocks higher Wednesday.Ahead of the report on Tuesday, speculation had broken out that growth could be high enough to trigger an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to come up with ways to cut spending. The Brookings Institution had scheduled an event Thursday to discuss the issue.""Last year's report projected that the hospital insurance trust fund would be depleted by 2030 -- just 14 years from now,"" Brookings' website said. ""The report also predicted a more immediate and controversial event: The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), famously nicknamed 'death panels,' would be required to submit proposals to reduce Medicare spending in 2018, with the reductions taking place in 2019.""The report of the Medicare Board of Trustees actually moved the depletion date two years earlier, but it said that there still wasn't enough growth in costs to trigger an IPAB. That seemed to turn around the major medical groups: biotech stocks had headed south Tuesday afternoon, but after the mid-morning announcement IBD's Medical-Biotech group rose 1.35%. The Ethical Drugs group was up 0.6%.Even if an IPAB had been triggered, analysts doubted the impact would have been that big, given the restrictions on the sort of cuts the panel could make. Late Tuesday, RBC Capital Markets' Michael Yee ran the numbers:""We note 8 million to 10 million 'dual eligibles' added to 50 million 60 million Medicaid patients, thus growing by 20%,"" Yee wrote in his research note. ""Taking Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) Medicaid exposure (10-20%) and growing it by 20% to get the larger Medicaid '23% rebate,' our calculations show that this would change revenues by no more than 1% or so if this happened.""Celgene stock, which fell 2.5% in heavy trading Tuesday, rose more than 3% intraday, closing 2.45% at 99.23 on the stock market today. Regeneron stock climbed 4% intraday, setting for a 2% rise to 351.92 after dropping 2.1% Tuesday. Amgen and Biogen shares rose fractionally after both sank nearly 1% Tuesday.Despite the timing of it all, though, hedge fund manager Leonard Yaffe wasn't convinced that the IPAB business was the actual reason for the stock moves, as biotechs had been trending downward since early June.""The rebound in biopharma stocks today is much more than offsetting the concerns mentioned yesterday, as well as the likelihood of fund redemptions; the stocks had become very attractive, and the prospects for several companies are bright,"" Yaffe wrote in an email.

267,REGN,"Big pharma Pfizer (PFE) said Monday that it's acquiring small biopharma Anacor Pharmaceuticals (ANAC) for $4.5 billion in cash, sending the latter's stock up more than 57% Monday.Pfizer agreed to pay $99.26 a share for Anacor, a 55% premium over Friday's closing price, though shares closed Monday just above 100. The total transaction value is $5.2 billion, assuming the conversion of Anacor's outstanding convertible notes, Pfizer said. Anacor's sole commercial product is a toenail-fungus ointment called Kerydin, distributed by Novartis (NVS), but Pfizer's press release on the merger played up Anacor's eczema treatment crisaborole, which is under FDA review due for completion by Jan. 7.""We believe the acquisition of Anacor represents an attractive opportunity to address a significant unmet medical need for a large patient population with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis, which currently has few safe topical treatments available,"" said Albert Bourla, head of Pfizer's innovative businesses, in the release.Pfizer estimates crisaborole could reach peak annual sales of $2 billion.The buyout adds another asset to Pfizer's innovate drug business, which it is widely expected to separate from its established-products business sometime in the next few years. Pfizer has said that it will make a decision on whether to split by year's end.Pfizer already has a significant presence in inflammation and immunology, including blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis treatments Enbrel (sold in partnership with Amgen (AMGN)) and Xeljanz. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) recently reported strong late-stage data for its injectable drug dupilumab in atopic dermatitis, so while the market is currently underserved, it may soon become more competitive.""It is not easy to make a cross-trial comparison between Crisaborole and Dupi as Regenron's treatment targets moderate-to-severe patients, while Crisa targets mild-to-moderate patients (as well as different routes of administration -- injectable vs. topical -- and a different primary endpoint),"" wrote Evercore IS analyst Mark Schoenebaum in an email to clients, ""but looking at top-line data for Investigator's Global Assessment the drugs are relatively comparable with Dupi appearing to be more effective if corrected for placebo: Dupilumab phase three demonstrated that 36% to 38% achieved clearing or near-clearing of skin lesions after 16 weeks ... compared to 10% and 8.5% with placebo, while (with) Crisaborole 52% (of) patients achieved clearance but at (a) much larger placebo background (30%-40% placebo patients achieved clearance with Crisaborole) after four weeks.""Besides Regeneron, Roche (RHHBY) and AstraZeneca (AZN) both have injectable atopic dermatitis treatments in midstage testing.Anacor stock closed at 100.67 on the stock market today. Pfizer stock rose a fraction, to 33.38, while Regeneron stock rose 6.1%. Roche and AstraZeneca were each up about 1%.

268,REGN,"Averaging up and averaging down are two terms often heard but not well understood by beginning investors.Averaging up is what happens when you add to a position in a rising stock. Every time you make a new purchase, the cost of the new shares is higher than the last purchase price. This drives up the average cost of your position -- the total investment averaged across all of your accumulated shares.Averaging down is the opposite: buying a declining stock. Each new purchase costs less, so the average cost declines.Investors buy on declines when they are convinced that a stock will recover to or above its current levels. It is a slightly distorted way to look at the buy low/sell high axiom: ""Every time I average down, my cost basis goes lower, so my ability to profit is increased.""The missing proof, required in the CAN SLIM investing technique, is heavy institutional interest. Declining stocks typically show funds and other big investors shipping out. On a stock’s chart, this shows as distribution, or declines in high trading volume.Until a stock’s chart begins to show evidence of accumulation -- days of increasing prices in heavy trade as big investors move in and establish positions -- an individual investor’s belief in the stock's story, or confidence in the historical trends of a stock or industry, is purely a gamble.Averaging up is the smart stock investor's strategy for grafting onto strong price moves driven by institutional support. Bases show a turnover in institutional holders: distribution on the left side, accumulation on the right. Breakouts past buy points occur after accumulation by big money buyers constrains the supply of available shares.Investors who step in at this point are in a solid position to begin averaging up.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is a former stock market leader; see which stock now leads the biomed industry with IBD's Stock Checkup.The concept grates the nerves of investors trained to seek out bargains. Rather than buy low and sell high, the IBD approach says buy at a proper breakout point, not at a low, then add and add and, finally, sell the entire position higher.When the approach doesn’t work, you sell your original position at 7% to 8% and never book a deeper loss.In a seriously rallying stock, the add-on buys and the averaging up (as well as the profits) can go on for years.So, how much averaging up is acceptable?Look at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ (REGN) breakout in January 2012. Let’s say an investor placed a $10,000 position on the stock at the breakout. (You could do this in steps at the breakout, through a technique called pyramiding.)You could add to that position with smaller, measured buys in:1) February 2012, at a three-weeks-tight pattern (1) with a 117.03 buy point (an earlier entry near 110 was justifiable).2) August 2012, at the breakout (2) from 142.06 a cup-with-handle buy point.3) April 2013, at the breakout (3) from a 176.47 cup-with-handle buy point.4) February 2014, at the breakout above a 319.93 cup-base buy point.5) March 2015, at the breakout above a flat base buy point of 437.74.Image provided by Shutterstock.

269,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) said Monday that its experimental antibody for arthritis pain succeeded in a mid-stage trial, but shares were flat in early trading as the results were expected.The study enrolled 421 sufferers of moderate-to-severe hip and knee pain who'd been unsuccessful with standard painkillers. After 16 weeks of treatment, the group taking Regeneron's fasinumab had improved by more than 3 points on a 10-point pain scale, significantly better than the placebo group.About 17% of the group taking fasinumab experienced adverse events, Regeneron said, including non-inflammatory joint pain, prickling and burning sensations in the skin, numbness and swelling.The investigators also did extensive imaging of the subjects, because the class of medicines to which fasinumab belongs -- nerve growth factor (NGF) antibodies -- has been associated with joint damage. They wound up excluding 2% of subjects due to imaging results, and five patients among the remainder suffered subchondral insufficiency fractures, or stress fractures on abnormal bones.Regeneron stock was near 377 in early trading on the stock market today. Shares touched an 18-month below 349 in late March, and Regeneron stock has a weak IBD Composite Rating of 47, putting it among the lower half of all stocks on the basis of key metrics such as earnings and sales growth.Regeneron had already signaled that the trial was going well earlier this year by starting a large phase-three trial of the drug, so the results weren't especially surprising to analysts. It also lost a potential competitor in late March, when Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) stopped development of its own NGF antibody fulranumab, which was in late-stage trials for arthritis pain. RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt wrote at the time that J&J's decision was based on pipeline prioritization, not on any problems with the drug itself.On Monday, Butt praised the effectiveness of fasinumab in the trial but wrote that the safety ""bears watching.""""Overall, should this program succeed, it could be another blockbuster candidate, which unlike others could be an upside driver since it comes with regulatory and mechanistic safety concerns, hence is not a major focus for investors at this time, aside from a development cost and timeline standpoint,"" Butt wrote in his research note.

270,REGN,"Big-cap drugmakers Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Merck (MRK) were moving in opposite directions in Thursday trading after their Q1 earnings reports, though both companies raised guidance.Regeneron's quarterly revenue rose 38% over the year-earlier period to $1.2 billion, beating analysts' consensus by about $240 million, according to Thomson Reuters. Earnings of $2.57 a share were a penny short of estimates and down 11% from last year's Q1.But on the crucial metric of U.S. sales of flagship drug Eylea, Regeneron reported 44% growth to $781 million, beating consensus by $11 million, and the company raised its full-year growth estimate to 20% to 25% vs. its previous 20%.The earnings miss stemmed from higher spending for selling, general and administrative costs, though spending guidance for the year remained unchanged.Also, cholesterol drug Praluent, which was launched last July, missed consensus again, but its numbers remained small ($13 million) as the company awaited the results of a cardiovascular outcomes trial of both Praluent and rival Amgen's (AMGN) Repatha later this year. Regeneron said that payer coverage for Praluent is good so far, with 74% of the commercially insured and 91% of those on Medicare having access to the drug.Regeneron stock was up 5% in midday trading on the stock market today, near 380.Merck posted earnings of 89 cents a share, up 5% from the year-earlier period and beating consensus by 4 cents. Sales declined 1% to $9.31 billion, missing Wall Street's number by $150 million. Merck stock was down 1.5% midday Thursday, near 54.Merck added a few cents to its 2016 EPS guidance range, now $2.65 to $3.77, and also raised the low end of its revenue guidance, now $39 billion to $40.2 billion. Echoing a number of global pharmas this earnings season, Merck cited improving foreign-exchange rates.The revenue shortfall was spread around a number of different drugs, including blockbuster diabetes drug Januvia and immunology drug Remicade. More interesting to analysts was up-and-coming cancer drug Keytruda, which missed estimates in the U.S. but beat slightly worldwide, especially after rival Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo beat consensus last week.Bristol-Myers also moved up its reporting date for a trial of Opdivo as a first-line treatment for lung cancer to Q3 from its previously guided Q4, eroding the advantage for Merck, which expects to report results for a similar trial of Keytruda at midyear. Both drugs are now approved only for previously treated patients, so first-line approval could significantly expand the market.Merck also reported $50 million in sales for its hepatitis C drug Zepatier, which just launched in late January. Although that's tiny compared with the $2.1 billion reported by market leader Gilead Sciences (GILD), both Gilead and AbbVie (ABBV) said on their earnings calls last week that Merck's aggressive discounting had affected their own businesses.Nonetheless, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee wrote that this may not have been directly responsible for Gilead's miss.""(Merck) suggested negotiations for important parity access remain ongoing, with the exception of the Veterans Administration (10% of the market), which they have good access on ... but interestingly suggested many of the commercial payor access deals are for 2017 impact, since 2016 contracts were already completed,"" Yee wrote in a research note. ""So what Gilead said about their lower sales in U.S. (being) mostly due to just higher gross-to-net from healthier patients coming in (not so much from competition) could be true, realizing price competition is still ongoing and coming and needs to be watched.""

271,REGN,"Analysts think it's a good time to take a ride via electric carmaker Tesla Motors (TSLA) and fossil fuel giant Exxon Mobil (XOM), while price targets were raised on TJX Cos. (TJX), Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO) and Cigna (CI).Goldman Sachs says Tesla may not reach its 2018 production target of 500,000 vehicles, but still upgraded the luxury electric car maker to buy from neutral, keeping a 250 price target, but said more grounded investor expectations now offer a good entry point. Goldman doesn't see any big near-term catalysts, though, since the next Model 3 update may not come until 2017. Goldman saysTesla shares closed up 3.2% on the stock market today but dropped 3% in late trading after Tesla announced a secondary stock offering.Argus Research raised Exxon's rating to buy from hold with a 104 price target. Crude oil futures have rallied in recent weeks on signs the global supply glut may be easing, as well as production disruptions in Canada and Nigeria.Exxon shares closed down 0.2% as crude futures dipped.TJX, which beat earnings on Tuesday and sees lots of room for expanding its store base, saw its price target bumped up to 84 from 82 at RBC Capital Markets.The off-price retailer's stock fell 1.15% after rising 0.5% Tuesday.Cigna, which is aiming to close its merger with rival health insurer Anthem (ANTM), was kept at sector perform at RBC, with the price target hiked to 174 from 169.Last week, Cigna reached a deal to pay Sanofi (SNY) and Regeneron (REGN) based on how well their customers respond to the drugmakers' cholesterol-lowering treatments.Cigna shares fell 0.7%.Sun Trust kept a buy on Agios, while raising its target to 65 from 57. Late Tuesday, Agios expanded its cancer drug partnership with Celgene (CELG).Agios shares jumped in pre-market action, but fell 1.5%. Celgene rose 0.4%.
"
272,REGN,"Biotech stocks fell into one of the deepest craters in their history, starting last summer, but rumblings of a recovery are sounding.After a three-year bull run that more than quadrupled its value by its peak last July, IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech Industry Group plunged 50% by early February, hurt by backlashes against high drug prices and mergers that seek to lower corporate taxes.But the group has gained 12% since its Feb. 11 low, and some leading stocks have done better than that.3 Biotech Stocks Buoyed By Potential Blockbuster DrugsBioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) is up 30% from its Feb. 9 low. Incyte (INCY) has gained 29% from its low point that same week, while Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) has climbed 45%, and Medivation (MDVN), boosted by buyout talk, is up 127%.The group was up by even more before taking some hits over the past two weeks on negative earnings news from several industry players. But fund managers tell IBD the rebound is here.Why? For one, they say, the spate of bad news has already been factored into stock prices. But more than that, they see a climate favoring rejuvenated M&A, hot drugs in the new-product pipeline and pricing power for innovate products.Bottom line: The positive factors that drove the runup never went away, they say. They just got drowned out by the noise.""A very key point is that this group is a very high-beta group -- particularly the small- to midcap stocks. Since they don't have sales, they don't have earnings,"" said Tom Vandeventer, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management.""The history of this group is that elevated macro uncertainty definitely hits (it),"" Vandeventer said. ""My own opinion is this group trades more on sentiment than on fundamentals during those time periods.""Vandeventer points to troubles in China as emblematic of the macroeconomic concerns that hit biotech stocks.Another sentiment-driving factor is politics.Many of the candidates in the U.S. presidential race have bashed drugmakers for high prices and have proposed ways to clamp down. Wall Street has dismissed some of these ideas as impossible or ineffective. What seems to be generating the most concern are Democrats' proposals to let Medicare and Medicaid negotiate drug prices, which they are not allowed to do now.Already the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services has shown its teeth. It announced a pilot program changing the reimbursement for Medicare Part B, which covers drugs administered in hospitals and clinics. The Part B reimbursement scheme was long criticized for encouraging use of expensive drugs because it reimburses health care providers for the entire cost of a drug, plus 6% on top. The proposed scheme would reduce that premium and add a flat fee unrelated to the price of the drug. That, in theory, could encourage doctors to choose cheaper options.On the M&A front, the Treasury Department last month issued new guidelines on tax-inversion deals that derailed what would have been the drug industry's biggest-ever merger, between Pfizer (PFE) and Allergan (AGN). Tax inversions have become a popular way for drugmakers to boost their bottom lines and get access to cash. Allergan, after earlier mergers, is based in Ireland, which has low taxes.""We think that with the tax regulation -- I call this the 'inversion bottom' -- and the bad press associated with the health care industry, that created a bottom in our minds,"" said Robert Bombace, senior portfolio manager at Frost Investment Advisors. ""A lot of the bad news has already been baked into these companies.""In fact, a number of industry insiders say the breakup of the Pfizer-Allergan merger could turn out to be good for biotech stocks because it makes them acquisition targets for the two companies. Allergan has a long history of acquisitiveness, and Pfizer is thinking of splitting its innovative drug business from its other products. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum says Pfizer will want to bulk up its innovative business to make it valuable as a standalone, since its pipeline is modest compared to its big-pharma competitors.Schoenebaum has also said, though, that biotech boards are balking at buyout offers. They can't accept how much their valuations have dropped, so they've been unwilling to sell at market prices. He suspects this will lead to hostile takeover deals if the big players are willing to do them. This partly came to fruition in late April, when Sanofi (SNY) made an unsolicited $9.3 billion bid for Medivation, as rumors swirled that AstraZeneca (AZN) and Pfizer were also interested.Medivation's response reflected the attitude that Schoenebaum spoke of -- that the market was underpricing the stock.""Sanofi's opportunistically timed proposal, which comes during a period of significant market dislocation, and before several important near-term events for the company, is designed to seize for Sanofi value that rightly belongs to our stockholders,"" Medivation founder and CEO David Hung said in a statement rejecting the offer.Bombace, however, says the biotechs' reluctance might be for show.""I think that's just a bargaining chip,"" he said. ""The reality is that most of these companies will have to partner up anyway. ... The larger pharma and biotech names ... will reach a point where their pipelines are so dry, it will force their hands.""Bombace sees lots of exciting biotechnology science going on to fill out those pipelines. As he put it, we're ""going from the Model T stage to the space-shuttle stage.""Though he declined to name specific companies, he pointed to work in biomarkers -- which include PD-1 inhibitors such as Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo and Merck's (MRK) Keytruda. He also cited work in genetic mutations, the focus of many rare-disease firms such as BioMarin and Bluebird Bio (BLUE).These discoveries are keeping money flowing into and out of biotechnology, says Leonard Yaffe, who manages a health care hedge fund at Kessef Capital Management. He told IBD that specialty drugs -- the largely biologic drugs prescribed by specialists, as opposed to primary-care doctors -- contributed only 1% of prescriptions last year but 37% of dollars spent on drugs, up from 25% two years earlier.""One thing I think will drive the biotech stocks is that, if you look at drugs introduced in the last two years, 65% of the revenue derived from those drugs are from biologicals,"" Yaffe said. ""So it's the most attractive sector in the pharmaceutical area.""Also, while most publicly traded biotech stocks don't have earnings, those that have successfully launched drugs remain highly profitable. Of the top five biotechs in market cap -- Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB), and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) -- four have IBD EPS Ranks ranging from 89 to 96, putting them in the top 11% of all stocks in EPS growth. Regeneron has a 68 EPS Rank.Those numbers, however, reflect the pricing power of biologic drugs, which is precisely what's under political attack these days. Vandeventer says price uncertainty is the biggest risk to his bull thesis on the group right now. But he also points out that Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton attempted a previous overhaul of the health care system back in the mid-1990s, which depressed drug stocks in the short term but was followed by the late-1990s boom.That boom was driven by the first wave of biotech innovation, when companies like Amgen and Roche's (RHHBY) Genentech proved that biotechnology could produce blockbusters. Vandeventer says that innovation will remain the key in maintaining pricing power, even under political pressure. He points to Gilead's portfolio of hepatitis C drugs, which started in late 2013 with the launch of Sovaldi. Despite much political criticism of Sovaldi's high price, no one could stop it because the drug was so superior to anything else on the market.""Companies that have done the research -- they'll continue to get price increases,"" he said. ""Companies that are particularly in the rare-disease, orphan-disease arena, (or) the oncology space -- companies that have drugs in an era of targeted medicine that have higher efficacy rather than a shotgun trying to hit a disease -- are going to have pricing power.""The promise of such drugs can still make small stocks explode. Celator Pharmaceuticals (CPXX) has surged to over 13 from under 3 since March on favorable late-stage trial results for its acute myeloid leukemia treatment. The company also saw a hedge fund take a position in the stock and attracted favorable initial coverage from an analyst.There are signs that even generalist investors think biotech stocks have gotten cheap, says Yaffe. During the first quarter, a common lament was that every biotech stock got punished for bad news, but good news got no reward. But when Biogen issued a mixed earnings report that drew mostly negative reactions from Wall Street on April 21, its stock rose more than 5%.Biogen had fallen even harder than other big-cap biotechs, dropping 50% from its March 2015 high to its Feb. 12 low, so it was ready for a bounce, says Yaffe.""The overview comment is the sector had corrected 30%, and at some point it gets to the level where the stocks are very attractive,"" he said.

273,REGN,"Stocks finished lower Wednesday, but good quarterly results from Whole Foods Market (WFM) and Tesla Motors (TSLA) after the close may help set a positive tone for Thursday's open.The Nasdaq fell 0.8%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each dropped 0.6%. Volume was lighter on both exchanges, according to preliminary data.Whole Foods reported earnings per share of 44 cents, three pennies better than a year earlier and more than analysts expected. Revenue came in a $3.7 billion vs. estimates of $3.74 billion.  Investors after hours focused on the earnings beat, bidding the stock higher.They did the same with Tesla, which reported a first-quarter loss of 57 cents a share. The Street expected a 58-cent loss. The company promised to deliver 20,000 cars in the second quarter. Tesla shares dropped 4% in the regular session after the announcement that two executives were leaving the company while investor Jim Chanos highlighted his case against the company.Former leader FleetCor (FLT) lost ground after hours. It scored an earnings beat with EPS of $1.53, three cents above estimates, but it missed on revenue and gave in-line guidance.Thursday before the open, the Labor Department is forecast to report jobless claims of 262,000 for the week ended April 30 vs. 257,000 the prior week.Companies reporting earnings Thursday include GoPro (GPRO), Regeneron (REGN), Square (SQ), Cerner (CERN) and Motorola Solutions (MSI).

The jobs consultant said layoffs rose to more than 65,000 in April, up 35% vs. March’s job cuts and about 6% higher than year-earlier numbers. Energy industry cutbacks continued, the report said, with rising layoff activity in retail and computer industries.The Labor Department reported initial jobless claims rose to 274,000 in the week ended April 30, up from 257,000 in the prior week. Economists had projected a milder rise to 262,000 claims.Oil prices bounded more than 4% higher, sending Brent crude above $46 per barrel and lifting West Texas Intermediate to past $45. Wildfires in Canada’s northern Alberta province were apparently a factor. News reports said the fires had not threatened Alberta’s oil sands facilities, but production had been affected by oil companies assisting in the evacuation of the town of Ft. McMurray.Gold rose nearly 1% to $1,284 an ounce. The dollar rose vs. the euro, slipped against the yen.In stocks, Dow issues were flat to positive. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), up more than 1% apeice.Weight Watchers (WTW) soared 14% after its first-quarter report. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) punched up 5% after a solid first quarter.China’s Alibaba Group (BABA) jumped 5%. Alibaba’s fiscal Q4 earnings showed higher-than-expected revenue, but adjusted EPS stopped short of estimates. The 85% gain in net income and sustained growth and margins allayed some fears about the effects of China’s slowing economy. The stock ended Wednesday about 5% below a 79.94 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Tesla Motors (TSLA) trimmed early gains and was up 2% after its quarterly report. Its stock ended Wednesday 7% below a 239.98 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.3D Systems (DDD) trimmed an early 6% gain to 1% after mixed Q1 results.

275,REGN,"Biotech Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ (REGN) core ophthalmology business still has huge upside as its Eylea sales grow in treating a variety of eye diseases, says RBC Capital. RBC also says that a legal settlement with Amgen (AMGN) over Praluent, a drug intended to lower bad LDL cholesterol, would be a positive.Most of Regeneron’s sales come from Eylea, launched in 2011 to treat age-related vision loss in the elderly. Regeneron aims to build sales of Eylea in the market for treating diabetic macular edema (DME), a cause of blindness in working-age people, as well as a related eye disease affecting older people.“Turning DME into a $2 billion to $3 billion market opportunity is important and likely,” Adnan Butt, an RBC Capital analyst, said in a research report Tuesday. In DME, Eylea competes with Roche Holding’s (RHHBY) Lucentis.Regeneron typically reports earnings in early May. Roche, Novartis (NVS) and Bayer (BAYRY) report earnings on April 19, 21 and 26, respectively, and their commentary could provide insights into Eylea’s growth, says RBC’s Butt.He says that consensus expectations for the recently launched cholesterol drug Praluent, which had only $7 million in December-quarter sales, still need to come down. Amgen makes a rival drug called Repatha. In March, a federal jury upheld the validity of two Amgen patents related to the cholesterol drug, dealing a blow to Regeneron and partner Sanofi (SNY).“A settlement with Amgen could be a positive,” Butt said in the report. He rates Regeneron stock outperform, with a price target of 668. Regeneron stock was up more than 1.5% in early afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 402.50.Amgen reports earnings on April 28, followed by Sanofi on April 29. Their earnings calls could provide reads on the status of Praluent litigation, says Butt.Regeneron stock has plunged 26% in 2016 amid a broad sell-off in biotech stocks, including Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD).Regeneron shares touched a six-month low below 349 last month but jumped on April 1 after the company announced strong phase three clinical results for dupilumab, a drug for eczema, an itchy skin condition. Regeneron is developing that drug with Sanofi.“The landmark deal with Sanofi provides $160 million per year to fund antibody discovery for eight years, gives Regeneron 50% of the profit and defers all development costs until the partnership is profitable,” added Butts.Startup Intellia Therapeutics late Monday announced a licensing deal with Regeneron. Cambridge, Mass.-based Intellia has developed “gene editing” technology to treat liver and blood diseases. It plans to go public.Regeneron has an IBD composite rating of 58 out of a possible 99, lower than both Celgene and Gilead. IBD’s Medical-Biomed/Biotech group ranks just No. 108 out of 197 industry groups. That’s down from No. 39 six months ago.  But it's up 9.8% the past four weeks, 10th best in that span.Anika Therapeutics (ANIK), Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) have the highest IBD Composite Ratings within the biotech group.

276,REGN,"Big biotech Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and its big pharma partner Sanofi (SNY) said Friday that their potential blockbuster eczema drug candidate sailed through late-stage trials and would be submitted for approval in Q3 of this year. Regeneron shares spiked Friday, headed for their best one-day percentage gain in years.Regeneron's and Sanofi's drug dupilumab cleared or nearly cleared the symptoms of atopic dermatitis (eczema) in more than a third of patients, compared with less than 10% of patients in the placebo group, in two clinical trials comprising a total of 1,379 people. Patients on dupilumab in general average around a 70% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), whereas the placebo group improved in the 30% to 40% range.""There are no approved systemic therapies in the U.S. for people with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, underscoring the clear unmet need,"" Sanofi R&D head Elias Zerhouni said in a statement. ""In the U.S., where dupilumab in AD (atopic dermatitis) has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the U.S. FDA, we plan to submit a regulatory application in the third quarter of this year and will work to bring this innovative therapy to patients as quickly as possible.""Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote that analysts' consensus peak annual sales estimate for dupilumab is $4 billion, but there's quite a bit of variation between individual analysts.""We believe that the current debate for dupilumab is focused on the size of commercial opportunity -- it is also in late stage studies for severe asthma (where dupilumab demonstrated high efficacy in phase two in an all-comers population) as well as chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis,"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients. ""A/D is a relatively new market segment and dupilumab is one of the first therapeutic candidates that could address the high unmet need. ... The commercial opportunity in severe asthma may be similarly attractive; however, dupilumab will be facing a more crowded competitive landscape in asthma.""Regeneron shares shot up 13.5% in afternoon trading on the stock market today to about 409, moving over its 50-day moving average for the first time in 2016. Regeneron stock touched a 17-month low below 349 on March 17. Sanofi stock rose a fraction, above 40.

Volume rose on both major exchanges vs. Thursday, according to early figures. Losers outpaced winners by a small margin on the NYSE, but advancers beat decliners by nearly 3-to-2 on the Nasdaq. For the week, the Nasdaq rose 3%; the Dow and S&P 500 climbed close to 2% each.In Friday's economic news, U.S. payrolls increased by 215,000 workers in March, slightly above expectations, despite a slight uptick in the jobless rate to 5%. Consumer confidence in March also edged past forecasts to 91, up from 90 in February. The ISM manufacturing index rose to 51.8 in March from 49.5 in February, its first foray above the neutral 50 level since August. Economists expected 50.5.West Texas intermediate crude prices slid 4% to below $37 a barrel.The top gainers in today's stock market action included biotechs, carmakers and other drug stocks.Tesla Motors (TSLA) surged as much as 8% intraday before settling for a 3% gain in fast turnover. Orders for the electric car maker's Model 3 mass-market sedan, which was unveiled Thursday evening and starts at $35,000, are pouring in. CEO Elon Musk confirmed at least 198,000 orders. The stock, up nearly 70% from its Feb. 9 low, is now 17% below its 52-week high.Among biotechs, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) soared 12% in robust trade, regaining its 50-day line for the first time since late December. Shares are still well below their 200-day line and 32% off their 52-week high. The biotech and partner Sanofi (SNY) said their dupilumab atopic dermatitis drug met key goals in two late-stage trials. They plan to file for FDA approval in Q3. Sanofi gained 1% in above-average volume.Inside the IBD 50, Smith & Wesson (SWHC), Sturm Ruger (RGR) and Six Flags Entertainment (SIX) each rose more than 4% in turnover higher than usual. Six Flags was featured in Friday's Stock Spotlight column.Energy, hotel and car dealers lagged.Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT) fell 5% and Marriott International (MAR) gave up 6% after an investor group led by China's Anbang Insurance withdrew its offer to buy Starwood.

278,REGN,"Stocks got off to a bullish start to the new quarter, holding moderate gains amid rising volume with roughly an hour left of trading on Wall Street.The Nasdaq composite led with a gain of 0.6%, trading virtually at its session high and stretching further above the key 200-day moving average. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials both rose nearly 0.4%. Small caps lagged, with the S&P 600 down an inch. Volume was tracking sharply higher on both exchanges.Tesla Motors (TSLA) looked poised for a strong weekly finish despite backing off of Friday's early intraday high of 247.90, the stock's highest price since Oct. 5. The stock is up nearly 4% to 238.64 amid raised price targets by some research analysts. Tesla is finding support above its 200-day moving average, a good sign. But the stock remains below a potential buy point.The electric vehicle firm is getting showered with orders for its Model 3 mass-market sedan, which starts at $35,000. With at least 180,000 orders confirmed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the potential revenue of $6.3 billion from fulfilling these orders next year and beyond already dwarfs the $4.05 billion in revenue that Tesla notched in the full year of 2015.Elsewhere in the stock market today, retail apparel stocks are rallying en masse, including former big winners Urban Outfitters (URBN) and Lululemon (LULU). The former is building a deep cup-style base; the latter is extended 5.5% past a 65.09 handle entry.The medical sector is also rocking on the first day of the new quarter after a disastrous January-to-March period. Biotechs paced the upside, with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) punching through its downward-slanting 50-day moving average. The stock still shows awful IBD ratings, including a 44 Composite and a 12 out of a maximum 99 for Relative Strength. Wall Street expects first-quarter profit to fall 10% to $2.60 a share.IBD's ethical drugs and research equipment/services industry subgroups are also leading Friday's upside with gains approaching 2%. But like IBD's Medical-Biomedical/Biotech subgroup, both still rank in the lower half of IBD's 197 rankings in terms of six-month relative performance. See the table of all 197 subgroups, found in ""Other IBD Data"" within the ""Stock Lists"" tab on the Investors.com homepage.Biotech stocks were big winners during the market rally that extends all the way back to the 2009 market bottom. They may need more time to consolidate gains amid a charged Capitol Hill atmosphere in which members of Congress are expressing outrage over high drug prices.On the downside, Stamps.com (STMP) extended its pullback far enough to clip its 50-day moving average. The stock dropped more than 5% to 100.70 in volume that's running nearly 90% above its typical pace. The stock has fallen more than 8% below a recent cup-without-handle entry of 114.36.Keep in mind that breakouts from late-stage bases show a much higher risk of failure. In Stamps.com's case, the stock's initial breakout was back in April 2013, when it powered past a 28.23 buy point. Since then, it's built new bases and it broke out again in February, August and November of 2015.

279,REGN,"The stock market turned in a solid performance Wednesday, as the release of the minutes from the March 16 Federal Reserve meeting didn't do much to alter an overall bullish tone.At the close, the Nasdaq was up 1.6%, the S&P 500 added 1.1%, and the Dow Jones industrial average picked up 0.6%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in slightly lower than Tuesday's level. Nasdaq volume rose a bit.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil for May delivery jumped $1.86, or 5.2%, to $37.75 a barrel after the U.S. government reported an unexpected drop in crude inventories.Biotechs did the heavy lifting in the Nasdaq. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) outperformed, rising 6%. Regeneron (REGN) and Biogen (BIIB) were among the best performers in the Nasdaq 100, up 6% and 5% respectively.In a nutshell, the Fed minutes showed that sentiment was running against a rate hike later this month. CME Group FedWatch currently has the odds of a rate hike at 3%. The 10-year Treasury yield added 3 basis points to 1.75%.In the stock market today, fast-growing homebuilder LGI Homes (LGIH) jumped nearly 13% in strong trade. It cleared resistance around 25 as it worked on the right side of a possible base. Late Tuesday, the company said new-home closings surged 23.2% in March.Most IBD 50 stocks were higher, led by Acuity Brands (AYI), which bolted  more than 13% upward following a strong quarterly earnings report. The stock rocketed past an alternate entry at 242 after hesitating around an earlier 225.28 entry of a cup-with-handle base.Pfizer (PFE) and Allergan (AGN) both rose after the drugmakers abandoned a $160 billion deal that would have shifted Pfizer’s headquarters to Ireland and provided the company an overseas tax shelter. Allergan rose 3.5% after plunging almost 15% on Tuesday following the Treasury Department's unveiling of rules aimed at discouraging such tax-inversion deals. Pfizer gained 5%.Meanwhile, oil-field services giants Baker Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton (HAL) outperformed in the S&P 500, jumping 9% and 6%, respectively, after the Justice Department filed a lawsuit to halt their planned merger on concerns that the combined company would stifle competition in the sector.After the close, watch for earnings from retailers Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) and small-cap Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI).

280,REGN,"Amgen (AMGN) won a patent suit against its fellow biotech Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and partner Sanofi (SNY) related to their rival cholesterol drugs Wednesday.Amgen sued in October 2014, charging that Regeneron's and Sanofi's co-developed drug Praluent violated patents that Amgen held on its drug Repatha. The two drugs are similar, both being proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors. Amgen had been slightly ahead in its development timeline, but Regeneron bought a priority-review voucher that let it launch Praluent last July, about a month ahead of Repatha.The case went to a jury, which on Wednesday ruled in favor of Amgen that its patents were valid. Amgen also asked for a permanent injunction, which will be decided in a hearing scheduled for March 23-24.Regeneron's general counsel, Joseph LaRosa, said in a press release that the companies will appeal.""This is a complex area of law and science, and we believe the facts and controlling law support our position,"" said LaRosa. ""We look forward to taking our case to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, the U.S. appellate court that hears all biopharmaceutical patent appeals.""Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote that the appeal could take an additional 12 to 18 months. ""Recall, no new arguments are able to be presented in the Appeals Court (appeal is fact-based) and so the bar is relatively high,"" he wrote in an email to clients.Analysts have expected the likeliest outcome to the suit would be a royalty paid to Amgen on Praluent sales. Schoenebaum estimated that a 5% royalty could peel 1% off Regeneron's 2020 EPS.Trading on Regeneron shares were halted midday in the stock market today while the news came out, after rising 2.6% in morning trading. When trading resumed in the early afternoon, Regeneron stock was down more than 1%. Amgen stock, meanwhile, was down a fraction Wednesday afternoon, near 143, while Sanofi stock, which was not halted, was down nearly 2%, near 40.50.

281,REGN,"There's something for everyone in the vast universe of sector funds, from consumer staples to health care to technology.When a sector is in favor, those funds can rack up big returns. But they can also be prone to bigger declines, since they're more concentrated in specific areas than a diversified fund.IBD ran a screen of actively managed funds with at least $100 million in assets that have beaten their benchmarks in each of the past one, three, five and 10 years. Two sectors were the clear winner: The five best sector funds ranked by 10-year performance all focus on biotech or health sciences. (See our full list of best sector mutual funds.)To highlight the best mutual funds in the top-performing sectors, the ""best of the best"" list of IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Award winners includes the top fund in each of six sectors.Click Here To View A Table Of Top Performing Mutual Funds By CategoryFidelity Select Biotechnology Portfolio (FBIOX) came out on top with a 10-year average annual return of 16.9%, well ahead of the S&P 500's 7.31%. The fund held $9.7 billion in net assets as of Feb. 29. Its expense ratio is 0.74%. Rajiv Kaul has managed the fund since October 2005.Like most sectors, biotech has seen its fair share of volatility. But that's not necessarily a negative.""In the next five to 10 years, there's going to be a renaissance for the industry in terms of the golden age of innovation,"" Kaul told IBD. ""It's not going to be in a straight line. Biotech is volatile for investors. That's the amazing opportunity that happens.""As of Jan. 31, biotech stocks made up 86% of the portfolio and pharmaceuticals 13%. Fidelity Select Biotech held 277 stocks in all. Top holdings at the end of Q4 included Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG).All five stocks belong to IBD's biotech industry group, which surged more than 800% from a November 2008 low to its July 2015 peak. Turnover in the fund tends to run fairly low, at about 29%.There are high barriers to entry in the biotech field, including expertise, capital and regulatory hurdles, Kaul points out. ""But when you do get a major breakthrough in a medication, you really improve people's lives and help save costs for the health care system.""How does Kaul pick stocks for the fund?""You have to understand the management and what is the track record of success,"" he said. ""We have that kind of historical understanding and depth of understanding of the industry and the individual players. Equally important is the ability of these companies to access capital at a low cost. I want my companies to be self-reliant.""The five top biotech funds all owned big-cap biotech and Soliris maker Alexion in their recently reported quarters. Four of the five funds also held biotechs Celgene and Gilead, which focus on cancer and hepatitis C, respectively. Generic drug makers tracked by IBD soared more than 900% from March 2009 to July 2015, while ethical drug stocks rallied nearly 750% from March 2009 to August 2015.T. Rowe Price Health Sciences (PRHSX) took second place among biotech funds, with a 10-year return of 16.8%. The fund, which has $11.7 billion in net assets, has been closed to new retail investors since June 2015. As of Feb. 29, the portfolio held 145 stocks. Services accounted for 35% of assets, followed by biotech at 25%, pharmaceuticals at 22%, products and devices at 10%, and life sciences at 6%. Top holdings included Aetna (AET), Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Allergan (AGN), Becton Dickinson (BDX) and Cigna (CI).""Focus on innovative medicines, diagnostics, devices and business models has been the core driver of success,"" Taymour Tamaddon, who has managed the fund since February 2013, said via e-mail. ""Over the past 10 years, strength has been broad-based, with biotech likely having the highest level of performance."" The fund's expense ratio is 0.77%.Prudential Jennison Health Sciences (PHLAX), with a 15.8% return over the past 10 years, has been closed to new investors since the end of June 2012. The fund has total net assets of $2.6 billion and an expense ratio of 1.1%. David Chan, Michael Del Balso and Debra Netschert manage the fund.Biotech made up the biggest weighting as of Jan. 31, at 38% of assets. Pharmaceuticals accounted for 30%, health care providers and services were 19%, health care equipment and supplies were 7%, and life sciences tools and services were 3%. The biggest holdings in the 98-stock portfolio included Celgene, BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Shire (SHPG) and Allergan.""We remain focused on the longer-term outlook of our fund, which we believe continues to be very positive based on a range of industry trends, from health care reform to the advent of oncology active immune therapy,"" the managers said in their Jan. 31 fund commentary. ""Although the realization of these companies’ values may encounter intermittent setbacks, we believe the market will recognize and reward them over the longer term.""Franklin Biotechnology Discovery (FBDIX), with $1.1 billion in total net assets as of Feb. 29, has a 10-year return of 15%. Biotech stocks made up 84% of the portfolio, followed by 13% in pharmaceuticals and nearly 3% in life sciences tools and services.""We focus on biotechnology and generally have limited exposure to other areas in health care,"" Evan McCulloch, senior vice president and lead portfolio manager of the fund, said. ""We avoid more traditional large-cap pharmaceuticals companies, which have less favorable growth prospects and do not show the same levels of innovation we see in biotechnology.""Celgene, Gilead Sciences, Biogen (BIIB), Amgen (AMGN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals were among top positions in the 119-stock fund. The fund, which closed to new investors in July 2014, has an expense ratio of 1%.""Overall, we believe there are strong fundamentals underlying the biotechnology sector's recent growth which have also helped our fund,"" McCulloch said. ""Innovation remains very strong, with promising new treatments in areas like immuno-oncology, gene therapy, Alzheimer's disease, GI (gastrointestinal) disorders, central nervous system diseases and others.""Rydex Biotechnology (RYOAX) rounds out the top-five sector funds with a 10-year return of 14.7%. The expense ratio is 1.3%. Biotech accounted for 77% of net assets as of Feb. 29, pharmaceuticals 13%, and life sciences tools and services 9%. Top holdings as of March 8 included Gilead, Amgen, Celgene, Biogen and Regeneron.Health care clearly dominated sector funds over the past decade. But which other funds led their respective categories?T. Rowe Price Global Technology (PRGTX), with $2.4 billion in net assets at the end of February, led tech sector funds with a 14.3% 10-year average annual return. Media, semiconductors and software made up the biggest weightings in the 64-stock fund; top holdings included Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and JD.com (JD). It has a 0.91% expense ratio.Leading the consumer cyclical sector is Fidelity Select Retailing Portfolio (FSRPX), with $1.8 billion in assets as of Feb. 29 and a 10-year average annual return of 14%. The expense ratio is 0.81%. Internet retail, home improvement retail and apparel retail accounted for the top three subindustries at the end of January. Amazon, Home Depot (HD) and Netflix (NFLX) were its top holdings.T. Rowe Price Media & Telecommunications (PRMTX) topped the communications sector with a 13.7% average annual return. The fund had $3.3 billion in net assets as of Feb. 29; its expense ratio is 0.8%. Media, telecom services and software were the three biggest investment areas, with Alphabet, Amazon and American Tower (AMT) among the 79-stock portfolio's recent top holdings.Rydex Consumer Products (RYCIX), with a 10.6% average annual return and a 1.3% expense ratio, led the consumer defensive sector. Food products, beverages and household products accounted for more than half of net assets; Procter & Gamble (PG), Coca-Cola (KO) and Philip Morris International (PM) were recent top holdings.Burnham Financial Services (BURKX), which held $250.1 million in assets, headed the financial sector with a 7.6% average annual return.

282,REGN,"What's the hardest thing for a champion to do? Win again. And again. And again. Just ask repeat Super Bowl titlists, or baseball and horse racing's Triple Crown winners, or tennis Grand Slam champs. And it's just as hard for the best mutual funds too.The relatively few funds that are able to pull off the feat deserve recognition. And they deserve consideration as additions to or replacements in your retirement accounts, like 401(k)s and IRAs, as well as your taxable accounts.To help you identify those special mutual funds, IBD is introducing its Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards. Stock mutual funds qualify for this exclusive recognition only if they have beaten the broad market over the past one, three, five and 10 years -- all four of those periods, not just one or two or three.  Awards were earned in 12 mutual fund categories. The top five ranked by 10-year performance (the top six in the case of sector funds) are highlighted as the best of the best, deserving special recognition.Being a four-time winner was no easy task. Of 2,702 mutual funds that met the criteria of having at least $100 million in assets and 10 years of operation, only 308 beat their benchmark in each period. Of 1,091 U.S. diversified stock mutual funds in business for the entire decade tracked by Morningstar Inc., only 101 pulled off the feat.Among 474 growth mutual funds, only 95 emerged as award winners.In some categories, it was much harder. Only three value mutual funds out of 292 beat their benchmark in all four time periods. Just four small-cap funds got awards.The winning stock mutual funds  -- including the categories of U.S. growth, blend and value, as well as large- mid- and small-cap -- were compared to the S&P 500 index in each of the four periods through Dec. 31, 2015.The international stock funds had to beat the MSCI EAFE index. The best U.S. taxable bond funds trumped the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond index. Tax-exempt funds conquered the Barclays Municipal index. Foreign taxable bond funds outperformed the Barclays Global Aggregate.Click Here To View Table With The Top Funds By CategoryWhether you are looking for mutual funds to strengthen your current portfolio or just starting out, the IBD awards list is a great place to start. Here you'll find top-performing funds run by the smartest portfolio managers. The award winners are arrayed in categories of stock and bond funds that are most often used in building core positions in diversified portfolios -- from large-, mid- and small- cap to growth blend and value U.S. stocks, foreign stocks, equity sectors and bonds.Whether you're in the market for a large-cap growth or foreign bond fund, check out those categories' award winners. Is it available in your 401(k) plan? Get the funds' prospectuses and quarterly reports and manager commentaries to see which choices make the best fit in terms of your investment horizon and risk tolerance.Start with the top five, but take some time to consider all the award winners in the categories you're interested in. You might already be familiar with a fund company that has a fund among the top mutual funds. This can add confidence to your selection.If a fund you own is not one of the award winners, you won't want to rush out and dump it. It might be a perfectly good fund run by competent portfolio managers and fit a unique need of your portfolio. You might consider whether it outperformed its benchmark in most periods but narrowly missed in one or two.How, exactly, did these funds outperform so consistently? After all, to achieve award status a fund has shown its ability to survive market corrections and bear markets without racking up losses that ruin long-term returns.Several managers claim their secret involves an ability to ignore the short-term zigs and zags of the market.""An individual who expects short-term performance would not be the type of person to invest in our fund,"" says Keith Lee, a manager of $2.5 billion Brown Capital Management Small Company Fund (BCSIX), in explaining his team's preference for stocks that provide their fund with consistently superior growth over the long run -- and which have also outperformed over the past one year, despite aiming for strong long-term returns.But what it really means is an ability to put together a portfolio that's built to weather market storms. For many funds, that means a focus on companies that are not in highly cyclical businesses -- such as those involving commodities. For many, it also means sticking to businesses with strong balance sheets and little if any debt.And for many it means looking for sustainable earnings, not short-term flashes in the pan. Gavin Baker, manager of $11.7 billion Fidelity OTC Portfolio (FOCPX), has a similar view. “We have a long-term time horizon where we are looking out over five, 10 and 15 years, which I think is a big advantage,"" Baker told reporter Billy Fisher for a profile of Gavin's fund, which is also among the best of the U.S. stock mutual funds and large-cap stock mutual funds.Many award-winning managers take it a step further: Not only do they ignore what some of them call short-term ""noise"" in the market, they also stick to their own long-term game plans.Tim Parton, manager of $5.7 billion JPMorgan Growth Advantage (VHIAX), one of the top five funds in the large-cap category, helms a team that looks for leading stocks regardless of market capitalization.Working closely with colleagues who run small- and large-cap funds, Parton's team mixes those names with the midcap stocks he himself focuses on.""The other beauty of this strategy is that we're never forced to sell a good stock just because it gets too big, which is a perennial problem for small- and midcap managers,"" Parton said.In the past, his fund has had bigger weightings of small and midcap stocks when his team was finding more growth opportunities at attractive valuations among those market caps.And while Parton thinks long-term, his team does not ignore the here and now. ""In tough periods we focus on fundamentals of companies,"" he said. ""We make sure our names are not too affected by the environment they're in. We may trim size of positions to reduce risk.""And when a volatile market, like the one we've been experiencing, makes names his team likes even more attractively priced? Parton nibbles, but only very cautiously. ""Only on the margins,"" he said, explaining his caution toward stocks that have been knocked down in price for any reason. ""We already have a slightly higher-risk portfolio than a value fund manager.""Parton invests stock by stock. Still, sector weights show where he expects to find leaders. His biggest sector was information technology, with a 35.5% weighting as of Feb. 29, nearly double his second-largest sector, consumer discretionary.Tech holdings range from small caps like medical-software maker Veeva Systems (VEEV), to midcap database software maker Splunk (SPLK), large-cap gaming software maker Electronic Arts (EA) and giant-cap Microsoft (MSFT).Winning managers in many diversified U.S. stock fund categories make a point of thinking long-term and basing investment decisions on individual stocks much more than on hot sectors. Sector-fund managers plumb their respective ponds to fish for hot trends and land the dominant sharks in those waters.As IBD's Nancy Gondo explains in her diagnosis of top-performing sector funds, biotech and and health sciences have been clear outperformers over the past 10 years.Stocks like Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) pop up in recent portfolio disclosures of the top-ranked sector funds.Another trait shared by the best of the best: a focus on well-managed companies able to maintain pricing power even during the toughest times, reports Scott Stoddard in his examination of the best of the best international stock funds.Like sector funds, success among bond funds often hinges on the ability to play the hottest part of the fixed-income market -- and to avoid segments that are out of favor.As Marie Beerens reports in this special report, TCW Total Return Bond (TGLMX) was a 10-year outperformer thanks in large part to surfing the recovery in mortgages since the credit crisis.TCW manager Bryan Whalen told Beerens that his fund also avoided a headwind in 2015 by having ""almost no exposure to the corporate credit market,"" which dramatically lagged similar-duration Treasuries.So, are these best-of-the-best mutual funds all that you need in your portfolio? ""It's not a stand-alone fund,"" Parton said about his portfolio. ""This is a growth fund. It does not give you holistic exposure"" -- that is, exposure to all parts -- ""to the market. For that, it should be used with others.""And for those others, what better choices to consider than the IBD award winners, which have proven their mettle over the years, in various market segments, again and again.

283,REGN,"Stocks wrenched into early losses in heavy trade Friday, then eased into mixed trade following a flurry of early economic reports.The Dow backed out of narrow losses into a slight gain. The S&P 500 held 0.2% in the red. The Nasdaq wrestled with a fractional loss.Volume jumped nearly 30% on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE, compared to trading volume at the same time Thursday.Despite Friday's early slip, the stock market remains in good standing for the week. The Nasdaq is up more than 2% vs. last Thursday's close, and is on track to end its first weekly close above its 200-day moving average since early January.The S&P 500 is fighting to hold its gain to around 1%, but remains comfortably above its 200-day line. Blue chips lagged for the week, with the Dow Jones industrial average below a 1% gain. Small-caps outpaced, sending the Russell 2000 into Friday's session with a 3.2% advance. The entire group opens the second quarter amid a burst of momentum, with the Nasdaq up 15.6%, the S&P 500 up 13.7%, and the Russell 200 up 18.1% off a mid-February low.The Labor Department's March payrolls report showed hiring slowed less than expected and wages rose firmly, although the unemployment rate ticked upward to 5%, vs. consensus expectations for no change.The morning's first read on March manufacturing was mildly disappointing, with researcher Markit putting its Purchasing Managers' Index at 51.5 for the month, up from February's 51.3 but below forecasts for 51.7.A similar gauge form the Institute of Supply Management was more positive, popping to 51.8 in March, up from 49.5 in February and clearing consensus forecasts for 50.5.March consumer confidence also improved above expectations. The University of Michigan placed its final Consumer Sentiment Survey at 91 for the month. Economists had projected an uptick to 90.9, from February's final tally of 90.Oil futures dug deeper, down more than 3% with West Texas Intermediate crude just pennies above $37 a barrel. Prices may see some effect from the Baker-Hughes (BHI) weekly rig count data, due out at 1 p.m. ET.Almost a third of the Dow's stocks posted losses deeper than 1%. Chevron (CVX) slid furthest, down 1.4%. McDonald's (MCD) added 0.7% to top the Dow's few advancing issues.Tesla Motors (TSLA) was center-stage following Thursday evening's introduction of its Model 3 sedan. Shares spiked nearly 8% in heavy trade at the open, breaking out above a 239.98 buy point in a V-shaped cup-with-handle base. The stock quickly pared its gain to 5%, holding just above the pivot.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Urban Outfitters (URBN) led the S&P 500, up about 4% apiece. Oil and energy-related stocks packed the low end of the index.Airline stocks were taking some hard early hits after Deutsche Bank downgraded United Continental Holdings (UAL) to hold from buy, based on a challenging outlook. United dropped 5% in fast trade. American Airlines (AAL) dumped 4%. Delta Air Lines (DAL) slipped 3%.On the IBD 50 list, U.S. Concrete (USCR) troweled out a 2% gain after announcing it had acquired Haskell, Texas-based Strickland Bridge. Terms were not disclosed, but the company said the deal expands its capabilities in markets in and around Abilene, Texas.

284,REGN,"With its soaring growth, Facebook (FB) may soon take steps to ease its tax burden, according to a Morgan Stanley report.And, Morgan Stanley says, Facebook is one of a list of technology and pharmaceutical companies that could gain if Congress creates a “patent box” as part of corporate tax reform.Other companies that would benefit from a patent box, also called an ""innovation box,"" would be Qualcomm (QCOM), chip maker Xilinx (XLNX), as well as drug companies Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), says the report.A patent box provides lower tax rates on royalty income generated from licensing. Intellectual property can include patents, trademarks, designs and logos.On Qualcomm, Morgan Stanley noted: “The IP licensing business is conducted almost entirely in the United States, and as such, we believe it generally pays near full corporate taxes.”Shares in Facebook jumped 16% by early afternoon in the stock market today, after the social networking giant late Wednesday said Q4 revenue jumped 52% from a year earlier to $5.84 billion.“In 2015, we estimate that around 51% of Facebook’s revenue will be generated internationally. Despite this fact, we estimate that Facebook will have (an approximate) 34% adjusted tax rate in 2015 (very close to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%). Going forward, Facebook may take steps to reduce its tax burden,” the Morgan Stanley report said.Congress could pass legislation overhauling corporate taxes, it said.Senators Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y) and Rob Portman (R-OH) have proposed tax reform aimed at “tax inversion” deals, in which companies relocate headquarters to a lower-tax nation, usually following an acquisition.“A patent or innovation box might be the United States' best means to combat inversions and remain competitive with other countries,” said the Morgan Stanley report.Supporters say a patent box would also help keep research and development in the U.S.

286,REGN,"Some of the biggest keys to fundamental analysis are examining a company's past record of earnings-per-share growth, current growth and the prospects for growth ahead. EPS growth drives a stock's performance, so it makes sense that this should be a focal point during the research process.But analyzing earnings is just one part of fundamental analysis. It's also important to have a good handle on sales, profit margin and return on equity.IBD's SMR (Sales + Profit Margin + ROE) Rating looks at all three and assigns letter grades of A to E for each stock. A-rated stocks are in the top 20% of all names in IBD's database. E-rated stocks are in the bottom 20%.Sales growth should be robust, preferably in the 20% to 25% range or higher, both in recent quarters and at an annual pace.Profit margin answers the question: How many cents in profit does a company generate for each $1 of sales? If a widget costs 50 cents to make, and the company sells it for a buck, the gross profit margin is 50%. There's no benchmark percentage for profit margin, as margin varies by industry, but it is good to see annual pretax margins and quarterly after-tax margins at or near peak levels when evaluating a stock.Return on equity (ROE) helps separate well-managed companies from poorly managed ones. It's also expressed as a percentage. It's calculated by dividing net income by shareholder equity (assets minus liabilities). Be careful, though. High return on equity can be a result of a heavy debt load. Look for high-ROE firms with low or zero debt. IBD's study of past market winners showed an average annual ROE of 17% before a major price move.While investors' focus should be on stocks with high SMR ratings, keep in mind that a new issue might fall a bit short in this rating because the company is still in the early stages of its business, just on the verge of profitability. If the stock passes muster in other key fundamental and technical areas, a lukewarm SMR Rating shouldn't be a deal breaker.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) recently had an SMR Rating of A, helped by big sales growth in recent quarters, plus a pretax margin of 41.7% and return on equity of 52.3% in 2014. But institutional investors have been selling shares in spades in recent weeks. The stock could be in the early stages of breaking down from a late-stage base.As for GoPro (GPRO), strong sales growth, profit margin and return on equity give it an SMR Rating of A, but it's been hit hard by institutional selling in recent months due to concerns about future growth. Last week, the company announced job cuts and issued weak sales guidance due to poor holiday sales. Despite a solid SMR Rating, the stock is almost 90% off its 98.47 high.Epam Systems (EPAM) owned an SMR Rating of A when it blasted out of a cup-shaped base in late October 2014. The high rating was helped by annual pretax margin at the time of 17.1% and return on equity of 24.2%. Quarterly sales growth was stellar, showing year-over-year growth in excess of 25%.

289,REGN,"A drug candidate that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) jointly developed has beaten AbbVie's (ABBV) best-selling rheumatoid-arthritis (RA) drug in a late-stage study, the companies said Friday.Regeneron and Sanofi said that their monoclonal antibody sarilumab met the trial's main goal of improving symptoms after 24 weeks of a biweekly dosing regimen. Some 72% of patients on sarilumab achieved at least a 20% improvement in signs and symptoms based on American College of Rheumatology criteria, in contrast to 58% of the patients in the Humira group. Both groups experienced about the same rate of negative side effects, though the sarilumab group showed a higher rate of neutropenia, or lowering of white blood cells.Humira is currently the top-selling RA drug and, indeed, the top-selling drug of any kind in the world today, but its number of competitors is rising. Last fall baricitinib, a drug that Eli Lilly (LLY) and Incyte (INCY) co-developed, also beat Humira in a head-to-head trial; unlike the injectable Humira and sarilumab, it is delivered orally. Roche's (RHHBY) intravenous medicine Actemra has also bested Humira in trials.Regeneron and Sanofi have already applied for FDA approval of sarilumab based on earlier data, with a decision due by Oct. 30.RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt called the news a ""modest positive"" but added that investors are still concerned with some nearer-term issues with Regeneron's stock. Among them is a pilot program to test changes in Medicare Part B, announced this week, that could affect a great deal of the reimbursement for Regeneron's flagship drug Eylea, and a patent lawsuit that Amgen (AMGN) filed over another monoclonal antibody in the Regeneron/Sanofi partnership, Praluent.""All else being equal, beating Humira is certainly better than not beating it, but at least some of the discussed overhangs may need clearing before the pipeline receives more credit,"" wrote Butt in a research note.By late morning on the stock market today, AbbVie stock was up almost 3% near 58. Sanofi was up 2% near 41, while Regeneron stock was up a fraction near 381.

"
294,REGN,"Drug stocks fell Wednesday as Wall Street sorted through the impact of proposed changes to Medicare Part B reimbursement designed to drive down the prices of some expensive hospital drugs.Late Tuesday, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services proposed a pilot program testing a new reimbursement scheme for Medicare Part B, which covers drugs administered in hospitals or doctors' offices. Currently, CMS will pay back the price of the drug plus 6% for the health care provider, which critics say encourages doctors to prescribe more expensive drugs. Under the proposed rule, doctors would get just a 2.5% premium plus a flat fee of $16.80 per drug per day, which would somewhat reduce the disparity between different-priced drugs.CMS also proposed reducing or eliminating the portion that the patient has to pay for the drug, and tying the reimbursement level to the effectiveness of a drug for a given indication. Thus, if the same drug works well for one condition but only so-so for another, CMS would reimburse it at different levels for each condition.The agency also wants to create online ""decision support tools"" to help physicians determine the most effective drug to use in a given situation. Another test would let CMS enter voluntary risk-sharing agreements with drug makers linking price adjustments with patient outcomes.There will be a comment period on the CMS proposal until May 9. At that point, CMS plans to place providers into two different groups, one using the old reimbursement method and one the new one, and study the differences between the groups over the course of five years. It plans to start testing its other ideas starting January 2017.The reimbursement proposal drew the most attention from Wall Street. The covered drugs would be mostly infused or injected treatments for serious conditions, as opposed to pills that the patient can take on her or his own, and so, potentially affects some of the drug industry's biggest cash cows.""For the big biotechs, the most notable drugs that would fall under this theoretical test would be drugs that include Amgen (AMGN) (U.S. Neupogen, Neulasta ... also Kyprolis, Xgeva/Prolia, Vectibix, about 35%+ of total sales), Celgene (CELG) (U.S. Abraxane is 6% of revenue -- the other notable drugs are orals),"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee in a research note.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan agreed about Amgen, adding that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Biogen (BIIB) also depend on drugs under the Medicare Part B umbrella.The new immunotherapy drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Merck (MRK), such as Opdivo, Keytruda and Yervoy, also are covered by Part B, but Yee argued that they aren't chosen for price reasons.""Consensus understands these drugs are chosen for high efficacy or where there aren't equivalent drugs that aren't also infused, not because of the 6% reimbursement,"" Yee wrote.Amgen stock hit a five-month low and ended the day down 2.6%, at 140.90. Regeneron tumbled 5.1% to 374.75. Celgene fell 1.1% and Biogen was off 2.2%. Bristol-Myers stock fell 1.1%, while Merck slipped a fraction.

295,REGN,"Stocks stepped up into moderate gains at Wednesday's open, with earnings reports and oil prices propelling a large share of early action.The S&P 500 rose 0.3%, the Dow industrials added 0.2%, and the Nasdaq recovered from an early slip to trade up a bit less than 0.1%, as losses among biotech stocks dragged heavily on the index.Volume decreased sharply in the stock market today, down 9% on the Nasdaq and 20% lower on the NYSE, relative to action at the same time Tuesday.

301,REGN,"Big-cap biotech Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) hit a 16-month low Tuesday after its Q4 earnings disappointed investors.Last month, Regeneron revealed Q4 sales of its eye drug Eylea, which accounts for the great majority of its revenue. Results announced early Tuesday, though, show that the recently launched cholesterol drug Praluent sold well short of expectations, at $7 million, while collaboration revenue from partner Sanofi (SNY) was also lower than expected.Overall, Q4 revenue rose 37% over the year-earlier quarter to $1.1 billion, about $80 million below analyst consensus, according to Thomson Reuters. Earnings of $2.83 a share also missed Wall Street's average estimate of $3.36. EPS rose just 1% from the year-earlier quarter, breaking a four-quarter streak of double-digit growth.Regeneron last month also guided 2016 expenses, and on Tuesday it added that U.S. Eylea sales should grow 20% this year, which was slightly above analyst consensus for 19% growth. The company does not provide overall revenue or earnings guidance. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum calculated that the implied 2016 earnings guide from the expense forecast is $11.57 to $14.14, which is on the low side of the consensus projection for $13.92.The weak Praluent number, which was less than half the consensus estimate, followed a likewise underwhelming report from Amgen (AMGN) on its similar drug Repatha in its Q4 results last month.""This slow start is consistent with the current market feedback about (Praluent's) initial launch and is certainly going to put pressure on long-term revenue expectations for the product and class,"" wrote Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges in a research note.Regeneron stock dropped as much as 10%, to 350.26, in early trading on the stock market today, its lowest point since October 2014. Shares closed the day down 6.3%, at 365.97, which also is the stock's lowest closing price since October 2014. Sanofi stock fell a fraction Tuesday, to 38.87.

309,REGN,"A lot can change on Wall Street over just a few days. So far this week, the market has fallen into a correction, and the number of Sector Leaders has been nearly halved. Four leading stocks remain, after Facebook (FB), Paycom Software (PAYC) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) fell off earlier in the week. Let's take a look at those that…
"
310,REGN,"2015 was a year with two distinct parts for drug stocks: The first seven months continued the bull run of the last four years, while the sudden resurfacing of the drug-pricing debate led to a rocky five months after that.But overall, the group came out ahead — and these top-performing big caps show that a solid story can make up for political worries in the eyes of investors.•Incyte (INCY) is up 49% — as of Wednesday's close — after a year of steady gains for its lone marketed product, Jakafi, as well as its pipeline of potential blockbusters. In March, Jakafi won EU approval in the blood cancer polycythemia vera, for which it is already approved in the U.S., along with another blood cancer, myelofibrosis. Both those diseases are rare, but Incyte is shooting for much bigger markets with its late-stage candidates baricitinib and epacadostat.Baricitinib, which Incyte is developing in partnership with Eli Lilly (LLY), tested successfully in phase-three trials in rheumatoid arthritis against a placebo, methotrexate and the current market leader, AbbVie 's (ABBV) Humira. In his Nov. 18 initiation report on Incyte, Goldman Sachs analyst Salveen Richter estimated peak annual sales of more than $2 billion after an expected 2017 launch.Richter added that a more important future driver of shares will likely be Incyte's entries into the budding field of immuno-oncology. Incyte has been testing its lead candidate in the field, epacadostat, in combination with Merck's (MRK) Keytruda in a variety of cancers. In early November, Incyte's stock fell after a small study of the combo in patients with advanced cancers disappointed Wall Street, but Richter wrote that 2016 will likely bring more clarity as more results come out.Incyte has been operating at a loss due to all this research spending, but analysts expect it to turn its first annual profit next year. The stock's current IBD Composite Rating is 60.•Danish diabetes giant Novo Nordisk (NVO) is up 39% as it ends the year with a flat base following early gains. In March, the stock rose sharply after Novo said it would refile for U.S. approval of its long-acting insulin analogue Tresiba, along with its shorter-acting sister drug Ryzodeg. The two drugs suffered a surprise rejection in 2013 as the FDA sought more data on their possible risks to the heart. This time around, the agency was convinced, and it approved them on Sept. 25.Also boosting the stock early in the year was Novo's February release of positive clinical-trial data on its latest glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, OG217SC. Novo has been selling its earlier GLP-1 agonist Victoza since 2010, but the market has gotten more competitive in the last couple years with new GLP-1s launching from Sanofi (SNY), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Eli Lilly. Those drugs are all injectable, however, while Novo's new candidate is oral. Novo announced further positive results for the drug in July and September.Novo's financial results in U.S. currency suffered from the foreign-exchange headwinds that hit all global drugmakers this year, but it still managed a solid IBD EPS Rank of 85 and a Relative Strength rating of 87.•Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) continued its multiyear run on the stock market, hitting a lifetime high of 605.93 on Aug. 4 before getting caught in the larger biotech sell-off. It's still up 34% for the year.Regeneron's flagship eye drug Eylea continued to perform well, aided by a new approval for diabetic retinopathy in March. But drawing more attention was the launch of its cholesterol drug Praluent in July.Praluent was not only the first of a new class of cholesterol drugs — though it was followed shortly to the market by Amgen 's (AMGN) Repatha — it's also the first of a number of novel monoclonal antibodies that Regeneron has been developing in a partnership with Sanofi. The next entry, dupilumab, is in late-stage testing for asthma and eczema and is also expected to attain multibillion-dollar annual sales.Regeneron is also the highest-rated stock on this list, with the highest-possible Composite Rating of 99.• Eli Lilly is the top-performing traditional big pharma of the year, with a 25% gain. While its sales growth has been flat due to its aging drugs, as well as currency headwinds, the company has improved profit margins through cost controls and gotten a lot of investors excited about its pipeline. As noted above, its partnership with Incyte has borne fruit in the baricitinib trials. Lilly doesn't have much of a presence in rheumatoid arthritis or other immunology diseases, but Lilly is planning to change that not only with baricitinib but with ixekizumab, a psoriasis treatment it's planning to launch next year that is expected to sell in the billions eventually.Lilly's already-launched diabetes drug Jardiance yielded one of pharma's biggest upside surprises this year, when a giant study of its effects on cardiovascular health showed that it reduced death from heart failure by 32%. That drove the stock to a 14-year high of 92.85 in September, which turned into a cup-with-handle base.The stock holds a 72 CR.• Baxalta (BXLT) is up 23% since it started trading July 1 in a spin-off from Baxter International (BAX), which sought to unlock the shareholder value of its biopharma arm. Just 10 days later, the company received an unsolicited $30 billion buyout offer from British drugmaker Shire (SHPG), which saw Baxalta's hemophilia franchise as an ideal addition to its rare-disease portfolio.Baxalta rejected the offer, but the situation remains unresolved. Last week, rumors were buzzing that Shire would up its bid, though it hasn't yet. Baxalta's financials have been slow and steady, leading to an EPS Rank of 62, but the acquisition hopes have lifted the stock's RS Rating to 94.

311,REGN,"When shopping for stocks, an investor has to look well under the hood for fundamental data showing that a company is growing fast and is likely to keep growing fast. After earnings and sales growth, two numbers that investors should check are pretax margins and return on equity. The six Sector Leaders that made IBD's most stringent screen show strength…
"
312,REGN,"The Sector Leaders list is depleted and tired after months of slop-and-chop stock market action.

A rise of less than 20% means the next base is still a first-stage…
"
314,REGN,"Sector Leaders is IBD's toughest proprietary stock screen. It's so tough that in a rocky market few stocks can meet its stringent criteria.If you spot a stock on the list (in today's IBD on B1), it's almost surely going to have EPS and Relative Strength ratings in the high 90s. Other SmartSelect Ratings are sure to be high.IBD runs weekly minicharts of Sector Leader stocks each day in the paper, up to 16 charts at a time. All of the Leaders that meet the criteria can be found in the stock tables at the head of each of the 33 sector listings. But many sectors won't have any Leaders.In recent days, a sagging market briefly reduced the Sector Leaders list to zero. A savvy investor has his or her powder dry during a bear market. Once the market turns up, stocks may begin appearing in the feature. You can be sure these highly rated stocks are worth further study. Many will make superior buy candidates. Always consult the chart to find proper buy points. Buying before a stock has formed a proper base and broken out, or buying an extended stock, is inviting disaster, even if the stock is highly rated.The Sector Leaders screen has a superior long-term track record. Since the original follow-through day on March 6, 2009, the list has gained 355% vs. a 177% gain for the S&P 500, through IBD's Feb. 18 edition.To gauge the strength of the market, investors should not only study the price and volume action of the major indexes, but also watch the action of leading stocks. Sector Leaders is a good place to do that. Is there a diminishing number of Sector Leaders appearing in IBD each day? Are these stocks showing poor action or weak Accumulation/Distribution ratings? That might mean the market is in for hard times.That was often the case in late 2015. On Dec. 29, an article accompanying the Sector Leaders charts noted the weak Accumulation/Distribution ratings of of the six remaining stocks on the list. Only NetEase (NTES) had a strong B+ rating. LinkedIn (LNKD) had a C; Arista Networks (ANET), Facebook (FB) and Regeneron (REGN) each a C-; and Paycom (PAYC) had a D, indicating intense institutional selling.That was a wake-up call. The new year started with a sharp sell-off that has persisted into February.Priceline Group (PCLN) was an undisputed winner during the bull market that began in 2009. If you were scanning IBD's stock tables on Feb. 14, 2012, you would have noticed that Priceline was a Sector Leader, a member of the Leisure Sector that ranked No. 19 out of 33 sectors. The sector was already up 15.7% for the year.The average EPS increase for the prior three quarters was 74%. The last quarterly report showed an 87% increase. ROE was 44%. The Composite Rating was 97;  the EPS a 99, the RS a 76. Strong overall. You would have noticed that earnings were due in a couple of weeks. That adds risk.After a solid run-up in the first three months of 2012, Priceline cooled off to form a new long base. It finally broke out past a 745.34 handle buy point on May 10, 2013. From there, it made an 85% gain before topping at 1,378.96 in March 2014.
"
315,REGN,"Biotech giant Amgen beat analysts' Q4 estimates late Thursday, sending shares up a fraction in after-hours trading after a rough day for drug stocks. Amgen (AMGN)'s earnings totaled $2.61, up 21% from the year-earlier quarter and soundly beating analysts' consensus estimate of $2.29, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 4% to $5.54 billion, vs. analysts' $5.53 billion. For the full year,…
"
316,REGN,"Biotech pioneer Amgen has long depended on its flagship drugs for its revenue stream, but the next few years could see a changing of the guard as new medications overshadow the old.
"
317,REGN,"Currently, more than half of Amgen's (AMGN) sales come from drugs that debuted in the 1990s: the sister drugs Neulasta and Neupogen, both of which stimulate production of white blood cells, and Enbrel, which treats immunology conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Amgen's legacy anemia treatment, Epogen, still provides 9% of sales after being approved way back in 1989.
"
318,REGN,"However, as some of the earliest and therefore simplest biologic drugs, they've also been the first targets for rivals waiting to sell what are known as biosimilars once patents lapse on Amgen's products. Biosimilars aren't quite like generic drugs, which are identical copies of the originals, but they are similar enough to be used interchangeably by at least some physicians.
"
319,REGN,"Biosimilars of Neupogen have been sold for a few years in Europe, and this year Novartis' (NVS) version, Zarxio, entered the American market. It has put more weight on the growth of Amgen's launches.
"
320,REGN,"Repatha's Launch
"
321,REGN,"Probably the most anticipated Amgen launch this year was for Repatha, a treatment for high cholesterol approved in Europe in July and in the U.S. in August.
"
322,REGN,"Repatha is one of a new class of cholesterol medications called PCSK9 inhibitors, also being developed by several other drugmakers. In fact, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and its partner Sanofi (SNY) launched their own PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent, just a month earlier than Repatha in the U.S.
"
323,REGN,"Since the clinical trials indicate similar effectiveness for both drugs, the two have been duking it out for payer deals. Last month Amgen was put on the preferred formulary of CVS Health (CVS), while Regeneron and Sanofi did the same with UnitedHealth (UNH).
"
324,REGN,"Analysts agree, however, that the crucial test for Repatha will come next year. That's when Amgen reports on the first results from its trial measuring Repatha's effects on cardiovascular outcomes — that is, whether it actually reduces cardiovascular events like heart attack and stroke. Praluent's corresponding tests come shortly after.
"
325,REGN,"Though the FDA approved both Repatha and Praluent based on their ability to lower LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol, that ability doesn't mean that they automatically improve heart health.
"
326,REGN,"Better Than Expected?
"
327,REGN,"In a Dec. 14 note upgrading Amgen to overweight, Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison estimated that outcomes data could add 20% in annual sales of Repatha, even if Praluent (as is likely) gets the same result. But his upgrade was driven by a survey of cardiologists that found it could do better than expected even before that.
"
328,REGN,"""While we will be the first to acknowledge that survey data tends to skew toward high uptake, the cardiologists and PCPs (primary care physicians) we surveyed believe PCSK9 inhibitors can obtain 30% to 40% share of patients ... prior to outcomes data,"" Harrison wrote. ""This is well above what both we and the consensus model (see), and even if the penetration was cut in half, it would still be above consensus.""
"
329,REGN,"Seeing The Upside
"
330,REGN,"Analysts call for peak annual Repatha sales of $4 billion to $5 billion, but Harrison isn't the only analyst who sees upside to that number. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee recently wrote he thinks sales could be twice that.
"
331,REGN,"However, the peak isn't expected until 2020, and the need to negotiate with payers is keeping the launch fairly slow in the near term.
"
332,REGN,"Amgen has a few other cards to play, though, starting with blood-cancer drug Kyprolis.
"
333,REGN,"Amgen came by Kyprolis when it acquired Onyx Pharmaceuticals in 2013 for $10.4 billion. Many investors at the time balked at the price tag, but Amgen has been working to justify it by doing more research to expand the drug's label.
"
334,REGN,"When the FDA first approved Kyprolis for multiple myeloma in 2012, it cleared the drug only for advanced cases — those who'd had at least two prior treatments — and only in combination with another drug called Velcade. Also, Amgen couldn't put any survival benefit on Kyprolis' label, as the clinical trials hadn't proven the benefit.
"
335,REGN,"Amgen won approval for somewhat less advanced multiple myeloma this summer, and it produced studies demonstrating a survival benefit, as well as Kyprolis' effectiveness without Velcade. In the most recently reported third quarter, Kyprolis sales jumped 46% from a year ago to $137 million.
"
336,REGN,"Overall, Amgen's earnings rose 18% to $2.72 a share for the quarter, beating analyst estimates by 34 cents. Sales increased 14% to $5.72 billion, also ahead of Street views.
"
337,REGN,"Unusual Events
"
338,REGN,"It was the best sales growth in some years, but Amgen acknowledged that some of it was due to one-time events, such as one customer's abnormally large purchase of Enbrel. Amgen's guidance was more modest; analysts overall are expecting a slowdown, with earnings up 5% in the current quarter and up 6% next year.
"
339,REGN,"The Street expects earnings growth to jump to 16% the year after that, but the longer-term outlook depends on the success of drugs currently in the pipeline.
"
340,REGN,"Analyst Harrison pegs June 2016 as the likely report date for the results of a late-stage study of romosozumab, a medicine Amgen is developing for osteoporosis. If it succeeds, the drug could eventually reach blockbuster status, with more than $1 billion a year in sales.
"
341,REGN,"But in the nearer term, Amgen doesn't have many levers left to keep growth pumping, says Wells Fargo analyst Jim Birchenough.
"
342,REGN,"""With a highly leveraged balance sheet and commitment to its dividend policy, we view Amgen's business development opportunities as much more limited than peers',"" Birchenough wrote in a Dec. 3 report, initiating coverage at neutral.
"
343,REGN,"""While Amgen has been able to beat consensus estimates for the past five years, with share repurchases and aggressive cost cutting, we believe that further cost cuts would be difficult to achieve and that focus will increasingly be on top-line performance,"" Birchenough said.Biotech pioneer Amgen has long depended on its flagship drugs for its revenue stream, but the next few years could see a changing of the guard as new medications overshadow the old.Currently, more than half of Amgen's (AMGN) sales come from drugs that debuted in the 1990s: the sister drugs Neulasta and Neupogen, both of which stimulate production of white blood cells, and Enbrel, which treats immunology conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.

The fund carries an IBD 36-Month Performance Rating of A. The third-quarter stock market nose dive pulled down Regeneron (REGN) to what the MainStay managers saw as an attractive entry point.The fund invests in three types of growth stocks: those with long-term sustainable earnings growth, with quality cyclical earnings growth and in industries with rapid growth.The fund bought shares in Regeneron, which has the leading treatment for retinal eye disease and a compelling pipeline, including a new cholesterol drug, Kelly says.For investors who follow IBD's CAN SLIM method, the stock shows a 588.15 entry point.Regeneron has an IBD Composite Rating of 98, powerful on a scale of 1-99.More Health StocksIn Q3, the fund started a stake in Edwards Lifesciences (EW).

"
390,REGN,"Recent weeks have not been friendly to the pharmaceutical industry, with some stocks in the sector such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Horizon Pharma (HZNP) withering amid criticism over the industry's drug-pricing practices and fears of greater regulation.But two biotechs with top fundamentals — Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), the focus of the Screen of the Day — have maintained strong ratings and held up in the stock market despite the furor. Companies with top fundamentals, by IBD's definition, have three-year EPS and sales growth rates of at least 25%.Gilead Sciences, which has faced a raft of criticism over the price of its hepatitis C wonder drug, Sovaldi, has a three-year EPS growth rate of 106% and a three-year sales growth rate of 60%. The company handily beat Q3 estimates last month, raising full-year sales guidance that was just shy of expectations.Gilead, like other pharma stocks, fell on Sept. 21, when Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton said she would introduce a plan to crack down on what she called ""price gouging"" in the industry. Clinton's announcement came after Turing Pharmaceuticals was harshly criticized for its decision to buy a six-decade-old drug and quickly raise its price by more than 5,000%.Gilead breached its 200-day line that day and sank further for a month before clearing its 50-day and 200-day line. The stock has found support at its 200-day moving average since.Shares closed down 2.8% in the stock market today.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), which makes the cholesterol fighter Praluent with Sanofi (SNY), has a three-year EPS growth rate of 46% and a three-year sales growth rate of 45%. But sales of Praluent, seen as a possible blockbuster, were less than half of what analysts expected in Q3. EPS and overall sales beat forecasts.Regeneron fell the day of Clinton's announcement, finished higher the next two days, then descended below its 200-day line on Sept. 28. But the stock has since climbed above its 50-day line.Regeneron stock dipped 2.5% Thursday as the stock formed a handle on a three-month consolidation.While Regeneron and Gilead have turned in stronger showings recently, stocks such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Mallinckrodt (MNK) and Horizon Pharma have been hit hard. Short-seller Citron Research last month accused Valeant of shady sales practices and criticized the drugmaker for price-hikes in its acquired drugs. And Citron this month attacked Mallinckrodt, saying sales of its drug Acthar had lagged and questioned the gel's effectiveness.And Express Scripts (ESRX) on Wednesday sued Horizon Pharma, saying it owed millions in unpaid drug rebates, and cut from its network a specialty pharmacy that Horizon was using. Valeant also has been hammered over its specialty pharmacy ties.Mallinckrodt, Valeant and Horizon are all trading their 50-day and 200-day lines.Valeant shares ended down 6.5% Thursday, Horizon lost 2%, while Mallinckrodt fell 6.5%. Express Scripts slid 0.5%.Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.

391,REGN,"Big biotech Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) beat analysts' Q3 estimates and raised its guidance Wednesday, but the stock slid as expense guidance went up and newly launched cholesterol drug Praluent missed expectations.Regeneron's earnings rose 37% over the year-earlier quarter to $3.47 a share, beatings analysts' consensus by 27 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue climbed 57% to $1.14 billion, about $80 million above consensus.Regeneron raised full-year guidance on U.S. sales of its lead drug Eylea, which is traditionally the only revenue it guides — foreign sales are handled by partner Bayer (BAYRY), and as yet no other drug contributes significant income. The company now expects sales to grow 50% to 55%, up from its earlier guidance of 45% to 50%. It did not offer EPS guidance but did raise its expense outlook. R&D spending is now forecast at $540 million to $560 million, about $15 million higher than previously guided. The guidance range on sales, general and administrative expenses was raised $20 million at the low end, now $630 million to $650 million.Praluent, the potential blockbuster cholesterol drug launched in late July, took in $11 million vs. consensus of $24 million. On the company's conference call discussing results, Robert Terifay, a senior vice president, said that the launch is slow because payers are taking time to assess their reimbursement policies and preferred formularies, so Regeneron is providing free prescriptions to many patients with immediate need. Terifay said that Regeneron is gauging demand by the number of doctor prescriptions submitted through the MyPraluent program, which he said is ""consistent with our expectations.""Chief Scientific Officer George Yancopoulos said that the crucial trial of the effect of Praluent on cardiovascular outcomes — i.e. whether it prevents heart attacks and strokes — will produce final results in 2017, though there will be an interim analysis next year. In that respect Regeneron is somewhat behind rival Amgen (AMGN), which is expected to produce results from its outcomes trial of similar drug Repatha late next year.None of this was entirely new: Marketing partner Sanofi (SNY) had reported Praluent numbers in its own Q3 report last week, and the commentary around the launch expectations and the timeline were consistent with what Regeneron has previously said. However, Regeneron stock was off nearly 2% in afternoon trading on the stock market today, leading Morningstar analyst Stefan Quenneville to suspect that investors were hoping for more upside.""I think that people realized that Amgen's guidance (for the outcomes trial) was a bit earlier,"" Quenneville told IBD. ""Maybe the just put it all together.""Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

416,REGN,"Analysts expect social-media pioneer Facebook's third-quarter earnings per share to surge 21% from a year ago to 52 cents on revenue up 36% to $4.367 billion, both accelerations from the prior quarters.
"
417,REGN,"The company over the past year has made all its public posts searchable, tried to recast itself into a more news-centric site, and rapidly expanded in video for users and advertisers — developing an array of new video features to deepen user engagement.
"
418,REGN,"The site's users are viewing around 4 billion videos a day, Jefferies said in a research note last month, and the investment firm expects video ads to become a multibillion-dollar business over the next two years as digital ad formats become more expensive.
"
419,REGN,"""As video consumption explodes across FB's massive user base, we think FB looks well positioned to capture an increasing portion of TV ad budgets as marketers migrate toward data-driven, highly targeted online video ad campaigns,"" Jefferies said. The firm also said that Facebook app Instagram, with its ""beautiful visual layout"" and ""highly engaged audience"" would make for a good advertising environment.
"
420,REGN,"Shares closed down 0.7% to 102.58 in the stock market today.
"
421,REGN,"Upscale grocery chain Whole Foods has struggled with its ""whole paycheck"" reputation, allegations that it overcharged consumers and competition from traditional grocery chains like Kroger (KR), which have pushed more aggressively into Whole Foods' turf by offering higher-quality fare.
"
422,REGN,"Whole Foods in September said it would lay off 1,500 workers, partly to keep prices lower and invest in technology.
"
423,REGN,"Whole Foods is trying to draw younger shoppers with less disposable income by launching a new chain of stores called 365 by Whole Foods Market. Those stores are set to open next year.
"
424,REGN,"Analysts expect Whole Foods' Q4 EPS to fall around 3% to 34 cents. Sales are seen rising 7% to $3.470 billion, both slowing from the prior two quarters. Shares rose 1.1% to 31.27.
"
425,REGN,"Two media giants reporting Wednesday, 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Time Warner (TWX), have been pressured by the rise of online programming from services like Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) Prime Video. Investors will be tuned into the companies' ad sales, subscriber figures, and other signs of how they've adapted to the digitization of television.
"
426,REGN,"Analysts see 21st Century Fox's Q1 EPS slipping 5% to 37 cents, with revenue edging down to $6.422 billion. Time Warner's Q3 EPS is expected to fall 12% on revenue up 4% to $6.512 billion.

"
432,REGN,"A ""(special) focus is expected to be given to initial figures from the Praluent launch,"" Roth Capital Partners said of Regeneron's upcoming quarterly results. ""As we noted in our previous note, we expect a gradual launch, though we eventually expect Praluent and Repatha to achieve blockbuster status. We believe doctors will first look to optimize statin therapy and other modalities like Merck's (MRK) Zetia/Vytorin before moving to an injectable therapy.""

435,REGN,"Earnings season for the IBD 50 is nearing its peak, with leaders like Facebook (FB) and Visa (V) due to report in the coming week. More than two-thirds of S&P 500 companies have released quarterly results so far, and a Thomson Reuters report said 72% of them topped earnings estimates. Will IBD 50 stocks Facebook, Visa, Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN), Paycom Software (PAYC) and Gray Television (GTN) also beat forecasts?VisaThe credit card and debit payments processor is forecast to report a 15% increase in fiscal Q4 EPS to 63 cents when it reports early Monday. Visa has beaten profit estimates for the last seven quarters in a row. Revenue is expected to grow 10.5% to $3.57 billion.On Thursday, rival MasterCard (MA) reported a 5% hike in EPS to 91 cents that beat views, as revenue edged up 1.2% to $2.53 billion, just below consensus.The payment space has been drawing increased attention, especially from tech giants, with Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL) rolling out mobile pay services. On Monday, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) said it will launch a mobile wallet called Chase Pay. Meanwhile, Visa is promoting Visa Checkout, which lets cardholders pay with a smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop from virtually anywhere.Paycom SoftwareSmall, fast-growing cloud-based employment management software maker Paycom has been on the IBD 50 list for a while as companies adopt its software to cut costs and help with talent acquisition, payroll and other tasks. It also offers tools to help clients manage ObamaCare plans.Paycom is slated to report Tuesday after the market close. Analyst consensus is for EPS to rise 40% to 7 cents. Paycom has beaten the Street's earnings targets five quarters in a row. Revenue is projected to climb 41% to $51.51 million.Gray TelevisionAnother small, fast-growing IBD 50 stock, Gray Television has a spotty earnings record as acquisition costs rise, missing estimates three of the last six quarters. When it reports Tuesday, analysts expect Q3 earnings to drop 46% to 13 cents a share. Revenue is seen increasing 11% to $145.7 million.Gray Television has bought more than two dozen mostly small TV stations in the last two years. On Oct. 1, Atlanta-based Gray said it bought three more TV stations, one in a new market, among other moves. After its latest transactions close, expected by the end of the year, Gray will own and/or operate more than 150 stations serving 50 markets.FacebookSocial network giant Facebook boasts more than a billion regular users globally, and about 1.5 billion searches daily.Facebook is slated to report after the market close Wednesday. Consensus is for EPS of 52 cents, up 21%. Earnings have topped estimates for at least eight consecutive quarters. Revenue is seen increasing 36% to $4.36 billion, but that would mark the sixth quarter in a row of decelerating growth.Below the headline numbers, Facebook's expenses and mobile growth have come under scrutiny. In Q2, expenses spiked 82% as Facebook spends heavily to drive future growth. But mobile ad revenue accounted for 76% of total ad revenue, up from 62% a year earlier.Regeneron Pharmaceutical""Wet age-related macular degeneration"" isn't an everyday term, but it's the most common eye disease related to aging as baby boomers move into retirement age. Regeneron's blockbuster Eylea eye-disease treatment continues to generate huge revenue, jumping 50% in Q2 to $993 million, putting it on track for a nearly $4 billion yearly run rate.For Q3, analysts are looking for Regeneron to report on Wednesday a 45% surge in revenue to $1.06 billion, with EPS rising 27% to $3.20. Regeneron topped profit views in the last two quarters.Meanwhile, it also has or is developing treatments for colorectal cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. In July, the FDA approved Praluent, a cholesterol fighter and part of a new class of drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors.Follow James DeTar on Twitter @IBD_JDeTar and Facebook.

Express Scripts had long been saying it would make an effort to keep down the prices of Amgen's Repatha and Regeneron's Praluent, both of…
"
476,REGN,"When big biotechs Amgen and Regeneron launched their new cholesterol drugs Repatha and Praluent this summer, Wall Street uniformly predicted blockbuster sales, though they debated just how big.
"
477,REGN,"After all, one in seven adult Americans have high cholesterol, and Pfizer's (PFE) Lipitor was the biggest-selling drug in the world before it went off patent in 2011 and got generic rivals.
"
478,REGN,"Yet the statins — the drug class to which Lipitor belongs — aren't enough for everyone. Repatha and Praluent, both in a new class called PCSK9 inhibitors, promise to help many of those people whose cholesterol is still too high.
"
479,REGN,"In mid-September, Amgen (AMGN) made an acquisition that signaled where the future might lie. The company agreed to pay $300 million upfront for Dezima Pharma, a company developing a drug called a cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor. That drug class, which is also being developed by Merck (MRK) and Eli Lilly (LLY), also promises to lower cholesterol for those inadequately treated by statins. But besides lowering LDL bad cholesterol, they've also shown the ability to raise HDL good cholesterol.
"
480,REGN,"In contrast to the biweekly injections required for Amgen's and Regeneron's (REGN) treatments, the CETPs can be taken in one daily pill.
"
481,REGN,"If Dezima's drug candidate succeeds, Amgen is on the hook for up to $1.25 billion in milestone payments. But that could be well worth it if the CETP class turns out to be a real threat.
"
482,REGN,"""It provides a natural hedge on Amgen's important cardiovascular franchise, given PCSK9 Repatha could be a $4 billion-to-$5 billion drug but is injectable, while Phase III competitor CETP inhibitors from Lilly and Merck are oral,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee in a research note on Sept. 16, the day the deal was announced.
"
483,REGN,"For Wall Street, success is a big if. The drug in the class to first make it to phase-three testing, Pfizer's torcetrapib, came to a screeching halt when Pfizer realized the drug was raising patients' death rate by increasing their blood pressure.
"
484,REGN,"""It really shook up the field, because there were high hopes for torcetrapib,"" Daniel Bloomfield, vice president of clinical research in Merck's cardiovascular program, told IBD. ""When they announced their results, we put our program on hold and started to work through some of the issues.""
"
485,REGN,"Bloomfield said Merck isolated the hormone that was responsible for raising blood pressure in Pfizer's trial, and could demonstrate that its own drug, anacetrapib, did not have that risk factor. Lilly also says it's confident its CETP inhibitor, evacetrapib, is safer than its predecessor.
"
486,REGN,"""We enrolled our first patient in 2012, and we have 12,000 patients, most of (whom) are many, many months on treatment without any evidence of a safety signal,"" said Jeffrey Riesmeyer, senior medical director of Lilly's cardiovascular program.
"
487,REGN,"At the same time, though, there's a danger of making the drug too weak. That happened with Roche's (RHHBY) CETP inhibitor dalcetrapib. Its phase-three trial showed no safety problems, but it raised HDL by only 30% — where other candidates have typically raised it in the triple digits — and it didn't affect LDL at all.
"
488,REGN,"This history is the reason PCSK9s are available now, while the CETP inhibitors won't be on the market for at least two years. Amgen and Regeneron were able to win approval on the basis of their cholesterol-lowering powers before the companies demonstrated the drugs' effect on overall cardiovascular health. Both Merck and Lilly, however, are going to complete their cardiovascular outcome studies before they apply for approval.
"
489,REGN,"""When we first started working on anacetrapib, we had alignment with the FDA that they would approve the drug based on LDL lowering,"" Bloomfield said. ""I think (now) the FDA wants to see evidence of outcomes benefit before they approve a drug in this class. I think we want to see it as well, given that shadow overhanging the mechanism.""
"
490,REGN,"Lilly's trial is expected to be done by mid-2016, and Merck's by early 2017, which is also when the PCSK9 data are expected to start coming in. Both companies are studying similar patient groups to those in the PCSK9 trials — mainly those who already have heart disease. Virtually all of them are already on statins and many of them are also taking diabetes medicines, Riesmeyer notes.
"
491,REGN,"Since Lilly's diabetes drug Jardiance was recently shown to improve heart health by itself, the two drugs might work in tandem, Riesmeyer notes.
"
492,REGN,"The main difference between the two drugs is that Merck's anacetrapib has a longer half-life, or time that the drug remains in the body — traces of the drug have been detected in patients up to four years after their last dose. Lilly's Riesmeyer points to this as a potential safety issue, though that has yet to be proved.
"
493,REGN,"So far, the CETP inhibitors' ability to lower LDL has lagged behind the PCSK9s. In its phase-three trial, Praluent reduced LDL by 58%, and Repatha performed similarly. Anacetripib and evacetrapib have lowered it 20% to 40%, though they've also raised HDL as much as 140%. Dezima's drug TA-8995, which has gone through phase two, lowered LDL 40% to 50% while raising HDL 160%, which Amgen advertised when it announced the deal.
"
494,REGN,"""Assuming the LDL hypothesis holds true for CETP's, TA-8995 may potentially be best-in-class,"" wrote Leerink analysts in a July 8 deep-dive report on the cholesterol market.
"
495,REGN,"The uncertainty about the exact connection between cholesterol and heart health leaves it unclear just how this could translate to market share. And Merck's Bloomfield says that will likely be the key factor.
"
496,REGN,"""That's not to say the magnitude of the benefit, the safety and tolerability profile, and the price vs. generics aren't going to be important,"" he said. ""All four of those factors would be important, but I would expect that outcomes would be the required entry into taking significant market share.""When big biotechs Amgen and Regeneron launched their new cholesterol drugs Repatha and Praluent this summer, Wall Street uniformly predicted blockbuster sales, though they debated just how big.After all, one in seven adult Americans have high cholesterol, and Pfizer's (PFE) Lipitor was the biggest-selling drug in the world before it went off patent in 2011 and got generic rivals.Yet the statins — the drug class to which Lipitor belongs — aren't enough for everyone.

513,REGN,"BioMed Realty Trust (BMR) jumped more than 12% Wednesday after Bloomberg reported that the company is exploring a sale. Bloomberg said Blackstone Group (BX) is interested in buying it.BioMed Realty is a real estate investment trust that specializes in providing homes and laboratories for the life science industry.It focuses its efforts in seven core markets : Boston, San Francisco, San Diego, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Seattle.The companies it serves want to be part of research hubs near universities.BioMed was founded in 2004 with the realization that traditional REITs weren't able to satisfy the unique needs of research companies. It says it owns 18 million square feet of office and laboratory space it leases to companies and research institutions.Among the big universities it houses are Harvard, Yale and the University of California, San Diego.In April 2013, the company announced a new build-to-suit transaction for Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) for two new buildings totaling 297,000 square feet and a parking structure at the Landmark at Eastview in Tarrytown, N.Y. That expands Regeneron's campus to 1.4 million square feet. BioMed Realty says the laboratory and office space is pre-leased for a 15-year term.In June of this year, it announced that Illumina (ILMN) signed a 20-year lease for a 155,000-square-foot research building in Cambridge, England.The stock has been underperforming for the last several years, basically moving sideways. From a high near 25 in January, it slipped to 18 in recent weeks.The company pays a dividend of 26 cents a share, which works out to an annualized yield of 4.8%.

516,REGN,"A leading stock's 50-day moving average is a key support level to watch after the stock breaks out of a base. The strongest stocks tend to ride the average higher after an early-stage breakout.You can use the 50-day line as a vital tool to screen stocks as well.When building your watch list of stocks using growth screens like the IBD 50 (updated every day in Leaderboard ), IPO Leaders (in IBD on Tuesday and Thursday) and the Big Cap 20 (most Tuesdays), make sure that the stocks are consolidating gains above their 50-day moving averages. (Mini charts in IBD are weekly charts and therefore show a stock's 10-week moving average.) These stocks have a better chance of breaking out successfully than those basing below their 50-day or 10-week lines.Stocks trading comfortably above their 10-week lines are showing relative strength, and that's important to see as a stock is building a base. It's common for a stock to fall below its 10-week line as it builds a base; but as it starts to regain momentum, make sure that it's above its 10-week line as it nears a breakout area. At that point, the only resistance level it has to overcome is its prior high. If it's below its 10-week line, overhead supply becomes an issue; the 10-week line can turn into a resistance level.A buy point in a flat base should appear above the 10-week line. The same holds true for a double-bottom pattern and a cup-with-handle pattern. A handle area that forms below the 10-week line is a no-no. This is another case where the 10-week line could be a difficult price area for a stock to punch through.Amazon.com (AMZN) has been a solid performer this year after clearing a series of bases that showed supporting action at the 10-week moving average. The first breakout occurred during the week that ended April 24; the second one was during the week ended July 17; and the third one was during the week ended Oct. 23, soon after the S&P 500's follow-through day on Oct. 2.Today, several other top-rated growth names are building bases above their 10-week lines. They include Monster Beverage (MNST), Alliance Data Systems (ADS) and LogMeIn (LOGM). Regeneron (REGN) recently cleared a double-bottom buy point of 557.97, but it added a handle area that shows an alternate buy point of 588.15.LinkedIn (LNKD) is working on the right side of a deep, jagged base.

648,REGN,"The FDA approved Amgen's (AMGN) cholesterol drug Repatha late Thursday, giving it a similar label to a recently approved rival from Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY), but a slightly lower price.The agency said it had cleared Repatha, one of the new PCSK9 inhibitor class of drugs, for patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), and patients with heart disease who need more cholesterol-busting power than the standard treatment of statins.This is essentially the same as the label given to Regeneron/Sanofi's Praluent when it was approved last month, although Praluent was not approved in HoFH since the companies did not seek approval for that group. Some had hoped for a broader label that included patients who don't yet have heart disease, i.e. primary prevention, but after Praluent was approved Wall Street generally expected a similar label.""We believe FDA will adopt class labeling for Repatha, making a primary prevention claim unlikely,"" Nomura analyst Ian Somaiya wrote in a July 30 research note. ""However, we believe a label that includes secondary prevention in statin-intolerant patients should be sufficiently broad to support our current $2.5 billion peak sales estimate as we estimate the PCSK9 class must capture 24% share of this patient segment.""The FDA's press release didn't specifically mention statin intolerance, a much-disputed condition that Regeneron and Sanofi had been hoping to include on Praluent's label. Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) has also been targeting this group with a cholesterol-lowering drug candidate from a different class, leading to much stock volatility as the PCSK9 drama has unfolded.Amgen's press release said the drug will cost $14,100 a year, a bit below Praluent's at $14,600 a year. Since Praluent and Repatha are basically similar the arrival of the new drug has been widely expected to apply pricing pressure, but it wasn't clear how much. Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) has signaled its intention to spark a price war between the two to keep its costs down. Amgen's price only modestly undercut that, but ""real world"" pricing often involves a great deal of rebating.Consensus calls for Repatha to bring in $10 million to $15 million in revenue in the third quarter and $42 million in Q4, according to RBC Capital Markets.Amgen rose a fraction in after-hours trading Thursday, after climbing 1.1% in regular trade to close at 155.72.

798,REGN,"This week's list of leading stocks near buy points includes a healthy dose of medical names, from biotechs to managed care providers. The biotech revival began prior to Celgene's (CELG) 7% jump Wednesday on its $7.2 billion buy of Receptos (RCPT). Celgene is extended past a 121.57 cup-with-handle buy point.But Gilead Sciences (GILD) is still in play from a 116.93 entry after finding support at its 10-week moving average. The move didn't create a new buy opportunity, since it occurred below the buy point. But the stock is within the 5% buy zone.Also in buy range is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), trading just above a 554.10 flat-base buy point. The pattern is late stage, which is not surprising given the eye drug maker's 76% advance the past year.United Therapeutics (UTHR) hasn't yet broken out, but it's nearing a 190.39 buy point of a late-stage flat base. The IBD 50 stock, whose lead drugs are Orenitram and Remodulin, gets a 98 Composite Rating.Biotechs moved up to No. 2 among IBD's 197 industry groups, up from No. 5 six weeks ago. Hospitals claim the top spot vs. No. 10 six weeks back.Representing the No. 9-ranked generic-drug group, Allergan (AGN) is just above a 315.10 handle buy point cleared Monday. Formerly known as Actavis, the Botox makeradded double-chin injection Kybella with its June buy of Kythera.Mallinckrodt (MNK), also a generic-drug maker, is working on a four-month consolidation with a 132.70 buy point. The stock looks poised for a third straight weekly gain to close above its 10-week line.Among other medical stocks, ethical-drug maker Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is building a flat base with a 246.11 entry. The Canadian company is the leader in the No. 11-ranked group, with the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating.Molina Healthcare (MOH), a provider of managed health care services to low-income families, is nearing a 74.08 flat-base buy point.

799,REGN,"When a stock splits its shares, especially in the manner of 3-for-1 or 4-for-1 or more, it often marks the top. As regular readers of this column know, too many large stock splits offer alert investors a timely sell signal.

801,REGN,"Some company managers think nothing of letting their stocks run up to $100 or $200 a share, or even $1,000. But among this small subset of leading stocks, you might encounter an extreme share split.

803,REGN,"Here's a dramatic statistic: When the IBD 100 (which later became the IBD 50) was unveiled on April 14, 2003, not a single issue traded above the century mark. The highest priced stock? It was eBay (EBAY), which traded near 88.

807,REGN,"Also in the dot-com boom, Qualcomm (QCOM) split 4-for-1 in the last week of 1999. From the Nov. 2 stock-split news to the ultimate high on the first trading day of 2000, the stock rocketed 250%, topping at precisely 200.

808,REGN,"A more recent example is Baidu (BIDU), which was trading above 800 when it split 10-for-1 in May 2010. The stock rose 16% that week, then built a two-month base.

814,REGN,"Three top-20 industry groups from the Medical sector showed nice price action Monday. All three groups have been long-time market leaders and a number of stocks within the groups are shaping late-stage bases.
"
815,REGN,"Shares of generic-drug giant Allergan (AGN), formerly know as Actavis, cleared a 315.10 cup-with-handle entry Monday. Volume was modestly above average. Allergan's latest base corrected a mild 12%, but is late stage. The stock's relative strength line touched a new high as it broke out, which adds confirmation to the move.
"
816,REGN,"Allergan will report Q2 earnings before the open on Aug. 6. Analysts are looking for per-share earnings to climb 28% to $4.39 on sales of $5.72 billion, up 117%. Sales estimates are boosted by the recent Allergan acquisition.
"
817,REGN,"Also from the generic-drug camp, Mallinckrodt (MNK) is tracking sideways in a consolidation that dates back to March. In May the stock cleared a short handle buy point at 130.35, but reversed lower and triggered an 8% loss sell signal a few weeks later. The handle can only be seen on a daily chart. For now, Mallinckrodt faces a test of resistance at its 50-day moving average.
"
818,REGN,"From the biotech group, Celgene (CELG) briefly cleared a 121.57 handle buy point intraday, but retreated by the close. Volume was light. A flaw in its latest base pattern is that the majority of the base was formed below the 10-week moving average line. The base also showed one week of net distribution. Celgene will report Q2 earnings results before the market open on July 23.
"
819,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) is approaching a 544.10 buy point in a late-stage flat base. The stock is finding support at its 10-week line, but has already made a huge run, which makes it a riskier buy if the stock breaks out.
"
820,REGN,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) jumped Monday and is trying for a sixth straight weekly advance as it climbs the right side of a consolidation pattern. The stock is back near an all-time high it set in December after months of sideways action and a sharp drop in the spring.

825,REGN,"Big-cap biotech Amgen (AMGN) beat Wall Street's third-quarter estimates and guided full-year earnings a bit above consensus Monday, sending its recently hot stock up 1% in after-hours trading.Amgen's earnings excluding one-time items rose 19% over the year-ago quarter to $2.30 a share, beating analysts' consensus by 19 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales increased 6% to $5.03 billion, about $70 million ahead of estimates.On the conference call to discuss results, CEO Robert Bradway noted that last year's Q3 included a $155 million order for anemia drug Neupogen from the U.S. government, which inflated that quarter's sales. Backing that out, sales growth was 8%, consistent with the first half of the year.The $518 million in Q3 sales of Neulasta, a drug stimulating white blood cells, beat consensus by more than $60 million, and was 5% over last year's third quarter. This was driven by price increases more than volume, according to Amgen. The story was virtually identical with anemia drug Epogen, whose sales rose 5% over last year also for price reasons, to total $518 million. Analysts had expected $486 million.Rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel missed estimates with a 3% dip in sales, though units grew 3% year over year. On the call, CFO David Meline reminded analysts that Q2 had seen an inventory build that was burned off in Q3, ""masking the strength in demand.""Nonetheless Enbrel helped drive the overall profit growth, since it is no longer under a profit-sharing agreement with Pfizer (PFE).Research and development spending of $980 million was more than $60 million lower than analysts' consensus, while sales, general and administrative spending was also about $60 million below the Street's estimate of $1.09 billion.The company added $300 million to its full-year revenue guidance, now $19.8 billion to $20 billion, slightly above the Street's forecast and up from $18.7 billion last year. It guided full-year EPS at $8.45 to $8.55, up from its previous range of $8.20 to $8.40 and above analysts' target of $8.42. However, that implies Q4 EPS between $1.91 and $2.01, which is short of the Street's average of $2.04. Last year, the company made $7.60 a share in the full year and $1.82 in the fourth quarter.On the conference call, Meline said that Amgen is lifting its 2014 tax rate estimate by a percentage point from 16% to 17%, due to uncertainties about the extension of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit. However, Cowen analyst Eric Schmidt commented that even accounting for that, a Q4 increase in operating expenses was implied in the guidance.Meline answered that expenses usually increase at the end of the year so this was ""nothing unusual."" However, Bradway added that the company is preparing for product launches next year, which also will increase spending.The most anticipated of these on the Street is evolocumab, the first in a new class of cholesterol drugs called anti-PCSK9s. Analysts expect sales could run up to $2 billion, though forecasts remain uncertain as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) is seen launching a competing product shortly thereafter.The management kept the call short as they planned to hold a business review meeting on Tuesday, at which they're expected to give a longer-term outlook on the company's business and strategy. They're also expected to address shareholder pressure to split into two parts, which got extra publicity last week from Daniel Loeb, hedge-fund manager at Third Point Capital.Loeb, taking an idea proposed by Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges in June, argued that making like Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Pfizer and splitting off the established legacy drugs such as Enbrel from the newer and more innovative products would unlock ""hidden value.""That chatter, along with the general recovery of biotech stocks, has helped drive up Amgen's stock over the last week. During regular trading Monday it hit a new high of 148.47, eventually closing up 0.6% to 148.20.

827,REGN,"Medical stocks are flexing their muscles in the latest Big Cap 20 list, as they've more than doubled in number from the prior week.Even though a few medical sectors make the cut, biotechs are well represented. The group earned the top ranking in Monday's issue among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, a big improvement from No. 76 six weeks ago.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) reversed upward to edge higher, following up on last week's 16% gain. The stock is 10% extended past a 173.80 entry of a second-stage base. It triggered the 8% sell rule on Oct. 15, but quickly recovered the buy point.The biotech on Thursday beat views with Q2 earnings of $1.27, up 53% from a year ago, on a 39% increase in sales to $551.1 million. It also lifted its full-year profit and sales guidance.The Cheshire, Conn.-based company's sole commercial drug, Soliris, treats two rare blood diseases. It's now in the submission process for FDA approval of a second drug, asfotase alfa, to treat a genetic bone disease called hypophosphatasia.Amgen (AMGN), up 1% to a new high, is 20% extended from a 123.21 cup-with-handle buy point it cleared in late July. The stock corrected 12% between Sept. 19 and Oct. 16, but didn't undercut the entry.Shares were up after hours, after the Thousand Oaks, Calif.-based biotech was announced Q2 earnings that rose 19% to $2.30 a share on a 6% sales increase to $5 billion, both above consensus estimates.Amgen recently said it will work with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and other groups to try to find an alternative method to produce ZMapp, an experimental Ebola drug made by Mapp Biopharmaceutical in San Diego.Celgene (CELG) closed slightly lower after striking a new high intraday Monday, and is still 14% extended past a 90.60 buy point it surpassed in mid-August. Like Alexion, it triggered the 8% sell rule on Oct. 15, but quickly bounced back.The Summit, N.J.-based biotech on Thursday reported Q2 earnings that topped views and revenue in line with forecasts. Celgene focuses on drugs to treat chancer and immune-inflammatory-related diseases. Revlimid, Vidaza and Abraxane are among its biggest sellers.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) extended its gains for a fifth straight session and is now 10% extended past a 369.41 flat-base buy point. The Tarrytown, N.Y.-based biotech develops drugs to treat eye diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer.On Oct. 17, it reported clinical trial results in which its Eylea eye drug outperformed two competing treatments in patients with diabetic macular edema.Other health care stocks in the Big Cap 20 include genetic analysis systems maker Illumina (ILMN) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX), a maker of dermatology, neurology and eye-health drugs.

828,REGN,"The stock market often does what's least expected, and that certainly has been the case lately. Consider these four recent occurrences: A heavy distribution-day count for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 in recent weeks didn't do much damage to the market. In fact, the market uptrend resumed Thursday when the Nasdaq marked an all-time closing high, rising 1.3% in higher volume.After showing signs of a climax top last month, Ambarella (AMBA) found support at its 10-week moving average again, rising nearly 12% for the week.Regeneron (REGN) is holding near highs despite a series of breakouts from late-stage bases.And right when it looked like Centene (CNC) was going to roll over after a massive price run, it's back above its 50-day moving averageSo it goes in today's market.The good news is that the action in several other IBD 50 names has been far from confusing. The IBD 50 rose 3.6% for the week, ahead of the S&P 500's 2.4% gain but below a 4.25% gain for the Nasdaq.Celgene (CELG) gapped out of an 18-week, cup-shaped base Wednesday, rising 7% in strong volume, after it announced plans to acquire Receptos (RCPT) for just over $7 billion. One of Receptos' key drugs is multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis treatment ozanimod. It's not approved yet, but early trials have been promising.Celgene's weekly chart looks solid. It's still in a buy range, just over 3% above a 129.16 buy point.Small-cap Fleetmatics (FLTX), a member of Wednesday's list, is at the high end of a buy range from a 48.06 cup-with-handle buy point.Monster Beverage (MNST) is in a similar boat as it trades near a 139.75 buy point.Meanwhile, several IBD 50 names are reporting earnings this week.Illumina (ILMN) and Blackhawk Network (HAWK) report Tuesday after the close. Celgene and Valeant (VRX) report Thursday after the close.Valeant is working on a late-stage, flat base with a 246.11 buy point. The base is strengthened by several tight weekly closes.Valeant has pursued an aggressive growth-through-acquisition strategy in recent years. Earlier this year, it bought Salix Pharmaceuticals for around $14.5 billion. In 2013, it scooped up Bausch & Lomb for nearly $9 billion.Q2 profit at Valeant is seen rising 29% from a year ago to $2.46 a share.

875,REGN,"Rising biotech star Medivation started losing altitude in after-hours trading Thursday after its Q1 report missed estimates, in a day when several high-rated drug stocks reported.Medivation's (MDVN) earnings excluding one-time items totaled 17 cents a share, reversing a year-earlier loss but missing analysts' consensus by 10 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue climbed 48% to $129.2 million, about $20 million short of consensus.Nonetheless, the company affirmed its full-year guidance of $600 million to $650 million in revenue. It did not offer EPS guidance, but its forecast of expenses remained the same.On the conference call discussing results with analysts, CFO Rick Bierly said the company had warned on the Q4 call that this quarter was likely to be slow. He cited a buildup of inventory of the company's sole marketed drug, Xtandi, in Q4, which has now returned to normal, as well as an unusually high refund rate due to the reset of the Medicare Part D ""donut hole"" at the start of the year. He also anticipated that returning to normal as the year goes on.The stock took a 5% hit in after-hours trading, after rising 1.3% in regular trade to close at 123.23.Also falling in late trading was specialty drugmaker Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ), which also affirmed guidance but reported a mixed quarter. Jazz's revenue rose 25% from the previous year to $309.3 million, a hair short of Wall Street's $309.8 million estimate. Profit also increased 25%, to $1.99 a share, missing consensus by 16 cents.Jazz also announced that it had decided not to move forward with clinical trials of JZP-386, a product developed in partnership with Concert Pharmaceuticals (CNCE) as a possible successor to Jazz's bestselling narcolepsy drug Xyrem. The companies said the underwhelming results of phase 1 studies led to the decision, but they will continue to evaluate possible uses for the drug.Earlier in the day, big-cap biotech Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) reported a more positive quarter and raised its guidance, but the stock still closed down a fraction at 468.62.Regeneron's earnings rose 27% over the year-earlier quarter to $2.88 a share, beating analysts' consensus by 20 cents. Sales climbed 39% to $869.6 million, about $45 million above consensus.The beat came from U.S. sales of Regeneron's flagship eye drug Eylea, which jumped 51% to $541 million. The Street expected $527 million, according to RBC Capital Markets. The firm now expects U.S. Eylea sales to rise 30% to 35% this year, up from its previous guidance of 25% to 30%. The company does not provide overall revenue guidance because foreign Eylea sales are handled by Bayer (BAYRY), while other sales come from collaborations and milestone payments.Regeneron executives stressed the importance of Protocol T, a study comparing Eylea head-to-head with its chief competitors, Roche's (RHHBY) Lucentis and Avastin, in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME), a type of vision loss associated with diabetes. Commercial head Robert Terifay told analysts on the company's earnings conference call that Regeneron's market research indicated that the study, published in February, was driving uptake of the drug and taking share from competitors.CEO Len Schleifer added that anecdotal accounts indicated that it might also be helping sales in Eylea's original target of wet age-related macular degeneration, since specialists who might have only had Avastin in stock now had Eylea available for all uses.""We had previously thought Eylea and Lucentis shares should at least equilibrate, but now believe Eylea should overtake Lucentis and maybe even grow the market with share away from Avastin, at least in DME,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt in a research note Thursday. ""REGN also has the power to post surprises from the pipeline.""The pipeline product that drew the most discussion on the call was Praluent, the cholesterol fighter that is under FDA review and expected to be approved by July.On the call, Terifay remained bullish on the drug's blockbuster potential but acknowledged that negotiations with payers might slow down the launch, as Express Scripts (ESRX) has made clear that Praluent's drug class will be its next target for a price war.""We are working with the players involved in the market-access decision-making process to focus on patient good,"" Terifay said. ""That said, it will likely take several months for commercial and government payers to take formulary reviews (and) make reimbursement coverage decisions.""

889,REGN,"Sector rotation is pretty much a done deal, if the Big Cap 20 is any guide. Last spring and summer, the medical sector was providing a third to a half of the names in the Big Cap 20.The summer leaders' charts now look sad. Biogen (BIIB) is 40% off its high. Illumina (ILMN) is 33% off its high. (It plunged after hours on preannounced Q3 revenue and full-year guidance that missed views.) Regeneron (REGN) is 23% off its high.In Tuesday's Big Cap 20, only one medical stock made the list.Heart-valve maker Edwards Lifesciences (EW) is on the list, despite a couple of breakouts that offered meager gains. A breakout on March 16 yielded a 9% gain in five sessions, then the stock consolidated. A breakout in July yielded an 8% gain in about three weeks before the stock consolidated.Small gains do not give individual investors much of a chance to make money.Edwards is now forming a new consolidation, but is it good news? In Monday's IBD, the medical sector was No. 19 of 33 sectors after being in the top four most of the year through September.If the medical sector is finished as a leader, what has replaced the medical stocks? An investor might just as well ask what hasn't replaced the medical stocks.The Big Cap 20's leadership is now more diverse than it has been all year.Its stocks are from many sectors, including retail, software, tobacco and leisure.Many are in early-stage patterns, thanks to resets or breakouts that didn't advance 20% or more.A reset occurs when a stock's low undercuts the low of its previous base, which resets the count at one. A first- or second-stage base has a better shot at success than a later-stage base.The following Big Cap 20 stocks feature first-stage bases:Software sector play Salesforce.com (CRM) is working on a first-stage consolidation. The stock has regained its 200-day and 50-day lines, and is only 4% off a new high.Breakouts this year led to gains of 9% and 10%. The stock hasn't posted a gain of 20% from a breakout since August-November 2013.Retail sector stock Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is working on a first-stage pattern. The stock is 4% off its high and is battling to retake its 50-day line.Breakouts this year led to gains of 15%, 4% and most recently 4%.Tobacco sector stock Reynolds American (RAI) cleared a 44.24 buy point Monday, but strong volume was missing. A valid breakout usually delivers a volume spike of at least 40% above average. Strong volume is the mark of institutional activity.Food and meat stock Hormel (HRL) rushed past a 64.23 buy point Monday. Volume was 130% above average. The stock is defensive and seldom delivers big gains out of breakouts. Hormel's last big gain was a 44% pop out of a November 2012 breakout.

945,REGN,"Drugmaker Akorn (AKRX) cleared a flat base, rising 2.28 to 41.29 in strong turnover. The buy point was 39.58. A range of antibiotics, steroids and vaccines has fueled growth for Akorn in recent quarters. It recently entered the dermatology market with its purchase of VersaPharm for $440 million. Earnings are due Nov. 6 before the open.
"
946,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) soared 14.89 to 381.01.

952,REGN,"Big-cap biotech Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) beat Wall Street's Q1 estimates and raised its guidance Thursday, sending the stock up more than 2% in early trading.
"
953,REGN,"Regeneron's earnings rose 27% over the year-earlier quarter to $2.88 a share, beating analysts' consensus by 20 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue climbed 39% to $869.6 million, about $45 million above consensus.
"
954,REGN,"The beat came from U.S. sales of Regeneron's flagship eye drug Eylea, which jumped 51% to $541 million. The Street expected $527 million, according to RBC Capital Markets. The company said it now expects U.S. Eylea sales to rise 30% to 35% this year, up from its previous guidance of 25% to 30%. The company does not provide overall revenue guidance because foreign Eylea sales are handled by Bayer (BAYRY), while other sales come from collaborations and milestone payments.
"
955,REGN,"Regeneron executives stressed the importance of Protocol T, a study comparing Eylea head to head with its chief competitors, Roche's (RHHBY) Lucentis and Avastin, in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME), a type of vision loss associated with diabetes. Commercial head Robert Terifay told analysts on the company's earnings conference call that Regeneron's market research indicated that the study, published in February, was driving uptake of the drug and taking share from competitors.
"
956,REGN,"Sees Opening Vs. Avastin
"
957,REGN,"CEO Len Schleifer added that anecdotal accounts indicated it might also be helping sales in Eylea's original target of wet age-related macular degeneration, since specialists who might have previously only had Avastin in stock now had Eylea available for all uses.
"
958,REGN,"""We had previously thought Eylea and Lucentis shares should at least equilibrate, but now believe Eylea should overtake Lucentis and maybe even grow the market with share away from Avastin, at least in DME,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt in a research note Thursday. ""REGN also has the power to post surprises from the pipeline.""
"
959,REGN,"The pipeline product that drew the most discussion on the call is Praluent, the cholesterol fighter under FDA review that is expected to be approved by July. On the call, Terifay remained bullish on the drug's blockbuster potential but acknowledged that negotiations with payers might slow down the launch, as Express Scripts (ESRX) has made clear that Praluent's drug class will be its next target for a price war.
"
960,REGN,"""We are working with the players involved in the market-access decision-making process to focus on patient good,"" said Terifay. ""That said, it will likely take several months for commercial and government payers to take formulary reviews, make reimbursement coverage decisions, and begin to process patient claims. Given these reasons, we expect an initial gradual uptake and launch.""
"
961,REGN,"Terifay said he expects most patients will begin on the lower 75mg dose of Praluent, then move up to the 150mg dose if needed. Regeneron executives see the potential approval of two dosages as an important difference between Praluent and Amgen's (AMGN) Repatha, a similar drug whose approval deadline is only a month later.
"
962,REGN,"Regeneron stock rose as much as 1.7% in early trading on the stock market today, but in morning trading it was down a fraction, near 467. Regeneron stock touched an all-time high of 495.50 on March 20.

964,REGN,"Best ETFs For 2015: May Performance Update
"
965,REGN,"Several sector ETFs have solar-powered investors to double-digit gains in 2015 so far. But for the brightest gains, Americans turned to foreign shores where China lords over all.
"
966,REGN,"U.S. equity exchange traded funds recovered in recent trading sessions after broad losses as April gave way to May. Both higher interest rates and mixed earnings weighed on U.S. stocks.
"
967,REGN,"""We don't expect more than a modest increase in rates, but even that may be enough to push volatility higher, which is likely to be a headwind for many of the most popular, so-called momentum stocks,"" Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist for BlackRock, wrote on May 11.
"
968,REGN,"He cited biotech and social media stocks as examples. They peaked in April but then tumbled hard along with the uptick in volatility.
"

"
971,REGN,"But Koesterich thinks the loss of momentum will continue. He suggests increasing value-oriented stakes. Namely, integrated oil companies that trade at a deep discount to the S&P 500 despite a rally from their recent lows.
"
972,REGN,"Both EOG (EOG) and Pioneer (PES) plan to resume drilling and rig deployment. New supply could slow the rally and stabilize oil prices, Koesterich says.

"
1001,REGN," Valeant Pharmaceuticals has a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99, meaning its shares outperform 99% of all stocks in the market as measured by fundamental and technical factors. Some of those factors are earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance.
"
1002,REGN,"Valeant completed its $11.1 billion acquisition of Salix Pharmaceuticals on April 1. Salix and partner Pharming Group came out Monday with good interim data on the phase-two clinical trial of their conestat alfa drug, Ruconest, developed for the treatment of angioedema attacks. (That's allergy-related swelling.)
"
1003,REGN,"Valeant shares, which eased 0.6% Tuesday, are 61% extended past a cup-with-handle base buy point of 147.39, initially cleared last December.
"

"
1012,REGN," Biogen, a biotech that earns a 97 Composite Rating, is now trading 19% off its March 20 peak of 480.18. That price was reached in a nearly four-month-long, 38% run out of a price consolidation.

""Inhaled drugs like this may require specific pre-clinical and clinical data related to (Parkinson's), consistency, long-term chronic lung safety in animals and humans, and other regulatory data specific for inhaled drugs that sometimes aren't always clear until during or end of regulatory reviews, which makes it particularly tricky (prior examples include Alexza, and Mannkind which didn't get through on first passes).""However, the long-term risk should be manageable, he said.""Also the commercial opportunity seems logical but needs to be better understood and may not drive huge value until it reaches the market post-2016,"" Yee said.

1201,REGN,"Connect with Amy Reeves: @IBD_Areeves and Facebook.Biotechs The Medicines Co. (MDCO) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) both got multiple price target increases Monday after they announced positive data on their anti-cholesterol drug candidate over the weekend.At the annual congress of the European Society of Cardiology, Medicines Co. and Alnylam presented results of their phase-one trial of ALN-PCSsc, which divided subjects with high LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) into various different dosage groups, some of whom received a single dose of the injectable drug while others received weekly, biweekly or monthly doses. ALN-PCSsc targets PCSK9, the same target as the recently approved Repatha from Amgen (AMGN) and Praluent from Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY).However, while Repatha and Praluent are monoclonal antibodies, ALN-PCSsc works through RNA interference, a new platform being studied for a variety of uses in medicine.The single-dose results were of particular interest, because they appeared to lower cholesterol as much as the monoclonal antibodies but for a longer duration. Both Praluent and Repatha are administered biweekly.Sees Low-Volume Dosage""Remarkably, significant and clamped lowering of LDL-C is achieved for over 140 days after a single dose,"" Alnylam Chief Medical Officer Akshay Vaishnaw said in a statement on Sunday. ""Accordingly, we believe that these results support a quarterly, and possibly bi-annual, low-volume subcutaneous dose regimen for further development.""Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz raised his price target on Medicines Co. stock to 53 from 40.""While patient numbers in each dose cohort are small (single digits), tight error bars, particularly with PCSK9 knockdown, suggest these responses are likely to be replicated in a larger program,"" Schwartz wrote in a research note Sunday. ""No SAEs (serious adverse events) or drug-related discontinuations occurred, with all adverse events being mild to moderate in severity.""Schwartz's colleague Michael Schmidt raised his target on Alnylam to 151 from 145, noting that for the phase-two testing the program lead will move to Medicines Co.""There is $170 million in milestones remaining that Alnylam could receive, in addition to royalties ranging from low-teens to 20% at the top tier,"" he wrote in a Monday note.Medicines Co. stock rose 22% Monday to an all-time closing high of 41, narrowly missing an all-time intraday high.

1205,REGN,"Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) said U.S. prescription-drug spending rose more last year than it had since 2003, according to its annual review. According to the 2014 Drug Trend Report, spending on drugs among the commercially insured rose 13.1% to $980 per member last year. Medicare spending rose 13.8% to $2,987 per member, while Medicaid spending climbed 10.2% to $882.
"
1206,REGN,"The report said that spending on hepatitis C drugs accounted for more than half of the increase, which was not a big surprise: Before 2014 the disease was still treated mainly with generic drugs, but in 2014 Gilead Sciences' (GILD) premium-priced Sovaldi, often prescribed in tandem with Johnson & Johnson 's (JNJ) also-pricey Olysio, took over the market. In October, Gilead launched Harvoni, which rendered Olysio obsolete but cost more than Sovaldi.

1213,REGN,"Biotech United Therapeutics (UTHR) received Food and Drug Administration approval for its first cancer drug Tuesday and was also awarded a priority-review voucher, which could turn out to be just as lucrative.The agency approved Unituxin, a monoclonal antibody that treats an ultra-rare childhood cancer called neuroblastoma. With only about 650 new cases a year, consensus estimates expect only $73 million in annual sales from the drug by 2019.To encourage more such rare-disease treatments, however, the FDA awarded the company a Rare Pediatric Priority Review Voucher. United Therapeutics can sell this to another company if it wishes, which will expedite review once the buyer files a new drug application.The demand for such a drug could be considerable. Last July, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and partner Sanofi (SNY) paid $67.5 million to acquire a similar voucher from BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN), which it then used to catch up to Amgen (AMGN) in their race to bring the first cholesterol-busting PCSK9 inhibitor to market. Currently, the FDA's deadline to make a decision on Regeneron's alirocumab is July 24, while for Amgen's evolucumab it's Aug. 27.In November, Gilead Sciences (GILD) paid $125 million to Knight Therapeutics for a priority-review voucher, which it hasn't used yet.The market seemed pleased. Though United Therapeutics stock opened down on the stock market today, it rallied after the news got out in the late morning and touched a record high of 164.82.

1246,REGN,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: August Performance Report
"
1247,REGN,"Sophomore slump? Not for Joe Fath. He took the helm of $47 billion T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund a year and a half ago — on Jan. 16, 2014. In that first calendar year in charge, his fund's 8.83% gain topped only 35% of its large-cap growth rival mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
1248,REGN,"This year — in which the broad market has imitated a bucking bronco — his fund has climbed 5.93% as of Aug. 31 , outperforming a whopping 96% of its peer investors.
"
1249,REGN,"Fath is more concerned with the longer term. The broad market's rally of nearly 6-1/2 years has made it increasingly hard for him to find attractively valued growth stocks.
"
1250,REGN,"The late-summer volatility has made it harder to find gainers.
"
1251,REGN,"Fath, who is about to celebrate his 45th birthday, talked with IBD from his office in Baltimore about why his mutual fund is performing so much better this year than last year and about how he is searching for new market leaders.
"
1252,REGN,"IBD: When you took charge of this fund, you cut the size of the overall portfolio and of its top 10 names. You initially trimmed to 100, down from 118, and more recently you're at 106 as of July 31. Is your initial retooling complete?
"
1253,REGN,"Fath: I'm where I want to be. The tail end of the fund is half what it used to be. It's 10% of the fund now. The top 10 decreased a little bit. The middle is bigger.
"
1254,REGN,"IBD: How does each segment differ?
"
1255,REGN,"Fath: I describe my philosophy as an upside-down pyramid. The top slice is secular-growth names. That typically makes up 50% to 60% of the portfolio. Those are innovative disrupters that are the most dynamic growth companies.
"
1256,REGN,"The middle section would be more cyclical opportunities. These would typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio. They're likely to be more opportunistic and have shorter holding periods in the fund than the average holding.
"
1257,REGN,"The last section would be what I generally characterize as special situations. These are in three primary areas:
"
1258,REGN,"First, stocks transitioning from value to growth.
"
1259,REGN,"Second, companies underway in a lasting industry structural change, like what has been going on the last several years in the U.S. airline sector.
"
1260,REGN,"Third, roll-ups, where strong management teams that are good capital allocators are applying discipline and efficiency in fragmented industries through acquisition.
"
1261,REGN,"This bucket will typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio.
"
1262,REGN,"The top 10 or 20 names are generally the most compelling secular ideas. The tail of my portfolio has the smallest holdings and are typically my farm team — earlier-stage growth names and private companies that I own.
"
1263,REGN,"IBD: Give me some examples of special situations, please.
"
1264,REGN,"Fath: Gilead Sciences (GILD) went through the value-to-growth transition when it bought Pharmasset and got into (treating) hep C in addition to its core HIV business.
"
1265,REGN,"Airlines are in the industry structural change category, and I own American Airlines (AAL) and United Continental (UAL).
"
1266,REGN,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is in the roll-up category, bringing capital allocation discipline to the pharma industry through an assertive allocation strategy.
"
1267,REGN,"IBD: Name examples from your secular bucket, please.
"
1268,REGN,"Fath:Amazon (AMZN) would be the poster child. Tesla (TSLA) is a bit more extreme. It's an on-the-come story. Other names include Priceline (PCLN), MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V).
"
1269,REGN,"IBD: And name some from your cyclical bucket, please.
"
1270,REGN,"Fath: Stuff in financials like TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Morgan Stanley (MS) to a degree, but it is also a shifting business model, looking more like a value-to-growth shift.
"
1271,REGN,"In industrials, I hold names like FedEx (FDX), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Flowserve (FLS), an energy industrial for the most part.
"
1272,REGN,"IBD: Why has fund performance zoomed up this year — at least until the broad sell-off?
"
1273,REGN,"Fath: It was a drag last year when secular-growth names sold off. A lot of that was due to people wanting to see more transparency in big names. They wanted to see Amazon break out its core e-commerce business and Amazon Web Services. That company is becoming more disciplined on expenses and costs.
"
1274,REGN,"And we're starting to see that in Google (GOOGL).
"
1275,REGN,"This year I've taken up the health care weighting significantly. And I've taken down energy. Both moves paid off.
"
1276,REGN,"I have a number of biotech and managed care and big-pharma names. That's played well. There's been some M&A activity in that space.
"
1277,REGN,"IBD: So you have a bigger bet on growth this year, and that has paid off?
"
1278,REGN,"Fath: The slowdown in growth happened prior to the sell-off in 2014.
"
1279,REGN,"I was positioned for a cyclical recovery, but that didn't play out. It's been the reverse in 2015.
"
1280,REGN,"We've been in a slow-growth environment. And the world has been thrown off by exogenous shocks like Greece and China, which is devaluing its currency.

1281,REGN,"Those external factors help make growth more valuable. That bids up the valuations of companies that are delivering growth.
"
1282,REGN,"But you've got to be disciplined about position sizes.
"
1283,REGN,"Google, Priceline — their outlooks look good. They've gone through heavy investment cycles.
"
1284,REGN,"Google has a new CFO, Ruth Porat, who came from Morgan Stanley. They're creating a new holding company called Alphabet, which will give more visibility to profitability of the core company going forward. People wanted more transparency there, and Google is starting to provide it.
"
1285,REGN,"IBD: Let's talk about some of your interesting names, as of your latest disclosure. Do you share the concerns that some people have about Apple (AAPL)?
"
1286,REGN,"Fath: It's done well. But I've been underweight. The stock peaked around 130. It's been sort of trading sideways. I'm guarded.
"
1287,REGN,"The most constructive part is its valuation and capital structure.
"
1288,REGN,"The worry has been about the company after this iPhone cycle.
"
1289,REGN,"They've done well with iPhone. Now the issue is its replacement cycle. What we underestimated is how impactful the replacement cycle would be.
"
1290,REGN,"I remain concerned about their ability to innovate, and does that drive enough of a replacement? They've done so well. Can they grow (as fast) off this base? It's hard to drive a higher multiple.
"
1291,REGN,"We'll see where it will go. The watch doesn't look like it will be a success — or at least not move the needle enough. I do own it. I don't have it overweight.
"
1292,REGN,"IBD: Why should anyone like Facebook (FB), whose earnings per share growth has slowed a lot for two quarters?
"
1293,REGN,"Fath: They've done everything right. Right now things are in transition in mobile. As they get a big base (of users), revenue growth is slowing as they invest in new initiatives. And they want a lot of users before they turn on the monetization engine.
"
1294,REGN,"They have 300 million users on Instagram, a lot on WhatsApp. They have 1.5 billion users on Facebook. They'll monetize over time, so profit will reaccelerate.
"
1295,REGN,"IBD: What's your thesis for Facebook's Oculus, which is buying Israel's Pebbles Interfaces, which specializes in depth-sensing tools that can track hand movement?
"
1296,REGN,"Fath: Oculus is a virtual reality play. It's interesting, but not a needle mover, but it's on the come. It's a green banana. It still needs to ripen. It shows (Mark) Zuckerberg is thinking multidecades.
"
1297,REGN,"IBD: What's your Visa thesis?
"
1298,REGN,"Fath: It ties in with durability of growth because it is at the center of online payments, the movement from cash and checks to digital and disruption.
"
1299,REGN,"In the U.S., cards still use magnetic swipes, but they are moving to chips with a PIN. All cards will be reissued with chips imbedded. That makes it much harder to steal card information.

1302,REGN,"IBD: You've built your stake in Celgene (CELG) for at least four quarters. What do you like?
"
1303,REGN,"Fath: The biotechs I want to own are going after big markets.
"
1304,REGN,"Over time, Celgene has built an arsenal where they can go after multiple things. Revlimid has been an anchor to what they do. But they've acquired companies and build their own franchise.
"
1305,REGN,"Now they've got Otezla, an immunology drug, for psoriasis (and psoriatic arthritis).
"
1306,REGN,"They've also got a cancer drug, Pomalyst, and chemotherapy treatment, Abraxane (acquired through Abraxis).
"
1307,REGN,"Another drug they acquired is GD-301 for treatment of Crohn's disease. Early trials are promising.
"
1308,REGN,"There's a patent cliff ahead for Revlimid. They'll protect it as long as possible.
"
1309,REGN,"And there's their recent acquisition of Receptos, which was viewed as a pretty reasonable price relative to some other deals. It's attacked multiple indications, but the most promising appears to be in gastrointestinal (disorders like) colitis and Crohn's.
"
1310,REGN,"IBD: Why have you been trimming your stake in Gilead Sciences?
"
1311,REGN,"Fath: They're a victim of their own success. They turned what was a chronic disease into an acute disease that is treatable.
"
1312,REGN,"Their treatment for hepatitis C is a monster drug. But its cure rate is almost 100% in eight to 12 weeks. Once someone is cured, they've got to find new patients.
"
1313,REGN,"IBD: You've also pared your stake in Regeneron (REGN). What's your outlook?
"
1314,REGN,"Fath: I probably shouldn't have trimmed. They've got a good core franchise in Eylea, which is used for treating wet age-related macular degeneration in the eye. Now it's also used for diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion.
"
1315,REGN,"They've got a powerful pipeline.
"
1316,REGN,"IBD: You've pared Starbucks (SBUX). What are your concerns?

1318,REGN,"They have a lot of presence, not just in the U.S., but globally. They've introduced nice food with their purchase of La Boulange. They're driving new traffic in the afternoon and evenings. They've got a good China story. Their menu is being broadened.

Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund a year and a half ago — on Jan. 16, 2014. In that first calendar year in charge, his fund's 8.83% gain topped only 35% of its large-cap growth rival mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.This year — in which the broad market has imitated a bucking bronco — his fund has climbed 5.93% as of Aug. 31 , outperforming a whopping 96% of its peer investors.Fath is more concerned with the longer term. The broad market's rally of nearly 6-1/2 years has made it increasingly hard for him to find attractively valued growth stocks.The late-summer volatility has made it harder to find gainers.Fath, who is about to celebrate his 45th birthday, talked with IBD from his office in Baltimore about why his mutual fund is performing so much better this year than last year and about how he is searching for new market leaders.IBD: When you took charge of this fund, you cut the size of the overall portfolio and of its top 10 names. You initially trimmed to 100, down from 118, and more recently you're at 106 as of July 31. Is your initial retooling complete?Fath: I'm where I want to be. The tail end of the fund is half what it used to be. It's 10% of the fund now. The top 10 decreased a little bit. The middle is bigger.IBD: How does each segment differ?Fath: I describe my philosophy as an upside-down pyramid. The top slice is secular-growth names. That typically makes up 50% to 60% of the portfolio. Those are innovative disrupters that are the most dynamic growth companies.The middle section would be more cyclical opportunities. These would typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio. They're likely to be more opportunistic and have shorter holding periods in the fund than the average holding.The last section would be what I generally characterize as special situations. These are in three primary areas:First, stocks transitioning from value to growth.Second, companies underway in a lasting industry structural change, like what has been going on the last several years in the U.S. airline sector.Third, roll-ups, where strong management teams that are good capital allocators are applying discipline and efficiency in fragmented industries through acquisition.This bucket will typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio.The top 10 or 20 names are generally the most compelling secular ideas. The tail of my portfolio has the smallest holdings and are typically my farm team — earlier-stage growth names and private companies that I own.IBD: Give me some examples of special situations, please.Fath: Gilead Sciences (GILD) went through the value-to-growth transition when it bought Pharmasset and got into (treating) hep C in addition to its core HIV business.Airlines are in the industry structural change category, and I own American Airlines (AAL) and United Continental (UAL).Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is in the roll-up category, bringing capital allocation discipline to the pharma industry through an assertive allocation strategy.IBD: Name examples from your secular bucket, please.Fath:Amazon (AMZN) would be the poster child. Tesla (TSLA) is a bit more extreme. It's an on-the-come story. Other names include Priceline (PCLN), MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V).IBD: And name some from your cyclical bucket, please.Fath: Stuff in financials like TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Morgan Stanley (MS) to a degree, but it is also a shifting business model, looking more like a value-to-growth shift.In industrials, I hold names like FedEx (FDX), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Flowserve (FLS), an energy industrial for the most part.IBD: Why has fund performance zoomed up this year — at least until the broad sell-off?Fath: It was a drag last year when secular-growth names sold off. A lot of that was due to people wanting to see more transparency in big names. They wanted to see Amazon break out its core e-commerce business and Amazon Web Services. That company is becoming more disciplined on expenses and costs.And we're starting to see that in Google (GOOGL).This year I've taken up the health care weighting significantly. And I've taken down energy. Both moves paid off.I have a number of biotech and managed care and big-pharma names. That's played well. There's been some M&A activity in that space.IBD: So you have a bigger bet on growth this year, and that has paid off?Fath: The slowdown in growth happened prior to the sell-off in 2014.I was positioned for a cyclical recovery, but that didn't play out.

1336,REGN,"The second half of August is usually a desert for business news, but the FDA schedule is year-round. Several important drugs are up for approval decisions this month, which could provide some upside for three biotech stocks that have recently been suffering.
"
1337,REGN,"Getting the most attention will likely be Repatha, Amgen's (AMGN) cholesterol drug. It's expected to be approved by Aug. 27. Repatha is a PCSK9 inhibitor similar to Praluent, the drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) that was approved with much fanfare last month.
"
1338,REGN,"Given the resemblance between the two drugs, Repatha is widely expected to be approved. In a July 30 research note, Nomura analyst Ian Somaiya wrote that Amgen's drug will probably also get a similar label, which doesn't cover quite as many patients as some had hoped but ""should be sufficiently broad to support our $2.5 billion peak sales estimate.""
"
1339,REGN,"What will be especially interesting to investors will be the pricing dynamics that come with two drugs appearing on the market. Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) has said it hopes to start a price war between the two, similar to what happened when AbbVie (ABBV) launched a rival hepatitis C regimen to Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Harvoni late last year. Gilead has maintained dominant market share, but only by rebating near half the drug's list price.
"
1340,REGN,"""We believe rebating may drive access, as Sanofi/Regeneron and Amgen will be directly competing for formulary position,"" Somaiya wrote. ""While our $750 Repatha net price per month estimate implies a 33% discount to Praluent's gross price of $1,120, we believe competition could result in above average discounting similar to what has been seen in hepatitis C.""
"
1341,REGN,"Amgen stock hit a new high of 181.81 after its Q2 report, but has since shed about 7% in the larger biotech selloff. It retains an excellent IBD Composite Rating of 95.
"
1342,REGN,"By Aug. 18, the FDA is due to decide on a label expansion for Adcetris, the sole marketed drug from Seattle Genetics (SGEN). Adcetris, marketed by partner Takeda, is already approved for patients with Hodgkins lymphoma who've relapsed after receiving a stem-cell transplant or after two chemotherapy treatments. The current filing followed a study of patients who'd received a transplant but hadn't relapsed, and found a significant improvement in progression-free survival.
"
1343,REGN,"In a July 16 research note, RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt wrote that the chances of approval looked good since the FDA didn't convene an advisory committee before the approval date, which it normally does when it has issues with a drug.
"
1344,REGN,"""The market opportunity in the post-transplant Hodgkins lymphoma setting could take Adcetris from $200 million to $250 million (a year) to $250 million to $350 million or higher in sales potentially,"" Butt wrote.
"
1345,REGN,"Getting new indications for Adcetris is a key part of Seattle Genetics' strategy, because even though the drug launched four years ago it still hasn't made the company profitable. Adcetris is also being tested in T cell lymphoma and in the front-line setting in both kinds of lymphoma. In January, the company also announced a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) to test Bristol's hot new cancer drug Opdivo along with Adcetris in various kinds of lymphomas.
"
1346,REGN,"Seattle Genetics stock is down about 14% from its July 20 high of 52.33, but retains a good Relative Strength Rating of 89. Analysts expect it to turn profitable in 2018.
"
1347,REGN,"The FDA has an Aug. 22 deadline for deciding on Aristada, a schizophrenia drug from Alkermes (ALKS). Alkermes created the drug by taking aripiprazole, which under the brand name Abilify was a best-seller for Otsuka and Bristol-Myers before it went off patent this year, and adding its own technology that turns the dosing regimen from daily pill to a monthly injection. Since patient compliance is one of the biggest problems faced by anti-psychotic medicines, generally the less frequent dosing the better.
"
1348,REGN,"Aristada won't be alone on the long-acting psychotic market, but Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt says it could do nearly as well as Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Invega Sustenna, which also uses Alkermes technology and is therefore providing royalties.
"
1349,REGN,"""We model Aristada sales of $7 million, $91 million and $240 million in 2015-17,"" he wrote in a July 31 research note.
"
1350,REGN,"Aristada is an important component in Alkermes' strategy to return to growth. While it was a leading stock in 2012 and 2013, last year it sacrificed profit growth to invest in R&D and marketing its new drug Vivitrol, while in the most recent quarter revenue also flatlined. Analysts expect sales growth next year to rise to 21%, but profitability is not seen returning until 2017, according to Thomson Reuters.
"
1351,REGN,"Alkermes stock hit a high of 75.17 on March 5 and went on to form a cup-with-handle base, but failed to break out as it slumped along with its sector last week. It was trading near 68, down a fraction, Wednesday afternoon.

Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) has said it hopes to start a price war between the two, similar to what happened when AbbVie (ABBV) launched a rival hepatitis C regimen to Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Harvoni late last year. Gilead has maintained dominant market share, but only by rebating near half the drug's list price.""We believe rebating may drive access, as Sanofi/Regeneron and Amgen will be directly competing for formulary position,"" Somaiya wrote. ""While our $750 Repatha net price per month estimate implies a 33% discount to Praluent's gross price of $1,120, we believe competition could result in above average discounting similar to what has been seen in hepatitis C.""Amgen stock hit a new high of 181.81 after its Q2 report, but has since shed about 7% in the larger biotech selloff. It retains an excellent IBD Composite Rating of 95.By Aug. 18, the FDA is due to decide on a label expansion for Adcetris, the sole marketed drug from Seattle Genetics (SGEN). Adcetris, marketed by partner Takeda, is already approved for patients with Hodgkins lymphoma who've relapsed after receiving a stem-cell transplant or after two chemotherapy treatments. The current filing followed a study of patients who'd received a transplant but hadn't relapsed, and found a significant improvement in progression-free survival.In a July 16 research note, RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt wrote that the chances of approval looked good since the FDA didn't convene an advisory committee before the approval date, which it normally does when it has issues with a drug.""The market opportunity in the post-transplant Hodgkins lymphoma setting could take Adcetris from $200 million to $250 million (a year) to $250 million to $350 million or higher in sales potentially,"" Butt wrote.Getting new indications for Adcetris is a key part of Seattle Genetics' strategy, because even though the drug launched four years ago it still hasn't made the company profitable. Adcetris is also being tested in T cell lymphoma and in the front-line setting in both kinds of lymphoma. In January, the company also announced a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) to test Bristol's hot new cancer drug Opdivo along with Adcetris in various kinds of lymphomas.Seattle Genetics stock is down about 14% from its July 20 high of 52.33, but retains a good Relative Strength Rating of 89. Analysts expect it to turn profitable in 2018.The FDA has an Aug. 22 deadline for deciding on Aristada, a schizophrenia drug from Alkermes (ALKS). Alkermes created the drug by taking aripiprazole, which under the brand name Abilify was a best-seller for Otsuka and Bristol-Myers before it went off patent this year, and adding its own technology that turns the dosing regimen from daily pill to a monthly injection. Since patient compliance is one of the biggest problems faced by anti-psychotic medicines, generally the less frequent dosing the better.Aristada won't be alone on the long-acting psychotic market, but Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt says it could do nearly as well as Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Invega Sustenna, which also uses Alkermes technology and is therefore providing royalties.""We model Aristada sales of $7 million, $91 million and $240 million in 2015-17,"" he wrote in a July 31 research note.Aristada is an important component in Alkermes' strategy to return to growth. While it was a leading stock in 2012 and 2013, last year it sacrificed profit growth to invest in R&D and marketing its new drug Vivitrol, while in the most recent quarter revenue also flatlined. Analysts expect sales growth next year to rise to 21%, but profitability is not seen returning until 2017, according to Thomson Reuters.Alkermes stock hit a high of 75.17 on March 5 and went on to form a cup-with-handle base, but failed to break out as it slumped along with its sector last week. It was trading near 68, down a fraction, Wednesday afternoon.Connect with Amy Reeves: @IBD_Areeves and Facebook.

1353,REGN,"We're in the middle of another big week for earnings, with a slew of medical-related companies among those reporting.Regeneron (REGN) hit a new high in the stock market today after issuing better-than-expected Q2 earnings. The biotech also raised its growth forecast for its blockbuster Eylea drug.Shares gapped up 6% in big volume, hitting a fresh high and clearing the 600 price level for the first time intraday. Regeneron is now extended from a 544.10 buy point from a late-stage flat base, initially cleared on July 14.The stock has been on a big run, gaining 44% so far this year.Medical device maker Abiomed (ABMD) is also now extended from a buy area, surging 15.5% in giant volume and entering new high ground. The stock is up more than 130% in 2015.Abiomed crushed Q2 earnings and sales estimates on Tuesday, and the company raised its full-year guidance above Wall Street views.Meanwhile, generic-drug maker Mallinckrodt (MNK) dropped 10.4% in fast trade after missing revenue estimates. The move has the stock undercutting the prior low of a price consolidation base and below its 200-day line for the first time.And Biogen (BIIB) rose 2.7% in quick turnover as it tries to recover from its post-earnings gap-down late last month. The biotech's shares are trading about 30% below their March 20 high.Follow Alissa Williams on Twitter: @IBD_AWilliams.

1354,REGN,"The major index ETFs downshifted further Monday, as China and the Federal Reserve have continued to weigh on the stock market. On the last trading day of August, exchange traded funds tracking the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq 100 posted their largest monthly losses since 2012. Last week, turbulence in the stock market whipsawed investors even as it intensified worries about a global slowdown and raised doubts about the wisdom of a Fed rate hike next month.SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) slipped 0.7% on the stock market today.The ETF holds 30 blue-chip industrial leaders.Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE) and IBD Leaderboard stock Visa (V) were among DIA's lead decliners.No. 1 holding Goldman Sachs (GS) and Intel (INTC) were among only six stocks in DIA that advanced.DIA pegged a 6% decline for August, its worst monthly loss in 3 years.So did SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad market, and PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks in the Nasdaq Composite Index.SPY fell 0.9% Monday, with every sector besides energy in the red. QQQ gave up 1.2%.Among QQQ's top 25 holdings, biotech stocks Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) were among the hardest hit at Monday's close. They lost 2% to 4% each.IShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) took a 3.2% hit and Market Vectors Biotechnology (BBH) 3.3%, the worst among sector- and industry-focused ETFs.The so-called ""death cross"" on SPY's daily chart is its first appearance in four years. The pattern occurs when a short-term moving average, like the 10-week moving average, slips below a long-term line like the 40-week moving average. It's seen as a bearish signal, warning of loss of momentum and more losses ahead.According to market watchers interviewed by CNBC, crosses on the daily chart may be less relevant than longer-term crosses.It may be more worrisome, therefore, that the weekly charts for SPY and DIA also show this pattern.Here's a look at how benchmark exchange traded funds tracking various asset classes are performing today.Following daily ETF market action can be key to successful investing:10 Bellwether ETFs: SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), +0.1%, RS 54 IShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG), -0.1%, RS 70 PowerShares DB US$ Bullish (UUP), -0.2%, RS 80 Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), -0.2%, RS 25 IShares Russell 2000 (IWM), -0.4%, RS 61 SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), -0.7%, RS 51 IShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH), -0.7%, RS 61 IShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), -0.8%, RS 47 SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), -0.9%, RS 61 PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), -1.2%, RS 70Follow Aparna Narayanan on Twitter: @IBD_ANarayanan.

1376,REGN,"Special Report: Best Mutual Funds 2015, January Performance Report
"
1377,REGN,"The ""January effect"" eluded mutual fund investors as violent price swings rocked the market last month.
"
1378,REGN,"U.S. diversified stock mutual funds lost 2.6% on average, according to Lipper Inc. data. They were buffeted by several crosscurrents: Tumbling oil prices benefited consumers but brought on worries of deflation. Positive news on corporate activity battled with worries over wage growth.
"
1379,REGN,"Then, in the final week of January, stocks sold off hard after a decidedly mixed earnings season.
"
1380,REGN,"Large-cap multinationals such as Procter & Gamble (PG) and Microsoft (MSFT) are starting to hurt from a stronger dollar that can curb U.S. exports and corporate profits.
"
1381,REGN,"As a result, the broad stock market ended the month 3.1% below where it started. ""We're starting the year in a very interesting way,"" said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer of equities for Charles Schwab Investment Management. ""Volatility seems to be picking up, and dispersion among sectors and styles seems to be picking up as well.""
"
1382,REGN,"Precious metal commodity funds grew 5.4% last month, while energy commodities funds sank 7.4%. Precious metal equities soared 13.4% — outperforming other sector funds.
"
1383,REGN,"Lower oil prices continue to weigh down on mutual funds holding energy commodities and equities, Aguilar says.
"
1384,REGN,"Meanwhile, gold's rebound from last year's lows helped funds holding precious metal commodities and equities. That bounce-back resulted from the Swiss decision to break the franc's peg to the euro, as well as general investor anxiety about higher volatility, says David Chalupnik, head of equities at Nuveen Asset Management.
"
1385,REGN,"""If you can't hold central bank currency without feeling you have a lot of risk, then you move into precious metals,"" Chalupnik said.
"
1386,REGN,"Growth edged out value across the board in January. For example, large-cap growth slipped 1.7%. Their value counterparts gave up 4.2%. That suggests the market already is recognizing stocks that beat their earnings estimates and have positive growth outlook, Aguilar says.

1387,REGN,"Health Care And Tech Stocks
"
1388,REGN,"Health care and technology — two sectors strongly represented in growth funds — have posted strong earnings and are poised for double-digit growth.

1389,REGN,"Tocqueville Opportunity , a midcap growth fund, posted a 0.83% increase in January vs. an average 1.9% decline for its peers. It allocates 33.8% of $77.9 million in assets to health care and 20.9% to technology. Top 10 holdings include Regeneron (REGN) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW). For a full list of six-month leaders, see the accompanying table.

""The backdrop for the S&P 500 tells us the U.S. market should be up midsingle digit this year,"" he added. ""Honestly, being slightly positive in a very volatile market is good.""
"
1395,REGN,"Domestic and global real estate funds were a bright spot in January, advancing 5.6% and 4%, respectively. They benefited from a drop in interest rates at home and abroad, Chalupnik says. The yield on the 10-year Treasury — highly correlated to 30-year mortgage rates — fell 49 basis points to 1.68%.

"
1398,REGN,"Latin American funds sank 6.3%. Even the region's better economies such as Mexico are suffering due to their sensitivity to energy prices, Chalupnik says. ""They need higher commodity prices and they need better global growth,"" he added.

Higher quality, dividend-paying stocks may also offer opportunities, as well as small caps that are more leveraged to the U.S. economy, which is ""the best out there.""
"
1402,REGN,"In a contrarian stance, Chalupnik favors the outlook for value funds. ""Oil prices will bottom"" moving through 2015, he said, which will drive up energy stocks. And Fed rate hikes, set to rise later this year, should help the margins of financial firms.

He wrote that at this point it's impossible to model the impact of new biosimilar competition to Amgen's flagship neutropenia drugs.""We think that uncertainty creates a waiting game that may limit upside potential in the stock this year,"" Roden wrote.Roden also maintained his ratings but lowered his price targets on a number of other biotechs, including Puma Biotechnology (PBYI), which he priced at 235 vs. his previous 300 in the wake of disappointing data on its breast-cancer drug last month.None of this seemed to hurt the stocks much on a morning when the market was rallying after a couple of bad days. In early trading in the stock market today, shares of Regeneron were down just a fraction and Amgen stock was up a fraction. And Puma stock was up more than 2%, near 111.Regeneron is No. 25 in the latest IBD 50 ranking of top-performing stocks and, trading near 506 early Thursday, is within 4% of its 486.10 buy point touched on May 11. Regeneron stock touched its record high of 544 on June 8.On the positive side, Roden raised his price target on Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) to 160 from 145 in the wake of the approval and pricing of Orkambi, Vertex's potential blockbuster cystic-fibrosis drug.""Despite conservative patient numbers that are at or below U.S./outside U.S. consensus, we come out with above-consensus revenue figures that in our view command a higher net present value,"" he wrote. ""We also believe we'd previously underestimated gross margins, which together with higher revenues drives greater earnings power than our prior forecasts, to over $11 in EPS by 2018.""Roden also raised his price target on Gilead Sciences (GILD) to 155 from 94, noting that ""numbers are still going up, and Gilead is talking like they'll do a (buyout) deal this year.""Vertex and Gilead stocks were up a fraction in early trading Thursday.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

"
1716,REGN,"The company did not issue new guidance, as it had already raised its forecast two weeks earlier when it announced a hostile bid for Allergan. At that time, Valeant guided full-year sales in the range of $8.3 billion to $8.7 billion, up from $5.8 billion last year, with EPS of $8.55 to $8.80 vs. $6.24.
"
1717,REGN,"The quarter's growth generally came from acquisitions, especially the buyout of contact-lens giant Bausch & Lomb last August. Organic sales growth was only 1%, as Valeant faced generic competition to some of its leading products, including skin cream Retin-A Micro and herpes ointment Zovirax. However, management expects growth to pick up over the course of the year after the launches of new products.
"
1718,REGN,"Bausch & Lomb outperformed the rest of the business by clocking 11% organic growth, without any significant new product launches. Valeant now expects some $900 million in synergies from the merger. Valeant CEO J.

"
1720,REGN,"At the same time, Pearson said he didn't touch the Bausch sales force, likely acting on a lesson learned the hard way after Valeant bought out Medicis in 2012 and attempted to overhaul its sales staff, resulting in high turnover last year. Pearson said the stabilization of that situation has helped boost the North American dermatology business this year.

That number was down a nickel from the year-earlier quarter (when Mallinckrodt was still part of Covidien (COV), but it beat analysts' consensus by 18 cents. Sales shrank 5% to $557.8 million, about $8 million short of estimates. Mallinckrodt guided revenue in-line and EPS above consensus, however, which probably accounted for the company's stock rising 3% in early trading.
"
1723,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) defied the pattern this season and actually beat sales estimates, reporting 42% growth to $625.7 million, more than $16 million above consensus. U.S. sales of its lead drug Eylea missed expectations.

1727,REGN,"Three big pharmas reported light-to-mixed Q1 earnings Tuesday, but their shares went in different directions in the stock market today as Wall Street seemed to focus on different details of the reports.
"
1728,REGN,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) said Q1 earnings rose 12% over the year-earlier quarter to 46 cents a share, beating analysts' consensus by 3 cents. Sales, however, fell 1% to $3.8 billion, missing consensus of $3.9 billion. Bristol added a nickel to the low end of its previous 2014 EPS guidance range, now $1.65-$1.80, but the midpoint is below analysts' $1.78. Sales guidance of $15.2 billion to $15.8 billion was squarely in line with consensus. Both represent modest declines from last year.
"
1729,REGN,"HIV drugs Sustiva and Reyataz were largely responsible for the Q1 miss, along with rheumatoid-arthritis drug Orencia. On the other hand, stroke preventer Eliquis finally seemed to be finding its legs after a disappointing launch last year, with sales of $106 million beating views by $12 million. Diabetes also outperformed, but Bristol sold that business in February to AstraZeneca (AZN), though it's still collecting royalties.
"
1730,REGN,"Bristol also announced it's begun a rolling FDA submission process for its PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab in squamous nonsmall-cell lung cancer, based on a study it expects to complete by year-end. Nivolumab performed well against this disease in a phase one trial, which presents a significant opportunity because the prognosis for squamous patients today is poor. Bristol said it will report phase two results at a meeting in October.

Its profit climbed 3.5% over the year-earlier quarter to 88 cents a share, beating estimates by 9 cents. Sales shrank 4% to $10.26 billion, missing consensus of $10.44 billion. Merck affirmed its previous guidance, which calls for EPS of $3.35-$3.53 and sales of $42.4 billion to $43.2 billion.

1741,REGN,"Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.Three big pharmas reported light-to-mixed Q1 earnings Tuesday, but their shares went in different directions in the stock market today as Wall Street seemed to focus on different details of the reports.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) said Q1 earnings rose 12% over the year-earlier quarter to 46 cents a share, beating analysts' consensus by 3 cents. Sales, however, fell 1% to $3.8 billion, missing consensus of $3.9 billion. Bristol added a nickel to the low end of its previous 2014 EPS guidance range, now $1.65-$1.80, but the midpoint is below analysts' $1.78. Sales guidance of $15.2 billion to $15.8 billion was squarely in line with consensus. Both represent modest declines from last year.HIV drugs Sustiva and Reyataz were largely responsible for the Q1 miss, along with rheumatoid-arthritis drug Orencia. On the other hand, stroke preventer Eliquis finally seemed to be finding its legs after a disappointing launch last year, with sales of $106 million beating views by $12 million. Diabetes also outperformed, but Bristol sold that business in February to AstraZeneca (AZN), though it's still collecting royalties.Bristol also announced it's begun a rolling FDA submission process for its PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab in squamous nonsmall-cell lung cancer, based on a study it expects to complete by year-end. Nivolumab performed well against this disease in a phase one trial, which presents a significant opportunity because the prognosis for squamous patients today is poor. Bristol said it will report phase two results at a meeting in October.The company also acquired privately held biotech iPierian, which develops treatments for a class of neurogenerative diseases called Tauopathies.Bristol stock was down 3% in midday trading, near 49.Merck (MRK) reported a similarly mixed quarter, though the Street was more impressed as the stock was up 3%. Its profit climbed 3.5% over the year-earlier quarter to 88 cents a share, beating estimates by 9 cents. Sales shrank 4% to $10.26 billion, missing consensus of $10.44 billion. Merck affirmed its previous guidance, which calls for EPS of $3.35-$3.53 and sales of $42.4 billion to $43.2 billion.For ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum, the most interesting thing about the results was that beleaguered diabetes drug Januvia beat expectations.""We can't quantify the price impact at this point, but would note that ANY favorable (year-over-year) price impact is good news for MRK, as the DPP-4 category was plagued by new and aggressive price competition in 2013,"" he wrote in an email to clients.Merck said it would leave pipeline updates till a business-review meeting next week.

1742,REGN,"CEO Leonard Schleifer makes sure that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is all about the study of drugs.That wide view of science has worked wonders the past three decades for Regeneron (REGN).But the philosophy sparked contention early in the biotech firm's publicly traded life.Its board and advisers debated whether Schleifer's long-range building toward a blockbuster drug would drag on too long.Those officials wanted Regeneron to focus strictly on one opportunity and get a magic drug to market as soon as possible.Schleifer, who had founded the company in 1988, said no. He knew that his overall pharmacology approach would pay off.And it has. Regeneron's 2013 sales hit $2.1 billion. And since the company's IPO in April 1991, the stock is up about 1,300%.The stock turned even healthier Wednesday, with shares leaping 6% after the Food and Drug Administration approved its flagship drug Eylea to treat diabetic macular edema (DME), a leading cause of blindness.Eylea was initially approved in November 2011 to treat age-related wet macular degeneration. Now it's in the thick of a DME market that's potentially lucrative for Regeneron due to the global diabetes epidemic.Enlightened Path""Our formula is surprisingly easy to articulate but difficult to emulate,"" Schleifer told IBD. ""We set out to have the world's best science and follow that science. That's what we've done for the past 25 years.""Schleifer, 62, started on his path to pharmaceutical success while growing up in Queens, N.Y.He went to Forest Hills High School where he was captain of the tennis team. He was also a junior New York state chess champion.Schleifer got his work ethic from his father, a Depression-era sweater maker born to poor immigrants in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. ""His advice was that I should get as well-educated as possible, because he believed that education was the weapon to fight the world with,"" the son recalls.Schleifer honed that weapon by attending his dad's alma mater, Cornell University. To save his family money, Len finished in three years. He earned a bachelor's degree in neurobiology and behavior, graduating summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1973.Schleifer then went to the University of Virginia for doctorates in medicine and pharmacology.While at UVA, Schleifer studied under Alfred Gilman, who would share the 1994 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine with Martin Rodbell. Schleifer watched Gilman do the research that led to his Nobel Prize, calling it ""enormously inspiring.""After being trained as a scientist and clinician, Schleifer returned to the Cornell system to work as a neurologist and junior faculty member at Cornell's New York Hospital.It was there that he became fascinated with the biotech revolution — while reading stacks of paper from Genentech, an industry leader before folding into Roche in 2009. ""I was trained as a biochemist, but I had an interest in molecular biology,"" Schleifer said.Genentech was a pioneer in DNA technology, but as Schleifer pondered going into business on his own, he aimed for another path: diseases of the nervous system.The business would be Regeneron Pharmaceuticals — named for regenerating nerve cells — with headquarters in Tarrytown, just north of New York City.With help from Gilman, Schleifer contacted top minds in the biotech field to lead him to the right people for Regeneron's 1988 start.Two early mentors were Roy Vagelos and George Yancopoulos.Roy Vagelos has held the chairmanship at Regeneron since 1995. He came over from Merck (MRK), where he was one of the greatest CEOs in American history, according to Schleifer.Yancopoulos is Regeneron's chief scientific officer.Schleifer recruited him in 1989 from Columbia University, where Yancopoulos led research in molecular immunology — and now is a star. Yancopoulos is the principal inventor of Eylea and most of the drugs in Regeneron's pipeline.Schleifer lauds him: ""He's one of the greatest scientists and entrepreneurs of his generation.""Joining Regeneron wasn't a hard decision for Yancopoulos. ""I really believed in Len and what he was trying to do,"" he said. ""I knew he was doing it for the right reasons.""Such talent around Schleifer is a key to Regeneron's drug and revenue generation.""We decided to build a company where we not only valued the science but also the scientists who did the science,"" Schleifer said.He likes to point out that he works for Yancopoulos, not the other way around.Tough StartThe early going for Regeneron was filled with adversity. The firm developed a protein in the early 1990s to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis — Lou Gehrig's disease — but patients lost too much weight as a side effect. The company halted trials in 1993.Then Regeneron's obesity drug never made it past the FDA. ""Failure in our business is just part and parcel, but it never really changed our view that we were on the right track,"" Schleifer said. ""Great successes in life come from failure.""Regeneron's first approved drug was Arcalyst in 2008. The drug, to treat a rare genetic disease, was widely considered a success inside the walls of Regeneron.But analysts weren't impressed with a drug that cost about $200 million to develop and wasn't contributing meaningfully to the bottom line.Arcalyst did just $3 million in sales in the first quarter, but the science behind the drug has been critical to further drug development at Regeneron. ""Wall Street missed the whole point,"" Yancopoulos said. ""We were building a company with an infrastructure, technologies and capabilities to not only innovate once but repeat it over and over again with new drugs in new therapeutic areas.""Opening The WayPipeline prospects are bright for alirocumab, an antibody for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, called bad cholesterol because it collects in the walls of blood vessels, causing blockages.On Wednesday, Regeneron and partner Sanofi (SNY) reported positive phase three results for alirocumab.Phase three trials for Regeneron's rheumatoid arthritis drug sarilumab are showing progress.Then there's dupilumab, in clinical trials for asthma and other diseases. Along with that late-stage production is Regeneron's early-stage pipeline, growing with 15 antibodies in the company's labs.""We have what some consider to be the most enviable pipeline in the industry, and it's all home-grown,"" Yancopoulos said.Meanwhile, Regeneron has stayed with Sanofi. The French firm recently raised its stake in Regeneron to 22.5% from 20.5%. Sanofi has the right to own to up to 30% of Schleifer's company.Regeneron also recently embarked on a research and development initiative with Avalanche Biotechnologies (AAVL) to develop next-generation gene therapy products in ophthalmology, a branch of medicine concerned with treating disorders of the eye.In its initial public offering Thursday, Avalanche went the opposite direction of what its name implies, gushing 60% in early trade.What about buying another company? ""Acquisitions don't give us a competitive advantage,"" Schleifer said. ""Our competitive advantage is our science.""Yancopoulos also weighed in on acquisitions, using a sports metaphor: ""A baseball team that spends a lot of money on an older free agent doesn't have a farm system. We believe in building internally using our farm system. We're producing prize prospects left and right.""On the personal side, Schleifer will celebrate 40 years of marriage with his wife, Harriet, in December. They live in New York and have two sons. He said that when it comes to recreation, he's into golf, chess and ""an occasional poker game with good friends.""Persistence has paid off for the CEO, and other personality traits have also helped.""I have an exaggerated sense of fairness that has allowed me to value the true value creators in a company like Regeneron,"" he said. ""This, combined with my overall optimistic nature, has allowed me to stay true to my conviction that talent at Regeneron will succeed over the long haul.""

1861,REGN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) rebounded more than 6% in afternoon trading on the stock market today when development partner Sanofi (SNY) said in a U.S. regulatory filing that it will raise its stake from 20.44% to 22.5%.The French drug giant's move comes after Regeneron superstar Eylea, a treatment for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), received a European Medicines Agency endorsement on Friday to expand its use to other types of vision loss.The two companies, partners on several other experimental drugs including cholesterol medications, have an agreement that permits Sanofi to control up to 30% of Regeneron.Regeneron rose 6.4% to 300.51 intraday, moving back above its 50- and 200-day moving averages. The stock has struggled in recent weeks amid analyst concerns that Medicare and Medicaid could mandate the use of Roche's Avastin over Eylea due to concerns over payment costs.Sanofi shares rose 0.4% to 53.38 intraday.

1894,REGN,"In recent decades, high cholesterol has been Big Pharma's gravy train. The statins, oral drugs that lower ""bad"" cholesterol, turned into the best-selling drugs in history, with Pfizer's Lipitor peaking at nearly $14 billion in 2006 sales.
"
1895,REGN,"Now, however, all the statins have gone off-patent or are about to. So Pfizer (PFE) and a passel of other companies — led by Amgen (AMGN), Regeneron (REGN) and Regeneron's partner Sanofi (SNY) — are turning to a new class of cholesterol busters called PCSK9 inhibitors.
"
1896,REGN,"At the American Cardiology Conference (ACC) in Washington, D.C., Saturday through Monday, investors will get a chance to see how the new drugs are doing in clinical trials.
"
1897,REGN,"PCSK9 is short for proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, an enzyme that binds to the liver's receptors of LDL, or bad, cholesterol and targets them for degredation. By blocking PCSK9, the companies aim to boost the liver's ability to eliminate LDL cholesterol from the blood, and thus reduce the chance of heart disease.
"
1898,REGN,"All the PCSK9 inhibitors in mid- or late-stage testing are monoclonal antibodies, a biotechnology that's already been used for best-selling cancer and immunology drugs.
"
1899,REGN,"Monthly Injections
"
1900,REGN,"All of the drugs also have to be injected once or twice a month, which makes them somewhat more unpleasant to take than statins. Partly for that reason, drugmakers are gunning for subgroups of high-cholesterol sufferers for whom statins aren't adequate.
"
1901,REGN,"""The majority of patients in our program are treated with statins, normally at the highest tolerable dose,"" said Jay Edelberg, head of Sanofi's PCSK9 development and launch unit. ""These are primarily the patients who are familial hypercholesterolemics — the genetic disorder — or those who've either had a (cardiovascular) event or are diabetics and are at high risk for cardiovascular disease.
"
1902,REGN,"""Then there are the patients who can't tolerate the statins.""
"
1903,REGN,"Morningstar analyst Stefan Quenneville estimates those descriptions cover about 4.4 million people in the U.S., and he expects that will grow by another million by 2022. A roughly equivalent number of potential patients also live abroad, he estimates.
"
1904,REGN,"Regeneron's and Sanofi's drug alirocumab will take the most stage time at the ACC meeting, with presentations detailing data from five of the 14 clinical trials being conducted on the product. These include studies of patients with genetic high cholesterol, patients who are taking Merck's (MRK) Zetia or AbbVie's (ABBV) Tricor and those who aren't, as well as a comparison of patients on Zetia alone vs. those on alirocumab alone.
"
1905,REGN,"The companies expect to file for approval of alirocumab in early 2015. So does Amgen, which is also conducting 14 different late-stage clinical trials of its candidate evolocumab.
"
1906,REGN,"Amgen will be giving five presentations on evolocumab, comparing it with Zetia and with statins, as well as its effectiveness in statin-intolerant subjects and in patients with one kind of genetic hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous). On March 17, it reported that a study of homozygous patients had met its endpoints, but didn't say when or where further details would be revealed.
"
1907,REGN,"Pfizer is a bit behind Regeneron and Amgen with its bococizumab, since it just launched a phase three program in October. It's scheduled to present a dose-ranging study of patients on statins at ACC.
"
1908,REGN,"Analysts have been pleased with the trial results of these drugs so far, but they haven't converged around a favorite the way they did during the recent hepatitis C race, for instance. That's because there hasn't been much in the data to differentiate one from the other, says Quenneville.
"
1909,REGN,"Looking At Safety Issues
"
1910,REGN,"""I think any of the trials (presented at ACC) are going to be interesting, because at this point the drugs have been pretty similar,"" Quenneville told IBD. ""What I'm looking for, more than differences in efficacy, is anything to do with safety.
"
1911,REGN,"""I think that's going to be the major concern — if some safety signal appears that we didn't see in smaller trials. That could waylay specific drugs, or even the entire class of drugs.""
"
1912,REGN,"The safety of the PCSK9s came under particular scrutiny earlier this month, when word got around Twitter that the Food and Drug Administration ""has become aware of neurocognitive adverse events in the PCSK9 inhibitor class"" and had asked Sanofi and Regeneron to ""make an assessment of potential neurocognitive adverse events across the global development program for alirocumab, especially in the longer-term studies,"" according to Sanofi's annual report.
"
1913,REGN,"As it turned out, the other PCSK9 players had gotten the same letter. All denied they had found any significant safety issues.
"
1914,REGN,"Analysts, however, seem to have settled on evolocumab as the culprit, since a 409-member cohort in its Osler trial included four people who reported memory impairment, and one with amnesia.
"
1915,REGN,"ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum, however, points out that most of these patients were also on statins, and memory loss has been connected with statins, so it's not clear if evolocumab was to blame.
"
1916,REGN,"If safety turns out to be no problem, Quenneville estimates PCSK9 drugs could collectively sell more than $7 billion in 2022. He assumes that alirocumab and evolocumab will split most of the market due to being first out. But he says Pfizer might yet have something up its sleeve.
"
1917,REGN,"""Pfizer has implied in one conference call that they had a more potent (PCSK9), and in their phase two they discontinued (some patients) because some people had dramatic lowering,"" he said.

"
2002,REGN,"Lead manager Matthew Kamm works the market like it's a garden with variety. He treats his young sprouts differently from his mature produce, and both of those differently from crops he's ready to reap.
"
2003,REGN,"This approach is working. It has made his $9.7 billion Artisan Mid Cap Fund a top performer among the largest diversified U.S. stock portfolios.
"
2004,REGN,"In the 12 months ended Jan. 31, its 31.18% return topped 91% of its midcap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its 16.94% average annual gain in the past three years topped 92% of its rivals.
"
2005,REGN,"Kamm, 40 years old, discussed his investment course with IBD from his office in Milwaukee.
"
2006,REGN,"IBD: In addition to Mid Cap, you run $906 million Artisan Global Opportunities and $1.7 billion Small Cap . How does managing different cap-size and style funds help you?
"
2007,REGN,"Kamm: Our team includes a group of analysts and five portfolio managers who work collaboratively to identify best ideas. We've been at this over 15 years. That level of tenure and trust is important.
"
2008,REGN,"We look up and down the market-cap scale and globally. That gives us broad perspective. We like to think we're better midcap investors because we know small-cap competitors and international emerging markets competitors that U.S. midcap companies increasingly face.
"
2009,REGN,"IBD: You divide your portfolio into three types of stocks. What's the advantage?
"
2010,REGN,"Kamm: The nomenclature we use is garden, crop and harvest.
"
2011,REGN,"Garden stocks are ones we believe are just emerging. We try to be early into them. We guard against risk by keeping garden positions small.
"
2012,REGN,"When a garden position turns out right and profit growth plays out, we allocate more into it and push it into our crop bucket or portfolio. Those are our largest positions and fewest positions. That's where we feel the profit cycle has been largely de-risked.
"
2013,REGN,"The third area is harvest, where we reduce positions.
"
2014,REGN,"IBD: How are you tweaking new buys to cope with the expected slow-growth economy?
"
2015,REGN,"Kamm: We've been focused on uniquely positioned franchises that are exposed to some strong growth trends. You see some signs, especially in the U.S., that the economy is getting better. Housing and jobs are examples. But emerging markets are struggling to grow at the same rates they experienced a few years ago.
"
2016,REGN,"We're focused on durable, high-quality franchises. We're less interested in high-commodity businesses and materials. And those business models are very cyclical, economy sensitive, but tend not to meet our franchise characteristics criteria.
"
2017,REGN,"IBD: What are some real-world examples, please, as of your latest disclosure?
"
2018,REGN,"Kamm: We're focused on innovation in health care. We're 10 years past the first sequencing of the human genome. Now we're seeing benefits in novel drug targets.
"
2019,REGN,"Regeneron (REGN) is an example. They have a drug called Eylea, which is a retinal drug for age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness for the elderly. It was launched in 2011. In its second full year it sold $1.4 billion. It's a strong driver of company sales and profits.
"
2020,REGN,"Regeneron also has a diverse pipeline of additional opportunities to extend its profit cycle into the future.
"
2021,REGN,"They were all discovered in Regeneron's own labs, but primarily funded by Sanofi, a large French drug company, in return for the ability to market these drugs and share profits.
"
2022,REGN,"IBD: Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) recently gapped up after reporting strong results and guidance. Its 30% earnings per share growth was the second straight quarterly acceleration. What's your thesis?
"
2023,REGN,"Kamm: We think they're positioned for growth. They have a very strong brand associated with high-quality ingredients. They have a significant opportunity to grow their footprint of restaurants in the U.S., and ultimately internationally.
"
2024,REGN,"They're executing well. They're getting customers through serving lines quicker. They've enhanced menus. They're offering office catering. They're able to drive solid same-store comps year-over-year and make restaurants more profitable through higher volumes.
"
2025,REGN,"They've resisted increasing prices to the same extent that a lot of restaurants have. Instead, they're driving growth through higher volume and traffic.
"
2026,REGN,"IBD: Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) has had a great run and just gapped up the other day. What makes you think it still has room to run?
"
2027,REGN,"Kamm: It fits our innovation theme. Their sales and profits are driven by Solaris, a biologic drug that's approved for two ultrarare, very serious diseases, not just in the U.S. but globally.
"
2028,REGN,"They still have room to run because both uses of Solaris still have a lot of growth ahead of them. There's still a lot of opportunity to reach more patients.
"
2029,REGN,"Solaris is also being tested for three or four additional ultrarare diseases, where early clinical data are encouraging. In three or four years, there will be additional (treatment) approvals for Solaris.
"
2030,REGN,"They also have asfotase alpha (which targets certain bone diseases and tooth losses), which is expected to be approved later this year.
"
2031,REGN,"IBD: Is broker-dealer LPL Financial (LPLA) a play on a growing economy?
"
2032,REGN,"Kamm: They're the largest independent broker-dealer in the country. They've grown by attracting financial advisers away from big banks and wire houses, giving them independence to grow their practices in ways they see fit, and letting them keep a larger percent of their profits.
"
2033,REGN,"They continue to gain market share, and we like market-share gainers. We like companies that can outgrow the market in a sustainable way.
"
2034,REGN,"Also, LPL captures some of the float on cash balances that customers keep with them. (Float refers to earnings on cash between the time a customer authorizes disbursement and when the cash actually leaves the account.) While rates were low, there was not so much float to capture. But if rates rise as the economy improves, then LPL earnings will accelerate.
"
2035,REGN,"IBD: Where's the innovation in a stock like athletic wear seller Under Armour (UA)?
"
2036,REGN,"Kamm: The innovation is in new materials that deliver better performance, whether sweat-wicking or shielding athletes from heat or cold. Companies like Under Armour and Nike (NKE) and Adidas have been able to grow by innovating product lines and driving increased value to customers.
"
2037,REGN,"Under Armour has a great brand with athletes, especially young athletes, who are inclined to spend more. They're expanding into other categories, such as footwear via cleats. And that's translating into more traditional ware like running shoes.
"
2038,REGN,"They've been mostly a U.S. brand, but they're extending their brand internationally and driving additional growth outside the U.S. So we think they still have a long runway. They're in our bucket category.
"
2039,REGN,"IBD: Am I right in thinking you like Illumina's (ILMN) genomic sequencing advances?
"
2040,REGN,"Kamm: Gene sequencing is a transformational technology. In 2007 they launched a next-generation sequencing platform. Cost of sequencing began to fall, leading to big growth in the market. They launched (on Jan. 14) another new product (the HiSeq X Ten) that delivers the first $1,000 genome, a target that researchers have been fixed on for five or six years.
"
2041,REGN,"So they're the center of action in human genetic research and have significant growth opportunities as they make these tools even more affordable.
"
2042,REGN,"IBD: TripAdvisor (TRIP) has pulled back from its Nov. 15 high. And earnings per share fell in the most recent quarter. Why aren't you concerned?
"
2043,REGN,"Kamm: They're the leading review site for hotels and other travel destinations globally. They've moved toward a bidding model, where companies bid for placement on a TripAdvisor site. It's almost like bidding for Google (GOOG) search terms. Earnings have declined during this process because it is a transition. They're foregoing some older advertising measures as they move customers to the new bidding system. Until this new system starts to mature, their profits are lower.
"
2044,REGN,"This was expected. That's why it's a garden investment. It will move up as they get through the transitional period.
"
2045,REGN,"IBD: Cepheid (CPHD) has uptrended since June. Why has it shown so much volatility in quarterly earnings?
"
2046,REGN,"Kamm: This is a crop position. They make diagnostic systems that let hospitals easily identify molecular markers of disease in patients. That used to be a complex, time-consuming process that required highly trained staff. Cepheid made GeneXpert, which automated it. You put a blood sample into a plastic cartridge, which goes into the instrument, and you get the answer. So more hospitals can do molecular testing.
"
2047,REGN,"The company ran into manufacturing challenges, which hurt earnings. Over (the past year) they've addressed those issues, exited 2013 in a better place in terms of inventory and ability to provide test cartridges to customers. And they have a broad pipeline of new tests that they've brought to market. Now they have to leverage their new systems to do a broader range of tests.
"
2048,REGN,"IBD: Is Fortune Brands (FBHS) a play on the housing rebound?
"
2049,REGN,"Kamm: They're a leading housing-products company, and this is a crop position.
"
2050,REGN,"They have a leading position in fixtures for kitchens and bathrooms, cabinets, faucets and locks in what tend to be attractive segments. It became clear last year that the U.S. housing market was coming out of the depths of the downturn. Fortune has been gaining share in key markets. That's delivering strong margin expansion, and margins are still below the peaks of the last housing cycle, so it's reasonable to assume that margins can continue to rise.
"
2051,REGN,"IBD: The rate of growth of LinkedIn's (LNKD) earnings per share have declined for two quarters. You've added to your stake in several recent disclosures. What's your game plan?
"
2052,REGN,"Kamm: LinkedIn has transformed the recruiting and hiring market. The main advantage is that people update their resumes and profiles even when they're not actively looking for a job. People who are hiring can access a rich database of not just job-seekers but also of people who would be open to the right opportunity. That's valuable to corporate HR departments.
"
2053,REGN,"In recent years LinkedIn has been investing to improve its mobile smartphone and tablet tools and provide more content, more articles and experts who write on topics that are relevant. That brings people to the site more frequently and with a higher level of engagement. And that translates into more advertising dollars for LinkedIn. There's not only a growing number of recruiters who subscribe to the platform. There's also growing advertising business. All of this has a long way to run.
"
2054,REGN,"IBD: You began your current stake in Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) in September. Why do you like this particular casino stock?
"
2055,REGN,"Kamm: They're a leading casino operator in Macau and the Cotai Strip (in Macau), which is well known as a high-growth market, noticeably larger than Las Vegas. The subtle shift in the market in recent years is that the market is no longer driven primarily by high rollers, ultrahigh net worth individuals gaming in Macau. It is driven by the mass market today.
"
2056,REGN,"Melco's properties are well positioned to serve the mass market. And that part of the market is more profitable than the high-net-worth part. Melco is working to open new properties, which will expand its earnings potential.
"
2057,REGN,"Also, transportation to Macau is improving. And we're seeing changes that make it more attractive for destination travel, not just gambling demand.
"
2058,REGN,"IBD: Your stake in Tractor Supply (TSCO) has edged up.
"
2059,REGN,"Kamm: They're the leading supply store for recreational farms and the rural lifestyle. They have 1,300 stores today. We think they have potential for at least 2,100 stores. As they grow, they've done a good job of increasing productivity of existing stores. They've done a good job of understanding their business data.
"
2060,REGN,"They've done a good job with e-commerce to leverage their brand outside their physical stores. They've done a good job of laying in private label goods within the store to provide different price points and help expand their own margins. All of those drivers have potential in the coming years.Lead manager Matthew Kamm works the market like it's a garden with variety. He treats his young sprouts differently from his mature produce, and both of those differently from crops he's ready to reap.This approach is working.

"
2061,REGN,"Despite the strong performance of biotech ETFs in the past three years and the recent market pullback, there may still be room to run for investors who can stomach the sector's high volatility.
"
2062,REGN,"Of course, a lot will depend on the stock market's general direction. Both it and the biotech ETFs continued selling off Monday. Further progress in biotech ETFs might have to wait for a market uptrend to return.
"
2063,REGN,"But Steven Silver, equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ, says the industry's success is based on three pillars.
"
2064,REGN,"First, ""there's been a very solid period of both late-stage data and new drugs coming to the market,"" he said. ""All put together, I think there are a lot of pockets of significant progress.""
"
2065,REGN,"The second pillar, as he states, is a much more accommodative Food and Drug Administration that is focusing on getting more drugs to the market. Last year, the FDA started the Breakthrough Therapy Designation, providing a fast track for the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions.
"
2066,REGN,"There are 35 to 40 programs that have received this designation so far. ""The FDA is only granting one out of every three programs with this designation, so I think over the long term it will be a really big deal if a company is to receive that designation in terms of getting the drug to market faster.""
"
2067,REGN,"Finally, the sector has a prospect of increased M&A activity. While traditionally the big pharmas were the acquirers of smaller biotechs, some biotechs have grown so large that they are now in the market to buy out smaller firms. This creates more competition in the market for the acquisition of those firms.
"
2068,REGN,"The two biggest biotech ETFs are iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) and SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI). Both are very liquid and have reasonable expense ratios, 0.48% of assets for IBB and 0.35% for XBI.
"
2069,REGN,"But their compositions are somewhat different. IBB holds 123 Nasdaq-listed stocks and is a market-cap weighted ETF. It is more diversified, with biotech accounting for 76% of the fund, pharma 17% and life sciences 7%.
"
2070,REGN,"Because it is market-cap weighted, its top five holdings are large independent biotechs: Gilead Sciences (GILD), Biogen Idec (BIIB), Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), each at 6% or 7% of the fund.
"
2071,REGN,"By comparison, XBI is made up of 69 stocks, nearly all biotechs. Its top five holdings are Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT), Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA), Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX), Sangamo BioSciences (SGMO) and Novavax (NVAX). The fund is equal-weighted, resulting in a bias toward smaller names, meaning more volatility and higher turnover.

"
2073,REGN,"""They are very different funds,"" said Robert Goldsborough, ETF analyst at Morningstar. In XBI, ""you're going to have more early-stage biotech firms. A lot of these are publicly traded companies, but they have no drug on the market yet and have no profits.""
"
2074,REGN,"XBI is up more this year but IBB has performed better over longer periods, with an average annual 38% vs. 23% in the past three years and 29% vs. 23% for five years.

2075,REGN,"""IBB actually has better risk-adjusted returns over the long term,"" said Goldsborough.

2076,REGN,"""I think that these stocks have done very, very well based on improving growth potential, rather than investors bidding up these companies just because,"" said Silver. ""It's been an exciting time, but I do think that it will continue to be an exciting time.""Despite the strong performance of biotech ETFs in the past three years and the recent market pullback, there may still be room to run for investors who can stomach the sector's high volatility.Of course, a lot will depend on the stock market's general direction. Both it and the biotech ETFs continued selling off Monday. Further progress in biotech ETFs might have to wait for a market uptrend to return.But Steven Silver, equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ, says the industry's success is based on three pillars.First, ""there's been a very solid period of both late-stage data and new drugs coming to the market,"" he said. ""All put together, I think there are a lot of pockets of significant progress.""The second pillar, as he states, is a much more accommodative Food and Drug Administration that is focusing on getting more drugs to the market. Last year, the FDA started the Breakthrough Therapy Designation, providing a fast track for the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions.There are 35 to 40 programs that have received this designation so far. ""The FDA is only granting one out of every three programs with this designation, so I think over the long term it will be a really big deal if a company is to receive that designation in terms of getting the drug to market faster.""Finally, the sector has a prospect of increased M&A activity. While traditionally the big pharmas were the acquirers of smaller biotechs, some biotechs have grown so large that they are now in the market to buy out smaller firms. This creates more competition in the market for the acquisition of those firms.The two biggest biotech ETFs are iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) and SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI).
