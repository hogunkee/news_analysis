1,HUM,"Amgen (AMGN) reported a ""ho-hum"" quarter on Tuesday, an analyst said, after the No. 1 biotech beat first-quarter expectations though 2018 guidance came in slightly soft at the midpoints.Sales of Enbrel, one of Amgen's biggest products, declined for the fifth straight quarter. Amgen cited lower demand, lower net selling price and year-earlier favorable changes in accounting estimates for the dip.But Amgen raised the low end of its full-year revenue outlook and boosted its adjusted profit expectations. Both metrics were slightly below the Street at the midpoint, but are now relatively in line, Mizuho analyst Salim Syed said in a note to clients.""Looks like a ho-hum quarter,"" he said.In after-hours trading on the stock market today, Amgen shares were flat. The stock ended the regular session down 1.6%, at 171.94. That matched the broad biotech group, which also wrapped down 1.6% at the closing bell.For the first quarter, Amgen reported adjusted profit of $3.47 per share, rising 10% to beat the consensus for $3.15 a share. Sales edged up 2% to $5.55 billion, just north of the Street's view for $5.46 billion.Bright spots in the quarter included cholesterol drug Repatha and Senispar, which treats a condition resulting from enlargement of a gland causing high levels of calcium in the blood.Repatha sales grew 151% year over year to $123 million. Of that, $84 million stemmed from sales in the U.S. Repatha competes with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi's (SNY) drug Praluent. Analysts had modeled $110 million in total sales and $78 million in the U.S., Syed said.U.S. Senispar sales came in at $409 million, topping consensus for $326 million. Total sales of $497 million grew 18%. RBC analyst Brian Abrahams, though, notes Senispar is likely to see generic rivalries in the long term, ""though this overhand may not materialize until post-2018.""Amgen's biggest drugs declined in the first quarter. But these ""pillar legacy products"" still drove the topline beat, Abrahams said in a note to clients.Enbrel, an arthritis and psoriasis drug, declined 6% to $1.105 billion in sales. Still, that was just above the consensus for around $1.096 billion, Mizuho's Syed said.Sales of Neulasta, a bone marrow stimulant, decreased 5% to $1.155 billion. The consensus had modeled around $1.122 billion to $1.129 billion, Syed said. Neulasta sales have declined for four straight periods.""While Neulasta's beat is an unexpected positive, we don't anticipate this will reinvigorate investor enthusiasm given the product remains at risk from potential biosimilar entry,"" RBC's Abrahams said.For the year, Amgen predicted adjusted profit of $12.80-$13.70 per share and $21.9 billion to $22.8 billion in sales. The midpoints of both outlooks were slightly below the consensus view for adjusted income of $13.28 per share and $22.7 billion in sales.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

6,HUM,"Walmart (WMT) reportedly is in talks to buy online pharmacy startup PillPack, another clue that America's largest brick-and-mortar retailer is seriously looking at becoming a health care disrupter.The late Monday CNBC alert follows reports last week that Walmart held talks with health insurer Humana (HUM). That could fundamentally reshape health care delivery in ways that Amazon (AMZN) may have trouble matching.PillPack describes itself as a ""full-service pharmacy that sorts your medication by the dose and delivers to your door."" It aims to save time by not making customers visit a physical pharmacy to fill their prescriptions.The service, with round-the-clock customer support, automatically refills prescriptions and ships for free. There's also a PillPack iPhone app that manages medications and lets users contact a pharmacist.Walmart runs about 4,500 pharmacies of its own that offer online access and a related mobile app. But the talks with a purely online pharmacy point to Walmart's increased e-commerce focus after several acquisitions over the last few years, notably Jet.com.CNBC sources say the deal, if it happens, would be worth under $1 billion. Amazon was also once in talks with PillPack, said the outlet.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

7,HUM,"Every Amazon (AMZN) flirtation toward the health care industry has sent hearts racing on Wall Street. Yet Amazon appears to be having commitment issues, and others have leapt while Jeff Bezos hesitated. Now comes a possible Walmart (WMT)-Humana (HUM) merger. A Walmart acquisition of the insurer could fundamentally reshape health care delivery in ways that Amazon may have trouble matching.A Walmart-Humana deal could potentially transform the health care market for seniors, a demographic that is critical for both companies.Walmart already operates about 4,500 in-store pharmacies and 2,900 vision centers, but a Humana deal would likely accelerate its efforts in developing in-store clinics. The clinics haven't been a knockout success, but Walmart has been learning, wrote Tracy Watts, U.S. health reform leader at Mercer, in a blog post. ""This partnership could foster new ways to bring people what they want and need,"" she wrote, highlighting health care access in rural areas.CVS Health (CVS), which is in the process of acquiring Aetna (AET), is planning to revamp its drugstores to provide more health services. Walmart has greater financial wherewithal to execute the strategy and its supercenters may be a more natural fit for health services.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA Walmart-Humana tie-up has strategic merits for the retail giant, wrote Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan. He expects it would drive greater store traffic and produce health care cost savings, helping the discounter to keep investing to fend off Amazon.Savings would come from closer ties to Humana, the largest remaining independent pharmacy benefits manager. That would help to reduce drug prices for Walmart's 1.5 million U.S. employees, Astrachan wrote.Humana recently purchased a major stake in the home health care business of Kindred Healthcare, a natural fit for Walmart's home delivery business.Still, there would be challenges. Piper Jaffray analyst Sarah James sees hurdles to staffing up clinics amid a nursing shortage that's pushing up wages. She also questioned how attractive a merger would be for Humana. Humana has an enviable Medicare position while Walmart has a smaller store base compared to CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA).Still, Humana shares rose 4.4% on the stock market today, even as the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all lost about 2% or more. Meanwhile, shares of Walmart lost 3.8% and Amazon skidded 5.2%.So far Amazon's disruptive impact on health care has been all about what others are doing. Since reports last summer that Amazon might enter the retail prescription industry, the shockwaves have set in motion one deal after another. First it was CVS buying Aetna and beginning to offer same-day delivery in major markets, and next-day nationwide. Albertsons grabbed the Rite Aid (RAD) stores not bought by Walgreens. Last month, Cigna (CI) announced the purchase of Express Scripts (ESRX), the largest of the pharmacy benefit managers.Options to enter the prescription drug business have narrowed for Amazon but haven't been closed off entirely. One potential avenue would be acquiring Walgreens.In January, Amazon announced a health care venture with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB). Health care stocks tumbled amid fear that Amazon would use the same formula that slayed book sellers and department stores. The scariest part: The companies say they have no intent to earn a profit from the effort. Yet they also confessed to a lack of any coherent plan for putting still-to-be-formed cost-saving ideas to work.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Trump Tariffs: China Trade War Just Took This Surprise TurnIs FANG Stock Trade Dead As Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google Lead Tech Weakness?The Big Picture: Stocks Do Some Damage Repair, As Patience Now Becomes KeyThe Best Growth Stocks To Watch And BuyHere's What You Need To Know About Spotify's IPO, Due Tuesday

That could mean deepening an existing partnership or possibly a takeover.That would follow several other big health care deals, including the pending CVS Health-Aetna takeover and the Cigna purchase of Express Scripts. Those deals reflect in part concerns over Amazon's moves into health care.Walmart-Humana would have some of the same logic as the CVS Health-Aetna deal. Walmart has thousands of pharmacies in its stores. A deal with Humana could direct more people to its pharmacies, boosting sales and perhaps curbing costs.

The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board last week said it was probing the accident. On Sunday, the NTSB said it was ""unhappy"" that Tesla disclosed details about the crash. Late Thursday, Tesla recalled 123,000 Model S vehicles for a possible flaw in its power steering.Also last week, Moody's downgraded Tesla over its heavy cash burn and Model 3 production woes.Tesla should release first-quarter production and delivery figures for the Model 3, Model S and Model X this week. The focus will be on Model 3 output, which has repeatedly missed company targets, which have cut and pushed back several times.The automaker, once again, raced to boost vehicle output and deliveries at the end of the quarter. Tesla encouraged Model S and Model X production workers to volunteer to help on the Model 3. But that highlights how Tesla hasn't worked out how to ramp up production in a steady, sustainable way.The Autopilot and Model 3 woes are more glaring now because Tesla no longer has such a huge technological edge. Major automakers are rapidly introducing electric vehicles. General Motors (GM) and Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Waymo are among those planning to roll out robotaxi services.As for Tesla?

14,HUM,"A federal judge ruled late Tuesday that the AT&T (T) takeover of Time Warner can go ahead without preconditions. That sent Time Warner and a slew of other media companies sharply higher, while knocking would-be acquiring companies such as AT&T and Comcast (CMCSA). But the antitrust clearance also gives hope to a pair of big health care mergers: CVS Health (CVS)-Aetna (AET) and Cigna (CI)-Express Scripts (ESRX).The gains in media and health care stocks gave a small lift at the open on the stock market today, with the S&P 500 index up 0.1%.Last year, the health insurance merger deals of Cigna-Anthem (ANTM) and Aetna-Humana (HUM) fell apart amid U.S. antitrust objections. Those were horizontal mergers, reducing the number of big insurers. The CVS Health-Aetna and Cigna-Express Scripts deals are vertical, combining different companies along the health care food chain. CVS Health, a drug store and pharmacy benefit manager, aims to team up with insurer Aetna. Insurer Cigna is grabbing pure-play PBM Express Scripts.The AT&T-Time Warner deal also is a vertical merger. It combines the wireless giant/pay-TV operator of AT&T with content maker Time Warner.

16,HUM,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) tumbled to a four-year low Tuesday — prodding rival Amgen (AMGN) to also dip — after announcing a deal with Express Scripts (ESRX) to cut the net price of cholesterol drug Praluent.Express Scripts will list Praluent as its exclusive PSCK9 inhibitor on its national formulary as of July 1. In exchange, it will pay a lower price for the drug. PCSK9 inhibitors, like Praluent and Amgen's Repatha, work to reduce ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the blood. They also benefit cardiovascular outcomes.The move is in an effort to expand access to cholesterol drug Praluent, Regeneron and partner Sanofi (SNY) said. Some reports suggest 70% of prescription requests are rejected by insurers. That could be, in part, due to price. Praluent and Repatha go for north of $14,000 per year.Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer praised the deal in a written statement. He sees the agreement as setting a new standard model for medicines like Praluent.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""This paradigm-shifting agreement is designed to break the gridlock so that Praluent is finally able to reach patients most in need,"" he said. ""U.S. cardiologists have experienced unprecedented challenges in securing access for Praluent for patients who were clearly appropriate, but were denied coverage.""But investors weren't as keen on the deal. In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Regeneron slipped 0.8% to 301.22. Amgen dropped 3% to 169.28. Sanofi lost a fraction to 39.13.The agreement significantly reduces the documentation necessary to secure Express Scripts insurance coverage for the cholesterol drug, Regeneron and Sanofi said in a press release. Physicians will submit a simplified attestation form to confirm the patient is appropriate for Praluent.Express Scripts also agreed to pass a portion of the savings onto patients enrolled in other plans. Those patients should see lower out-of-pocket costs for their Praluent prescriptions, the companies said.Analysts were largely positive on the deal, though note the specifics of the price cut aren't public. It's likely Praluent will be priced in line with a recent report that suggested it would be cost effective for higher risk patients at $4,500-$8,000 annually, RBC analyst Brian Williams said in a note.The ""price for volume"" announcement leaves a lot of the financial benefit up in the air, Williams said. The PCSK9 market is particularly attractive given its massive size. But this type of deal could further incentivize insurers to implement complicated utilization processes, he said.Further, if the deal prices the cholesterol drug closer to the $4,500 annual target, it would represent a 50%-plus cut to the net price, Williams said.""Despite this, we do not view this as a pricing 'race to the bottom' given potential for annual compounding and lifetime treatment creating distinct differences vs. the 'price for volume' contracts in the curative one-time-treatment hepatitis C space,"" he added.Now, it's a battle for the other insurers, Williams said. Amgen is in negotiations with payers and will likely leverage its ""expertise in winning contracting agreements"" to seek deals with United Health (UNH), CVS Health (CVS), Anthem (ANTM), Aetna (AET), Cigna (CI) or Humana (HUM), he said.Amgen estimates the Express Scripts formulary decision will impact 2,000, or 6%, of Repatha patients, Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said in a report to clients. But he kept his model on Praluent intact until after the first-quarter earnings conference call on Thursday.""Just doing some back-of-the-envelope math, if all 2,000 Repatha patients switched to Praluent on July 1, this would be an $8 million tailwind for Praluent in the second half of 2018 on the formulary decision alone,"" he said.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

Both were off session highs.Among drug distributors, McKesson (MCK) rose 3.5%, AmerisourceBergen (ABC) 2.25% and Cardinal Health (CAH) 3.1%.Amazon shares didn't react negatively to the news, rising 0.75% on Monday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe report seemed to have the most direct connection to the trio of major drug distributors that handle logistics for major drug manufacturers, a big revenue but low-margin business. Complexity, such as handling temperature-sensitive products, and the lack of interest among hospitals in switching purchasing relationships, will keep Amazon out of the business.Investors seemed to interpret the move as decreasing the likelihood that Amazon will enter the retail prescription business, giving a boost to CVS and Walgreens. If so, then Amazon investors apparently don't think the internet retail giant needs prescription drugs to win over and keep customer loyalty.Amazon could still enter the prescription business, such as via an acquisition of Walgreens. Or it could start small with just online pharmacy.Meanwhile, Walmart (WMT) appears to be increasingly focused on health care and pharmacy as a key to boost sales and loyalty. Walmart is reportedly in talks to merge or deepen its partnership with Humana (HUM), whose managed care businesses is focused on the Medicare population.Shares of Walmart climbed about 1%, but didn't see much of an uptick after the Amazon news broke.Cigna (CI), the managed care provider that is buying pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX), rose 2%.Shares of UnitedHealth (UNH), the largest managed care provider, rose 2.7%.

While Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), Intel (INTC), Walmart (WMT) and Facebook (FB) were high-profile losers, there was no place to hide. Nearly all of IBD's 197 industry groups lost ground.In fact, just 3 groups posted gains Monday, but it was really just two. The Building-Residential/Commercial industry only rose because high-priced NVR (NVR) jumped, distorting the price-weighted group's performance. Several top homebuilders fell 3%-5%.

26,HUM,"Results from insurer Centene (CNC), by far the biggest player on the ObamaCare exchanges, reveal that paid national enrollment almost certainly increased in 2018 compared to a year ago, defying predictions that President Trump's actions would lead to a sizable drop.X Centene said on a Tuesday earnings call that it now has more than 1.6 million paid exchange customers, well above the 1.4 million-plus that the company indicated to investors on Jan. 8.The unexpected surge in customers didn't result from late signups — since enrollment ended in most markets on Dec. 15 — but from a much bigger share of those who signed up following through and paying their premium.Shares of Centene jumped 4.3% on Tuesday and added another 0.7% on the stock market today, boosted by better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and an improved outlook, thanks to ObamaCare enrollment and tax cuts.Centene is ranked No. 2 by IBD Stock Checkup in the Medical-Managed Care industry group based on earnings, revenue, margin and stock performance trends, trailing only Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth Group (UNH). With UnitedHealth, Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) all exiting the ACA exchanges, and Anthem (ANTM) greatly scaling back its presence, the door has been opened for Centene, which has traditionally catered to the Medicaid population, to seize a leadership position.Fears of a substantial enrollment decline were fueled by the Trump administration's adoption of a much earlier signup deadline and its gutting of the advertising budget for HealthCare.gov, along with Republicans' successful effort to repeal the individual mandate to buy coverage or pay a fine.Ironically, the unexpected strength in enrollment resulted from Trump's decision last fall to halt payments for cost-sharing subsidies, which the Affordable Care Act promised to insurers to reimburse their expense for dramatically shrinking deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for low-income households who buy silver coverage.Trump, who had the authority to end the payments funded by President Obama without a congressional appropriation, had threatened the move as an act of sabotage. But most state health insurance officials seized on advice from Urban Institute scholars to jury-rig their exchanges in a way that turned attempted sabotage into a life raft.IBD'S TAKE: After Thursday's market action — and before Friday's and Monday's market drubbings — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Instead of raising premiums for all customers in response to the loss of cost-sharing subsidies, as feared, insurers piled all of their extra expense onto silver plans, sending only silver premiums skyward.But while Trump ended the cost-sharing subsidies for insurers, a separate tax-credit subsidy remains in place to offset the cost of premiums that individuals pay.And because those premium tax credits are based on the cost of the second-lowest-cost silver plans, the size of those subsidies soared, which is why many more people can get free high-deductible bronze coverage in 2018 than in prior years. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 4.5 million uninsured could get bronze policies this year for no cost.Not surprisingly, anecdotal evidence suggests an increase in the take-up of bronze plans. In Connecticut, bronze signups went from 25% of the total in 2017 to 35% in 2018.Typically, somewhere between 70% and 80% of people selecting Centene plans during the open-enrollment period would eventually pay a premium, CEO Michael Neidorff said on Tuesday, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.But this year, he noted, ""we had a much higher percentage convert and pay the premium.""Given that the number of people signing up for exchange coverage came in at more than 96% of last year's total – 11.8 million vs. 12.2 million a year ago, according to ACASignups.net – the experience of Centene, whose large presence makes it a strong indicator of national trends, suggests that paid enrollment will top last year's total of 10.2 million.The wider availability of free bronze plans surely goes a long way toward explaining the higher share of enrollees who paid the premium they owed – if they owed one. The higher subsidies also likely enabled more people to buy lower-deductible gold plans for little more than the cost of silver. California reported a big increase in the take-up of gold plans, with a more modest increase in bronze coverage.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:How Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

27,HUM,"The first initial public offering of a tech unicorn in 2018, Zscaler (ZS), began trading Friday in spectacular fashion, and two more unicorns are galloping to the gate and adding some much-needed excitement to a ho-hum IPO market.Shares of the network security company soared more than 70% in midday trading as the IPO raised $192 million. Zscaler priced 12 million shares at 16 each and opened trading at 27.50. On Tuesday, Zscaler hiked the estimated price of shares to a range of 13 to 15 a share, up from 10 to 12. It also increased the amount of shares being offered to 12 million, up from 10 million.The next tech unicorn after Zscaler will be file-storage company Dropbox (DBX), which comes next week and is expected to trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker DBX. It will be followed by streaming music company Spotify, expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker SPOT.In the IPO prospectus, Zscaler says it's a leader and pioneering developer of cloud-based network security for businesses, with 2,800 customers.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe market for cloud computing services has advanced rapidly since Amazon (AMZN) introduced its highly successful Amazon Web Services cloud computing program, a rival to Microsoft (MSFT) and its Azure platform. The growing use of cloud services from Amazon, Microsoft and others has significantly increased cybersecurity business risks, which Zscaler aims to solve.Founded in 2007, Zscaler reported revenue of $125.7 million in 2017, up 57% from the prior year, and a net loss of $45 million. IPO research and advisory firm IPOboutique.com said underwriter guidance from channel checks reveals that the demand for Zscaler shares is strong, saying it's ""many multiple times oversubscribed.""Zscaler has a market valuation of about $1.64 billion. The unicorn designation applies to companies that, before their IPO, had a private market valuation above $1 billion.IBD'S TAKE: The biggest stock market winners typically make their major price moves within a few months or years of their initial public offering.

28,HUM,"Cigna (CI) just made a bid to join an elite group of health care industry titans with its $67 billion deal to buy drug-benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX).X Yet the takeover, which includes $15 billion in assumed debt, comes as something of a shock because Express Scripts and pharmacy benefit managers, in general, have been under fire and unloved on Wall Street. To some extent, Cigna may be jumping into the frying pan.Cigna will pay $48.75 plus 0.2434 share for each Express Scripts share. At Wednesday's close that was equal to 96.03, a 31% premium for Express Scripts.Wall Street's initial reaction to the deal was skeptical. Shares of Cigna closed down 11% at 172.00 on the stock market today. Meanwhile, Express Scripts jumped 8.6% to 79.72. Among competitors, UnitedHealth (UNH) dipped 0.8%, CVS Health rose 1.3%, while Humana (HUM) lost 1.4%.Cigna sees the combination as giving it the scale and skill sets to deliver value to customers, hold down health costs and compete in a world in which its competitors like UnitedHealth and CVS, after it completes its merger with Aetna, own an increasingly formidable array of health care assets.Cigna told analysts on Thursday that the deal would immediately add to earnings and provide a significant boost in the intermediate term. The company raised its EPS target for 2021 to $20-$21 per share from $18.Yet some industry analysts worry that Amazon.com (AMZN) will disrupt the prescription industry. Amazon has flirted with entering the retail drug business and just launched a venture with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) aimed at lowering health care costs. Washington has amped up the rhetoric on the lack of transparency in drug pricing, and PBMs are seen as a prime suspect. To top it off, Express Scripts had a falling out with Anthem (ANTM), its biggest customer, which accused it of not passing along drug manufacturers' rebates.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

29,HUM,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowExpress Scripts has a purchasing alliance with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), so its merger with Cigna could create the same kind of scale as CVS Health-Aetna. Walgreens recently mulled buying the 76% of drug distributor AmerisourceBergen (ABC) that it doesn't already own, according to reports.CVS acquired pharmacy benefit manager Caremark in 2006. UnitedHealth acquired Catamaran, another PBM, in 2015.UnitedHealth this week announced that its OptumRx PBM would directly provide drug rebates to some 7 million insured members through employer plans, an apparent response to pressure on the industry from customers and politicians.Industry players have increasingly seen the stand-alone PBM model, meaning a pharmacy benefit manager that is not owned directly by a major insurer, as being under threat. Anthem is setting up its own in-house PBM while temporarily contracting with CVS.Some analysts had speculated in recent months that Amazon might bid for Express Scripts to ease its entry into the highly regulated and complex prescription industry.

30,HUM,"Over the last three months, the top-performing mutual funds have been heavily buying shares in big-name industry leaders, including Bank of America (BAC), Intel (INTC), Boeing (BA), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Charles Schwab (SCHW), investing well over $1 billion in each during that period.X BofA led the group, with top fund managers scooping up more than $2 billion of the financial giant's shares. Boosted by that demand, the stock is now around 25% above the 25.45 buy point it cleared in September.Semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT) and software and analytics leader Adobe (ADBE) both came in just shy of the $1 billion mark, getting investments of approximately $982 million and $932 million, respectively.The IBD 50 screen identifies the top growth stocks that are strongly displaying the key traits typically shared by the biggest stock market winners.Seven of the names on this month's list of new buys by top funds are also currently on the IBD 50, including Applied Materials, Adobe, Abiomed (ABMD), Lam Research (LRCX) and S&P Global (SPGI).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn addition to BofA, seven other bank stocks made the list, joined by six financial sector companies, including Charles Schwab, which was named one of the best online stock brokers for 2018.Leading portfolio managers also continued to pick up shares in semiconductor stocks, including the aforementioned Intel, Applied Materials and Lam Research, as well as Microsemi (MSCC) and KLA Tencor (KLAC).Portfolio managers also showed a healthy interest in medical stocks, with five companies from that sector joining Abiomed and Abbot Laboratories on the list, including Express Scripts (ESRX) and Cantel Medical (CMD).Just because mutual fund managers have been buying a stock doesn't mean it's time for individual investors to pick up shares, especially given that the overall market has come under selling pressure recently. Be sure to run all your stock ideas through a buying checklist and do additional research before making any investment decisions.On Tuesday, Applied Materials cleared a 58.83 buy point in a later-stage, and therefore riskier, double bottom. Its relative strength line has been trending sharply higher and is just shy of new high ground.Lam Research is also working on a late-stage double bottom, and has now climbed within 5% of the 218.58 entry.Scanning and tracking solutions leader Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) leapt past a buy point in January, but pulled back as the stock market fell sharply in early February. But on Feb. 22, Zebra soared on its Q4 earnings report and is now 27% above the initial 112.49 entry.Adobe also launched a successful breakout in January and has now climbed 14% above the 186.37 buy point.IBD 50 member SVB Financial (SIVB), which owns Silicon Valley Bank and was just featured in the IBD Stock Analysis, broke out past a 263.19 entry on Tuesday, but is now testing support at the buy point after the resignation of Donald Trump's top economic advisor Gary Cohn rattled the market.Despite being among the top new buys this month, Boeing topped the list of stocks being sold, with 42 net sellers (123 funds selling minus 81 buying).American Express (AXP) was second, with 40 net sellers (90 funds selling minus 50 buying).Managed care provider Humana (HUM) and Motorola Solutions (MSI) also saw a significant number of net sellers.You May Also Like:What Are Today's Fastest-Growing Companies?Find And Track The Best Mutual FundsVideo: How To Quickly Find Top-Performing Mutual Funds

32,HUM,"The unseemly sight of nearly the entire Democratic congressional delegation sitting on their hands and clinging to their chairs throughout Donald Trump's State of the Union speech is further evidence that they want America to fail on Trump's watch.XHundreds of American companies are bringing jobs to America and paying American workers bonuses.  Democrats sat stone faced. The lowest black unemployment rate in 40 years. Democrats smirked.  We are defeating ISIS in the Middle East. Ho hum. They acted like petulant 12-year olds who fold their arms in defiance and pout miserably when things don't go their way.Many on the left are suffering from a severe case of anti-Trump derangement syndrome.  ATDS sufferers crave bad news.  In a bright sunny ‎economic sky, they point to the single cloud.  This is why Nancy Pelosi could only sniff that the bonuses workers are getting from the tax cuts are ""crumbs.""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveThe other day I was on CNN and was sparring with April Ryan of the American Urban Radio Networks — who is to say the least not friendly to Trump.  When I mentioned all of the companies that are hiring more workers and paying bonuses or raises to their employees, including as many as one million Walmart employees, I thought this might elicit some positive reaction.Instead, she rolled her eyes.  ""Look at all the stores they are closing and all the layoffs?"" she complained.  Yes 5,000 Walmart workers will be mostly reassigned, while about 200 times that number will get raises. ‎Liberals have been protesting Walmart pay scales for years agitating for higher wages, and now Walmart is raising their minimum wage by $2 an hour.  But the left still is unhappier than ever.   ‎For at least two weeks the TV networks on the left praised to the hilt ‎ Michael Wolff's book ""Fire and Fury."" They obsessed over the charge of whether Trump was mentally competent to hold office, and even called for his ouster under the 25th Amendment — all based purely on unsubstantiated charges in a book that has now been exposed as mostly a work of fiction, not fact.  Many of the ATDS crowd don't even care whether the information is true or false. They are the ""Birthers"" on the left.Trump's successes one year into office are now dismissed as a result of Obama policies, which is rich since Trump has one-by-one reversed Obama's economic policies.  If the economy and stock market had tanked in 2017, liberals would have seized upon the bad news as evidence that his policies are abject failures. Now that the policies are working, Obama gets the credit. They are so blinded by ATDS, they can't even acknowledge the double standard.I remember at a Wall Street Journal editorial meeting when Barack Obama was first elected president and he was rolling out ObamaCare, the stimulus plan, tax increases, a regulatory assault, and a litany of other dimwitted economic policies, one of the writers said what we were all thinking: If this program works, everything we believe on the economy is wrong.We opposed the policies, not the man, and in the end the Keynesian big government policies were indeed a failure. We ended up with the weakest recovery from a recession since the Great Depression.It is true opposition to Obama on the right prompted some conservatives to similarly root against American success on his watch.  When the International Olympics Committee snubbed Obama's hometown of Chicago, there were videos of conservatives celebrating the bad news.  The cascade of disappointing economic data on Obama's watch was too-often cheered by Republicans.""Some of these people on the right are starting to put politics first and country second,"" observed then-Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who is now a Senator from that state. ""The American people are starting to wonder if they are rooting against America,"" he charged.He had a point back in 2009. But, Senator, look in the mirror.Why does no national Democrat stand up to the leftist Trump haters, who have morphed into America haters?   He or she would be hailed as a hero. The Democrats desperately need a Sister Soulja moment.Most Americans are not especially ideological. We are for what works. The United States is on a roll right now and the good economic news transcends political spin. Tens of millions of Americans are starting to see the benefits in their paychecks of the tax cuts that Democrats lied would raise people's taxes.If Trump haters continue to sit on their hands and oppose America's comeback, voters will see they are putting political ideology over patriotism.  That's no winning ticket and it means they are in for a miserable next seven years.RELATED:Do The Media Hate Trump (Part II)?

33,HUM,"Stock fell out of the starting gates Tuesday, as global markets suffered another day of losses and a new partnership announced by Amazon.com (AMZN) rattled stocks across the U.S. health care fields.XThe Nasdaq Composite opened down 0.7% as Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) and ExpressScripts (ESRX) put up heavy losses.The S&P 500 traded down 0.6%. and the Dow Jones Industrial average dropped nearly 0.8%, with UnitedHealth Group (UNH) down hard and Caterpillar (CAT), Apple (AAPL) and Chevron (CVX) among the half-dozen other Dow Jones names clocking early losses of greater than 1%.International markets were also posting losses, as bond markets remained under pressure and the dollar continued its slide. Leading benchmarks in Tokyo and Hong Kong fell more than 1% on Tuesday. Stocks in Europe also showed deepening losses in afternoon trade, with London's FTSE 100 and Frankfurt's DAX diving furthest, each down 0.8%.The Federal Open Market Committee swings into its two-day meeting in Washington Tuesday morning — the last FOMC gathering over which Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will preside. A policy announcement is set for 2 p.m. ET Wednesday, though no rate hike is expected this time around.Other economic news for the day is thin, with the Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for November rising 0.7%. That was unchanged from October's reading, and just above consensus views for a 0.6% gain. The January consumer confidence survey from the Conference Board expected at 10 a.m. ET.Health-care stocks were reacting briskly to news that Amazon would partner with Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) to chart out new ways to provide health care for their U.S. employees, ""through an independent company that is free from profit-making incentives and constraints.""The deal suggested that the ""Amazon effect"" — the impact of deep pockets and massive online scale the company brings to its efforts — could begin to assert an impact on health care and insurance industries, the way it has on retail, shipping and other markets.Amazon dropped 1.3%, JPMorgan slipped 0.9% and Berkshire Hathaway was flat. Amazon shares are extended, almost 17% above a 1213.10 buy point following a breakout in early January.On the Dow, UnitedHealth Group dove nearly 5% in opening action.  Other managed care providers responded similarly, with Anthem (ANTM) down 5%, Cigna (CI) sliding 5%, while Aetna (AET) slipped 3% and Humana (HUM) subtracted more than 2%.Shares also dived among pharmacy benefit managers and pharmacy chains, with Express Scripts careening 9% lower to the bottom of the Nasdaq 100. CVS Health (CVS) crumbled nearly 5%. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD) fell 5% each.Apple traded down 1%, as news reports detailed the company's plans to reduce production for its iPhone X through March 31. Some reports said this was on weaker-than-expected demand, others said the move was seasonal and occurred around this time each year. Apple spent a third session below its 10-week moving average on Monday, and starts Tuesday in a test of its prior low, from early December — just ahead of its fiscal first-quarter report on Wednesday.Early earnings reports were also a factor in early trade, with McDonald's (MCD) down 1.1% after its fourth-quarter report. Homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM) dropped almost 3% after its quarterly results.Life insurer MetLife (MET) tumbled 8% after announcing late Monday it would postpone its fourth-quarter earnings report as the company wrestles with a foul-up that potentially left ""tens of thousands"" of workers without monthly pension benefits. The company said it would increase reserves by $525 million to $575 million in order to deal with the problem, and revealed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the matter.Maxim Integrated dived nearly 7%, reversing much of Monday's 12% gain that followed news reports the company was a possible takeover target for Japanese rival Renesas for $20 billion. In reports after Monday's close, Renesas denied that it was in takeover discussions with Maxim.Callidus Software (CALD) spiked 10% at the open, after announcing German software giant SAP (SAP) would acquire the company for $2.4 billion.

(CSX), Comerica (CMA) and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) all report today.X Citigroup and Dow component UnitedHealth Group closed Friday near buy points, with caveats. CSX is the first rail operator to report this week, while Interactive Brokers precedes Charles Schwab (SCHW) on Wednesday. Citigroup and super-regional Comerica kick off a new wave of big bank earnings.S&P 500 futures were 0.5% above fair value. The dollar's recent weakness continued vs. major rivals, hitting a 2-year low vs. the Chinese yuan. Dow futures popped 1% vs. fair value and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.7% against fair value.Bitcoin fell 9% to $12,335.19, according to CoinDesk after falling as low as $11,182.71. South Korea's finance minister stressed that banning cryptocurrency trading is on the table. Ethereum lost 14% and Ripple 20% vs. 24 hours earlier, according to CoinMarketCap. That follows further signals from China to crack down on Bitcoin mining in that country.The No. 1 U.S. insurer reported before the opening bell Tuesday. UnitedHealth earnings rose 23% to $2.59 a share, beating views for $2.50, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue climbed 9.5% to $52.06 billion. UnitedHealth also raised its 2018 EPS forecast.UnitedHealth rose 2.7% to 234.78 before the opening bell on the stock market today. That suggests a move above a 231.87 buy point from a flat base.But the relative strength line, with tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging since the end of November, actually hitting a consolidation low on Thursday.Ideally, a stock's RS line (the blue line in the charts below) should lead or confirm a breakout.A strong breakout could push the RS line to at least a short-term high over its pseudo-handle.  Flat bases do not have handles, and this brief pause was not long enough to qualify as a handle in any other pattern, but it's still something for the RS line to try to top.UnitedHealth also is the first managed-care company to report for the latest quarter, with several in or near buy zones. Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI) moved into a buy zone Friday, joining Humana (HUM), though none of the breakouts came on impressive volume and their RS lines continue to lag. Aetna (AET) and WellCare Helath Plans (WCG) are near buy points but with lagging RS lines.Citigroup reports early Tuesday as well. EPS should edge up 4.4% to $1.19, with revenue edging up 0.5% to $17.09 billion.Citigroup has a flat base that's a half-step above a prior flat base, which was just above yet another flat base. The buy point is 78.02. Shares rose to 76.84 on Friday.But Citigroup, which outperformed the RS line from early June to early October and generally outperformed rival banks over that span, has had a declining RS line since then.Citigroup follows bank earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) on Friday. Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) report later this week.Comerica also reports Q4 earnings early Tuesday, with analysts forecasting a 31.5% EPS jump to $1.21 billion with revenue climbing 13% to $819 million.Comerica shares have risen 7.2% in January and are well extended from any buy point. The stock's RS line has been rising for the past four months.Rail giant CSX delivers Q4 results after Tuesday's close. Analysts expect a 14% advance to 56 cents even as revenue slides 5% to $2.88 billion. This is the first report after CSX named James Foote CEO in December following the death of veteran railroad exec Hunter Harrison.CSX's stock is modestly extended from a 55.09 buy point. Shares briefly tumbled on news that Harrison was taking a leave of absence followed quickly by his death, but shares didn't fall quite enough to invalidate the buy point. Also, shares found support at their 200-day line and never closed below their 50-day.CSX's RS line initially confirmed the Nov. 30 breakout. But the RS line hasn't made headway since then, and has generally been lagging for more than six months.Later this week, Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Kansas City Southern (KSU) will report quarterly results. Canadian Pacific is in a buy zone while Kansas City is near a flat base buy point, but both have lagging RS lines.Interactive Brokers reports will issue results late Tuesday. Revenue should more than double to $399 billion with earnings sprinting to 39 cents  a share vs. 7 cents a year ago.Shares cleared a short consolidation last week, hitting new all-time highs.

38,HUM,"The $67.5 billion CVS Health (CVS) takeover of Aetna (AET) will test the Trump administration's approach to far-reaching corporate takeovers, just weeks after the U.S. government sued to block a major telecommunications merger.X The health-care deal unveiled Sunday would create an industry giant with over $240 billion in annual sales with a hand in insurance, prescription drug plan administration, retail pharmacies and corner clinics. The companies said the combination will save $750 million in costs and bring consumers better, more efficient health care.In the past, deals combining companies up and down a chain of business — such as a supplier and a distributor — have been viewed as posing less anticompetitive risk than combinations of direct rivals. Last month, however, the Justice Department sued to block just such a ""vertical"" merger between AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX), saying it would harm consumers and limit their media content options.""We are obviously going to get some scrutiny,"" said Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini. ""We are prepared to deal with whatever comes along to make this work.""Aetna shares were trading at $184.84 at 6:33 a.m. in New York, well below CVS's $207-a-share offer for the company — a sign investors are skeptical the deal will close at the current price.How much scrutiny the deal gets from the government may depend on which federal agency reviews the takeover — the Justice Department, or the Federal Trade Commission.Both scenarios present obstacles.The FTC has typically handled mergers of retail businesses like CVS. While it allowed Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) to buy more than 1,900 Rite Aid (RAD) stores earlier this year, the deal had to be significantly scaled down to gain the regulator's approval. The Justice Department, meanwhile, successfully sued to block insurance mergers between Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI), and Aetna and Humana (HUM).In the past, vertical deals have typically won approval after companies agree to restrictions on how they operate.That may be changing. The Justice Department's new antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has criticized past settlements that allowed vertical deals with behavioral restrictions. In a speech last month, Delrahim said such conditions don't work and force antitrust enforcers to become regulators.That view was behind Delrahim's decision on Nov. 20 to sue to block AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner, a vertical deal that would bring together Time Warner content like HBO with AT&T's pay-TV and wireless distribution.""Most vertical deals don't raise antitrust concerns, and the ones that do generally get approval to close with an agreement containing behavioral conditions,"" said Jennifer Rie, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst who follows antitrust issues, in an email. ""But the Justice Department appears to be rejecting this kind of remedy given its approach to the AT&T-Time Warner deal.""That doesn't mean there's heightened hostility toward vertical deals at the Justice Department, but CVS might prefer the Aetna deal to go to the FTC given Delrahim's criticism of behavioral fixes, said David Kully, an antitrust lawyer at Holland & Knight in Washington and a former Justice Department attorney.""Delrahim was very clear in his concerns about behavioral decrees and then put his money where his mouth is when he brought the AT&T case,"" Kully said.One point in favor of the CVS-Aetna deal is that there's already another large insurer with many of the characteristics of a combined health companies. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) offers health insurance, administers drug benefits and runs a growing network of doctors and clinics.But the CVS-Aetna combination takes integration to a new level with its 9,700 retail drugstores. It would also allow CVS to expand its 1,100 walk-in clinics, saving Aetna's insurance customers money by steering patients away from expensive hospital emergency rooms.A condition to an approval could be measures preventing Aetna from steering patients to CVS pharmacies over competitors such as Walgreens, said Rie, who noted that CVS may be better off if the FTC takes the review.One of the few areas where the companies directly overlap is in the Medicare drug business. CVS is already the largest provider of Medicare drug plans, and Aetna is the fifth largest, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.Michael Newshel, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said Aetna would likely need to divest some or all of its Medicare drug-benefits business in a CVS merger. He anticipates a deal would likely go through in the end no matter who reviewed it.The deal ""would definitely be scrutinized, but ultimately we still see a path for it to get through,"" Newshel said in an email. Evercore worked on the deal and Newshel said he's suspending his analyst coverage of Aetna.RELATED:CVS Will Buy Aetna, Reshaping Health Care As Amazon Looms
"
39,HUM,"CVS Health (CVS) will buy Aetna (AET) for about $67.5 billion, creating a health-care giant that will have a hand in everything from insurance to the corner drugstore.X CVS will pay $207 a share for Aetna, with $145 a share in cash and the rest in stock, the companies said in a statement Sunday. That's a 29% premium to Aetna's share price on Oct. 25, the day before the companies were reported to be in talks.The deal is among the biggest health-care mergers of the past decade, combining the largest U.S. drugstore chain with the third-biggest health insurer. CVS also manages drug-benefits plans for employers and insurers, a business that could help steer some of Aetna's 22 million customers into CVS drugstores when they fill a prescription. The deal will give Aetna's insurance plans a closer on-the-ground tie to where customers get care.Including CVS's assumption of Aetna's debt, the deal will be valued at $78 billion. It's expected to close in the second half of 2018, the companies said.In a joint interview, CVS Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo and Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said combining the companies would help CVS expand a variety of retail medical services, from vision care to nutrition advice to audiology, making basic care more convenient and less costly for consumers. Aetna will be operated as a separate business unit, and any new services will be designed to appeal broadly to customers of other insurance companies as well, the executives said.The immediate financial benefits of the deal are projected to be relatively modest. The companies said they expect $750 million in synergies, and profit improvements in the low-to-mid single digits the second full year after the merger is completed. The companies are betting on longer-term profit from reshaping how their customers get care, by creating what the executives are calling ""10,000 new front doors for the health-care system'' at CVS's stores and clinics.""Think of these stores as a hub of a new way of accessing health-care services across America,'' Merlo said in the joint interview. ""We're bringing health care to where people live and work.''s into CVS drugstores when they fill a prescription through CVS's drug plans. It will also give Aetna's insurance plans a closer on-the-ground tie to where customers get care.The deal will be financed with a mix of cash and debt. Barclays, Goldman Sachs. and Bank of America have committed to provide $49 billion of financing, the person said. It's expected to close in the second half of 2018 and create cost savings of about $750 million, said the person.After the deal closes, Aetna will operate as a separate unit run by members of the current management. Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini will join the CVS board, along with two other Aetna directors.It comes as the health sector is looking over the horizon at Amazon.com (AMZN), and how the company could shake up the business of buying, distributing and selling drugs and medical products if it gets into health care. The retail industry has been battered by the online giant. Amazon hasn't revealed its plans.""One of the problems with the health-care system is it's so fragmented and there's so little coordination,"" said Steve Kraus, who invests in health firms at Bessemer Venture Partners. ""A better vertically integrated less-siloed system is a good thing in my mind.""It could also set off a new round of takeovers as CVS and Aetna's competitors look at the reshaped landscape. On Nov. 30, the CEO of Express Scripts (ESRX) said the pure-play pharmacy benefits manager would be open to a deal at the right price, though wasn't actively looking for one.""We don't need to sell to be very successful in the future, but we are always open to others who may all of sudden conclude they want what we have,"" Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth said in an interview. He also mentioned the possibility of partnering with Amazon on a drug distribution arrangement.Express Scripts is just one company in a universe of independent drug plans, insurers and supply-chain middlemen. WellCare Health Plans (WCG), Humana (HUM) and Centene (CNC) could become merger targets after the CVS-Aetna deal, according to Matthew Borsch, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. Drug distributors like Cardinal Health (CAH) or McKesson (MCK), and retailers such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) could also face pressure to find partners.CVS, which operates about 9,700 retail stores and 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, has been moving beyond it drugstore roots for years. In 2007, it bought pharmacy-benefits manager Caremark Rx — a business that made up almost half of the Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company's operating profit in the third quarter. In 2014, CVS stopped selling cigarettes and added ""Health"" to its name.""Aetna has emphasized its desire to move care closer to the consumer,"" Brian Tanquilut, an analyst at Jefferies, said on Oct. 26. ""CVS's capabilities, including Minute Clinic and the Coram home infusion business, could enable the health plan to improve health outcomes and reduce cost trend.""Consolidation is picking up among health-care suppliers and administrators, as insurers seek more control over how their consumers get care. But two proposed megamergers among insurers — including a deal between Aetna and Humana — were blocked this year on antitrust grounds, leading the companies to look beyond rival insurers to different types of health-care companies for potential deals.The CVS-Aetna deal antitrust prospects may depend on which U.S. regulator is tasked with reviewing it, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Rie. The Federal Trade Commission has been less critical of consolidation among companies in adjacent businesses, known as vertical consolidation. The Justice Department, on the other hand, last month sued to block the merger of AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX), a vertical deal.Michael Newshel, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said the DOJ effort to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal does raises concerns but a CVS-Aetna deal does have a path forward. Aetna would likely need to divest some or all of its Medicare drug plan business, he said.The biggest U.S. health insurer, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), is also the most diversified. United owns doctor clinics and an outpatient surgery chain, and also has a pharmacy-benefits management, called OptumRx, built on the acquisition of Catamaran Corp. in 2015

42,HUM,"New products and services are the key to prosperity for businesses. In fact, those introduced in the last five years account for more than 30% of U.S. companies' sales.That's from Robert Cooper, author of ""Winning at New Products: Creating Value Through Innovation."" Cooper, a distinguished academic and fellow of the Product Development and Management Association since 1999, says there is also flip side.""It's estimated that almost half the resources that U.S. firms spend on product innovation is spent on failures, while only one new-product concept out of seven becomes a commercial winner,"" he said.Cooper says extensive research shows there are proven ways for companies to move the odds of success and profitability more in their favor.Some tips:Create unquestioned value. One way to beat the one-in-seven odds of new-product success, Cooper wrote, is to ""find big problems, then create big, bold solutions.""Most new products are ""tired, ho-hum, or copycat efforts that lack a wow factor for the customers,"" he said.A product that has unique benefits for users, he adds, has five times the success rate, four times the market share and four times the profitability of the ones that don't.Understand your market. Not knowing the customer and the market remains the No. 1 cause of new-product failures, Cooper states. ""Most people make too many assumptions about what the customer wants, needs or values, and many are wrong!""Exercise detailed preparation. Cooper's studies reveal that the steps that precede the actual design and development of the product make the difference between success and failure.The best innovators, he added, ""do their homework and make the front end a lot less fuzzy.""Avoid loose definitions and vague assumptions. Cooper says to always keep at the forefront of your thinking the target market; the product concept in detail; and the benefits to be delivered to the user.Experiment and learn. To better understand what consumers see as having value, constantly validate a new product by testing it with them regularly throughout development, Cooper says.Get feedback and then revise your thinking, he says. ""Do this early, often and cheaply.""Jay Goldman, co-founder of Sensei Labs, a developer of data-driven workflow solutions, suggests getting out there and talking to your prospective customers to learn what they really want. He references the book, ""The Four Steps to the Epiphany,"" which says that when it comes to new products, no facts exist inside the building, only opinions.Seek out new technologies. Erik Ritchie, vice president of e-commerce for Zenni Optical, a leading online eyewear brand, says  build bridges between your various vendors so that they can collaboratively be part of your approach to job-flow automation. This is what allows a product to be produced at the highest rate while keeping costs to a minimum, he adds.Goldman points out that utilizing technology to automate those common, repetitive product-launch tasks, when applicable, frees ""your team up to focus on your core objective — getting your product into market!""Keep listening. Companies should remain in constant communication with their customers via a network of phone, email, chat, SMS and social media, Ritchie said.""This daily flow of information helps the organization to assist customers in the moment as well as to identify areas of improvement for every facet of the product or service,"" he said.It's also a way to monitor the pulse of changing customer needs.Capitalize on opportunities. Consumers looking for additional information about your new product or service are a built-in audience. By creating compelling and innovative informational content you have another chance to educate and sell them.Ritchie recommends taking a tiered approach where content on a specific issue is available in short, medium and long forms. Doing so allows customers to quickly find easy-to-consume content that should resolve most issues and provide the option to learn more.""It's also valuable to use multiple formats from written text to imagery to video in order to serve each customer's individual learning preference,"" he said.MORE SECRETS TO SUCCESS:7 Smart Ways To Elicit Honest Feedback9 Steps To Take From Failure To Greater SuccessGood Lessons From Bad Bosses6 Strategies For Staging Goal-Driven Meetings5 Genius Ways To Sharpen Your Mental Acuity

43,HUM,"Sen. John McCain almost certainly just killed TrumpCare — and gave a boost to managed-care stocks such as UnitedHealth (UNH) and Centene (CNC). The Arizona Republican declared that he couldn't ""in good conscience"" vote for the Graham-Cassidy plan to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with block grants to states.I cannot in good conscience vote for Graham-Cassidy. A bill impacting so many lives deserves a bipartisan approach. https://t.co/2sDjhw6Era pic.twitter.com/30OWezQpLg— John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) September 22, 2017The news brought a sudden turnaround in managed-care stocks, though much of that was short-lived. Shares of Centene, whose fortunes are more tied to the ObamaCare exchanges and Medicaid than any other leading insurer, vaulted into positive territory on the stock market today. After being down more than 3%, Centene shot up to gain 3%, closing with an advance of 1.6%. Dow component UnitedHealth, which had been down more than 2%, finished off 1.1%. While UnitedHealth has bailed on the exchanges, it serves about 6 million Medicaid beneficiaries. Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) both closed 0.1% higher.Hospital operator HCA Healthcare (HCA) went from near the flatline to up 0.7% after McCain's remarks, made shortly before 2 p.m. ET.The rebound in insurers and hospitals also helped the Dow industrials pare losses and the S&P 500 index to close up 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite moved to a 0.1% gain.IBD'S TAKE: Centene isn't just widely acknowledged to be the insurer to best capitalize on the ObamaCare exchanges, it's also ranked No. 1 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care group based on earnings, sales and margin trends, as well as stock performance. Check out how other insurers stack up at IBD Stock Checkup. The industry group is ranked 39 of 197 based on price performance, getting a ""neutral"" grade from IBD. Breakout stock candidates are more likely to be successful if their industry group ranks among the top 40.Before McCain spoke, the Medical-Managed Care industry group was down about 5% on the week, putting in No. 194 among 197 IBD industry groups.The last-ditch repeal bill from GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy would shift ObamaCare funding to the states via block grants — through a formula that advantages states which didn't expand Medicaid, while sticking it to states that did. Including a cap on growth of per-beneficiary Medicaid subsidies, the bill would cut federal outlays by about $200 billion from 2020-2026.Congress has until Sept. 30 to pass legislation using a filibuster-proof budget reconciliation procedure that expires at the end of the fiscal year. Extending the ObamaCare-repeal effort is unlikely because it could make tax reform more difficult.RELATED:Wall Street Is Taking The Latest ObamaCare Repeal Push SeriouslyStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksObamaCare Repeal Is Dead: Here Are The 2 Big WinnersObamaCare Fines Nailed The Working Class In 2017 And Other Unpopular Truths
"
44,HUM,"Six months after President Trump embraced ""our wonderful new Healthcare Bill,"" and a month after it was last left for dead, Republicans are down to just 18 days to repeal and replace ObamaCare.XWhile TrumpCare has reemerged in an undead state before, zombies don't move that fast, and the fiscal 2017 budget resolution allowing the GOP to do an end-run around a Democratic filibuster is set to expire at midnight on Sept. 30.Trump, with his focus turned to tax cuts, appears to lack enthusiasm for one last massive push. Over the weekend, he tweeted: ""Republicans, sorry, but I've been hearing about Repeal & Replace for 7 years, didn't happen!""He added: ""Republicans must start the Tax Reform/Tax Cut legislation ASAP. Don't wait until the end of September. Needed now more than ever. Hurry!""While the final whistle hasn't blown, it seems pretty clear that two big winners have emerged from the Republicans' defeat: Bernie Sanders and his vision of Medicare for all, and — if stock prices are an accurate gauge — the health insurance industry.IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group is one of the best-performing sectors since Election Day, rising 40% compared with a 17% gain for the S&P 500 index.Centene (CNC), the biggest remaining player on the ObamaCare exchanges and a major participant in the Medicaid expansion, is currently ranked No. 1 in the managed care group by IBD based on stock performance, earnings, revenue, and profit margin trends. Centene announced a $3.75 billion deal to buy Fidelis Care, expanding its reach into New York.The four companies that had their mergers blown apart early in 2017 — Anthem (ANTM), Cigna (CI), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) — all are up in excess of 40%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH), the biggest of the bunch and a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, is up 38%, vs. 21% for the overall average.On Tuesday, managed care stocks lagged the major indexes, led lower by Anthem, which signaled it may pull out of more ObamaCare exchange markets in 2018. Insurers have until Sept. 27 to finalize their plans.IBD'S TAKE: Most managed care stocks are too extended to chase, meaning they're at least 5% beyond a buy point, the optimal point for acquiring shares to maximize chances for a near-term gain. Here's a good place to start to find stocks that may be setting up for advances. The group of stocks that fit IBD's investing criteria on the IBD Leaderboard have outperformed the S&P 500 by 60% this year.What is interesting is that the gains come even as support for single payer is on the rise and Sanders rails that the health care system is failing because ""it is largely designed not to provide quality care in a cost-effective way, but to make maximum profits for health insurance companies,"" as well as drug and medical equipment companies.Managed care investors aren't yet worried about single payer because it probably can't happen before 2021, may not happen at all because its financing will be controversial, and even if it does, it still doesn't rule out a big role for private insurers. After all, many states have turned their Medicaid programs over to managed care companies, and Medicare Advantage is one of the reasons profits are surging for Humana and others.On Wednesday, Sanders unveiled his Medicare-for-all legislation, and he's no longer a voice in the wilderness. Four potential 2020 contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination have signed on as co-sponsors, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and New York's Kristen Gillibrand. Even relatively conservative West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin said Tuesday that single payer is worthy of consideration.The lack of popularity for the Affordable Care Act and the horrific polling for the GOP TrumpCare plans have left an opening for Sanders, whose big unveiling may even overshadow the expected release of new repeal-and-replace legislation from GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy.Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky both threw cold water on prospects for the new bill on Monday. Paul, whose state of Kentucky stands to be among the bigger losers under the Graham-Cassidy plan, said that the bill would probably be worse than doing nothing.Even as some Republicans push for one more attempt at killing ObamaCare, others in the GOP are negotiating with Democrats on a plan to shore up the exchanges to avoid a premium spike in 2018.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks Trump's Debt Deal With Democrats Sinks Tax-Cut Hopes: Goldman Sachs Trump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesObamaCare Fines Nailed The Working Class In 2017 And Other Unpopular Truths

Wall Street analysts had expected EPS of $3.17 and revenue of $15.37 billion. The delivery giant said it would have posted EPS of $3.32 minus the adverse events. It also lowered full-year guidance. But FedEx shares rose 2.4% for the week to 220, flirting with a 220.09 buy point off a flat base. The shipper is bumping up rates for many services by 5% starting Jan. 1.Shares in T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S) jumped 4.7% and 10.8%, resectively, amid reports that their stalled merger talks may be back on and near an agreement. Shares in cell tower operators down. The wireless operators are said to be looking at an all-stock deal that would give Deutsche Telekom control. They have yet to agree upon an exchange ratio based on each company's valuation. But Sprint and T-Mobile shares rose again early Friday on a report that the telecoms were near a deal on terms.Adobe Systems (ADBE) earnings rose 47% in fiscal Q3 as revenue swelled 26% to $1.84 billion, both above views. But investors focused on lower-than-expected bookings for Adobe's Experience Cloud business, which includes online marketing, advertising and analytics services. Adobe blamed longer sales cycles for closing deals worth over $1 million each. Adobe guided higher on earnings, but in line on sales.

Alnylam spiked 52% Wednesday after reporting strong late-stage data for a rare-disease drug, prompting rival Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) to plunge 8.8%. Adamas, on Tuesday, hit a 20-month high after announcing it will charge $28,500 per patient per year for its Parkinson's drug, Gocovri. Aerie, though, dipped to a three-week low after the FDA set a committee review date for its glaucoma drug, Rhopressa. Meanwhile, Intercept neared a four-year low Thursday after the FDA warned of liver damage and death related to its drug, Ocaliva. Versartis cratered Friday after its drug for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency didn't meet a late-stage trial goal.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) got the nod from regulators to purchase 1,932 Rite Aid (RAD) stores, less than what it agreed to in June, along with three distribution centers and other assets for $4.375 billion in cash.

46,HUM,"TrumpCare is back and could become the law of the land next week.While the coming vote to repeal and replace ObamaCare could go either way, Wall Street is taking this latest GOP effort seriously. Investors are bailing on health insurance stocks such as UnitedHeath Group (UNH) and Centene (CNC), while hospital stocks continued to sag.The biggest ObamaCare players were the hardest hit, with Centene sinking 5.1% and Molina Healthcare (MOH) down 5.9%. Both Centene and Molina hitched their fates to ObamaCare in a significant way, as the Medicaid managed-care companies seized the opportunity to enter the individual insurance market.Both stand to be hurt if the new GOP bill from Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy can get through Congress by Sept. 30. The clock is ticking because passage depends on using budget reconciliation to avoid a Democratic filibuster. Once the 2017 budget resolution expires on the last day of the fiscal year, the GOP would have to start from scratch.While the Congressional Budget Office hasn't yet scored the bill, the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says that Cassidy-Graham would cut ObamaCare funding by $239 billion from 2020 through 2026, while killing the law's subsidies and sending the money to states, which would have to figure out how best to spend it, free from much of ObamaCare's regulations.On top of that, Medicaid would impose a cap on costs per beneficiary, lowering spending by $175 billion over the same span. In 2026, the total cut in funding under Cassidy-Graham would amount to $80 billion.Even insurers that don't rank as big fans of ObamaCare saw their stocks come under pressure on Tuesday. Dow component UnitedHealth slipped 1.8%, while Humana (HUM) lost 3.4% and Aetna (AET) 3.1%. UnitedHealth, Humana and Aetna all traded at or just below their 50-day moving averages, an area of key support.IBD'S TAKE: While managed-care stocks have been solid performers lately, they aren't acting well right now. Here's a good place to start to find stocks that may be setting up for near-term advances. The group of stocks that fit IBD's investing criteria on the IBD Leaderboard have outperformed the S&P 500 by 44% this year.Among hospital stocks, HCA Healthcare (HCA) fell 1.8%, close to an eight-month low, while Tenet Healthcare (THC) dipped 0.7%, losing ground for a third straight session.One stock that stands to benefit from the legislation is Healthequity (HQY), which provides technology that lets consumers manage their health savings account, whose limits would be increased under Cassidy-Graham. Shares of Healthequity rose 3.5%.Investors seem to have been caught by surprise by the sudden revival of TrumpCare's prospects. Even President Trump tweeted the other week that it was time for the GOP to move on from repealing ObamaCare and focus on tax reform.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksObamaCare Repeal Is Dead: Here Are The 2 Big WinnersObamaCare Fines Nailed The Working Class In 2017 And Other Unpopular Truths

47,HUM,"Aetna (AET), which scaled back its ObamaCare exchange presence this year, easily beat second-quarter earnings estimates early Thursday, while Molina Healthcare (MOH) which dove deeper into the individual insurance market, saw its shares tumble after reporting a huge loss.XAetna earned $3.42 per share, up 55% from a year ago. Revenue slipped 3% to $15.5 billion amid its pullback from the ObamaCare exchange business. Analysts expected Aetna to earn $2.35 a share on revenue of $15.39 billion.After the close on Wednesday, Molina reported a loss of $4.10 a share vs. a 58-cent profit a year ago, largely blaming its ObamaCare exchange business. The company said it will pull out of the Wisconsin and Utah markets and scale back its presence in Washington state. In its remaining markets, Molina said it will hike premiums at least 30% in 2018, but that could rise to 55% if President Trump makes good on his promise to withhold the law's cost-sharing subsidies that make coverage affordable for low-income enrollees.Shares of Aetna rose 2.5% to 158.57 on the stock market today. Molina shares tumbled 5.9% to 62.32 after hitting 59.41 intraday.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Aetna have been on a roll since the stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base on April 28, often a sign that a stock is poised for a near-term advance.Despite some signs that the exchange markets are stabilizing, Molina's results suggest that problems are still lurking and that certain markets remain troubled.Anthem (ANTM) cited market instability in announcing on Tuesday that it will shrink its presence in California in 2018, leaving about 150,000 customers to look for a new carrier. Anthem already had announced plans to pull out of the Wisconsin, Indiana and Ohio markets, and it's seeking rate increases of 20% or more in many of its remaining markets.On the other hand, Centene (CNC) has said that it will expand into additional state exchanges next year as its individual market business performs well. Centene is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care group based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance.Meanwhile, Humana (HUM) said that its exchange results took a turn for the better in the second quarter. Humana now expects to turn an $85 million profit from its individual insurance business this year, vs. earlier guidance of a $45 million loss. Still, the company will fully exit the individual market at the end of the year as it focuses on government programs like Medicare Advantage and Medicare's prescription drug program in the wake of its acquisition by Aetna being blocked by courts.Humana shares, which reported strong Q2 results Wednesday, rose 4.5% that day. Humana rose 3.2% on Thursday.RELATED:Managed Care Stocks Fall As Trump Tweets: 'Hurt The Insurance Companies'ObamaCare Fines Nailed The Working Class In 2017 And Other Unpopular TruthsUnitedHealth Raises Full-Year Target After Q2 Earnings Jump 25.5%

48,HUM,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings before Tuesday's market open. Revenue was about in line with analyst forecasts. The health insurer giant also raised full-year guidance. Shares rose a fraction. XEstimates: Earnings per share should rise 21% to $2.38 a share, with revenue climbing 8% to $50.082 billion. That would represent the second quarter of decelerating earnings growth and the smallest revenue gain in 10 quarters.Results: Earnings per share of $2.46 a share, up 25.5% vs. a year earlier. Revenue rose 8% to $50.053 billion. UnitedHealth's Optum services unit saw a 9.9% revenue rise.Outlook: UnitedHealth now sees adjusted full-year profit $9.75-$9.90 a share. Analysts had expected $9.81 before Q2's results.Stock: UnitedHealth rose 0.3% to 186.96 on the stock market today, hitting a new record high. The Dow Jones industrial average component has been consolidating since peaking at 188.66 on June 22, closing Monday at 186.35.Why It Matters: UnitedHealth is the first of the major health insurers to report second-quarter earnings, with Aetna (AET), Anthem (ANTM), Cigna (CI), Humana (HUM) and others due in the coming weeks. (The U.S. government blocked proposed mergers of Anthem-Cigna and Aetna-Humana earlier this year on antitrust grounds.)UnitedHealth has exited the ObamaCare exchanges, with most of the other big insurers also on their way out aside from Medicaid specialists such as Centene (CNC). But it's still a huge player in Medicare and Medicaid.So Senate Republicans's late Monday decision to pull their health care bill could have a significant impact on UnitedHealth and other insurers.RELATED:Dow's Visa, American Express Are In Buy Zones Ahead Of EarningsThese 2 Drug Giants In Buy Range Just Beat Earnings ViewsDow's UnitedHealth Rises On Blowout Q1 EarningsBank Of America, Goldman Sachs Earnings Top, But Trading Weak

The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.3% while average hourly wages rose a solid 0.3%. The report is more evidence of tighter labor markets, though it likely won't shift the Federal Reserve's policy path in the near future. Meanwhile, ISM surveys signaled still-strong manufacturing growth while some decelerating growth in the service sector.Grubhub (GRUB) and Yelp (Yelp) both topped second-quarter earnings and revenue estimates late Thursday. As part of a long-term partnership, Grubhub will pay $287.5 million in cash to acquire Yelp's online food ordering and delivery business, Eat24. The partnership comes as Amazon (AMZN) is getting more aggressive in the food delivery market. Grubhub rose 9.2% on Friday while Yelp shot up nearly 28%.Symantec (SYMC), Qualys (QYLS) and FireEye (FEYE) reported better-than-expected June-quarter results, following computer security peer Proofpoint (PFPT) last week. Symantec's adjusted fiscal first-quarter earnings rose 14% as revenue climbed 39% to $1.23 billion. Symantec agreed to sell its website security business to DigiCert for about $950 million cash.

"
50,HUM,"After years of subjecting ObamaCare to the harshest criticism, the Senate GOP's struggles to come up with a replacement over the past several weeks have been a revelation: A critical mass of Republican senators seem to be saying that wresting the health care security provided by the law from their constituents is a nonstarter.That leaves Congress with two possible paths forward. The most likely path is a form of triage that would try to control the bleeding, rather than address ObamaCare's underlying problems that explain why enrollment was weak even before premiums spiked, and why the law was unpopular before ""mean"" TrumpCare came on the scene.Stabilizing insurance markets, principally by providing protection for insurers against high-claims customers, is a good idea and an important step. But let's be clear about what that won't achieve: It won't create a robust nongroup insurance market with rules that Americans can broadly support, and that work reasonably well for the finances of healthy and sick, old and young, working class and middle class.To create a robust nongroup insurance market with lower premiums that serves people well will require taking the other potential path forward: transforming the Affordable Care Act, largely by injecting the ingredient that Republicans say the law is most sorely lacking — freedom.While ObamaCare has helped the near-poor and those with chronic conditions who otherwise might be stuck without affordable coverage, it gives a bad deal to pretty much everyone else, which is why the exchanges' pool of customers is too small, too old and too costly, and premiums have soared as insurers like UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) have mostly exited the markets.Simply stabilizing the turbulent insurance-exchange markets wouldn't do anything to ameliorate ObamaCare's harshest reality: Even among working-class households earning 150% to 250% of the poverty level, supposedly among the law's biggest beneficiaries, just 1 in 3 people who lack insurance from other sources are getting coverage that will protect them from financial disaster. Most of the other two-thirds are uninsured, either because they or a spouse work full time and don't qualify for exchange subsidies, or else they've spurned subsidized bronze plans that carry $6,000-$7,000 deductibles — despite the threat of a individual-mandate penalty.While Americans aren't crying out for the freedom to buy the skimpiest coverage that insurers can dream up, and pretty much everybody would rather have insurance than not — if the price is right — many people would benefit from greater flexibility than the ACA allows, and the entire country would benefit from a bipartisan consensus on health reform that helps those who have fallen through ObamaCare's wide cracks.That is why the very best step for public policy, within the realm of what might be possible, would be to give people a choice between the comprehensive coverage that Democrats want them to have — and that many people with chronic conditions or low incomes clearly need — and the consumer-driven model that Republicans believe in, which allows people to opt for high-deductible coverage and set aside funds to cover basic medical needs.This would involve turning ObamaCare's cost-sharing support into something more akin to working-class tax cuts and removing ObamaCare's heaviest-handed mandates, while preserving the ACA's critical protections and support.A central problem with ObamaCare is that the rules stacked the deck in favor of those needing comprehensive coverage, leaving far too many in the working class with three unappealing options: a silver plan that costs too much; a bronze plan that won't pay their medical bills until long after they're in financial distress; or an individual-mandate penalty for opting against coverage that may be of little use.Think of a couple, age 30, in St. Louis with income of $40,000 (about 200% of the poverty level) and a child covered by Medicaid. For this couple, the cheapest silver plan under ObamaCare offers pretty solid coverage but costs $2,430 — likely too much for a young family that's probably already struggling to save anything. The cheapest bronze plan, costing $1,068, might be doable, but the $13,300 deductible ($6,650 per person) could make a hospital stay financially devastating.The chasm between ObamaCare's silver and bronze deductibles — $700 vs. $13,300 — is by design, though clearly a poor one. ObamaCare provides extra cost-sharing subsidies that shrink deductibles for modest-income households, but only if they buy silver plans. Those cost-sharing subsidies work exactly like premium subsidies, paid directly from the government to insurers each month, even if the policyholder gets no medical care.Looking through the lens of these 30-year-olds in St. Louis, a bipartisan replacement, merging Republican principles and Democratic values, is easy to identify.First, don't get rid of the comprehensive option. If this couple is trying to have a second child or one spouse has a chronic condition, they will be desperate for a low-deductible plan with a wide range of essential benefits.Second, offer people the flexibility to choose a Republican option. A replacement for ObamaCare could give young, modest-income families the chance to set aside some savings for health expenses with two simple tweaks. Relax ObamaCare's age-rating restrictions that inflate insurance costs for the young, but only for high-deductible plans, keeping comprehensive plans affordable for older adults. (That could mean silver plans with a 3:1 age rating, bronze 4:1 and catastrophic 5:1.)Next, let people use cost-sharing subsidies to reduce premiums, if they prefer, effectively making it a tax cut. Those two steps would shrink that St. Louis couple's bronze premium to zero, and they'd have about $900 left to put in a Health Savings Account to defray medical expenses — not nirvana, but a dramatic improvement over what ObamaCare offers. Yes, this family would still be subject to very high deductibles, but no greater than under ObamaCare, and they'd have a $2,000 head start on their medical bills, giving them a chance to put aside some savings — not because their tax credits are more generous than under ObamaCare but because they would be more usable.From 100% to 150% of the poverty level (about $12,000-$18,000 for a single), roughly 90% of exchange enrollees sign up for silver coverage. Bronze-level deductibles would be almost too extreme to bother — if not for the mandate penalty — though some percentage don't bother and remain uninsured. So here's a beautiful compromise that would inject some freedom and flexibility — but not too much — into the ACA.ACA cost-sharing subsidies, which are even higher for this income tier, turn silver plans to ultra-low-deductible platinum plans. That option would still be available, but they also could opt to use their cost-sharing subsidy to cover a basic silver-plan premium and deposit the extra amount in a Health Savings Account. What's beautiful about this is that the bar on minimum coverage would rise compared to the ACA, yet people would still have more freedom to pick a plan that works for their finances and their health status.IBD'S TAKE: IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" on Tuesday, June 27, a signal to investors to exercise extra caution in buying stocks and to take some money off the table to deploy when the turbulence subsides. Make sure to read IBD's The Big Picture each day to get the latest on whether the flashing-yellow market trend turns green.We also should do something about the steep drop-off in cost-sharing subsidies that acts as a disincentive to earn above 200% of the poverty level and is an especially big deal for people with significant medical needs. A more gradual phase-out by 300% of the poverty level would provide more constructive incentives, while delivering modest tax cuts to income-tax-paying households. Premiums could essentially be free for everyone up to 250% of the poverty level — if a catastrophic-plan option is made available to people above 200% of the poverty level and they opt to apply their cost-sharing subsidy to the premium for the lowest-cost plan, roughly around the ""copper"" option proposed by the insurance industry and some moderate Democrats.This is another compromise in which both sides win. Above 200% of the poverty level, ObamaCare's cracks widen in a serious way. The percentage of the uninsured under ObamaCare takes a big jump, and so does take-up of bronze coverage. Easing the cost-sharing subsidy cliff won't only make it more attractive for people to get coverage, albeit higher-deductible coverage, but it will allow people who need comprehensive coverage to get a better policy than they do under ObamaCare, since the bigger cost-sharing subsidy will effectively turn a silver plan to gold.Meanwhile, freedom to choose a catastrophic plan with a 5:1 age-rating should satisfy the GOP that the reformed insurance markets will provide sufficient flexibility to meet the needs of all comers. Democrats should acknowledge that it's far better to let a young adult member of the working class get a higher-deductible plan for free than pay a penalty for going uninsured, and the broader, healthier risk pool will serve to hold down premiums for everyone.As for the individual mandate, among the biggest issues of contention, if people earning up to 250% of the poverty level can get high-deductible coverage essentially for free — and in most cases get extra cash on top — there should be no need to threaten them with fines.Above 250% of the poverty level, an alternative to the individual mandate is well worth considering. Among the reasons that the ObamaCare individual mandate doesn't work very well is that relatively young and healthy people who gamble on going without coverage can reasonably expect to win their bet and end up with a financial gain. ObamaCare encourages this kind of short-term calculation, since only those who get sick pay a price.A more logical approach would eliminate the incentive to go without coverage when one is young and healthy, then sign up when one's health starts deteriorating. Much like Medicare's late-enrollment penalties, the idea would be to very gradually shrink future tax subsidies based on how long people go without coverage. This should apply to both the individual market and employer market, or else people would have reason not to get coverage between jobs that offer insurance. The key for this to work in the constructive way intended is that subsidies must be sufficient to make coverage affordable, or else people would opt out for legitimate financial reasons and their future cost of coverage would gradually become even less affordable.Even without this more constructive incentive, it's important to give members of the middle class a better deal than they get now. Those who earn too much to receive ObamaCare subsidies — including young adults earning well below the official cut-off at 400% of the poverty level — should be treated more equitably relative to their peers covered through the workplace.A fiscally responsible solution would be to put a floor on tax credits for anyone buying coverage on the individual market equal to 25% of the cost of a silver plan, while limiting the income-tax benefit to 25% of the cost of employer-provided coverage and capping that benefit for high-income households. People in the 25% tax bracket (up to $91,151 for singles and $151,900 for married couples) who get coverage from an employer wouldn't be touched by the tax change, while there would be minimal effect on those in the 28% bracket (up to $190,150 for singles and $231,450 for couples).The sad reality today is that ObamaCare throws millions of modest-wage, full-time workers under the bus. There are some 4.5 million uninsured full-time workers who — along with their spouses — don't qualify for exchange subsidies, even if bronze-level workplace coverage costs close to 10% of income, which ObamaCare deems ""affordable"" but clearly isn't. That can amount to five times what people pay on the subsidized exchanges, sometimes even more. That's why perhaps a million other modest-wage earners — solid numbers are hard to come by — opt for ""skinny"" coverage at work that won't pay for hospitalization or surgery but will keep them from having to pay a mandate penalty. This is worth repeating: The skimpy coverage that Democrats hate is exactly the kind of insurance-in-name-only-coverage that a lot of low-wage, full-time workers are settling for under ObamaCare.The employer mandate is easy to dodge and ends up harming the low-wage workers it was supposed to help. Getting rid of it is a progressive thing to do — especially if it is done while fixing the individual insurance market.Finally, we should allow states that haven't expanded Medicaid to do so while limiting the expansion to 100% of the poverty level, easing the fiscal burden of the expansion on states, as suggested by Urban Institute scholars.The Health Care Security & Freedom Act wouldn't deliver gold-plated insurance to most people, but it is the least we can do. All of these features would create a broad, stable risk pool, with affordable coverage options and plenty of flexibility to let people get the coverage that they believe suits them best. While they entail a fiscal cost, we can tackle that while still putting the nation on a sounder fiscal course and strengthening the social safety net.Having a robust nongroup market for insurance that serves people well should be a priority for the nation. The dynamism of our economy will be better served if entrepreneurs and idealists who are willing to step out on a limb don't have to fear that their health insurance support will come crashing down. Demographic changes make it increasingly important for people to have the flexibility to step back from full-time work to help care for an aging parent or a sick child. Amid minimum-wage pressures and health care mandates, ultra-competitive markets and the advance of technology threaten to widen the cracks in our employer-centric insurance system that millions of workers, many with modest wages, are already falling into. And don't forget that we're entering the ninth year of an economic expansion. When the next recession hits, all of these pressures will multiply and millions more people will depend on insurance outside the employer system.RELATED:Senate Delays TrumpCare Vote, Pressuring Stock MarketTrumpCare: Almost Everyone Gets A Worse DealHow To Replace ObamaCare And Save Social Security

51,HUM,"After a ho-hum 2016, $12.1 billion MainStay Large Cap Growth Fund (MLAAX) is having a hi-ho 2017. The fund's 2.62% setback last year badly lagged the S&P 500's 11.96% gain. It trailed 90% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. But its 21.24% gain this year going into Thursday more than doubled the big-cap bogey's 10.32% return and trumped 89% of its direct rivals.XThe fund's rally reflects the market's shift away from defensive, low-growth staples-providers and higher-dividend stocks, which dominated for much of last year, to the sort of higher growth stocks that the fund favors. Fund co-manager Patrick Burton — on this job since early 2013 — says leading technology stocks in particular have been buoyed by market-share gains and strong earnings. Burton and lead manager Justin Kelly are with subadvisor Winslow Capital.Reflecting that market tilt, the fund has been boosted this year by such holdings as Alibaba Group (BABA), which is up 66%. The fund also holds graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), which is up 46% this year. Digital-media and marketing-software firm Adobe Systems (ADBE) is up 39%. Biomed Celgene (CELG), which is up 14%, is a fast grower in health care.""Alibaba is the No. 1 player in e-commerce in China,"" Burton said. It is benefiting from the shift to mobile devices. Gross sales are still growing rapidly despite its size. And Alibaba Cloud, like Amazon Web Services, is growing very fast, he says.Nvidia is benefiting from a shift toward the use of graphics processing units (GPU), away from regular CPU computer chips, because of their faster processing speeds in applications such as artificial intelligence and self-driving cars, Burton says.Adobe is shifting from selling software licenses to annual subscriptions. ""Customers churn less and buy more"" under that model, Burton says.Celgene stock is up due to a combination of decent earnings and attractive valuation ""since biotech has been under pressure for a couple of years,"" Burton said.Over the past 10 years, the fund's 8.18% average annual gain topped 72% of its rivals. Winslow's Kelly has been at the helm since late 2005.The fund aims to navigate through various market phases by adjusting its allocations among three types of growth stocks.One bucket holds stocks that the managers see as long-term, sustainable earnings growers. The second bucket holds quality cyclical growers, which may be more volatile. And the third holds stocks in newer industries with rapid growth.Visa (V) is a sustainable grower. Its takeover of Visa Europe boosts economies of scale and leads to better coordination of global marketing campaigns, Burton says, adding, ""It's a really steady Eddie, consistent grower.""Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) is one of the fund's cyclicals. They supply radio frequency filters for Apple (AAPL), Samsung and Chinese cellphones. ""What's changing is that they are moving into other products that need wireless applications like Tesla (TSLA) (cars),"" Burton said. ""They are pushing to get involved in the internet of things.""ServiceNow (NOW) is a new-industry stock, which is expanding from IT management for clients into new areas like cybersecurity and human resources.Celgene, whose cancer drug Revlimid is its flagship, is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group. The group is ranked No. 8 among 197.Wall Street expects earnings per share to climb 23% this year. Pretax margin last year of 50.4% was its highest in at least nine years.IBD'S TAKE: You can check out more of Celgene's fundamental and technical strengths in IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Illumina (ILMN) and Netflix (NFLX) were new additions to the fund's portfolio in the second quarter.Illumina is a leader in low-cost gene-sequencing equipment. Burton said, ""We believe Illumina will demonstrate an accelerating growth profile over the course of this year and next, driven by the launch of its new gene-sequencing instrument, Novaseq. We believe this acceleration will drive upside to (analysts') consensus (earnings) estimates.""Netflix returned to the portfolio after being sold. Its EPS rose 50%, 71%, 114% and 567% in the past four quarters.Netflix is facing increasing competition from Hulu and stocks like Amazon.com (AMZN) and YouTube-owner Google (GOOGL) — both also owned by MainStay Large Cap Growth. Netflix's drivers are its original programming and global expansion, Burton says.RELATED:MainStay Large Cap Growth Sees Market Tilting Toward Its Favorite Types Of Growth Stocks

52,HUM,"After railing for years about ObamaCare's affordability problems, Republicans came up with a plan that would make them exponentially worse.""Few low-income people would purchase any plan,"" the Congressional Budget Office said of the Senate TrumpCare bill, either because premiums for comprehensive coverage are out of reach, or deductibles for lower-cost plans amount to an untenable percentage of income  — more than one-third of income for individuals in some cases and potentially much more for families.TrumpCare is so ""mean"" — President Trump's own characterization of the House-passed bill — that relatively moderate GOP governors and senators have rejected it. Yet if TrumpCare is about to be buried and it's possible to start looking for a path forward, let's not forget that there's a reason ObamaCare was unpopular and suffered from weak marketplace enrollment even before TrumpCare came around.While ObamaCare has helped the near-poor and those with chronic conditions who otherwise might be stuck without affordable coverage, it gives a bad deal to pretty much everyone else. That's why the exchanges' pool of customers is too small, too old and too costly, and premiums have soared as insurers like UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) have mostly exited the markets.Unfortunately, the two most likely paths forward are forms of triage that would try to control the bleeding, rather than address ObamaCare's underlying affordability problems. One approach would focus on stabilizing insurance markets, principally by providing protection for insurers against high-claims customers — a good idea and an important step, but one that addresses the symptoms, not the underlying problem of affordability. After all, ObamaCare's unpopularity and weak enrollment preceded its premium spikes, so moderating premium increases isn't the answer.A second path, represented by the proposal from Republican senators Susan Collins of Maine and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, wouldn't actually fix anything. It forces states to choose between ObamaCare, with all of its problems, and a less-regulated alternative built around Health Savings Accounts that's guaranteed to undermine Affordable Care Act protections for low-income households and older adults facing high medical costs.So here's a crazy idea: How about Congress actually trying to deliver something that Americans can broadly support, that works for the finances of old and young, working class and middle class, and that will lead to stable insurance markets with lower premiums?There's no good reason to aim lower, and ideology shouldn't stand in the way. In fact, the very best step for public policy, within the realm of what might be possible, would be to give people a choice between the comprehensive coverage that Democrats want them to have — and that many people with chronic conditions or low incomes clearly need — and the consumer-driven model that Republicans believe in, which allows people to opt for catastrophic coverage and set aside funds to cover basic medical needs.This would involve turning ObamaCare's cost-sharing support into something more akin to working-class tax cuts and removing ObamaCare's heaviest-handed mandates, while preserving the ACA's critical protections and support.Here's ObamaCare's harsh reality that makes these changes so important — even if the law weren't under political attack and insurance markets weren't experiencing turbulence. Even among working-class households earning 150% to 250% of the poverty level, supposedly among ObamaCare's biggest beneficiaries, just 1 in 3 people who lack insurance from other sources are getting coverage that will protect them from financial disaster. Most of the other two-thirds are uninsured, either because they or a spouse work full time and don't qualify for exchange subsidies, or else they've spurned subsidized bronze plans that carry $6,000-$7,000 deductibles.IBD'S TAKE: Find out why hospital stocks rose and one analyst touted UnitedHealth and HCA Healthcare — even as Senate Republicans called for steep Medicaid cuts in a TrumpCare bill estimated to cut the ranks of the insured by 22 million. A central problem with ObamaCare is that the rules stacked the deck in favor of those needing comprehensive coverage, leaving far too many in the working class with three unappealing options: a silver plan that costs too much; a bronze plan that won't pay their medical bills until long after they're in financial distress; or an individual mandate penalty for opting against coverage that may be of little use.Think of a couple, age 30, in St. Louis with income of $40,000 (about 200% of the poverty level) and a child covered by Medicaid. For this couple, the cheapest silver plan under ObamaCare offers pretty solid coverage but costs $2,430 — likely too much for a young family that's probably already struggling to save anything. The cheapest bronze plan, costing $1,068, might be doable, but the $13,300 deductible ($6,650 per person) could make a hospital stay financially devastating. (By the way, that bronze option would be far worse under the Senate TrumpCare bill, costing roughly $2,000.)The chasm between ObamaCare's silver and bronze deductibles — $700 vs. $13,300 — is by design, though clearly a poor one. ObamaCare provides extra cost-sharing subsidies that shrink deductibles for modest-income households, but only if they buy silver plans. Those cost-sharing subsidies work exactly like premium subsidies, paid directly from the government to insurers each month, even if the policyholder gets no medical care.Looking through the lens of these 30-year-olds in St. Louis, a bipartisan replacement, merging Republican principles and Democratic values, is easy to identify.First, don't get rid of the comprehensive option. If this couple is trying to have a second child or one spouse has a chronic condition, they will be desperate for a low-deductible plan with a wide range of essential benefits.Second, offer people the flexibility to choose a Republican option. A replacement for ObamaCare could give young, modest-income families the chance to set aside some savings for health expenses with two simple tweaks. Relax ObamaCare's age-rating restrictions that inflate insurance costs for the young, but only for high-deductible plans, keeping comprehensive plans affordable for older adults. (That could mean silver plans with a 3:1 age rating, bronze 4:1 and catastrophic 5:1.)Next, let people use cost-sharing subsidies to reduce premiums, if they prefer, effectively making it a tax cut. Those two steps would shrink that St. Louis couple's bronze premium to zero, and they'd have about $900 left to put in a Health Savings Account to defray medical expenses — not nirvana, but a dramatic improvement over what ObamaCare offers.We also should do something about the steep drop off in cost-sharing subsidies that serves as a big disincentive to earn above 200% of the poverty level. A more gradual phase-out by 300% of the poverty level would provide more constructive incentives, while delivering modest tax cuts to income-tax-paying households. Premiums could essentially be free for everyone up to 250% of the poverty level — if a catastrophic-plan option is made available.Families above 200% of the poverty level, who are more likely to remain uninsured under ObamaCare, despite the mandate penalty, should be able to opt for coverage with higher deductibles than bronze, roughly around the ""copper"" option proposed by the insurance industry and some moderate Democrats.Freedom to choose a catastrophic plan with a 5:1 age-rating should satisfy the GOP that the reformed insurance markets will provide sufficient flexibility to meet the needs of all comers. Democrats should acknowledge that it's far better to let a young-adult member of the working class get a higher-deductible plan for free than pay a penalty for going uninsured, and the broader, healthier risk pool will serve to hold down premiums for everyone.As for the individual mandate, among the biggest issues of contention, if people earning up to 250% of the poverty level can get high-deductible coverage essentially for free — and in most cases get extra cash on top — there should be no need to threaten them with fines.Above 250% of the poverty level, an alternative to the individual mandate is well worth considering.

53,HUM,"Health Reform: This week ObamaCare suffered two more blows, making a replacement plan all the more urgent. Not that you'd know it, since all anyone wants to talk about is how horrible the Republican replacement plan supposedly would be. Why aren't Democrats being pressured to produce their own fix?The big news this week is supposed to be the Congressional Budget Office's decree that the Republicans' ObamaCare replacement plan would cost 23 million their insurance coverage. This number should be taken with a huge grain of salt, given the fact that the CBO predicted twice as many would sign up for ObamaCare plans as did so.What got considerably less attention, however, was the announcement by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas that it will drop out of ObamaCare next year, citing the fact that it had lost more than $100 million on its ObamaCare business, which ""is unsustainable for our company.""If no other insurer steps up to the plate, that could leave 25 counties in the region with no ObamaCare plans, adding still more areas in the country that may end up with no insurers in their exchanges next year, after Aetna, Humana (HUM) and Wellmark said they were bailing on some or all of their ObamaCare markets. Idaho is losing an insurer as well, as BridgeSpan announced that it won't be offering plans in the exchange next year.ObamaCare defenders can talk all they want about ObamaCare's ""guaranteed"" coverage, but if there aren't any insurers willing to sell ObamaCare plans, the guarantee is completely worthless.Meanwhile, a report from the Department of Health and Human Services out this week shows that average premiums in the individual markets have doubled since ObamaCare went into effect in 2014. If the three states where insurers have already announced premiums for 2018 are any indication, we're in for another round of eye-popping rate shocks.Democrats and their water carriers in the press want to blame the Republicans' repeal talk for these developments.This is false.Insurance defections and premium-rate shocks have been the norm under ObamaCare. Each year, more insurers dropped out amid massive losses, and those that remained sharply hike premiums. Last spring, for example, saw a raft of insurance company defections, including Blue Cross plans, despite the fact that nobody expected ObamaCare repeal to be a possibility at the time. And each year, ObamaCare backers promised that things will get better next year.So the question now is, if the GOP plan is so bad, what's the Democrats' alternative? What's their plan to cut premiums, stabilize insurance markets, increase competition, and cut the deficit (all of which ObamaCare was supposed to do in the first place)?Answer: They don't have one. And they don't intend to produce one.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi bragged to the Washington Post that the Democrats' strategy is not to put out a plan to rescue ObamaCare: ""Don't have an alternative until it's time. Keep the focus on what they're doing. Otherwise you just confuse people,"" she said.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the same thing. ""Different people have different ideas. We didn't lay out our exact specific plan. We laid out where we want to go."" (Democrats haven't even done that.)Roll Call's Jonathan Allen had it right when he wrote that if Democrats ""truly care about preventing regular folks from taking a devastating hit — and the richest Americans from consolidating wealth at the expense of the poor — they'll offer a serious substitute bill that addresses the shortcomings of ObamaCare.""The only fault in Allen's reasoning is that he assumes Democrats actually care about regular folks.RELATED:Unlike ObamaCare, The GOP Health Bill Wasn't Built On Lies And False PromisesSome Facts Jimmy Kimmel Left Out Of His Emotional ObamaCare PleaDems Taunt GOP For Voting To Replace A Collapsing ObamaCare

54,HUM,"A banner morning for steel stocks on Friday turned into a ho-hum day as the White House pushed back plans for a steel tariff announcement and U.S. trade partners pondered possible retaliation.Steel Dynamics (STLD) salvaged the best performance among U.S. steelmakers, rising 1.3% on the stock market today. But AK Steel (AKS) reversed lower to close down 2.7%. U.S. Steel (X) also gave up early gains, losing 1.8%. Nucor (NUE) slid 0.5% after climbing as much as 1.5%. Meanwhile, Europe-based Arcelor Mittal (MT) rose 1.7%.President Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross have whipped up expectations for a quick conclusion to the Trump administration investigation into whether steel imports are hurting national security, signaling that there's little doubt about how they'll rule.Early in the session, investors scooped up steel stocks after the news site Axios reported that Trump and a few key advisors made clear at a White House meeting this week that they're ""hell-bent on imposing tariffs — potentially in the 20% range — on steel, and likely other imports.""Cowen analyst Novid Rassouli said on Thursday that the government was expected to rule by Friday, and he predicted a significant potential rise in prices for hot-rolled coil steel. He noted that AK Steel and U.S. Steel could move to the upside after the decision.But on Thursday, the White House began to suggest that the tariff decision will be delayed. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that it might not come until after a mid-July summit of the leading global economies, known as the Group of 20.Late Friday, Bloomberg reported that Trump hasn't yet made up his mind about whether to impose tariffs, though there was no indication that he had given up the idea.A surprising amount of pushback — not just from steel purchasers and their representatives in Congress — but even from within the Trump administration. Reuters reported on Friday afternoon that the threat of Trump steel tariffs was sparking trade retaliation threats from the European Union, which sees the national security rationale as unwarranted.One potential outcome is that the tariffs will be smaller than expected. Earlier this month, Ross said that a combination of a tariff and quota would protect domestic steel producers while also protecting steel fabricators that are consumers of foreign steel from excessive price increases.If the intent is to penalize China, which produces about half of global steel production but accounts for a slim share of U.S. imports, it's not clear how much impact the tariffs would have. That's why other countries fear that the tariffs may be more broad-based.IBD'S TAKE: IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" on Tuesday, a signal to investors to exercise extra caution in buying stocks and to take some money off the table to deploy when the turbulence subsides. Make sure to read IBD's The Big Picture each day to get the latest on the market trend and what it means for your investments.Imminent tariff expectations have supported the stocks even as industry leaders Nucor and Steel Dynamics both warned on second-quarter earnings in mid-June.Steel Dynamics rebounded from its 200-day moving line this week and retook its 50-day line as it trades in a base going back to early December with a 40.27 potential buy point.RELATED:Steel Stocks Sink On Q2 Warning; Will Trump Come To The Rescue?While All Eyes Were On Comey, Here's How The White House Boosted Steel

55,HUM,"Anthem (ANTM), the for-profit operator of Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states, has said it's exiting Ohio's market, and the law's supporters are bracing for the possibility that it will bolt from the other 13 state exchanges, leaving 300-plus counties with no nongroup insurance options.Humana (HUM) and Aetna (AET) have said they'll completely withdraw from the ObamaCare exchanges by year-end. UnitedHealth (UNH), the nation's biggest insurer, set the trend by pulling out of 31 states in 2016, leaving minimal exposure. None of this has hurt their stocks, with analysts generally seeing a pullback from the exchanges as positive for earnings. Shares of UnitedHealth, Humana, Aetna and Anthem have all hit record highs in recent weeks, with IBD's Medical-Managed Care group ranked a respectable 46 out of 197 industry groups based on stock price performance.Yet the health insurer with IBD's top Composite Rating, based on earnings and sales growth, margins and share appreciation, is going the other way, diving deeper into ObamaCare. Centene (CNC) said it will add three states exchanges to its network in 2018, while expanding its footprint in six others.The Medicaid-focused insurer said it plans to offer new exchange coverage in Kansas, Missouri and Nevada, all states where it has Medicaid managed care contracts. Centene leverages its Medicaid assets to serve mainly low-income ObamaCare exchange customers as a low-cost carrier. The formula, though it has involved some controversial pricing strategies that have helped shrink the ranks of the insured, has made Centene a rare breed: a company that's actually generated a profit from its exchange business.IBD'S TAKE: Wall Street's focus has shifted from the Comey-Trump mud fight to the Federal Reserve's policy meeting this week, but the biggest near-term development for markets may be Anthem's coming decision on whether to exit ObamaCare, which could upset the White House's legislative plans.On Tuesday, shares of Centene rose 2.05% to 78.06, leading the managed care group. Centene is still in buy range from a 75.67 buy point.Centene said it's now serving 1.2 million exchange members, up a half million from a year ago. Despite the surge in enrollment as other carriers dropped out, the insurer signaled on Tuesday that no red flags have emerged from the expanded pool: ""The key demographics of these members including age, gender, financial assistance and metal tier are consistent with Centene's experience over the past three years. Ninety percent are eligible for subsidies.""CEO Michael Neidorff acknowledged the ""uncertainty of new health care legislation,"" but said in a statement that Centene ""has demonstrated disciplined execution, agility and capacity to successfully navigate industry changes to the benefit of our members, customers and shareholders.""If TrumpCare makes it across the finish line in a form that resembles the House bill, estimated to cut the ranks of the insured by 23 million, that would deliver a big hit to Centene's market opportunity. At least as of April, Neidorff was betting that any bill to emerge from the Senate would be kinder and gentler, noting that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid, and 16 Medicaid expansion states have Republican governors.""Among other health insurer stocks, Anthem closed up 0.3% while UnitedHealth rose 1% and Aetna 0.6%.Humana advanced 1.65% to 231.86, now slightly extended from a 220.59 entry.RELATED:One Company Could Wreak Havoc On The Trump Agenda This WeekHumana Could Fetch $300 A Share, But Suitors May Surprise You: JPMorganZombie TrumpCare Is Back, But These Health Insurer Stocks Are Breaking OutObamaCare's Top Insurer Is Increasing The Uninsured

69,HUM,"Shares of Humana (HUM) have advanced 13% to a record high since its official Valentine's Day breakup with Aetna (AET), but new suitors could be lining up that could push the stock much higher, says JPMorgan.JPMorgan analyst Gerry Taylor isn't the first to speculate that Cigna (CI) could bid as much as $300 per share for Humana. Wells Fargo analysts said the same thing last week. What's interesting, though, is that Taylor sees a range of potential suitors that could extend beyond the usual managed-care industry suspects.IBD'S TAKE: Humana is ranked No. 8 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance. See which Medicaid-focused insurer is ranked No. 1 at IBD Stock Checkup.Taylor also sees pharmacy-benefit managers and drug stores as potential bidders because of the attractiveness of Humana's leading position in Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D markets.That might add CVS Health (CVS), the drugstore and pharmacy-benefit giant to the list of possible buyers. CVS Health's revenue has taken a hit from the loss of pharmacy contracts. After meeting with management, Taylor said he thinks Humana is open to integrating its business with a drugstore or pharmacy-benefit manager.Humana shares slipped 1.5% to 230.26. The stock is now back in buy range from a 220.59 buy point, though Thursday's heavy volume action isn't great.Cigna, which also saw its proposed takeover by Anthem (ANTM) collapse after courts blocked the deal on antitrust grounds and the two companies had a falling out, lost 1.2% to 166.51. Cigna hit a 52-week high Wednesday.CVS Health rose 0.4% to 78.45.RELATED:Amazon, P&G, Humana Get Price-Target Hikes; Under Armour Cut AgainCVS Earnings Top, But Pharmacy Sales, Guidance Less Impressive

70,HUM,"XTenet Healthcare (THC) and other hospitals led a broad advance in health care stocks on Thursday as Senate Republicans unveiled their own version of TrumpCare.The short takeaway, courtesy of Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick, is that the Senate bill is ""Lots Less Worse Short-Term; Lots More Worse Long-Term,"" in comparison to the House version. In particular, Medicaid spending would suffer a smaller hit in the near term, but face even bigger long-term cuts.Among hospital groups, HCA Healthcare (HCA) rose 2.5%, Tenet Healthcare jumped 6.8% and Universal Health Services (UHS) gained 1.8%.The stock performance may have even taken management by surprise. Politico published a letter Tenet sent to employees asking them to rally opposition to TrumpCare.Investors have good reason to focus more on the intermediate term, because it's always possible that the big out-year cuts could be interrupted or delayed — if Democrats make a comeback, for example. On the other hand, the sharp eventual spending cuts relative to ObamaCare could threaten the support of moderate GOP senators. NBC News was reporting that three GOP senators planned to voice their opposition to the new legislation, enough to deny passage.Managed care companies also were solidly higher on Thursday. Centene (CNC) and Molina (MOH), both big players in the ObamaCare exchanges and its Medicaid expansion, were among the better performers. Centene climbed 3.6% and Molina 2.3%. Anthem (ANTM), the biggest ObamaCare exchange insurer, rose 0.65%. Anthem said on Wednesday that it's pulling out of the ObamaCare marketplaces in Indiana and Wisconsin.Centene is among the rare companies making a profit from the exchanges, but Medicaid is a big profit driver for the industry, including UnitedHealth Group (UNH), a Dow Jones industrial average component. All insurers would stand to benefit from the GOP plan to kill a tax on health insurance plans.UnitedHealth rose 0.7% to a record high, while Aetna (AET) gained 0.55% and Humana (HUM) advanced 0.3%.Skolnick's message to investors: ""Buy UNH and HCA.""Prospects of more modest health spending cuts than feared — assuming TrumpCare even passes — also lifted shares of drugmakers and biotechs. Among Dow components, Merck (MRK) rose 0.9%, Pfizer (PFE) 0.5% and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) 0.85%, with J&J notching a record high.Johnson & Johnson would also stand to benefit from the repeal of ObamaCare's tax on medical devices. Merck, which has been rallying on good news for immuno-oncology treatment Keytruda, crossed an aggressive entry and neared a conventional buy point.

71,HUM,"Shares of Exact Sciences (EXAS) jumped to a three-week high Wednesday after top medical insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH) announced updated coverage guidelines, opening access to Exact's colon-cancer test to an estimated 30 million patients.On the stock market today, Exact stock popped 11.7%, near 36.47. Canaccord analyst Mark Massaro kept his buy rating on Exact stock, but boosted his price target to 40 from 38.Updated coverage guidelines from UnitedHealthcare, a unit of No. 1 insurer UnitedHealth, will allow an estimated 30 million patients to use Exact's Cologuard once every three years. The update will go into effect July 1.The update will increase the total number of lives covered for Cologuard to 227 million, Massaro estimated in a note to clients. He described the UnitedHealthcare decision as a ""major win for Exact."" The decision arrived nearly a year before it was expected.IBD'S TAKE: Exact Sciences stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 75, meaning it outperforms three-quarters of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it lags leader Corcept Therapeutics which has a CR of 97 out of a best-possible 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top biotech players.Aetna (AET), the not-for-profit Health Care Service Corp. and Cigna (CI) cover 18 million, 15 million and 14 million patients, respectively. Humana (HUM), Tricare and Centene's (CNC) Health Net unit each cover south of 10 million lives apiece, Massaro wrote.Massaro expects Exact to pull in $205 million in 2017 sales, up from earlier views for $203 million. That's at the high end of Exact's guidance for $195 million to $205 million, but below the consensus for $209.8 million prior to UnitedHealth's update.RELATED:Exact Sciences Q4 Sales Beat, Colon-Cancer Test Procedures Double

74,HUM,"Even as House Republicans began to sound optimistic on Wednesday about a near-term vote to repeal ObamaCare, a raft of health insurance stocks are either breaking out into buy zones, approaching buy points or setting new highs.Shares of Anthem (ANTM) surged 3.8% to 179.03 on the stock market today, still just within the 5% chase zone from Tuesday's breakout from a short, flat base above a 170.79 buy point. On Wednesday, the stock finally cleared its prior high of 173.59 set in June 2015 on the strength of its first-quarter earnings. Before the open, Anthem reported a profit of $4.68 per share, sailing past estimates of $3.86. Revenue rose 10.3% to $22.32 billion, topping estimates of $21.27 billion.Among other insurers, Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth Group (UNH) hit an all-time high of 175.10 but closed up 0.2% at 174.38. Aetna (AET), which will report earnings before the open on Tuesday, flirted with a breakout above a cup-with-handle base buy point at 134.76, but pulled back to up 0.1% at 133.99. Humana (HUM), which previewed its earnings results and raised guidance after the close on Monday, also was bumping up against a buy point on Wednesday, rising 0.6% to 219.35.Cigna rose to its highest point since July 2015, but pulled back to a 0.2% decline. Anthem said it expects an appeals court to rule in the very near future about whether the Department of Justice was wrong to block its acquisition of Cigna (CI). Cigna wants out of the deal. Anthem said it will clarify its intentions after the appeals court decision.Centene (CNC), one of the insurers most closely tied to ObamaCare, fell 0.9% after making a run to the crest of a six-month trading range.On Tuesday, Centene reported a profit of $1.12 a share, 7 cents ahead of estimates, while revenue of $11.7 billion surpassed expectations of $11.4 billion.IBD'S TAKE: President Trump's bid to deliver the biggest tax cut in history looks likely to deliver a whole lot less. JPMorgan called the plan ""virtually impossible to pass,"" while Wells Fargo said the long-run costs of deficit-funded tax cuts will outweigh short-term benefits.Centene CEO told analysts not to overreact to headlines about ObamaCare repeal, noting that the GOP's American Health Care Act replacement still divides conservatives and moderates and has yet to make it out of the House. CEO Michael Neidorff noted that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid, and 16 Medicaid expansion states have Republican governors.""However, some key House Republican groups backed the latest repeal-and-replace legislation, suggesting at least some momentum.The GOP plan was estimated to cut 14 million people from Medicaid and reduce the ranks of the insured by 24 million overall, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis. Shares of Centene and Molina Healthcare (MOH) have moved higher since the plan backed by President Trump as ""wonderful"" first appeared dead on March 24.Molina Health fell 1.2%.An agreement among House Republicans to let states opt out of ObamaCare's rules requiring insurers charge all comers a single rate regardless of health status (though with adjustments for age) appears to have shored up the support of conservatives. Yet even if the legislation can survive the House, it appears unlikely to satisfy moderate GOP senators in Medicaid states.Anthem said it saw its insured membership grow by 1.2 million from a year ago, led by a 507,000 gain in Medicaid membership. The company, which sells Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in 14 states, said it is evaluating its plans for the ObamaCare exchange for 2018 and will make an announcement no later than July.Centene said its ObamaCare exchange membership soared by a half million to 1.2 million, which was more than expected. While the first quarter didn't reveal any negative trends to worry about among new customers, Centene management said the current quarter would give it a better idea about cost trends among its own customers and those of rivals. Both are important, since ObamaCare provides for risk-adjustment payments to those with a sicker patient pool from those with relatively lower-cost customers.Humana preannounced earnings of $2.75 a share, up from $1.98 a year ago and estimates of $2.49. The insurer, which has already said it will fully exit from the ObamaCare exchanges in 2018, said that all businesses performed well in the quarter and ""early indicators are positive relative to management's initial expectations around medical utilization.""RELATED:Dow's UnitedHealth Rises On Blowout Q1 EarningsTrumpCare Is Back: Dow Inches Ahead As Pivot To Tax Cuts Is Put On HoldTrump Is Right: The ObamaCare Exchanges Are Racing Toward A Crisis

75,HUM,"In a very busy week for news, stocks rallied solidly. Markets worldwide cheered the results of the first round of France's presidential election. Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Dow stock McDonald's (MCD) hit record highs on earnings, while Intel (INTC) and Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled, with hundreds of other companies reporting. President Trump's big tax-cut plan, which had lifted markets in anticipation, didn't move the needle when its outline was finally released.The major market averages jumped Monday and Tuesday after Emmanuel Macron led the first round of voting in the French presidential election, with polls suggesting he will easily defeat nationalist Marine Le Pen in the early May runoff. Stocks largely consolidated gains the rest of the week, though individual stocks and sectors were active amid a flurry of earnings. Internet, chips, restaurants and casinos were leaders, while Baidu (BIDU), Intel and Starbucks showed that even leading groups had losers. But the Nasdaq composite hit record highs during the week, climbing 2.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.9%, while the S&P 500 index was up 1.5%, just below all-time bests.The e-commerce giant said adjusted income rose 38% year over year to $1.48 a share, beating the consensus Q1 estimate of $1.12. Revenue rose 23% to $35.7 billion, topping views of $35.3 billion. That maintained a steady streak of double-digit revenue gains going back more than four years.Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud computing unit, continued to deliver huge, if gradually slowing, growth.Amazon shares rose to a record high Friday, clearing a new buy point, but closing well off intraday peaks.The earnings of Google-parent Alphabet rose 28% as revenue rose 22%, to $24.75 billion. Analysts expected the company to report earnings of $7.40 a share on sales of $24.22 billion. Revenue at Google's ""other"" non-advertising business — which includes its cloud computing unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store — rose 49%, to $3.01 billion. Mobile advertising growth was a bright spot, although Google's rising traffic-acquisition costs are a concern. TAC refers to what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, or what it pays partners like Apple (AAPL) that generate search traffic. Alphabet shares gapped up 3.8% to a fresh record high Friday.McDonald's first-quarter results beat views, and the burger giant talked up its tech efforts, including expanding delivery, trying out mobile order and pay and its new digitized restaurant layout. Shares jumped to record highs. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) also beat and said it was testing GPS-tracking technology. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) beat as well, and analysts debated its progress following a food-borne illness scare. Starbucks matched profit expectations, but missed on sales amid worries about stalling growth. Starbucks shares undercut a recent buy point intraday Friday, but closed above that level.Software leader Microsoft (MSFT) delivered earnings per share above views for its fiscal third quarter, but sales came in a tad short. Its sales guidance for the June quarter also was below analyst estimates. Microsoft earned 73 cents a share excluding items, up 18% year over year, on adjusted revenue of $23.56 billion, up 6%, in the March quarter. Analysts expected 70 cents and $23.62 billion. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to sales of $24.15 billion, up 7%, but Wall Street had been modeling for $24.51 billion.Intel earnings topped, but the chip giant's sales fell shy amid weakness in its data center market, sending shares gapping down 3.5% Friday. Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were chip plays that retreated. But Cavium (CAVM) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) rallied after the chipmakers topped Q1 earnings. Gear makers Teradyne (TER) and Ultra Clean (UCTT) boomed on results.Lockheed Martin (LMT) sees more international demand for its F-35 fighter and missile-defense systems as global tensions heat up and Raytheon (RTN) sees ""significant demand signals"" for its munitions on increasing military operations in Syria. Lockheed's Q1 sales fell short of expectations and it gave weak guidance. Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) topped on EPS and sales. All four defense stocks were in buy range at some point in the week, but by Friday's close all were slightly below entry areas.Core Boeing (BA) earnings jumped 16% to $2.01, beating views, but revenue fell 7% as defense revenue fell 18%. Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million. The aerospace giant raised its full year EPS outlook, but the midpoint still fell below analyst views. Industrial conglomerate United Technologies (UTX) topped with slim EPS and sales gains, as Otis elevator revenue, aerospace system sales and Pratt & Whitney jet engine sales rose.Boeing shares rose toward a flat-base buy point. United Tech is at a 23-month high, at the edge of buying range.Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX), the two largest providers of disk drives, had differing earnings. Seagate revenue missed estimates, with the stock falling 17% in reaction. Western Digital's earnings beat on the top and bottom lines, and announced very bullish guidance, sending shares up 3.9% Friday.Wynn Resorts (WYNN) pulled ahead of forecasts with 99 cents EPS and $1.475 billion in sales, as Macau gaming activity continues to rebound. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) EPS rose 47% to 66 cents, topping, on 15% revenue growth, meeting views. MGM Resorts (MGM) topped handily on both the top and bottom lines, helped by the takeover of the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa and the MGM National Harbor opening. Wynn Resorts hit a two-year high, and MGM rose to its best since 2008, with shares in buy range. Sands advanced within a consolidation.Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported mixed first-quarter results but said it had no plans to adjust its capital expenditure guidance as the oil major has identified and captured capital efficiencies. Exxon warned that it still needed to be cautious on the rebalancing of the oil market. Chevron (CVX) swung to a profit in Q1 and revenue beat Wall Street estimates as overall production rose. Management said if oil remains around $50 a barrel then future spending would be near the low end of its capex forecast. U.S. oil prices are modestly below $50 a barrel as Baker Hughes announced the U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a 15th straight week, foreshadowing further production gains.T-Mobile US (TMUS) topped Q1 earnings estimates and continued its streak of grabbing the most new subscribers among wireless operators. T-Mobile added 798,000 postpaid phone subscribers vs. 877,000 in the year-earlier period; that topped estimates of 725,000. T-Mobile shares rose to a new high, in buy range. AT&T (T) is expected to ramp up advertising for bundled wireless and pay TV offers after reporting in-line EPS and revenue that fell more than expected. AT&T lost 348,000 wireless postpaid subscribers, more than expected. Subscriber growth at DirecTV Now's streaming service helped AT&T offset surprising weakness at DirecTV's traditional pay TV business. But AT&T shares fell to 2017 low.Separately, cable giant Comcast (CMCSA) rose to a new high on strength in its movie business and broadband-customer gains.Recall costs and slowing U.S. sales hurt Ford (F) earnings, which fell but still beat Q1 views. Ford said higher commodity costs, particularly in steel, could weigh but that the worst hit to profit and costs this year likely happened in Q1. General Motors (GM) beat forecasts on solid U.S. truck and crossover sales, while Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) held its full-year outlook and kept its debt in check. The results come amid concerns about slowing auto sales, rising inventories and falling used-car prices.Dow Jones industrial average equipment-maker Caterpillar (CAT) earned $1.28 a share in Q1, more than doubling estimates, and raised its 2017 revenue range by $2 billion to $39-$41 billion, vs. estimates of $38.3 billion. Caterpillar's good news comes despite lack of progress on President Trump's infrastructure program or border wall, two initiatives that have made Caterpillar a Trump stock. Ahead of earnings, Caterpillar finally broke a 51-month streak of falling retail sales, with a 1% gain that was driven by construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Caterpillar shares soared into a buy zone.Biotechs and drugmakers reported en masse Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) delivering across-the-board beats, pumping their stocks up that day. AstraZeneca (AZN) topped on earnings, but sales slid 12%, though adjusted profits grew 4% and topped by 17 cents. Top two biotechs, Amgen (AMGN) and Celgene (CELG), both reported lagging sales. On Thursday, Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) stock hit an 11-year low on light sales and an 8-cent per-share loss ex items that also missed.Even as the House made another push to repeal ObamaCare — with a plan that included steep cuts for Medicaid — a raft of insurers moved into buy zones, and flirted with breakouts or pushing to new highs. The catalyst was an especially strong earnings report from Anthem (ANTM), though investors may have judged that TrumpCare remains doomed. Humana (HUM) previewed its earnings and raised guidance. Centene (CNC) topped estimates and CEO Michael Neidorff said he expects the Medicaid-heavy insurer to thrive on any reform that can be passed by Congress, noting that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid.""PulteGroup (PHM) topped earnings estimates, but revenue fell short. Meanwhile, President Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood imports, which could raise construction costs by $1,200 per home. New-home sales rose in March to the second-fastest rate of the current business cycle. Pulte tumbled, but did not outright close below a prior buy point. D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) fell below their 50-day lines as well.

76,HUM,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone business is increasingly being split between well-heeled shoppers who want the company's latest and greatest handsets and cost-conscious buyers looking for lower-priced iPhones that deliver the most bang for the buck.That's the assessment of UBS analyst Steven Milunovich. In a report Monday, he said the bifurcation in Apple's smartphone business could have big implications for the company's average selling prices and profit margins.Apple's top-of-the-line iPhone 7 Plus model continues to sell well, but so are cheaper iPhone 6S and SE handsets, he said. Strong sales of those cheaper models could limit Apple's handset average selling prices in the March and June quarters, Milunovich said. Meanwhile, the midrange iPhone 7 isn't selling as well.""The regular iPhone 7 model is being squeezed at the high and low ends, perhaps a polarization of iPhone buyers between value-oriented and innovation-oriented,"" Milunovich said in a report.Milunovich cited a survey by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners that showed continued strong sales in the U.S. of the iPhone 7S as well as better-than-expected performance by the iPhone SE and older model iPhones.Shares of Apple, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, were up 1% to close at 143.64 on the stock market today. Apple is trading just below its all-time high of 145.46, reached on April 5.Milunovich reiterated his buy rating and 12-month price target of 151.IBD'S TAKE: Apple is on IBD's Leaderboard list of actionable stocks with the potential for big gains.The next potential catalyst for the stock is Apple's fiscal second-quarter earnings report, scheduled for May 2 after the market close.But Milunovich expects two ho-hum quarterly reports before Apple releases its highly anticipated 11th-generation smartphone, the iPhone 8, in September.""Most investors are focused on fiscal 2018 (which starts Oct. 1), which means the next few reports should be less important than usual,"" he said.The iPhone 8 is expected to be the biggest change to the look of the iPhone since the iPhone 6 came out in September 2014. It is rumored to feature a borderless OLED display with no physical home button, a glass sandwich design, wireless charging, and augmented reality capability.Photos of purported iPhone 8 dummy models and components are already starting to leak on to the internet through tech enthusiast websites.RELATED:'Arms Race' Underway In Smartphone Specs; Apple To Fire NextApple Prototype Smartglasses Giving Employees Eye Pain: ReportApple Retakes Buy Point After iPhone 8 Sales Estimates Raised

77,HUM,"Health Reform: ObamaCare backers are grinning at a new survey that shows the law is more popular than ever. But this is likely to be the calm before the storm.A Gallup survey out this week finds that ObamaCare has never been more popular, with 55% saying they approve of the law. That, as Gallup notes, ""is the first time a majority of Americans have approved of the health care law."" The big change comes from independents, who've largely shifted into the ""approve"" column.Gallup's findings come on the heels of the April IBD/TIPP poll, which finds that just under half (48%) of those following the story closely believe ObamaCare is unsustainable and will collapse if left alone. And a plurality (43%) say they'd be less likely to support candidates who vote to repeal ObamaCare, while only 30% say they'd be more likely to support such candidates.There's no doubt that at least some of this newfound ObamaCare love is the result of the drumbeat of biased news coverage touting its many supposed benefits, while attacking the House replacement plan.But even as the public grows to like ObamaCare more, it is hurtling toward disaster. Last year's massive hikes in premiums and insurance defections are turning out to be just a prelude for what's in store this year.Humana (HUM) got the ball rolling in February when it announced plans to exit all the ObamaCare exchanges next year. Humana had already pulled out of most states last year after getting hit with massive losses.Humana's exit will leave the 40,000 people in the Knoxville, Tenn., area with no ObamaCare insurer.Then last week, news came out that Anthem (ANTM) might leave most of the exchanges after losing $374 million on its ObamaCare business last year.Anthem covers 800,000 people in 14 states, largely through its Blue Cross Blue Shield affiliates, and is the only insurer offering ObamaCare exchange plans in almost 300 counties. So if Anthem makes good on this threat, hundreds of thousands of people in Kentucky, Colorado, Missouri and Ohio could also end up with no ObamaCare insurers.(These folks will still be able to buy individual health insurance policies outside the ObamaCare exchanges, but that means they won't be eligible for any of ObamaCare's subsidies.)ObamaCare is teetering on collapse in other parts of the country where the Humana, Aetna (AET), UnitedHealth Group and others already dropped out, leaving just one insurer behind.The news site Axios did an analysis showing that ObamaCare enrollees in Mississippi, Tennessee and West Virginia could find themselves out of choices if insurers like Centene (CNC), Cigna (CI) and Highmark decided to drop out.None of this, mind you, has anything to do with the GOP threat to repeal and replace ObamaCare. The ObamaCare death spiral was well underway long before President Trump was elected.The problem is that the Republicans aren't telling people why ObamaCare is failing, and are instead proposing to keep the very ObamaCare regulations that are causing the collapse in the first place — namely, the law's unworkable protections for those with pre-existing conditions.This nice-sounding reform has failed everywhere it's been tried, with ObamaCare being only the latest example. (IBD recently provided a detailed explanation of why ""guaranteed issue"" keeps failing.)The initial House GOP bill retained ObamaCare's ""guaranteed issue"" rule, and any attempt by conservatives to water it down is being met with stiff resistance from liberal Republicans who have made it clear that they want to keep ObamaCare almost entirely intact.Public support for ObamaCare might tumble again later this year in the face of more market defections and a new round of shocks about premium rates. But that won't matter much if the GOP can't explain to the public why it's happening or offer a real alternative.RELATED:Republicans Cave On ObamaCareObamaCare And The Myth Of Democratic ModeratesRepealing The ObamaCare Train Wreck Has Become A Train Wreck2 Words That Spell Doom For The GOP's ObamaCare Replacement Plan
"
78,HUM,"It was just a year ago that the formula seemed right for Biogen (BIIB), the fourth-largest company in its industry, to mix up a biotechnology megamerger.Biogen's multiple sclerosis franchise — a lineup of six drugs that includes Tecfidera and Tysabri — was growing. Tecfidera, Biogen's most important drug, brought in $3.97 billion in 2016, up 9%.Further, hemophilia sales, though small, grew 53% in 2016 to $847 million between just two brand-name drugs, Eloctate and Alprolix. And Spinraza, a spinal muscular atrophy drug, grabbed FDA approval just days before Christmas.The plot thickened when Biogen's chief executive, George Scangos, resigned in July, leaving the company susceptible to takeout by the likes of Merck (MRK), Allergan (AGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Pfizer (PFE). Takeout rumors abounded, and Biogen stock ended 2016 down 6.2%, making it a cheaper asset to buy.""I thought last year was really the time for it to happen,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said. ""What Biogen offered last year was a relatively stable MS business that was still growing, a robust cash flow scheme, the opportunity for Spinraza and the hemophilia franchise. So an acquirer could say, 'I get all of that.' ""Fast-forward to today, and the picture is entirely different. Biogen is seeing increasing competition in the MS market, payers are balking at Spinraza prices, and the company has already taken its hemophilia drugs out of the equation.Now, only 24% of Wall Street sees Biogen as a potential takeout candidate in 2017, according to a Mizuho survey. And Porges says Biogen will probably have to wait until 2020 to see the deals roll in, if ever.""I think it has become significantly less likely,"" Porges said.So, what happened?After an incredibly successful 2016 in multiple sclerosis — including the launch of Zinbryta with AbbVie (ABBV) — Biogen's MS unit is facing looming competition from the likes of Roche (RHHBY) and Celgene (CELG), Porges told Investor's Business Daily.In a note to clients on April 7, Porges called Roche's Ocrevus a ""game-changer."" Ocrevus was approved in late March to treat both relapsing-remitting and primary progressive forms of MS, separating itself from the pack that is only approved for the relapsing-remitting form.""Both the MS physician and patient communities have been eagerly awaiting the Ocrevus launch,"" Porges said. ""The drug's high efficacy, reasonable safety profile and convenient six-month dosing schedule are all major factors in the drug's positive reception.""That spells trouble for Biogen, as Tecfidera had comprised 40% of total product sales as well as 76% of the MS unit. Biogen is actually partnered with Roche on Ocrevus, but the royalty won't be enough to offset erosion to its own MS franchise, analysts say.Porges expects Ocrevus to get 60% of the primary progressive MS market within three to four years. In the relapsing-remitting MS market, Porges sees 40%-50% erosion of Tysabri, and 30%-40% erosion of Tecfidera and Novartis' (NVS) Gilenya sales.Meanwhile, Celgene is working on an MS drug called ozanimod in Phase 3 testing. In function, ozanimod is closest to Novartis' Gilenya, though it could also rival Tecfidera or Sanofi's (SNY) Aubagio. Tecfidera, Gilenya and Aubagio, respectively, lead the MS market in terms of sales.""If Celgene wanted to buy a sales force and have something overnight to help sell ozanimod, Biogen could be that company,"" Porges told IBD. But with Biogen likely to suffer erosion from Roche competition in MS, that's looking less probable.The silver lining? Biogen won a patent and an interference case against Forward Pharma (FWP) over Tecfidera, though it was out a $1.25 billion settlement fee. Forward stock toppled 22.5% on the decision as it now loses out on a major royalty.Biogen's Spinraza has a different set of troubles. Developed with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), Spinraza is the first and only drug approved for the rare neurological disorder that causes muscle weakness and wasting in infants and children.Wall Street largely thought of Spinraza as a slam dunk. It had ""profound efficacy"" in two August 2016 studies in infants and children. The drug was so effective that Biogen and Ionis ended the studies early, Ionis Chief Executive Stanley Crooke told IBD in December.Spinraza was approved Dec. 23 with a fairly broad label. It's approved for use in children and adults with spinal muscular atrophy and remains the only drug approved for the disease that Crooke called ""catastrophic.""""This drug, of all things, should be rapidly adopted and widely reimbursed,"" Porges said. ""And what may have happened was what appeared to be good fortune with the label may have turned into a liability because payers became concerned too many patients would start on the drug so they restricted access.""Mizuho analyst Salim Syed calls 2017 ""largely a Spinraza story."" Biogen is set to report its first-quarter earnings on April 25. That will be particularly telling following the launch of Spinraza earlier this year. Analysts say, though, that payers are pushing back hard on reimbursements of the drug.Insurers Anthem (ANTM) and Humana (HUM) are only reimbursing patients on Spinraza with the most severe form of the disease, Type 1. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has a broader policy, covering Type 1, 2 and 3 patients. That could be because Spinraza costs $125,000 per treatment, or $750,000 in the first year, and $375,000 in subsequent years, making it a pricey drug.The consensus is projecting $15 million in first-quarter Spinraza sales, Syed said.Porges lowered his expectations for Spinraza for 2017 to $266 million from $400 million. Sales results for the first quarter will be especially telling, he told IBD. North of 100 patients on the drug would be ""pretty good — as long as they're seeing continued starts.""Then there's Biogen's hemophilia drug lineup.In February, Biogen spun off its hemophilia franchise into Bioverativ (BIVV). Since then, Bioverativ shares are up 27%, which is great — for Bioverativ. But any company considering a Biogen takeover might think again without that unit, Porges said.IBD'S TAKE: Bioverativ isn't your standard biotech startup. Head to The New America to find out why.Bioverativ has yet to announce any quarterly results, having only been public since early February. The company is set to release its first-quarter earnings results on May 3. In its last full quarter with Biogen, that hemophilia unit brought in $242 million, up 11.5% year over year.Now, Porges says it would be smart for Biogen to also spin off its multiple sclerosis unit and turn its focus toward Alzheimer's. In Alzheimer's Biogen is following Eli Lilly and Merck, both of which had notable failures in December and February.Biogen's Alzheimer's play is the strongest in the sector, analysts say.In March, RBC analyst Michael Yee told IBD that Pfizer and Merck are the likeliest players to make a bid on Biogen. They would be ""interested in more branded drugs and particularly the Alzheimer's pipeline.""Biogen is working on two classes of Alzheimer's drugs — one that works to remove plaque buildups in the brain associated with Alzheimer's and another called a BACE inhibitor with Eisai. BACE inhibitors aim to prevent the plaque buildup.Porges says Biogen will likely have to wait until 2020 to see renewed takeover interest. In 2020, Biogen is expected to release the results of two Phase 3 trials of aducanumab. Its BACE inhibitor, elenbecestat, is also in a Phase 3 trial with results expected after September 2020.Eli Lilly's solanezumab worked on the theory that it would remove plaque buildup — called beta amyloid — in the brain. Merck's verubecestat was a BACE inhibitor. But both failed, and there are only a handful of potential Alzheimer's drugs in development now.Meanwhile, Axovant Sciences (AXON) is working on a different theory of treatment that doesn't involve beta amyloid. It expects to have Phase 3 data of its drug, intepirdine, later this year. That, too, could change the Alzheimer's landscape and potentially further dent Biogen's chances of a merger.Still, Biogen's board will place a high premium on its Alzheimer's pipeline if it ever comes to the acquisition table, Porges said. That's because everything else has failed and development costs for aducanumab and elenbecestat have headed toward the billions of dollars, Porges said.""If you're willing to take the risk on Alzheimer's, it still makes some sense as an acquisition, but what I've heard from people in and around the industry is they're struggling to bridge the gap,"" he said. ""The board wants to be paid for Alzheimer's as if it's going to work.""RELATED:How Roche's 'Game Changer' Drug Will Chip Away At Biogen, NovartisBiogen Dives As Takeover Buzz Fades, Drugs Hit SnagsCan This Small-Cap Biotech Take On Gilead, Celgene, Biogen In Alzheimer's?

But small caps fended off sellers, with the Russell 2000 up 0.1%.Volume was tracking higher on the Nasdaq and lower on the NYSE. Even as indexes faded, breadth remained positive. Winners beat losers by a 6-5 ratio on the NYSE and Nasdaq.Wall Street's focus in today's trading was on Capitol Hill. President Trump demanded a vote on a bill that replaces ObamaCare, but it was unclear if Republicans had enough votes to pass the measure.Perhaps sensing a defeat of the bill, investors sent health care stocks higher, to some of the best gains Friday. Hospitals, medical equipment and medical research were some of the industry groups were up more than 1% and in the top groups.Dow component UnitedHealth Group (UNH) was nearly flat after erasing a 1.3% early gain. Shares of the health insurance company are testing the 10-week moving average and are still near record highs. But pharmaceuticals Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) were down fractionally.Goldman Sachs (GS), another Dow component, fell more than 1% to the lowest level since Feb. 2. The bank tumbled below the 50-day moving average Tuesday amid a sell-off in financials and the general market.Outside the Dow, managed care company Humana (HUM) slid 1.6%, breaching its 50-day moving average in heavy trading. The stock fell as much as 6% below the 217.90 buy point of a breakout March 7.Coherent (COHR) climbed past the 200.63 buy point of a flat base. But shares retreated back into the pattern and volume was running more than 40% below normal levels. All that made for a dispirited breakout attempt.U.S. Concrete (USCR) cratered 1o% and plunged below the 50-day moving average. It was one of the most heavily traded stocks on the day. The ready-mix concrete provider said in a federal filing that Chief Financial Officer Joseph C.

"
80,HUM,"Anthem's (ANTM) reported plan to withdraw from many of the ObamaCare markets where it does business is the clearest sign that the exchanges face a near-term crisis.Such a move by Anthem, which was the only insurer that offered any semblance of support for RyanCare, may raise suspicion that its real motive is to curry favor with the Trump administration to salvage its merger with Cigna (CI).Yet even before Thursday's news about the for-profit operator of Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, there was plenty of reason to expect a white-knuckled, high-stakes showdown over ObamaCare's future this summer between Democrats and the Trump administration. Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET) have already withdrawn from most ObamaCare exchanges, with Humana (HUM) planning on a full exit for 2018.Shares of Anthem fell 1 on the stock market today. UnitedHealth, Cigna and Humana edged lower while Aetna rose 0.5%.The official exchange sign-up data for the 2017 open enrollment period that ended Jan. 31 tell part of the story. The exchange population this year is smaller and tilts older than it did last year, both bad signs for the overall health of the risk pool and 2018 premiums.As the number of people signing up for exchange coverage unexpectedly fell by 463,000, or 4%, from 2016, the number of young adults (18 to 34) shrank by 230,000, while enrollees 55-and-up rose by about 19,000, an IBD analysis finds.IBD'S TAKE: ObamaCare repeal was supposedly the big holdup for the rest of President Trump's economic agenda, but now that he's moved on, the White House is seemingly at a loss for how to proceed on tax cuts.What happens in the ObamaCare-compliant off-exchange market is almost as important as what happens on the exchanges. The Congressional Budget Office says there are about 8 million individuals with unsubsidized off-exchange coverage, and most of those are lumped in the same risk pool as those why buy on the exchange. (Those who have grandfathered policies or buy from carriers that don't offer exchange policies are in a separate pool.)Even before President Trump's election created uncertainty about the future of the exchanges and individual mandate penalty, the off-exchange market was set to take a hit in 2017 as premiums for the lowest-cost bronze plans in major HealthCare.gov markets spiked by 28%. An informal survey of some carriers by health insurance consultant Robert Laszewski finds that insurers have seen their off-exchange enrollment fall by 15% to 35% this year.In one important respect, President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan seem misguided when they say that the ObamaCare exchanges are in a death spiral. The average after-subsidy premium owed by people who qualified for tax credits and signed up via HealthCare.gov in 2017 was $106 per month, exactly the same as in 2016. ObamaCare mostly shields subsidy-eligible individuals from rising premiums, though the government portion of premiums jumped 32% to $383 per month.The Congressional Budget Office, Standard & Poor's and other outside analysts have been saying they expect the exchanges to stabilize after a big, one-time jump in premiums this year. Yet those predictions look increasingly unrealistic. The combination of a somewhat smaller, older exchange membership, shrinking off-exchange group and added pressure from Trump administration policies has created a potentially explosive situation and enormous risk for insurers.Besides pulling the plug on advertising to encourage people to enroll in late January and using his bully pulpit to criticize ObamaCare at every turn, Trump has taken one action that fundamentally undermines the operation of the exchanges.As reported by Reason's Peter Suderman in February, the IRS acted on Trump's executive order to ease compliance with ObamaCare regulations by undoing its rule to reject tax forms on which individuals fail to declare whether they had insurance coverage during the prior year.The Obama administration had put in place that rule to begin in the current tax-filing season, believing that more aggressive enforcement of the mandate could give a boost to weaker-than-expected enrollment.Now that lax enforcement has been embraced by the Trump administration and publicized by the news media, the big risk for insurers is that ObamaCare will come to resemble the failed markets in states that passed rules requiring insurers to offer the same price to the sick and healthy but didn't have a mandate to compel people to get coverage.Insurers likely already have felt some impact from lax enforcement of the mandate as customers who signed up for coverage opted not to pay their premiums.There's little question that the exchanges were in need of shoring up, regardless of who was elected, but now the situation has become more dire. The Kaiser Family Foundation's Cynthia Cox noted that there are 200 counties — where Anthem is the only insurer — that could be left without an exchange option if it exits.The big fight that seems to be just around the corner is over what happens in markets where no insurers participate. Republicans are now pushing a bill that would let people in such markets use their subsidies to buy coverage that doesn't comply with ObamaCare rules. That's a nonstarter for Democrats, who fear such a fallback would give insurers reason to bail from markets to play by more profit-friendly rules.Most Democrats will likely want to lift income restrictions on Medicaid in such markets or offer some kind of related public option, which Republicans will surely fight. A third potential solution, following Alaska's example, would have states try to entice an insurer to participate by extending reinsurance that covers a big portion of expenses for the costliest plan members. Alaska did that by passing costs onto other health plans, which is a hard pill for states to swallow. It's probably a good time for someone to come up with a Plan D.RELATED:CBO Reveals RyanCare Trick To 'Save' $600 BillionTrump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesWhy Obama Is Wrong About ObamaCare, In One ChartObamaCare's Individual Mandate Bites Hardest In These CitiesObamaCare's Individual Mandate Works Like A Payday Loan

81,HUM,"If there's one thing that Republicans agree on about health insurance, it's that the federal government shouldn't tell people what kind of insurance they can buy. The seemingly ironclad GOP principle is that people should be able to buy the kind of coverage they want.So one of the most curious aspects of House Speaker Paul Ryan's new American Health Care Act is that it limits ""eligible health insurance"" to plans that provide ObamaCare's list of essential benefits. It is even more curious because, as Washington and Lee School of Law Professor Timothy Jost notes in his Health Affairs write-up, the original leaked version of the House plan eliminated federal benefit requirements.Here's the puzzle: If House GOP leaders are trying to keep conservatives on board with their ObamaCare repeal plan, why would Ryan add back this provision that would only appeal to Democrats?IBD'S TAKE: The parts of President Trump's economic agenda that investors are most excited about, tax cuts and infrastructure spending, are stuck in line behind ObamaCare.One possible reason for the change is that the Congressional Budget Office has said that it won't count anything but major medical coverage in figuring how many people are insured under an ObamaCare replacement. That means that lifting restrictions on what kind of insurance is acceptable might make insurance coverage losses under Ryan's plan look worse. It's possible that Ryan made the change, reinstating essential benefits, to get a better score from the CBO on the plan's coverage impact.The other possibility has to do with budget scoring. The decision to preserve ObamaCare's coverage restrictions may go a very long way in lowering the cost of providing subsidies under the American Health Care Act. That's because, realistically, the only way that most low-income shoppers would be able to use their much smaller tax subsidy under the GOP plan would be to buy low-value insurance that isn't available under ObamaCare and won't protect them from a real health emergency.Already, there are an estimated 6 million uninsured who are leaving their ObamaCare subsidies on the table. Despite the risk of paying an individual fine for going without coverage, many people have spurned bronze plans that carry $6,000-$7,150 deductibles, contributing to a spike in premiums and leading insurers including Humana (HUM), Aetna (AET) and UnitedHealth (UNH) to exit most of their exchange markets.Standard & Poor's estimates that Ryan's new health plan will increase the ranks of the uninsured by 6 million to 10 million. On the low end, including the 6 million subsidy-eligible uninsured under ObamaCare, Ryan's subsidies might go unclaimed by 12 million people. With subsidies ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per year, taking the midpoint as a rough average, that's $36 billion in unused subsidies each year.""Decreasing tax credits for low-income people without changing benefit requirements will lead to a substantial reduction in enrollment and takeup of the subsidies,"" said Larry Levitt, health policy expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation.Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, chairman of the Freedom Caucus of conservative lawmakers, told the Washington Post that Ryan's replacement for ObamaCare amounted to ""subsidies for unaffordable health care, subsidies for unaffordable premiums — not just policies that Republicans had opposed, but policies voters would reject.""If the essential benefits requirements were axed, health policy experts believe that insurers would inevitably offer people coverage that costs no more than the value of their tax credit under the GOP plan. As the CBO notes, ""low-income people might prefer coverage for preventive services and routine physicians' visits to keep their monthly expenses low, even if such a policy did not cover more costly services such as hospital care."" In other words, people would find a way to use their tax credits, even if they couldn't afford to buy very much.That's exactly what Ryan outlined in his Better Way policy paper last summer: ""The new fixed credit would be large enough to purchase the typical pre-Obamacare health insurance plan."" And if people choose to buy insurance that costs even less than their credit, presumably even the barest bones insurance imaginable, ""the difference would be deposited into an HSA-like account.""That latter feature — being allowed to keep tax credits in excess of premiums — is part of Ryan's new bill, but that won't do anything to help low-income people who won't be able to afford any insurance on offer.Ryan's age-based tax credits — a sharp departure from ObamaCare's design that provides the most help to lower-income and older adults — would replace a modified system of subsidies starting in 2020. Because legislation's budget impact is scored over a decade, the new subsidies would be in force for seven of those years during which uninsured Americans could leave roughly $250 billion on the table. That's more than 40% of the cost of the $600 billion in tax cuts that Ryan's bill would provide.RELATED:Trump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesHow To Replace ObamaCare And Save Social SecurityThe House GOP ObamaCare Repeal And Replace Plan: 7 Key PointsThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade
"
82,HUM,"President Trump in a Tuesday tweet embraced the new House plan to repeal and replace much of ObamaCare as his own.In doing so, Trump has launched what is likely to be a tumultuous phase of his presidency that threatens to sidetrack the rest of his economic agenda.""Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation. ObamaCare is a complete and total disaster — is imploding fast!""While Trump may overstate just how fragile the ObamaCare exchanges are, there's little question that the GOP has to act fast to avoid an exodus by insurers waiting for clarity about the rules for 2018 ahead of a June deadline to set premiums. Humana (HUM) has already said it will exit the exchanges in 2018, while Aetna (AET) and Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH) have one foot out the door, and Anthem (ANTM) and Molina (MOH) won't commit to sticking around.Trump promised throughout his campaign that he would ""take care of everybody."" Speaking before Congress last week, he vowed that his plan would ""bring cost way down and provide far better care.""""Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing, and hope.""Yet the gap between those promises and the American Health Care Act legislation unveiled by House Republicans on Monday appears to be massive. A better read on the consequences of the bill will be available when the Congressional Budget Office weighs in, but analysts on the center-left and right are estimating that TrumpCare would reduce the ranks of the insured by 15 million to 20 million.The coverage losses would result from dramatically shrinking the subsidies available for older adults and lower-income Americans to buy coverage, phasing out ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion starting in 2020 and repealing ObamaCare's individual and employer mandates.So far, the Republican plan has managed to unite the left, center and right in opposition, though for disparate reasons.Some people who don't get a very good deal from the exchanges today would be better off under TrumpCare, which replaces ObamaCare's income-based subsidies with tax credits that vary only based on age. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a 27-year-old earning $40,000 would get a $100 subsidy from ObamaCare but a $2,000 subsidy from TrumpCare in 2020.Young adults with moderate incomes, many of whom have shunned ObamaCare plans despite the individual mandate penalty, also would benefit from the GOP's lifting of restrictions on how much insurers can charge older adults. Now, insurers on the exchange can only charge a 64-year-old three times as much as a 21-year-old, but Republicans would lift that restriction, raising premiums for older adults and lowering them for young adults.Some in the middle class who don't get any subsidies would be better off too. A 40-year-old earning $75,000 would get nothing from ObamaCare, but a $3,000 subsidy from TrumpCare.Yet the gains in coverage for those who get a better deal would likely be swamped by coverage losses, a range of analysts across the ideological spectrum have concluded. One reason is the replacement, with a relatively minor late-enrollment penalty, of ObamaCare's penalty for not buying coverage. People who let their coverage lapse would have to pay insurers a one-time penalty equal to 30% of annual premiums in the year they renew coverage, even if they go without coverage for a decade or more.Another reason for the expected rise in the uninsured is that many people might not be able to afford to take advantage of the subsidies under TrumpCare. Here's why, using the stark example of a 64-year-old couple earning 150% of the poverty level, or about $25,500 in 2020:For this older couple, a silver-level ObamaCare plan would cost roughly $1,150, with maximum out-of-pocket costs likely limited to about $2,000 to $3,000, an IBD analysis finds. Under TrumpCare, the same plan would likely cost the couple between $15,000 and $20,000 in premiums, after subsidies. The increase reflects much smaller subsidies and a roughly 16% increase in premiums due to TrumpCare's age-rating change. The wide range also reflects uncertainty over how states would deploy the extra ""stability"" funds in the Republican plan, with the low end of the range assuming that the entire sum would go to help low-income insurance shoppers attain more comprehensive coverage.IBD'S TAKE: The parts of President Trump's economic agenda that investors are most excited about, tax cuts and infrastructure spending, are stuck in line behind ObamaCare.One likely red flag for a couple of GOP senators is that TrumpCare's subsidies don't vary according to geography, even though health insurance costs can vary widely by state and county. For example, the lowest-cost ObamaCare bronze premium this year averages $272 per month in the biggest metropolitan area of each state using the HealthCare.gov platform. But the lowest bronze plan in Alaska costs $626 before subsidies, while the cheapest plan in West Virginia costs $332.Not surprisingly, perhaps, Republicans Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia are seen as among the most likely to vote against repeal. Both senators, along with Rob Portman of Ohio and Cory Gardner of Colorado, warned in a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday that they won't support a bill that ""does not meet the test of stability for individuals currently enrolled"" in ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion.It's not clear if they'll be won over by the House provision that would grandfather people who enroll in the Medicaid expansion through the end of 2019. After that, the GOP would stop covering 90% of costs for new enrollees, so states would likely change the parameters of the program, shifting newcomers to the federal tax credits under TrumpCare.One negative fallout of that grandfathering provision is that people may be even more determined to hang onto their Medicaid coverage, or else they'll face an extremely hard time affording coverage in the individual market. Ironically, these are the kind of work disincentives that have led the GOP to oppose ObamaCare's income-based subsidies in the first place.Legislative prospects would look somewhat better for TrumpCare if it were only centrist Republicans on the fence, but conservative groups are coming out in opposition too, such the Heritage Foundation and the Club for Growth. The Club for Growth warned on Tuesday, ""If this warmed-over substitute for government-run health care remains unchanged, the Club for Growth will key vote against it.""RELATED:The House GOP ObamaCare Repeal And Replace Plan: 7 Key PointsTrump, GOP Will Create New ObamaCare Winners, LosersThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

83,HUM,"Leading indexes booked their third decline in four sessions Tuesday as stocks continued to consolidate below the market's March 1 high.The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.2%. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 each took looses of 0.3%.  Small caps continued to outpace the general market's decline, with the Russell 2000 ending off 0.6%.The Nasdaq and the Dow industrials made a brief, late-morning foray into positive territory as Apple (AAPL) reversed sharply out of its early losses. But the Dow did not touch 21,000 and both it and the Nasdaq quickly returned to narrow losses. Apple ended up 0.1%.Preliminary data showed volume climbing on the Nasdaq and the NYSE exchanges relative to end-of-day trade on Monday.Economic news appeared to have little impact on the stock market today, although the Federal Reserve's January consumer credit estimate showed credit borrowing contracted sharply during the month.  January trade data from the Commerce Department showed the deficit widening to $8.5 billion, in line with expectations.Data Storage led the roster of industry groups, bolstered by Nimble Storage's (NMBL) 45% gain, following news that Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) would acquire the company for $1 billion. Some other small plays in the group rose, possibly on takeover speculation: Pure Storage (PSTG) jumped 11%. Qualstar (QBAK) rocketed 14% higher. Shares of HPE ended effectively flat.The video game developer and cable satellite industries also marked up strong sessions.The recreational vehicle makers group dropped hard as Thor Industries (THO) dived 10% in powerful trade as investors took profits after the company reported a broadly solid fiscal second quarter. A 27% rise in earnings and a 63% revenue surge beat analyst expectations and validated management's strategy and execution of its $576 million acquisition of Jayco last year.Thor's decline broke below support at its 50-day moving average in heavy trade, and it reversed all gains from a 106.43 buy point. Both moves are sell signals.Other RV makers and suppliers also felt the undertow, with Winnebago (WGO), Patrick Industries (PATK) and Rev Group (REVG) all down more than 5%. LCI Industries (LCII) fell nearly 2%.Verizon Communications (VZ) dropped 1.2%, the only Dow stock to hit the 1% mark. Aerospace and defense contractor giant Boeing (BA) led the index with a 0.6% gain.Humana (HUM) led the S&P 500, up more than 2% in what may or may not have been reaction to the GOP health care proposal released late Monday. Among hospital stocks, Tenet Healthcare (THC) dropped more than 7%, apparently in reaction to the plan, while peers Universal Health Services (UHS) shed 2% and HCA Holdings (HCA) dipped 1.3%.Earnings season is winding down, but quarterly results are expected from Urban Outfitters (URBN), H&R Block (HRB) and others after the close.RELATED:These Pharma Stocks Are Big Losers From Trump's Drug Pricing TweetStock Market Today: Why Snap Shares Could Lose All Of Its Post-IPO AdvanceInside The IBD 50: Which Leaders Besides Thor Industries Got Thumped Hard?

84,HUM,"Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) stock seesawed Wednesday after the biotech guided to north of $80 million in 2017 sales for its Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug Exondys 51, lagging Wall Street estimates by 40%.Sarepta stock was up and down a couple times on the stock market today, but it ended the session down 2.4%, at 30.38. Shares hit a 14-year high above 63 in September when the FDA approved Exondys 51, but are down more than 50% since then and now trade below both their 50-day and 200-day moving averages.The FDA's approval of Exondys 51 was met with widespread disapproval as payors like Anthem (ANTM), Humana (HUM) and United Healthcare (UNH) have pushed back against covering the costly drug, with doubts as to its efficacy. Analysts note the Duchenne market is small, in the thousands of patients.For the first quarter, Sarepta guided to $13 million to $15 million in Exondys 51 sales, in a late Tuesday conference call with analysts. Sales would accelerate from $5.4 million in the fourth quarter, when Exondys 51 had been on the market for about a month.IBD'S TAKE: For the best among biotechs, Incyte has a slew of potential blockbusters, analysts say. Head to The New America for more on the company.Analysts had broadly expected $14.9 million in first-quarter sales of Exondys 51, Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz wrote in a research note, cutting his price target on Sarepta stock to 27 from 32. He still has a market perform rating on shares.""Therefore, it comes as a negative surprise that management expects just $13 million to $15 million in revenue in Q1,"" he wrote in a note. ""This leaves us to wonder whether compliance, discontinuations and/or slower new patient adds are contributing to the shortfall.""Guidance for 2017 Exondys 51 sales was more disappointing. For the year, Sarepta guided to more than $80 million. RBC analyst Simos Simeonidis says the guidance is overly conservative. Exondys 51 has a monopoly on a market with a significant unmet medical need, he wrote.""The debate of whether the drug works or not is irrelevant at this point; the FDA has put the drug on the market,"" he wrote in a report. In the long run, payors will likely reimburse Exondys 51 ""after exhausting their usual tactics of placing obstacles and buying as much time as possible.""Simeonidis cut his price target on Sarepta stock to 91 from 98 to reflect the updated financials, guidance and Sarepta's sale of its rare pediatric disease priority review voucher to Gilead Sciences (GILD) in a $125 million deal.Needham analyst Chad Messer cut his 2017 Exondys 51 sales expectations to $109 million from $183 million. He also lowered his price target on Sarepta stock to 75 from 78, though kept his outperform rating.""We stress that this is simply a change in the slope of the ramp, not a change in peak estimates,"" he wrote in a research report. ""We still believe a majority of the about 1,400 Duchenne muscular dystrophy boys in the U.S. will ultimately be on therapy.""Messer expects broad adoption to occur in the second half of 2018 as opposed to his earlier view for year's end 2017.RELATED:Sarepta Muscular Dystrophy Drug Interrupts 5-Day Biotech SlumpAnthem, Humana, United Pack Back On Sarepta's FDA-Approved DMD DrugSarepta's Costly Muscular Dystrophy Drug Flirts With Big Pharma M&A

85,HUM,"Social Security's day of reckoning is a dozen years away, according to the Congressional Budget Office. ObamaCare may be headed for crisis as early as next year. Here's how to save both, offering more affordable coverage and preserving the old-age safety net — without breaking the Treasury.ObamaCare was sick and in need of major surgery no matter who won the election, but with the Trump administration unwilling to promote enrollment or step up enforcement of the individual mandate, the exchanges could be headed for a crisis.Humana (HUM) said on Feb. 14 that it's making a complete exit. UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET) already have one foot out the door, while Anthem (ANTM) and Molina (MOH) won't commit to sticking around in 2018.Democrats may be tempted to stand aside, watch ObamaCare unravel and let the GOP reap the whirlwind, but they have an obligation to play a constructive role. Even before this year's enrollment decline, the pool of customers was too small, too old and too costly, and premiums have soared as a result.Here's ObamaCare's harsh reality: Even among working-class households earning 150% to 250% of the poverty level, supposedly the law's big beneficiaries, just 1 in 3 people who lack insurance from other sources are getting coverage that will protect them from financial disaster. Most of the other two-thirds are uninsured, either because they or a spouse work full time and don't qualify for exchange subsidies, or else they've spurned subsidized bronze plans that carry $6,000-$7,000 deductibles.Yet here's the truth about Republican repeal-and-replace plans: They all give a better deal to young, healthy and middle-class insurance shoppers by making health care unaffordable for older, higher-cost and low-income individuals. For a 64-year-old, low-income couple, the same plan that costs $1,000 under ObamaCare could cost $18,000 under new Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price's Empowering Patients First plan.So this is the key question: Can't we come up with a more uplifting approach that doesn't treat health insurance markets as a zero-sum game, creating millions of losers as well as millions of winners?Yes, definitely. If enough Democrats are willing to be honest about ObamaCare's flaws and the extent of our budget challenges, and enough Republicans are willing to acknowledge that taking away ObamaCare's protections for millions who depend on it is not a good idea, it just might be possible to change the debate and accomplish some big things.Politics aside, there are two big hurdles standing in the way. The first is a hurdle of understanding. No one on Capitol Hill seems to realize that the best step forward for public policy, within the realm of what might be possible, is to give people a choice between the comprehensive coverage that Democrats want them to have (and that many people with chronic conditions or low incomes clearly need) and the consumer-driven model that Republicans believe in, which allows people to opt for catastrophic coverage and set aside funds to cover basic medical needs.The second hurdle is one of resources. Replacing ObamaCare with something that works much better and gives people more freedom to choose options that work for their finances won't be free. Yet, realistically, any bipartisan plan put forward can't raise tax rates and must deliver big budget savings. Some of those savings can be found within the health care system, as explained below.There is also very good reason to marry Social Security reform with a health insurance fix that keeps care affordable for people under 65. RomneyCare, the model for ObamaCare, reduced work among adults age 55 to 64, the Boston College Center for Retirement Research found.Health insurance subsidies that rise as income falls encourage people to claim Social Security benefits early, replacing a bigger paycheck. Spending a bit less on early retirement — without pulling away the floor of support for those who really need it — would give people a nudge to work longer. That would lead to better personal financial outcomes, limiting penalties people will face for retiring early — a lifelong 30% hit to annual benefits for those who claim Social Security at age 62 — and averting the need to cut Social Security benefits in very old age to restore the program to solvency.The plan here would close more than half of Social Security's financing hole without raising the retirement age or cutting any benefits for the very old, while creating a stronger minimum Social Security benefit for modest-wage workers to keep them from falling into poverty late in life — something policymakers on the left and right have wanted to do forever.A central problem with ObamaCare is that the rules stacked the deck in favor of those needing comprehensive coverage and gave a bad deal to pretty much everyone else.Think of a couple, age 30, in St. Louis, Mo., with income of $40,000 (about 200% of the poverty level) and a child covered by Medicaid. For this couple, the cheapest silver plan under ObamaCare offers pretty solid coverage but costs $2,430 — likely too much for a family that's probably already struggling to save anything. The cheapest bronze plan, costing $1,068, might be doable, but the $13,300 deductible could make a hospital stay financially devastating.The chasm between silver and bronze deductibles — $700 vs. $13,300 — is by design, though clearly a poor one. ObamaCare provides extra cost-sharing subsidies that shrink deductibles for modest-income households, but only if they buy silver plans. Those cost-sharing subsidies work exactly like premium subsidies, paid directly from the government to insurers each month, even if the policyholder gets no medical care.Looking through the lens of this 30-year-old St. Louis couple, a bipartisan replacement, merging Republican principles and Democratic values, is easy to identify.First, don't get rid of the comprehensive option. If this couple is trying to have a second child or one spouse has a chronic condition, they will be desperate for a low-deductible plan with a wide range of essential benefits.IBD'S TAKE: The difficulty of Republicans in settling on a replacement for ObamaCare is threatening to sidetrack the rest of President Trump's economic agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. That's been good for gold prices.Second, offer people the flexibility to choose a Republican option. A replacement for ObamaCare could give young, modest-income families the chance to set aside some savings for health expenses with two simple tweaks. Relax ObamaCare's age-rating restrictions that inflate insurance costs for the young, but only for high-deductible plans, keeping comprehensive plans affordable for older adults. (That could mean silver plans with a 3:1 age rating, bronze 4:1 and catastrophic 5:1.)Next, let people use cost-sharing subsidies to reduce premiums. Those two steps would shrink that 30-year-old St. Louis couple's bronze premium to zero, and they'd have about $900 left to put in a Health Savings Account to defray medical expenses — not nirvana, but a dramatic improvement over what ObamaCare offers.Families above 200% of the poverty level, who are more likely to be uninsured, should be able to opt for coverage with higher deductibles than bronze, roughly around the ""copper"" option proposed by the insurance industry and some moderate Democrats. These steps could make premiums essentially free for everyone up to 250% of the poverty level.Third, give people fair treatment. There are some 4.5 million uninsured full-time workers — and their spouses — who don't qualify for exchange subsidies, even if workplace coverage costs close to 10% of income. They shouldn't be denied the help given to people buying coverage on the individual market.Further, members of the middle class who earn too much for ObamaCare subsidies should be treated more equitably relative to their peers covered through the workplace. A logical solution would give a tax credit equal to 25% of the cost of a silver plan, while limiting the income-tax benefit to 25% of the cost of employer-provided coverage and capping that benefit for high-income households. People in the 25% tax bracket (up to $91,151 for singles and $151,900 for married couples) wouldn't be hurt by the tax change, while there would be minimal effect for those in the 28% bracket (up to $190,150 for singles and $231,450 for couples).Fourth, get rid of the mandates. The employer mandate is easy to dodge and ends up harming the low-wage workers it was supposed to help. As for the individual mandate, if people earning up to 250% of the poverty level can get coverage essentially for free, and most will get extra cash on top, there's probably no need to threaten them.Above 250% of the poverty level, post-ObamaCare rules should eliminate the incentive to go without coverage when one is young and healthy, then sign up when one's health starts deteriorating. A logical approach, much like Medicare's late-enrollment penalties, would very gradually shrink future tax subsidies based on how long people go without coverage. This should apply to both the individual market and employer market, or else people would have reason not to get coverage between jobs that offer insurance.Republican plans would steer people who develop costly conditions while their coverage has lapsed to separate subsidized high-risk pools. The idea is understandable, since a small number of high-cost patients can substantially raise premiums for the whole pool, particularly in relatively small markets. Yet, if these separate high-risk pools are supposed to offer good and affordable coverage (as they should), the availability of this option could provide peace of mind for the uninsured and encourage people to go without coverage. That's just one of the reasons why it makes more sense to hold down premiums in the individual market through another mechanism that accomplishes the same goal.That would entail an ongoing federal reinsurance program that recoups a portion of insurer expenses for the highest-cost patients, much like Alaska is doing to keep its individual market viable (while asking the federal government to foot the bill). Republican governors should be in favor of federal reinsurance, or else states with an older population or less-healthy pool of customers could end up bearing a disproportionate share of the cost of repairing and replacing ObamaCare. Reinsurance may have come under attack as part of overall opposition to ObamaCare, but it's hardly a partisan idea. It's a feature of Medicare's Part D prescription drug benefit that came into being under President George W. Bush.Allowing states to expand Medicaid but limit the expansion to 100% of the poverty level, as suggested by Urban Institute scholars, also could be a popular option among Republican governors.All of these features would create a broad, stable risk pool, with affordable coverage options and plenty of flexibility to let people get the coverage that suits them best.So how would Social Security change? One provision called Old-Age Risk-Sharing, introduced in the 2010 book ""A Well-Tailored Safety Net,"" reduces benefits in the first year of retirement, with progressively smaller cuts for lower earners, and the cuts steadily diminish over 20 years, falling to zero at age 82 for someone who claims benefits at 62.As longevity rises — though in a very unequal fashion across income groups — and people face growing risk of outliving their savings, it's sensible to carefully scale back support for early retirement. Yet because many people don't have a choice about when they stop working, it's critical to include a fail-safe function, and in this case there will be three:No. 3 involves another idea introduced in ""A Well-Tailored Safety Net,"" called a progressive saving offset. Everyone would be required to save an additional 1.5% of income per year, with the funds going into a personal account rather than to the Treasury. For low earners, two-thirds of this savings will go to an early-retirement account, with the other one-third deposited in an account that will eventually fund 5% of annual benefits, offsetting the amount by which benefits are reduced. For average earners, one-third of the 1.5% savings would go into an early-retirement account, with the other two-thirds eventually used to fund 10% of annual benefits.Here's why this mandated savings shouldn't be considered a tax hike. First, people are going to need more retirement income than Social Security will be able to afford. People can always choose to save less outside of Social Security or hold riskier investments outside of Social Security to compensate for the extra mandated savings that would likely be invested in Treasuries. Second, this is money people will own. If they die, the account is transferred to their estate. Lastly, the 1.5% of income will be matched by Social Security, though in a notional account (meaning it won't require government borrowing). This will give modest-income workers the chance to leave an inheritance via Social Security — now only possible if they die when their children are still minors — without undercutting income security.RELATED:

89,HUM,"The reviews for President Trump's speech to Congress were strongly positive, from pundits, the public and, so far, investors. But does the speech really matter.The Dow Jones industrial average soared above 21,000 for the first time at Wednesday's opening bell, with the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite also jumping to record highs. On Tuesday, the Dow industrials slipped 0.1% to end a string of 12 straight gains, while the S&P 500 index dipped 0.3%, the Nasdaq composite 0.6% and the small-cap Russell 2000 1.5%.If Trump is right that the stock market's impressive rise since his election has been driven by his policies, then what he didn't say in his speech matters a whole lot more than anything he did say. (Some of Wednesday's early gains may reflect shifting views and Treasury yields regarding a possible Federal Reserve rate hike at the March 14-15 meeting.)He didn't say how he would pay for or when he would advance his trillion-dollar infrastructure plan, a potential boon to Caterpillar (CAT), steel makers like U.S. Steel (X) and Nucor (NUE), engineering and construction firms like Fluor (FLR) and construction aggregates suppliers like Vulcan Materials (VMC). Could last week's report that the plan will be delayed until 2018 be true? Not clear, but there's more reason to think so after Tuesday night.However, Nucor, U.S. Steel, Vulcan Materials, Caterpillar and Fluor were up 2%-3% in morning action.In any event, there appears to be a logjam of contentious issues blocking the road to more spending on highways and bridges. Trump managed to successfully turn the page after a rocky first five weeks in office in part because he stayed above the fray, declining to take any clear positions on the two issues that could largely determine whether his economic agenda rises or falls: ObamaCare and tax reform.Now he's about to enter a potentially hazardous stretch of his presidency in which he'll have to take firm policy stands that may divide his narrow governing majority in the Senate.On ObamaCare, the issue that Trump said must be addressed before tax reform, the clock is ticking for him to come up with a replacement that can unify Republicans, something that has proved impossible in the seven years since the law's passage. Humana (HUM) has already said it will exit the exchanges in 2018, while Aetna (AET) and Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH) have one foot out the door, and Anthem (ANTM) and Molina (MOH) won't commit to sticking around.Shares of UnitedHealth and other health insurers rose 1%-2% intraday.Come April, if Republicans haven't gotten their ducks in a row, insurers faced with setting premiums for 2018 will be in full panic mode and may start to pull the plug on their participation in the exchanges, leaving swaths of the country with no insurers for 2018.IBD'S TAKE: Despite growing doubts about the timing and size of President Trump's tax and spending stimulus plans, markets are pricing in higher odds of the Federal Reserve hiking rates again as early as this month. Tax reform doesn't look to be any easier. Trump wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% or 20%, but the House proposal for doing so depends on raising $1 trillion with a 20% tax on imports that's being fought by Wal-Mart (WMT) and the entire retail sector. Now General Motors (GM) is calling the tax ""problematic,"" and a growing number of GOP senators oppose the idea.Trump stuck to vague generalities in his speech, saying, ""We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers.""Who would oppose that? It's only when he arrives at a plan to pay for it — if not with a border tax then by taking away valued corporate tax subsidies — that the effort will turn into a mud fight.Trump is off to a slow start in clarifying how he will put his economic agenda into action. That's not surprising, because his agenda tackles major problems that have long defied solutions, but it should make investors nervous, regardless of what Trump said last night.RELATED:

Anthem's (ANTM) $48 billion deal to buy Cigna (CI) was blocked by a federal judge late Wednesday, weeks after another judge halted Aetna's (AET) bid for Humana (HUM). Anthem said it'll appeal, and Aetna and Humana have said they're still deciding where to appeal.The question now becomes what the companies will do with the large piles of cash they allocated for the acquisitions, and whether they'll try anew at fresh takeovers under a Trump administration, whose antitrust officials could be more amenable to large consolidations. They could also opt for something more conservative in the face of widespread uncertainty about the future of the U.S. health system.But first, they may be back in court.""Anthem is significantly disappointed by the decision,"" Chief Executive Joseph Swedish said in a prepared statement. ""If not overturned, the consequences of the decision are far-reaching and will hurt American consumers.""Cigna, for its part, said it ""intends to carefully review the opinion and evaluate its options in accordance with the merger agreement."" CEO David Cordani has estimated that his company will have $7 billion to $14 billion of deployable capital, with the high end including extra debt that the company could take on if it decided to make acquisitions.""We have a track record of being very disciplined relative to our capital priorities and not allowing surplus capital to sit around,"" Cordani said on Jan. 11.Humana may be a target, once again. Cigna or Anthem may make a bid for the Louisville, Ky.-based company, which specializes in the fast-growing business of selling private health plans for the elderly, said Ana Gupte, an analyst at Leerink Partners. Cigna could also bid for WellCare Health Plans (WCG), she said.Also likely are more conservative moves by the companies, like buying back shares or investing in their own businesses, said Sarah James of Piper Jaffray.""The four deal stocks have been hoarding cash for 18 months, and now that the rulings have been announced, we believe the companies will look to deploy the capital,"" she said in a note to clients. ""The companies will most likely favor share repurchases.""The Justice Department, along with the antitrust division that sued to block the deals, could be remade under new Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was confirmed Wednesday. While antitrust officials under the Obama administration aggressively blocked a number of megadeals, over time the antitrust laws have ensured some consistency in enforcement between Republican and Democratic administrations.The case is a holdover from the Obama administration, where the Justice Department thwarted several megamergers, including Comcast's (CMCSA) attempted takeover of Time Warner Cable, Halliburton's (HAL) deal for Baker Hughes (BHI) and AT&T's (T) bid for T-Mobile U.S. (TMUS)""If health-insurance companies are thinking of merging, and they don't really compete with each other, then these decisions shouldn't discourage them,"" said Martin Gaynor, a professor of economics and health policy at Carnegie Mellon University. Companies with serious overlaps in business would still face obstacles, he said.There's also the risk that Republicans will remake large parts of the U.S. health care system as part of their plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Insurance executives may wait to see which parts of the industry the new administration and Congress favor before writing checks.The ACA, which expanded the market for Medicaid health plans and for coverage sold to individuals, hasn't been a big driver of growth for any of the firms. Still, its demise could cut off a source of growth at a time when they're looking for ways to expand.""We expect potential buyers to take their time,"" Thomas Carroll, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said in a research note. ""In our view, all potential buyers will sit back, see how the new administration reshapes U.S. health care, and digest the deal commentary of the last year and a half.""Anthem has also said it would pursue deals and buybacks as its ""Plan B"" if the Cigna transaction didn't go through. CEO Swedish has said he might attempt to expand in the Medicare Advantage market through acquisitions, for example.The 18-month effort to get the transaction done was marked by discord between Anthem and Cigna. Last year, the companies accused each other of violating the merger agreement, and the government said in court that disputes among executives had undercut the rationale for the deal.The hostility could continue. With the deal defeated, Anthem owes Cigna a $1.85 billion breakup fee under the terms of the agreement. Anthem wouldn't have to pay the breakup fee if it could prove that Cigna committed a ""willful breach"" of the merger agreement.The disputes, which spilled into court, harmed the deal's chances, said U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson. She called the hostility the ""elephant in the courtroom.""""Cigna officials provided compelling testimony undermining the projections of future savings, and the disagreement runs so deep that Cigna cross-examined the defendants' own expert,"" she wrote. ""Anthem urges the court to look away, and it attempts to minimize the merging parties' differences as a 'side issue,' a mere 'rift between the CEOs.' But the court cannot properly ignore the remarkable circumstances that have unfolded both before and during the trial.""The Anthem-Cigna case turned on the market for health plans sold to employers. In her ruling, Jackson looked at its likely effect on the sale of health insurance to ""national accounts"" — customers with more than 5,000 employees, usually spread over at least two states — within the 14 states where Anthem operates as the Blue Cross Blue Shield licensee.""Eliminating this competition from the marketplace would diminish the opportunity for the firms' ideas to be tested and refined, when this is just the sort of innovation the antitrust rules are supposed to foster,"" Jackson said in her 12-page order. Her accompanying opinion fully detailing her reasons for ruling against the deal was filed under seal.Acting Assistant Attorney General Brent Snyder of the Justice Department's antitrust division called the ruling ""a victory for American consumers.""""This merger would have stifled competition, harming consumers by increasing their health insurance premiums and slowing innovation aimed at lowering the costs of health care,"" Snyder said in a statement.

93,HUM,"Aetna (AET) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday, overcoming ObamaCare exchange losses, but offered guidance for 2017 that trailed analyst estimates.The insurer, which exited most but not all of its ObamaCare exchange markets at the end of 2016, says it will get out completely amid a disruptive political battle over their future.CEO Mark Betolini said he sees ""no possible way"" to set premiums for 2018 to meet regulatory deadlines ""given the unclear nature"" of how the exchanges will operate.The company also said it's still evaluating next steps in its proposed merger with Humana (HUM) after a federal judge rejected the $37 billion deal last week on antitrust grounds.Anthem (ANTM), whose lawsuit to salvage its proposed merger with Cigna (CI) will be ruled on soon, reports earnings before Wednesday's open.Estimates: Analysts expected Aetna to report a fourth-quarter profit of $1.44 per share, up 5.1% from a year ago, on a 5% rise in revenue to $15.841 billion.Results: The insurer easily topped profit estimates, earning $1.63 a share, helped by strong margins in its Medicare and Medicaid business, but fell a bit short of targets with revenue of $15.717 billion.Outlook: Full-year EPS of at least $8.55 vs. Wall Street views for $8.79, on revenue of $60 billion-$61 billion, below consensus for $62.225 billion.Aetna said revenue from individual and small group customers would fall by $4 billion and Medicaid contract losses would cut another $1.4 billion, with not-quite-offsetting gains from Medicare, Medicaid and its core commercial markets.Stock reaction: Aetna shares rose 1.6% to 118.61 on the stock market today. Anthem stock dipped 4 cents to 154.14. Cigna rose 0.4% and Humana fell 0.4%.IBD'S TAKE: Read why UnitedHealth is fast becoming the Amazon of health care and why it isn't sweating forthcoming policy changes under President Trump.Aetna shares initially surged after the election because it stands to benefit from corporate tax cuts and investors may have hoped a Trump administration would be more friendly to big corporate mergers.But analysts increasingly doubt that the Humana deal can be resurrected after a judge ruled it would reduce competition in Medicaid Advantage and ObamaCare exchange markets.The health care sector has underperformed during the Trump rally because of uncertainty over ObamaCare and drug pricing. Aetna said it expects its drug costs to rise in the low double-digits in 2017, reflecting both price increases and usage.RELATED:Apple, Aetna, Humana Downgraded; Comcast PT Raised Ahead Of Q4Trump, GOP Face Huge 'Now What?'

Apple was a key contributor to all the major indexes. Fed Chair Janet Yellen's somewhat hawkish tone didn't worry investors, but gave bond yields and bank stocks a boost.""Waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise,"" Fed chief Janet Yellen told Congress, a shift from her 2016 tone emphasizing downside risks to the economy. Yellen, along with other Fed officials speaking during the week, raised the odds of a near-term hike slightly. Markets don't expect a March move but see a 50-50 move by May and a strong likelihood by June.  Yellen warned against repealing financial regulations passed after the credit crisis.Meanwhile, retail sales and inflation data were stronger than expected, while small-business optimism hit a fresh 12-year high and the Philly Fed manufacturing index shot up to its strongest reading since 1984.RELATED:Worries over intensified wireless competition pressured phone company stocks after Verizon Communications (VZ) reintroduced unlimited data plans nearly six years after removing them.

95,HUM,"Aetna (AET) ended its $37 billion takeover of Humana (HUM), after deciding not to appeal a ruling by a federal judge who blocked the health insurers' combination on antitrust grounds.The companies came to a mutual agreement to terminate the deal, and Aetna will pay Humana a $1 billion breakup fee, or about $630 million after taxes. A plan to divest some assets to Molina Healthcare (MOH) — a remedy that was rejected by the judge — was also canceled, Aetna said in a statement Tuesday.Aetna and Humana, which had agreed to combine in July 2015, are free to make new deals or spend billions of dollars on buying back their own shares. Another massive health insurance deal, meanwhile, is grinding forward — for now. Anthem said on Monday that it's seeking a fast-track appeal of a different judge's ruling that blocked its own proposed $48 billion acquisition of Cigna (CI).The federal judge who blocked the Aetna-Humana deal on Jan. 23 sided with Justice Department lawyers who said that allowing the insurers to combine would harm competition, mainly in the market for Medicare Advantage plans.""While we continue to believe that a combined company would create greater value for health care consumers through improved affordability and quality, the current environment makes it too challenging to continue pursuing the transaction,"" Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said in the statement. ""Both companies need to move forward with their respective strategies.""On Jan. 31, Aetna had given a forecast for this year's profit that assumed the termination of the Humana and Molina deals.

97,HUM,"Aetna's (AET) $37 billion deal to buy rival insurer Humana (HUM) was blocked by a federal judge Monday, thwarting one of two large mergers that would reshape the U.S. health care landscape. Aetna said it was considering an appeal.The transaction would violate antitrust laws by reducing competition among insurers, U.S. District Judge John D. Bates in Washington ruled. With the deal defeated, Aetna owes Humana a $1 billion breakup fee under the terms of the merger agreement.Aetna lost 2.5% in midday trades. Humana fell 1.4%. Molina Healthcare (MOH), which would have benefited from a deal to buy divested assets from Aetna and Humana, slumped 2.5%.""We're reviewing the opinion now and giving serious to consideration to an appeal after putting forward a compelling case,"" T.J. Crawford, an Aetna spokesman, said. A Humana spokesman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The ruling is another victory for antitrust enforcement efforts initiated by the Obama administration. A separate Justice Department challenge, against Anthem's (ANTM) $48 billion bid for Cigna (CI), is also pending a ruling. Investors saw the ruling as a bad sign for that deal. Anthem fell 1.1%, while Cigna lost 0.5%.""If the judge blocked this deal, there is very little, if any, chance that the Anthem-Cigna deal gets cleared,"" Jason McGorman, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said by email. He added that analysts and investors had thought that the Aetna-Humana deal ""had a better chance of settlement/clearance"" than Anthem-Cigna.The Obama Justice Department frustrated a slew of megamergers amid a wave of record deal making, including Comcast's (CMCSA) attempted takeover of Time Warner Cable, Halliburton's (HAL) deal for Baker Hughes (BHI) and AT&T's (T) bid for T-Mobile US (TMUS). The Trump administration is taking over investigations into AT&T's deal for Time Warner (TWX) and Bayer's (BAYRY) proposed combination with Monsanto (MON).The government case against the merger focused on the market for private health plans for the elderly, known as Medicare Advantage. The U.S. argued the Aetna-Humana deal would have eliminated competition between the insurers in 364 counties in 21 states and likely forced seniors to pay higher premiums for Medicare Advantage plans. It also threatened competition on the insurance exchanges set up under ObamaCare, the Justice Department said.Aetna countered that the Medicare market is much larger than the Justice Department claims because it includes both Medicare Advantage plans and original Medicare, providing more choice for seniors than the government portrayed. Competition on the exchanges isn't an issue, they said, because Aetna withdrew from all 17 counties at issue in the government's case.The judge sided with the government's view of the Medicare Advantage market.""In that market, which is the primary focus of this case, the merger is presumptively unlawful — a conclusion that is strongly supported by direct evidence of head-to head competition as well,"" Bates wrote. ""The companies' rebuttal arguments are not persuasive.""

100,HUM,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH) beat fourth-quarter earnings forecasts Tuesday, helped by reduced cost pressure from its ObamaCare exchange business.Earnings of $2.11 per share were up 50.7% from a year ago and 4 cents ahead of the consensus. Revenue rose 9.0% to $47.52 billion, topping views of $47.13 billion.The company stood by its financial outlook for 2017: Revenue of $197 billion-$199 billion and adjusted EPS of $9.30-$9.60. Wall Street analysts see revenue of $198.3 billion and EPS of $9.51.Shares eased by 0.7% to 160.66 on the stock market today, despite the positive tone of the earnings and analyst call.UnitedHealth appeared to be caught up in a downdraft triggered by President-elect Donald Trump's weekend comments that clouded the prospects for corporate tax reform. Aetna (AET) was off 1% to 121.04, Anthem (ANTM) lost 1.2% to 146.75, Cigna (CI) dropped 1.1% to 144.77, while Humana (HUM) shares managed a 0.6% gain to 204.04.While other insurers' shares have been volatile amid ObamaCare woes and the antitrust outlook, UnitedHealth has been a standout stock, driven by its fast-growing Optum health services unit. UnitedHealth, whose shares vaulted above a buy point on Nov. 10 on the way to a 13% postelection rise, had been carving out a tight, constructive consolidation base before Tuesday's volatile session.Optum unit revenue growth temporarily slowed in Q4 due a 4.8% decline in revenues at the OptumRx pharmacy benefit management services unit. That decline reflected a loss of business that had been anticipated when UnitedHealth bought Catamaran.As the first big health insurer to report, UnitedHealth said its medical costs as a share of premium revenue fell 1.9 percentage points to 80.8% in Q4, helped by ""reduced individual market pressure.""While exchange losses were basically in line with expectations in Q4, the real improvement came vs. a year ago when UnitedHealth had recognized a premium deficiency reserve due to its ailing exchange business.UnitedHealth remains in a handful of ObamaCare exchange markets in 2017, but management said it has virtually no earnings exposure to the exchanges this year.The company added 2.2 million insured members in 2016, including 585,000 Medicaid beneficiaries. It expects its expects its Medicare membership to grow by 1 million in 2017.RELATED:UnitedHealth, The Amazon Of Health Care, Isn't Sweating Trump

103,HUM,"Like the proverbial dog who just caught the car he's been chasing, Republicans are about to gain control of ObamaCare's fate, but with no clear idea what to do with it — or how to bury it.The GOP says that it will take several years to put what would inevitably be called TrumpCare in place, but they don't want the responsibility for overseeing and enforcing ObamaCare — individual mandate and all — in the interim.Republicans have settled on what might be called a hurry-up-and-wait solution to this awkward spot they're in: Repeal ObamaCare as soon as January but wait to sunset most of its provisions until perhaps 2020. Yet a range of policy experts, including some Republicans, and health care industry players have warned that repealing the law without simultaneously replacing it could blow up the individual insurance market operating under ObamaCare rules.After a repeal vote, even if the GOP were to keep the individual mandate, relatively young and healthy people may be even less likely to sign up for coverage. Under such conditions, health insurers which have already grown weary of taking it on the chin in the ObamaCare exchanges might not stick around. UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) already are exiting most of the ObamaCare markets where they did business in 2016. Anthem (ANTM) has warned that it might do the same.The risk is that large swathes of the country could find themselves with zero individual market insurers in 2018. That would be an emergency, which might prompt the government to try and fill those gaps by essentially bribing insurers to offer coverage or perhaps temporarily removing income limits for Medicaid.IBD'S TAKE: Read why UnitedHealth is fast becoming the Amazon of health care and why it isn't sweating forthcoming policy changes under Donald Trump.There are two apparent motivating factors behind the GOP repeal-now strategy: 1) Republicans can claim to have done something substantive for those who oppose the law; and 2) They can justify a vote to cut some ObamaCare taxes immediately, including  a 3.8% tax on investment income.With a 52-48 majority, Republicans would need to keep all but two senators on board to repeal ObamaCare provisions through a procedure known as reconciliation that is limited to tax and spending measures. That means many of ObamaCare's key provisions, such as those guaranteeing coverage to everyone at a price unrelated to health status, would stay in place until there's a bipartisan consensus to get rid of them.At least two Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, have said the GOP should have a replacement plan lined up before repeal, so there's some possibility that a repeal of ObamaCare's major tax and spending provisions won't make it to Donald Trump's desk.Repealing the Medicaid expansion, which provided coverage up to 138% of the poverty level, would be more straightforward to do through reconciliation. The GOP has long sought to deliver Medicaid funding to states in the form of block grants that provide greater flexibility but which are likely to increase at a rate below health care inflation to curb government spending.Hospitals were already in a bad place before the election, but the outlook is even bleaker now. IBD's Medical-Hospitals industry group is ranked No. 195 out of 197 based on price performance, trailed only by gold and solar power.Outright appeal of the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion and individual market subsidies could cost hospitals $400 billion in revenue and $165.8 billion in income over the coming decade, an analysis for the Federation of American Hospitals and American Hospital Association found.Yet Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick, who downgraded Tenet Healthcare (THC) to underperform on Nov. 21, has warned of further downside for hospitals from Medicaid block grants that push states from traditional fee-for-service Medicaid into adopting Medicaid managed care programs. Skolnick estimates that hospitals get 48% less in revenue per patient from Medicaid managed care than fee for service. Likewise, she says, Medicare Advantage pays 17% less per patient than traditional Medicare, suggesting more downside if Republicans turn Medicare into a premium-support program as House Speaker Paul Ryan has advocated. Health insurers, on the other hand, might stand to gain from GOP-style Medicaid and Medicare reform, which could bring an influx of new customers.RELATED:The Only Way For TrumpCare To Be 'Terrific'

"
105,HUM,"ObamaCare was on the way to the emergency room and in need of major surgery no matter who won the election.The pool of customers is too small, too old and too costly, and premiums are soaring as a result. The reason is simple: The law succeeded in making insurance affordable for older, higher-cost, and near-poor individuals, but has fallen far short of its promise for those who are relatively young, lower cost, working class and middle class.Those latter groups comprise some 24 million people who lack either employer or government coverage, and if TrumpCare were to give them a better deal, while preserving the protections afforded to the vulnerable, Democrats would have every reason to get on board.There is an exceedingly simple bipartisan formula for replacing ObamaCare's individual market reforms with ""something terrific,"" in Donald Trump's words, at least relative to the status quo and to the GOP plans on the table.That formula, explained in further detail below, is this: Get rid of the heavy-handed mandates and give people a choice between the comprehensive coverage that Democrats want them to have (and that many people with chronic conditions or low incomes clearly need) and the consumer-driven model that Republicans believe in, which allows people to opt for catastrophic care and set aside funds in a Health Savings Account to cover basic medical needs.There's good reason to think that this is the only possible path to a bipartisan health care fix and that the political window for seizing this opportunity may quickly shut if not seized early in 2017. Unfortunately, the GOP is contemplating a repeal-now, fix-later strategy that, at worst, could blow up the individual health insurance market or, at best, let ObamaCare's problems fester for three years or more, hurting millions and millions of working-class and middle-class individuals and families that need — and in many cases voted for — a better deal.Keeping ObamaCare on life support for years while the GOP wracks its collective brain to come up with something terrific would require insurer ""bailouts"" — the Republicans' own term for it — that could exceed anything seen under President Obama. To keep insurers from bolting the troubled markets en masse after a repeal vote, Republicans would have to essentially guarantee that they'll at least break even after administrative expenses.Republicans would be attending to the bottom line of big insurers such as Aetna (AET), Cigna (CI) and Humana (HUM) while ignoring the needs of 20-plus million people who are getting a bad deal from ObamaCare and would like to see that deal ripped up tomorrow.Before getting into the details of a replacement, let's take a moment to consider just who these 20-plus million people are who have nothing to gain and much to lose from repeal and delay.IBD'S TAKE: Despite the uncertainty over what will happen to ObamaCare and Medicaid in the Trump era, shares of UnitedHealth have surged to a record high since the election. Here's why the company is well on its way to becoming the Amazon of health care.There are about 7 million people buying ObamaCare plans off the exchange, mostly because they earn too much to qualify for exchange subsidies. That's hardly fair treatment when nearly everybody else gets government subsidies to buy health insurance, either through the tax exclusion for employer-provided coverage or through a government program. On top of that, there are another 3 million with income above ObamaCare's 400% of poverty level cut-off for subsidies who remain uninsured and more than a million buying unsubsidized coverage through the exchanges. All of these people would stand to benefit from GOP proposals to offer a tax credit for everyone buying coverage in the non-employer market, but Republicans in Congress now say that such ideas may be put on ice, even as ObamaCare premiums are soaring, making coverage harder to attain.Another 4.5 million people are uninsured despite working full time and having an offer of employer coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. These people have modest to moderate incomes that would qualify them for ObamaCare subsidies, but they — and their spouses — are ineligible as long as employer coverage doesn't cost more than about 9.7% of income. That means high-deductible bronze-level coverage can cost some full-timers five times or even upwards of 10 times what its costs someone at the same income level who is eligible for exchange subsidies (perhaps because they work two part-time jobs or at a smaller company not subject to ObamaCare's employer mandate).KFF estimates that there are another 5.3 million uninsured people who are eligible for subsidies but have spurned ObamaCare coverage, either because they see it as a bad deal — even with subsidies, if they buy coverage, and fines, if they don't — or perhaps aren't fully aware of their eligibility. The Urban Institute estimates this group is even larger, comprising 6.9 million people.Finally, there are 2.6 million low-income Americans in states like Texas and Florida who earn too little to qualify for Medicaid but can't get exchange subsidies. That's because the Supreme Court created a coverage gap when it ruled that the Medicaid expansion must be voluntary for states.That makes about 24 million Americans who have a huge stake in the GOP's coming decision, and that doesn't even include the 8 million-plus subsidized ObamaCare exchange customers who don't want to see their coverage disrupted or roughly 10 million gaining coverage via the Medicaid expansion.If Republicans stick to their repeal and delay strategy, experts warn that the individual insurance market could be thrown into crisis with far-reaching repercussions. While the GOP can conceivably avoid outright chaos in the individual market by protecting insurers' bottom lines, what will that achieve? They'll never get any Democratic votes needed to overcome a filibuster and there will likely never be a bridge to a strictly Republican vision of reform. To understand why, just consider this analysis showing that the same plan which costs a 64-year-old couple earning 150% of the poverty level (about $23,600) less than $1,000 under ObamaCare would cost the couple roughly $18,000 under the Empowering Patients First Act authored by Rep. Tom Price, Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.Making coverage affordable for older, higher-cost, low-income patients isn't the problem with ObamaCare. The problem is that ObamaCare's rules stacked the deck in favor of comprehensive coverage and gave a bad deal to pretty much everyone else, which is why the pool of customers is too small, too old and too costly.Even among households earning 150% to 250% of the poverty level, a group that was supposed to be among the big beneficiaries of the law, just 1 in 3 people who lack insurance from other sources are getting silver-level coverage that will protect them from financial disaster, an IBD analysis of ObamaCare's effect on the working class has found.Consider the example of a couple, age 30, in St. Louis, Mo., with pre-tax income of $40,000 (200% of the poverty level) and a child covered by Medicaid. For this couple, the cheapest silver plan under ObamaCare this year costs about $2,200, and carries a $1,000 deductible (and $4,500 out-of-pocket limit on top of premiums), but they're probably already struggling to save money and that may be too much of a financial stretch.Alternatively, this couple could buy the cheapest bronze plan for $1,260, but it carries a $13,700 deductible, which means that a trip to the hospital could be financially devastating.The chasm between silver and bronze deductibles — $1,000 vs. $13,700 — is by design, though clearly a poor one. The architects of ObamaCare decided to attach extra cost-sharing support only to silver plans, effectively turning silver plans to platinum for modest-income beneficiaries while making bronze plans of questionable value. Those cost-sharing subsidies work exactly like premium subsidies, paid directly from the government to insurers on a monthly basis, whether or not the policy holder gets medical care.Looking through the lens of this 30-year-old St. Louis couple, a bipartisan replacement that merges Republican principles and Democratic values is easy to identify.First, don't get rid of the comprehensive option. If this couple is trying to have a second child or one spouse has a chronic condition, they will be desperate for a comprehensive policy that limits their liability.Second, offer people the flexibility to choose a Republican option: a high-deductible plan with a Health Savings Account on top. TrumpCare, unlike ObamaCare, could give young, modest-income families the chance to set aside some savings with two simple tweaks. ObamaCare's age-rating restrictions that inflate insurance costs for the young could be eased for high-deductible plans (without putting comprehensive plans out of reach of older adults), and cost-sharing subsidies could be used against bronze plan premiums. Those two steps would shrink that 30-year-old St. Louis couple's premium to zero this year, and they'd have about $800 left in a Health Savings Account to defray medical expenses.While Democrats don't want modest-income households to opt for high-deductible plans that could sink their finances, having some coverage is better than none, as is all too common at present — despite ObamaCare's penalties for those who go uncovered. That's why families above 200% of the poverty level should be able to opt for catastrophic coverage — with higher deductibles than bronze, roughly around the ""copper"" option proposed by the insurance industry and some moderate Democratic senators. This approach, along with the tweaks noted above, could make coverage free for everyone up to about 250% of the poverty level.Third, give people fair treatment. There's no reason why members of the middle class who earn too much for ObamaCare subsidies should be denied a comparable level of help given to those who get coverage through the workplace. A logical way to do this would be giving a tax credit equal to 25% of the cost of a silver plan, while limiting the income-tax benefit to 25% of the cost of employer-provided coverage and capping that benefit for high-income households. Further, full-time low-wage workers who can't afford the coverage offered at work and their spouses shouldn't be denied the help given to people buying coverage on the individual market.Fourth, get rid of the mandates. The employer mandate is easy to dodge and ends up harming the low-wage workers it was supposed to help. As for the individual mandate, if people earning up to 250% of the poverty level can get coverage essentially for free, and those with lower incomes get Health Saving Account deposits on top, there's really no point in threatening them with penalties.Even for people above 250% of the poverty level, coverage would be a lot cheaper for the young adults who are the prime target of the individual mandate, so take-up would naturally increase. Still, to ensure a broad risk pool, TrumpCare should eliminate the incentive to go without coverage when one is young and healthy, then sign up when one's health starts deteriorating. A logical approach would very gradually and incrementally shrink tax subsidies for those above 250% of the poverty level based on how long they go without coverage. This should apply to both the individual market and employer market, or else people would have reason not to get coverage between jobs.Republican plans would steer people who develop costly conditions while their coverage has lapsed to separate subsidized high-risk pools. The idea is understandable, since a small number of high-cost patients can substantially raise premiums for the whole pool, particularly in relatively small markets. Yet, if the coverage provided by these separate high-risk pools is good and affordable (as it should be), the availability of this option could provide peace of mind for the uninsured and encourage people to go without coverage. That's one reason why it may make more sense to hold down premiums in the individual market through another mechanism that accomplishes the same goal. That would entail an ongoing federal reinsurance program that recoups insurer expenses of the highest-cost patients, much like Alaska is doing to keep its individual market viable (while asking the federal government for financial backing). Reinsurance may have come under attack as part of overall opposition to ObamaCare, but it's hardly a partisan idea. Public reinsurance is a feature of Medicare's Part D prescription drug benefit that came into being under President George W. Bush.All of these features would create a broad, stable risk pool, affordable coverage options and plenty of flexibility to let people get the coverage that suits them best, including an option for modest-income households to deposit subsidies in excess of premiums in a Health Savings Account. This approach, or something very close to it, is likely the only approach to replacing ObamaCare's individual market reforms that can win bipartisan support, but the chance for seizing it may go quickly out the window if Republicans opt for repeal and put the replacement debate on hold.The reason why should be clear: Making sure that no one currently benefiting from ObamaCare is ""worse off"" and that the 20 million-plus who get a bad deal can get a better deal — the goal for replacing the law sketched out by Paul Ryan — will require some hard choices. That includes reforming the income-tax (though not payroll-tax) exclusion for employer-provided coverage as outlined above. There are other logical offsets as well to pay for what essentially would be a tax cut for millions of people without raising tax rates. But once the debate is poisoned by the consequences of repeal and delay on the individual market, and once Republicans move forward with the rest of their tax-cutting agenda, the opportunity will almost certainly be gone. At that point, as in President Bush's failed push for Social Security reform in 2005, Democrats will have a whole list of Trump tax cuts they'll want repealed before they begin to consider reforms that require any politically difficult trade-offs.

107,HUM,"Payers like Anthem (ANTM), Humana (HUM) and United Healthcare (UNH) are either broadly denying or in UNH's case restricting coverage of Sarepta Therapies' (SRPT) FDA-approved Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug, Jefferies analyst Gena Wang said Wednesday.Wang slashed her price target on Sarepta Therapies stock to 32 from 46. She has a hold rating on Sarepta stock, which crashed 5.8% to close at 29.98 on Wednesday. Shares are down 17% this year and have traded under their 50-day moving average since late October.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to Sarepta's Exondys 51 in September. The drug targets 13% of the DMD population with confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 51 skipping.But the drug is costly. Sarepta estimates average annual cost at about $300,000 per patient. The majority of patients would be covered by Medicaid and benefit from a 23.1% discount. Private plans would likely get the same discount, Wang said.""There appears to be no legal consequence, according to KOLs (key opinion leaders) for payers (Medicaid and private) to restrict/deny coverage, citing clinical benefit as No. 1 criteria for coverage decisions and FDA approval status as secondary,"" she wrote in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Sarepta might be diving, but fellow biotech Regeneron has a bright future ahead on eczema drug dupilumab, an analyst said Tuesday. What takeaways are there for the broader biotech sector. Head to IBD Industry Themes for the bigger picture.Outside the Medicaid and private arenas, though, Wang says three of five national and eight of 15 regional managed care organizations (MCOs) have said they would largely deny coverage of Exondys 51.Anthem denies coverage of Exondys 51, saying the drug ""failed to show it improves health outcomes."" Humana has said it would cover Exondys 51 on ambulatory patients provided they remain able to walk. The drug will be approved every six months or as determined through clinical review.Wang notes that it's ""largely unprecendented"" for an FDA-approved drug to be denied or restricted.Aetna (AET) requires the drug be initiated before age 14 and patients be able to average a six-minute walking distance.United Healthcare is mostly unrestricted, but will only cover the drug for the initial four weeks and likely require monitoring after the first month, Wang said.Only certain Cigna (CI) plans cover Exondys 51, she wrote. CVS Health's (CVS) Caremark would cover the drug for 12 months, but then look for improvement in dystrophin levels or a six-minute walking distance before renewal. Express Scripts (ESRX) hasn't disclosed its plans for Exondys 51.Most pediatric hospitals and clinics administering Exondys 51 would be eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, Wang said. Home infusion could potentially cut down on costs, but Wang sees that as a long shot outside of private insurance plans.Editor's Note: Clarifies first paragraph to note the United Healthcare restricts, but does not deny, coverage of the Sarepta DMD drug.

108,HUM,"There are a number of huge problems with Republicans repealing ObamaCare now but putting off a fix for several years as they figure out how to replace it.The first is that repeal without replace risks blowing up the already-ailing exchanges. The news that ObamaCare has been repealed, even if the fine print says the individual mandate penalties stay in force, will lead the young and healthy to abandon the exchanges in droves for the same reason that relatively few signed up in the first place: ObamaCare offers them a pretty unattractive deal.UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) have already mostly exited the exchanges. If ObamaCare were repealed now but kept on life support while the GOP figures out how to replace it, other insurers like Anthem (ANTM) would be crazy to keep offering coverage — short of a government backstop that ensures they'll do no worse than break even. Without such a commitment, it's reasonable to expect huge swathes of the country to have zero insurers left on the subsidized exchanges, and Republicans would reap a backlash.What would happen then? The GOP would likely have to resort to what is effectively an emergency public option, with the government filling the void via Medicare or Medicaid — just as occurred in Massachusetts in 2014 because of that exchange's temporary technical glitches. Wouldn't it be ironic if ObamaCare repeal turns out to be a big step to single payer?While avoiding this disruptive scenario is critically important, that's hardly the only reason why it's essential to replace ObamaCare without delay. Even if Republicans can buy time by removing insurer risk, there's another huge reason to move forward without delay.Much of the reason is embedded in this first chart, which shows that ObamaCare hasn't only been a failure for middle-class households, which get little or no help buying coverage, but it's failing a wide majority of working-class households too.The chart shows that 2 in 3 members of the working class (with incomes from 150% to 250% of the poverty level) who lack coverage from other sources remain uninsured or, to a lesser extent, are getting bronze coverage that won't protect them from a devastating financial hit if they land in the hospital.Republicans were hired to replace ObamaCare with ""something terrific,"" as Donald Trump promised to do, not to kick the can and do nothing for far too many millions of people who are getting a bad deal from ObamaCare. And Republicans should remember something that Democrats too easily forgot: Millions of full-time low-wage workers get perhaps the worst deal of all from ObamaCare, since they are excluded from subsidies, but may still be subject to penalties.Also, don't forget about those 2.6 million low-income Americans in states like Texas and Florida who earn too little to qualify for Medicaid but can't get exchange subsidies. That's because the Supreme Court created a coverage gap when it ruled that states must be able to opt out of the Medicaid expansion.IBD'S TAKE: Despite the uncertainty over what will happen to ObamaCare and Medicaid in the Trump era, shares of UnitedHealth have surged to a record high since the election. Here's why the company is well on its way to becoming the Amazon of health care.These problems are far too urgent for Republicans to waste several years trying to come up with a plan that has eluded them for the nearly seven years since the Affordable Care Act was passed.The reality is that Republicans are not ready for prime time when it comes to health care. They have no actual plan to replace ObamaCare with either something that is terrific or even that comes close to Paul Ryan's pledge to leave no one ""worse off"" while giving most people a better deal.To see just how far the GOP is from keeping faith with Ryan's word, all you really have to do is look at one chart that exposes the weakest link in the Empowering Patients First plan put forward by Tom Price, Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.The chart shows that a 64-year-old couple earning 150% of the poverty level (about $24,000) would have to pay about $18,000 a year for the same low-deductible coverage that costs less than $1,000 under ObamaCare.The reality is that Republicans are at a loss about how to proceed, but that doesn't provide a legitimate excuse for, at best, letting ObamaCare's very serious problems fester while the government soaks up insurer losses or, at worst, blowing apart the exchanges. Repeal and replace later is a bridge to nowhere.It should be clear that repealing without replacing ObamaCare will inflict great damage for no good reason. Republicans don't need moral victories. They're in power and need to show they can govern. So what is the GOP to do? Monday's piece will explain a surprisingly logical path to making TrumpCare terrific without an individual mandate — and without delay.RELATED:Trump, GOP Will Create New ObamaCare Winners, LosersWhy Obama Is Wrong About ObamaCare, In One Chart
"
109,HUM,"No industry faces more upheaval from the changing of the guard in the White House than the health sector, with Donald Trump pledging to sweep away ObamaCare, the defining policy effort of outgoing President Barack Obama.Yet, despite the uncertainty over whether up to 22 million people might lose coverage, health insurance stocks — with a few exceptions — have been among the big winners of the stock market's postelection rally.A few drivers of the rally are pretty obvious. Repeal of ObamaCare is expected to kill an insurance industry tax that cut the profit of industry leader UnitedHealth Group (UNH) by $1.85 billion in 2016. President Obama and Congress already passed a one-year moratorium of the tax for 2017.A Trump administration that may be less hostile to big business combinations could let Aetna (AET) complete its acquisition of Humana (HUM) and Anthem (ANTM) close its deal to buy Cigna (CI). That latter deal could create the nation's largest health insurer, displacing UnitedHealth for the top spot in the number of insured.Still, UnitedHealth, though it's not the best sector performer since the election, is alone among major insurers in reaching an all-time high.""We see the next 10 years as holding even greater opportunity and growth than the last 10 years for this company,"" Chief Executive Stephen Hemsley said at the company's recent Investor Day conference.UnitedHealth, which is No. 6 on the Fortune 500 list and still would tower over Anthem-Cigna based on revenue — an estimated $184 billion vs. $123 billion combined in 2016 — doesn't have to have the most clients to be the Amazon.com (AMZN) of health care, as it appears well on its way to becoming.No company is better situated to capitalize on the irrepressible growth in health care spending, aging demographics and the inevitable need to control costs, and those trends are far too powerful to be derailed by a change at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.""What has UnitedHealth standing apart from other insurers is Optum,"" its fast-growing, higher-margin, health-services division that will contribute more than 40% of company operating profit this year, CFRA Research analyst Jeffrey Loo told Investor's Business Daily.Optum, which is on pace to grow revenue by 22.8% to $83 billion for 2016, has three main parts: OptumInsight, a data-analytics division; OptumRx, its prescription benefit management business; and OptumHealth, which provides medical care via 20,000 physicians and more than 500 primary and urgent care centers.Like Amazon, UnitedHealth has become the leader in customer data analytics and personalization — though instead of suggesting other books you might like, Optum can provide proactive help filling gaps in care. That might include scheduling an overdue mammogram or signing up someone ordering a prescription for a long-term diabetes-management program.Also like Amazon, UnitedHealth has expanded horizontally, carving out new ground to better fulfill its customers' needs, such as through its fast-growing network of urgent care centers. Similarly, UnitedHealth's OptumInsight unit has opened up fast-growing markets selling its expertise, just like Amazon Web Services.""Optum, while participating in a contested market, has created a demand for its technologies and services,"" noted research and consulting firm Frost & Sullivan in naming Optum its 2016 company of the year in population health management. ""The company is equally versed to draw evidence from payers, providers, employers and consumers,"" informing its ""holistic health care approach.""IBD'S TAKE: Shares of UnitedHealth are extended after breaking above a buy point at 144.58 on Nov. 10. Visit IBD University for a primer on timing stock purchases and be sure to read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's underlying trend and what it means for investment decisions.All these elements, along with its mining of data derived from the 50 million people it covers and the 1 billion prescriptions it processes in a year, come together to let UnitedHealth deliver what executives like to say is ""the right care at the right place at the right time"" to achieve the best outcome while holding down costs.Despite political uncertainty over ObamaCare, Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick upgraded UnitedHealth to a buy rating this week following the company's Tuesday investor conference.""UnitedHealth made a compelling argument at its Investors Day that its balanced portfolio and growth, its innovative approaches and its commitment to fixing a broken health care system likely insulate it from downside due to political change,"" she wrote, seeing sustainable double-digit growth in earnings per share.OptumInsight CEO Bill Miller told investors that nearly 700 hospitals are using Optum analytics to predict outcomes and guide treatment for their patient populations, including more than 100 additional hospitals over the past year. Further, he said, 20 of the 25 top health plans have tapped Optum to improve their claims processing.UnitedHealth stubbed its toe with ObamaCare, piling up losses and beating a nearly full retreat from individual exchange business, but Loo sees that as being due to problems with the exchanges, rather than exposing a weakness of the company.While big coverage losses with the unwinding of ObamaCare could hurt UnitedHealth, which has benefited from the expansion of Medicaid coverage, Loo also sees potential upside from the GOP's election sweep. On one hand, efforts to rein in Medicaid could be a negative, but fiscal curbs also could lead more states to shift to Medicaid managed care. UnitedHealth told investors that it is starting five new Medicaid managed care contracts in 2017.Likewise, the GOP has always preferred Medicare Advantage to traditional fee-for-service Medicare, so there's a possibility of faster growth there. Hemsley preached his vision to investors — as the company does to policymakers in Washington — of fully shifting both Medicaid and Medicare to managed care.Such a strategy could reap savings for the government while giving UnitedHealth and other insurers a bigger cut of the government health-care pie. Currently, less than two-thirds of 72 million Medicaid beneficiaries are enrolled in managed care programs, while about 30% of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.UnitedHealth signaled to analysts that its insured base could drop by 1 million in the individual market — both on and off the exchanges — amid its pullback from ObamaCare, but that will be a tailwind for earnings in 2017 because the company has lost about $850 million on the exchanges this year.UnitedHealth shares started to break out in late October, retreated, and then surged in mid-November. Shares had been on a four-day rally but slowed to a crawl, and fell by 1.9% to close at 157.63 on Monday.

110,HUM,"Aetna's (AET) attempt to assuage U.S. antitrust concerns about its $37 billion takeover of Humana (HUM) by selling certain assets to a smaller company landed with a resounding thud.The companies are trying to convince a federal judge that the Justice Department's rejection of the deal was wrong. A trial on the government's lawsuit started Monday in Washington.The firm Aetna wants to sell assets to, Molina Healthcare (MOH), is unlikely to replace the competition that would be lost from the merger, according a filing by the U.S. Molina was criticized by the government as a junk-rated company whose previous foray into the Medicare Advantage market flopped.""Today, the companies compete directly against one another,"" Justice Department lawyer Craig Conrath said in his opening statement. ""All this competition would be eliminated by the merger.""The Justice Department sued Humana and Aetna in July, the same day it filed a complaint seeking to halt Anthem's (ANTM) $48 billion acquisition of Cigna (CI). The antitrust lawsuits are aimed at preventing the contraction of the national health insurance market to just a handful of players and protect competition in an industry that President Barack Obama reshaped with the 2010 Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare.""Health insurance can mean the difference between life and death,"" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said when the lawsuits were filed. ""If the big five were to become the big three, not only would the bank accounts of American people suffer, but the American people themselves.""While the ACA was meant to make health insurance more accessible and more affordable to tens of millions of people who lacked coverage, the law has been beset by legal and political opposition. Enrollment has fallen short of estimates and financial losses have prompted some companies to withdraw from the market.Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna in August announced it would stop selling ObamaCare coverage in 11 of the 15 states in which it participated in the program, including all 17 of the Florida, Georgia and Missouri counties where the U.S. has claimed its merger with Humana would decrease competition.""Because Aetna no longer operates in the challenged counties, the merger will have no effect on market concentration or competition,"" the company said in a Nov. 23 filing with U.S. District Judge John Bates.The U.S. argues that Aetna's withdrawal was aimed at undermining the government's case and said that nothing prevents Aetna from re-entering those markets after sitting out a year.Aetna's acquisition of Humana would leave the carrier dominant in Medicare Advantage coverage for the elderly in 364 counties in 21 states, Justice Department lawyers argued.Aetna and Humana attorneys claim that Medicare Advantage operates in the same market as the government's Medicare program and therefore the combined company can't be dominant.""To be sure, there may be differences among original Medicare options and Medicare Advantage products, but such differences are not sufficient to support separate markets,"" the companies said in a filing.Aetna shares plunged 3% to close at 129.45 Monday. Humana fell 2.3% to 208.83. Anthem was off fractionally to 144.09 while Cigna was up nearly 1% to 134.70. UnitedHealth dropped 1.9% to 157.63.

115,HUM,"The root of ObamaCare's mounting problems is that far too many people — even those eligible for big subsidies — see the plans as either unaffordable or such a bad deal that they're willing to risk paying a fine.That goes a long way to explaining why the exchanges are attracting a small group of customers who are disproportionately old and in relatively poor health, why the cheapest bronze-plan premiums are set to spike 28%, and why UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) are bolting most of the markets where they're doing business.In replacing ObamaCare with ""something terrific,"" as Donald Trump has pledged to do, he may not find it especially hard to give a better deal to those millions of middle-class and working-class households that get a bad deal from the exchanges. Yet Trump also will have to find a way to meet the needs of millions of low-income families and older adults, many with costly chronic conditions, for whom the law has been a godsend.The reality check for Trump is that there is a vast gap between the financial support that a modest-income older adult with a chronic condition will need to make health care affordable and what the GOP is on record as supporting.This look at just how the Empowering Patients First Act, a GOP blueprint for replacing ObamaCare, would serve the needs of modest-income, older adults relative to the ObamaCare exchanges should be eye-opening — to say the least.Consider that for a 64-year-old couple earning 150% of the poverty level ($23,895), an ObamaCare silver plan in 2017 will cost a bit less than $1,000, after subsidies, and cap out-of-pocket spending at $1,000 to $2,000. That means, in a really bad scenario, the couple might end up spending from 8% to 12% of annual income on insurance and medical bills.A key question is how much low-income adults can reasonably afford to pay in premiums and additional medical expenses before the cost of health care overwhelms their finances. Those on the right worried about the size of government might argue that the couple could reasonably afford to pay a somewhat bigger share of income, but how much more? Would it be reasonable to put this couple on the hook for up to 15% of income? Would 25% of income make the couple shoulder too much financial risk?Now consider how the couple would fare under the Empowering Patients First Act, legislation put forward by House and Senate Republicans that has been at least loosely endorsed by every GOP health policy wonk. The same low-deductible coverage that costs less than $1,000 in after-subsidy premiums under ObamaCare could cost the couple about $18,000 under this leading Republican plan, putting them on the hook for up to 80% of their annual income, including out-of-pocket costs.How does a sub-$1,000 plan under ObamaCare turn into an $18,000 plan under the GOP? First, the GOP believes it's a bad idea to provide subsidies that rise with income, because that can be an incentive for people to earn less, but there are other ways to mitigate this concern than slashing subsidies to lower earners. The GOP plan gives $6,000 to couples at least 50 years old to help with premiums. Back in 2015, before exchange premiums began to spike due to the exchanges' stunted growth and unhealthy risk pool, ObamaCare gave the same couple a premium subsidy of $14,846, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation health subsidy calculator.(For 2017, ObamaCare's subsidy will rise to $19,592 to offset the surge in premiums. The comparison here uses ObamaCare's 2015 premiums and subsidies to provide a fair comparison, or else the GOP subsidies would look stingier.)Second, even a comparison of premium subsidies understates the cost difference between ObamaCare and GOP alternatives, because ObamaCare provides another layer of subsidies to low-income enrollees to offset out-of-pocket costs. Those extra cost-sharing subsidies, which are paid directly to insurers, effectively turn a silver plan to platinum, lowering the cap on out-of-pocket medical bills from about $13,000 to $2,000 or less. For the older 64-year-old couple, those extra cost-sharing subsidies effectively add just over $5,000 to ObamaCare's premium subsidy.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of some health insurers have been flying since Donald Trump's surprise victory, now that big mergers might get a friendlier hearing than they did from the Obama administration. Although UnitedHealth is staying solo, for now, its stock surged above a buy point and hit a record high. Meanwhile, Centene and Molina, the fastest growing insurers in the ObamaCare era, are tanking amid uncertainty about the Medicaid expansion on top of sagging hopes for the exchanges. Check out the group at IBD Stock Checkup. So, as far as subsidies go, ObamaCare is giving the 64-year-old couple just under $20,000 to the $6,000 provided by the leading GOP plan. Yet, even that understates the cost gap for low-income older adults, because GOP plans would eliminate the ObamaCare regulation that limits how much insurers can charge older adults to three times the premium charged to 24-year-olds. Removing that age-rating restriction and returning insurance markets to the common 5-to-1 gap between premiums charged to old and young before ObamaCare would raise the cost of premiums (before subsidies) by about 16.5%. So the older couple would have a much smaller subsidy to buy a more expensive plan.The comparison is a rough one, because ObamaCare's list of essential benefits might raise the cost of exchange plans by 3% to 9%, various analyses have shown. Yet that doesn't change the math very much.The challenge of taking care of the needs of low-income ObamaCare enrollees with chronic health problems helps explain why, before the election, a murderer's row of health policy wonks offered a GOP plan to kill ObamaCare softly. The plan from the American Enterprise Institute effectively promised that people who liked their ObamaCare plan could keep it, while everyone who got a bad deal under the law could opt for the new GOP deal. Their goal was to make the idea of replacing ObamaCare less scary for the public and to avoid the backlash seen in 2013 with the cancellations of millions of plans. Yet the promise people can keep their ObamaCare plan is an empty one because the approach would drain younger, healthier people from the risk pool and would undoubtedly trigger the kind of death spiral that conservatives have warned about. Insurers would simply refuse to participate.RELATED:Why Obama Is Wrong About ObamaCare, In One ChartObamaCare Subsidies To Explode As Cheapest Bronze-Plan Costs Surge 28%

116,HUM,"A late-hour sell-off took the shine off what looked to be a nice session for stocks Tuesday. The major indexes settled for pinched gains as volume rose.The Nasdaq composite, up more than 0.6% at one point, closed up just 0.2%. The Nasdaq 100 did a little better, rising 0.3%.The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 edged 0.1% higher after logging bigger gains earlier in the stock market today. The Russell 2000, still catching its breath after three straight weeks of huge gains, fell 0.1%.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) led the Dow 30 components, soaring 3.6% to 157.59 and continuing its impressive rebound since resuming a rally past a 141.88 handle buy point on a nearly three-month base.The managed care giant issued strong earnings and revenue guidance for 2017 just after President-elect Donald Trump on Monday named Georgia Congressman Tom Price as his health and human services Cabinet secretary to oversee the federal government's Medicare and Medicaid programs. Price is reportedly known for his anti-ObamaCare policy stance.While UnitedHealth cannot equal the outstanding run that tech giant Apple (AAPL) made from its initial breakout in 2004 through its latest peak in 2015, in recent years the big-cap health care play has been a superb long-term performer.After the market's key follow-through on Sept. 1, 2010, UnitedHealth broke out of a fresh base at 33.89 and has since risen 365% — more than the 237% maximum gain achieved by Apple when it broke out that same month six years ago.The Street currently sees UnitedHealth's profit rising 24% to $8.01 this year and 14% to $9.14 in 2017.UnitedHealth weighs in at $150 billion in market value, a fraction of Apple at $594 billion. Yet UnitedHealth's proprietary IBD rankings, as seen in IBD's diagnostic tool Stock Checkup, are much stronger than its tech peer for now, including a group-leading 88 Composite Rating out of a maximum 99 (vs. a 47 for Apple), an 83 for Relative Strength and a B+ for Accumulation/Distribution.An Accumulation grade of C+ or higher hints at net institutional buying in the stock over the past 13 weeks.UnitedHealth's recent rally is affirmed by solid moves in the Medical-Managed Care group.Aetna (AET) ran up nearly 3% to 132.03 on Tuesday, extending recent gains. The insurance giant is now up 8% past an 121.70 early buy point within a nearly five-month cup-like pattern. EPS growth is expected to accelerate in 2017 at 9% vs. a 4% jump expected this year.Humana (HUM), another fellow large cap play with a market value of $31.3 billion, rose 2% to 210 in fast trading and has gained 9.5% since surpassing a 191.75 entry within an unusual-looking four-month consolidation. The provider of health insurance to the military and civilian consumers sports an outstanding A+ Accumulation grade according to IBD Stock Checkup.Meanwhile, other top stocks are still in bases. They include NetEase (NTES) and GrubHub (GRUB), ranked No. 9 and 10, respectively, in the current IBD 50. However, both stocks are swimming below their 50-day moving averages.A leading growth stock tends to break out after rising above its 50-day line, not trading below it. Such action indicates that the stock has been making stronger-than-usual price gains in the near term.NetEase began its new base after peaking at 272.58 and reversing lower on Oct. 14.GrubHub, the leader in online and mobile-based food ordering, has been working on the right side of a potential cup base since reversing lower in above-average turnover on Sept. 29.Both stocks show Composite Ratings of 90 or higher, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup.RELATED:UnitedHealth Sees Revenue Topping $184 Billion In 2017

119,HUM,"Anthem's proposed merger with Cigna would reduce health care competition and raise costs for consumers, U.S. antitrust lawyers will argue Monday when the government goes to court to block the transaction.Their $48 billion merger — the biggest in the history of the American health -insurance industry — would likely give the enlarged company the power to raise prices for insurance, cut payments to doctors and reduce the quality of service, the Justice Department has said in court papers.Anthem (ANTM) counters that by buying Cigna (CI) it would be able to lower reimbursement rates to health care providers. Those savings would be passed on to employers and policyholders, the Indianapolis-based company says.The Justice Department's lawsuit opposing the Anthem-Cigna merger is one of two health care antitrust cases going to trial in the waning days of the Obama administration as it tries to prevent that industry from shrinking to three national carriers from five. The second case, against the $38 billion tie-up of Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM), opens before another judge in Washington on Dec. 5. The fifth major carrier, and largest, in the U.S. is UnitedHealth Group (UNH).By challenging the deals earlier this year, President Barack Obama's administration seized an opportunity to further shape the future of health care after passage of the Affordable Care Act.President-elect Donald Trump has said his administration will be more pro-business than his predecessor's, but he has also said he would block AT&T's (T) plan to buy Time Warner (TWX). Trump, who is to take office on Jan. 20, said Friday he would nominate Senator Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. The Alabama Republican doesn't have a clear track record on antitrust issues, leaving his approach to competition preservation unclear.The government said in its complaint that Anthem's deal for Cigna would hurt competition for millions of consumers who receive commercial insurance from national employers as well as large-group employers in at least 35 metropolitan areas, including New York.The run-up to the Anthem-Cigna trial was marked by acrimony between the companies, with each accusing the other of breaching terms of their deal. Cigna stands to collect a $1.85 billion break up fee if the merger is blocked. Last month, the U.S. won an order compelling the companies to turn over written correspondence between the two, which the government argued was relevant to combating the carriers' claims that their combination would create a more efficient company. The U.S. could use those letters as evidence during the trial.""Governance disputes between defendants have escalated, and the firms are now accusing each other of breaching the merger agreement,"" the U.S. said in court papers. ""Because the breach letters reveal the current state of hostility between defendants, the letters evince barriers to integrating these firms and are relevant"" to the defenses raised by the companies.The trial is scheduled to last more than a month, in two phases. In the first, the U.S. will attempt to prove that the combined company would hurt large national employers. The second phase, set to start Dec. 12, will focus on the proposed tie-up's effect on local markets.Backing the Justice Department are 11 states, including New York, California and Connecticut, plus the District of Columbia.Anthem had pushed the judge for a trial scheduled to finish by the end of the year so it has time to get state regulatory approvals by the merger deadline of April 30.

120,HUM,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has put payday loans in its cross hairs as it rewrites the rules for short-term loans that carry an interest rate in excess of 36%.Maybe it should investigate ObamaCare, which effectively charges more than 100% interest to members of the working class for accessing their own cash because they only see unaffordable options under the law and opt to remain uninsured.There were noble intentions behind the mandate as a cog in ObamaCare's machine for making coverage affordable and accessible to those who were priced out of it due to income or a pre-existing condition. Yet the reality of the coverage options and the way the law is administered have undermined those high-minded goals and often made income inequality worse.The individual mandate is looking like a failure in its goal to make coverage affordable by coaxing the relatively young and healthy to get coverage. Premiums for the cheapest HealthCare.gov bronze plans are set to spike 28% in 2017 to cover the costs of the exchange pool that is disproportionately old and unhealthy. UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET), and Humana (HUM) are bailing out of most of the state exchanges where they do business this year. Now Anthem (ANTM), which runs Blue Cross Blue Shield in many states, says it may follow suit.This year, roughly 8 million people faced ObamaCare individual-mandate penalties totaling more than $3 billion, even before the penalty jumped from a minimum $325 to at least $695 in the coming tax season. It's now clear that the actual impact of ObamaCare's individual-mandate tax penalty is far worse than the benign intent that the Obama administration claimed when it made the case for it.""What we're talking about is a penalty for the few people who will refuse to buy health insurance — even though they can afford it — and who expect the rest of us to pick up the tab for their care,"" a September 2009 White House defense of the individual mandate states.Consider, by contrast, the perspective of diner cashier Wylene Gary of Yazoo City, Miss., who dropped her coverage in 2014 when she discovered it had a $6,000 deductible, enough to torpedo her finances if she landed in the hospital. ""This ain't worth a tooth,"" she told Kaiser Health News.Democratic politicians rail against income inequality. Yet they defend ObamaCare, when the individual mandate in 2017 will tax away something like 3% of pretax income from modest-wage earners unless they buy coverage that may prove of little use to them.IBD'S TAKE: News that the Justice Department is investigating generic drug makers for price collusion is just the latest sign of the growing political risk facing the health care sector as cost growth ramps up again.Although ObamaCare's problems run much deeper, consider for a moment how the administration of the mandate penalty undermines the law and has a negative effect on the working class.The Obama administration likes to tout affordability by saying that most people eligible for subsidies can get a plan for $75 a month (or less). But paying around $900 a year for a bronze plan that carries deductibles as high as $7,150 in 2017 may seem like too much of a stretch for many.That first $75-a-month payment comes due in December 2016, while the penalty of $695 isn't paid until March or April 2018.The option of keeping your $75 a month is akin to letting ObamaCare be one's payday lender on a loan that averages $450 over the course of the year and charges $695 in interest.And like payday loans, people who have their finances sapped in this way are more likely to pay the mandate penalty again. That's because $75 a month may seem even less affordable the following December if they're about to have $695 taken out of their tax refund in April.ObamaCare's mounting problems should only serve to intensify questions about the wisdom and fairness of the individual mandate, even as some on the left are arguing that the fines need to be strengthened.RELATED:Why Obama Is Wrong About ObamaCare, In One ChartObamaCare's Individual Mandate Bites Hardest In These CitiesObamaCare Enrollment Sinks Again, Now Trails Worst-Case Scenario

121,HUM,"Anthem (ANTM) said Wednesday it may join other major U.S. health insurers in largely pulling out of ObamaCare's markets in 2018 if its financial results under the program don't improve next year.Anthem retreating from the Affordable Care Act would mean almost all major American for-profit health insurers have substantially pulled back from the law. The other big insurers — UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) — have already scaled back, after posting massive losses. The retreats threaten to further destabilize coverage in the markets for individual coverage, known as exchanges, that provide insurance to millions of Americans.""If we do not see clear evidence of an improving environment and a path toward sustainability in the marketplace, we will likely modify our strategy in 2018,"" Anthem Chief Executive Officer Joseph Swedish said on a call discussing third-quarter results. ""Clearly, 2017 is a critical year as we continue to assess the long-term viability of our exchange footprint.""Anthem sells health coverage under the Blue Cross Blue Shield brand in 14 states. The company will continue offering plans for next year in the new markets created by the Affordable Care Act. If it pulls back in 2018, it will leave mostly regional and not-for-profit firms on the markets.Swedish said that the U.S. needed to help insurers get better prices under the law, as well as improve the regulations that govern the sale and administration of plans. He also said that too few people were signing up. The company said Wednesday that it had 889,000 people signed up under individual ObamaCare plans at the end of the third quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Anthem shares have been steadily declining since reaching an intraday peak of 173.59 in June 2015. Shares touched a two-year low during opening trades on Wednesday but then recovered and closed up nearly 4% from Tuesday's nine-month low. Anthem is the second-biggest insurer in the U.S., just behind UnitedHealth, but UnitedHealth is tops among managed-care providers in IBD rankings, while Anthem is eighth.""The financial performance in individual ACA-compliant products has been disappointing as membership has been short of our original expectations,"" Swedish said. The company could also pull back from some states and not others, executives said on the call.Earlier Wednesday, Anthem reported third-quarter earnings that fell short of estimates as medical spending increased, driven in part by costs in the company's business serving poor people through Medicaid.Net income fell to $617.8 million, or $2.30 a share, from $654.8 million, or $2.43, a year earlier. Revenue increased 7.5% to $21.4 billion. Anthem spent 85.5 cents of every premium dollar on medical costs, compared with a medical loss ratio of 83.6 cents per dollar a year earlier. Medical membership rose to 39.9 million people as of Sept. 30 from 39.8 million three months earlier.Adjusted profit was $2.45 a share, Anthem said Wednesday in a statement, compared with the $2.47 average of analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Full-year adjusted profit will be about $10.80 a share, Anthem said, compared with the company's forecast earlier this year that it would report more than $10.80.Anthem, which agreed more than a year ago to buy Cigna (CI) for about $48 billion, is now facing a court battle to win U.S. approval of the deal. The Justice Department sued to block the takeover on antitrust grounds in July, saying the combined firm would control too much of the market for health insurance sold to big employers.While the company added more customers in its Medicaid business, costs there rose as well, which hurt profitability in the quarter. Anthem said expenses also rose in its individual business, which includes plans sold under ObamaCare.Anthem's stock has declined 16% this year, the second-worst performance among the six biggest U.S. health insurers.
"
122,HUM,"Aetna (AET) narrowly beat third-quarter earnings estimates despite wider losses in its ObamaCare exchange-related business.The insurer earned $2.07 per share, up from $1.90 a year ago and analyst estimates of $2.03. Operating revenue rose 5% from a year ago to $15.74 billion, squeaking past estimates of $15.71 billion.Aetna updated its full-year guidance, narrowing both the bottom and top ends of the range to $7.95-$8.05 per share vs. the $7.90-$8.10 range offered in August.Aetna shares fell 0.2% to close at 110.83 on the stock market today, but had been down as much as 4.1% earlier. The stock is in the middle of a consolidation zone after hitting an all-time high on June 26, following a big run-up that started in the fourth quarter of 2014.On an earnings call with analysts, Aetna management sounded optimistic about finalizing the proposed merger with Humana (HUM), despite the Justice Department's antitrust case that will go to trial on Dec. 5, with a decision expected in mid-January.  The deal would make Aetna the largest Medicare Advantage provider and largest purchaser of prescription drugs. If it doesn't close before Dec. 31, Aetna is supposed to pay Humana $1 billion.In August, Aetna announced it would pull out of most of the ObamaCare exchanges where it is doing business this year, citing growing losses in the business and structural problems with the exchanges' pooling of risk. Still, the company recorded an additional $20 million premium deficiency reserve, on top of $65 million in the second quarter, to account for losses in ObamaCare-compliant policies sold on and off the exchange.IBD'S TAKE: Wall Street analysts are warning that Centene and Anthem, two big insurers that are keeping their big ObamaCare presences, may see take a profit hit in 2017 due to increased exchange enrollment. Overall, the company expects to lose $350 million this year in its ObamaCare individual market business. However, pulling out of most exchanges may provide a tailwind for 2017 earnings.Aetna had about 775,000 exchange customers at the end of the third quarter, down from 838,000 at the end of June.Aetna management highlighted its Medicare and Medicaid business as its strongest growth segment: ""Operating results in our government business in particular remain robust,"" the earnings announcement said.Still, the company discussed the loss of some state Medicaid contracts. Lost contracts in Missouri and Nebraska will be a $750 million hit to revenue. Aetna is challenging its loss of a Pennsylvania contract that could cost another $1 billion in revenue. Those will be offset to some degree by wins in Virginia and Nevada.Aetna is the No. 5 ranked stock in IBD's Medical-Managed Care group, but the group is a market laggard, ranked No. 166 out of 197 industry groups based on stock performance. UnitedHealth (UNH), fueled by growth in its Optum health services division, is ranked No. 1.Molina Healthcare (MOH), a Medicaid managed care company with a big ObamaCare exchange presence, topped quarterly forecasts after Thursday's close. But it also cited ObamaCare exchange woes. Molina Health, which closed down 0.55% at 57.70 during the regular session, slid 56 after hours.RELATED:UnitedHealth Stock Surges Close To Buy Point On Earnings, GuidanceHealth-Services Spending Takes Off, Raising Political Risk

123,HUM,"Window shopping for 2017 ObamaCare plans has just opened on HealthCare.gov, and an IBD analysis of next year's deductibles and premiums — both before subsidies and after — reveals some surprising findings.Overall, the cheapest bronze-plan premium will spike by an average 28.2% before subsidies, based on a review of prices in the biggest market in each of the 38 states utilizing the federal government website. That follows a 12.7% rise in 2016. For a 30-year old, a bronze premium will rise to $272 per month from $212 this year,Six markets will see increases of more than 50%, including Nashville, Tenn. (54%); Columbia, S.C. (54%); Charlotte, N.C. (55%); Chicago (65%); Oklahoma City (80%) and Phoenix (177%).The huge premium hikes will be a shock for middle-class households that earn too much to qualify for ObamaCare subsidies restricted to those earning up to 400% of the poverty level ($47,520 for a single person). But for those who get subsidies, the premium hikes look like much ado about exactly nothing.IBD's analysis looked at how subsidies would change for individuals earning 257% of the poverty level, or $30,539. Here is the shock: Subsidies are set to explode by 99%, to an average $121 per month vs. $61 this year. Once the bigger subsidies are factored in, the average cost of a bronze plan will be $152 per month — exactly the same as in 2016.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Anthem and Centene are being dogged by concerns that they'll get more ObamaCare exchange customers, while shares of UnitedHealth, which is exiting most exchanges, are sitting at a buy point after trouncing earnings estimates.President Obama last week called for subsidies for the middle class who are excluded from the law's help. Yet IBD explained why Obama's ObamaCare prescription misses the law's most fundamental problem: Two in three people who earning a working-class income from 150% to 250% of the poverty level remain either uninsured or woefully underinsured.Even consumers who are eligible for subsidies and don't face a premium increase may find other reasons to be unhappy about the new offerings at HealthCare.gov. Plan choice is down dramatically as UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) exited most exchanges where they are doing business this year, and many nonprofit co-ops went out of business. Even if people can get a plan at the same after-subsidy cost, it may force them to change doctors.UnitedHealth lost 0.5% to 144.69 on the stock market today. Aetna gained 0.7% to 112.02 while Humana ticked up 0.2% to 176.27.The average deductible for the cheapest bronze plan in each of these 38 markets will rise to $6,358, up 5% from $6,045 this year. But that's nothing compared to the rise in deductibles among the cheapest silver plan, which will jump 18% to $4,261 from $3,613 in 2016. That jump is no small part due to the impact of Ambetter plans from Centene (CNC), which carry silver-plan deductibles of up to $7,050. Although the plans do offer some predeductible benefits, most big-ticket items aren't covered until the deductible is exhausted.Centene was up 1.5% to 63.05.The cheapest silver plan is set to rise 25%, IBD finds, to $322 a month from $258 this year. Taking into account the subsidy increase, the cheapest silver plan will cost an average $202, up 2.3% from $197.There are lots of reasons that ObamaCare is poorly designed to attract relatively young and healthy enrollees, even with a mandate penalty for those who go uninsured. A huge increase in subsidies to offset soaring premiums isn't going to make ObamaCare popular all of a sudden, but it may keep most exchanges from entering a death spiral.RELATED:Why Obama Is Wrong About ObamaCare, In One Chart ObamaCare Is Ill But Hasn't Entered Death SpiralNew ObamaCare Shock: $7,050 Silver-Plan Deductible

TripAdvisor plummeted nearly 16.2% to 52.95.Universal Health Services was downgraded to neutral from buy with its price target lowered to 135 from 150. Shares tumbled 6.9% to 119.26, but also climbed back from session lows. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to repeal ObamaCare. At the very least, he's unlikely to take aggressive action to shore up the faltering ObamaCare exchanges.Anthem (ANTM) last week said it may join other major U.S. health insurers in largely pulling out of ObamaCare's markets in 2018 if its financial results under the program don't improve next year.Anthem retreating from the Affordable Care Act would mean almost all major American for-profit health insurers have substantially pulled back from the law. The other big insurers — UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) — have already scaled back, after posting massive losses.Maxim Group lowered its price target on Wayfair to 45 from 49 but maintained a buy rating. Wayfair reported third-quarter earnings Wednesday, beating estimates on the top and bottom line. Revenue rose 45% to $861.5 million year over year. It reported earnings per share minus items of a 54-cent loss, vs. a 15-cent loss.Wayfair rose 5.4% intraday after falling 4.1% on Tuesday.

125,HUM,"The coming presidency of Donald Trump and the near-certain prospect he will try to unravel President Obama's Affordable Care Act sent shares of hospital stocks into cardiac arrest in Wednesday trading, while major insurers were mixed and drug wholesalers enjoyed a revival.Most of the nation's biggest hospital operators plunged by double digits, led by the likes of Tenet Healthcare (THC) and troubled Community Health Systems (CYH). Tenet stock lost a quarter of its value, dropping to 15.21. Community plummeted by 21.6% to 4.66.The nation's biggest hospital company, HCA Holdings (HCA), fell nearly 11% to 72.16, while LifePoint Health (LPNT) plunged 13.5% to 52.80. Universal Health Services' (UHS) drop was paltry by comparison, 6.9%, but still that gouged nearly $9 out of its shares, bringing it to 119.26.Hospitals are expected to take the brunt of an expected drop in federal health care funding. The demise of the ACA, commonly known as ObamaCare, could leave millions of Americans uninsured and unable to pay for hospitalization, thus cutting into the profits of major health care facilities' operators.Mizuho Securities analysts Sheryl Skolnick and Ann Hynes said in a note to clients that Trump's victory, along with Republicans managing to retain control of the House and Senate, does not bode well for health care companies.""(A) GOP Triple Play, the worst possible outcome for (health care) stocks, is a reality,"" the analysts said in a note to clients. ""We see extreme risk of ACA repeal-replace, loss of the Medicaid expansion, a primary driver of results for both hospitals and health plans, and reversal of the many value-based regulations that promote home health care.""Insurers, however, were beginning to cut ties with the ambitious health-coverage plan even before Trump's surprise victory in Tuesday's election, so the effect on them was mixed. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares were down fractionally to 141.90 while Aetna (AET) jumped 4.7% to 118.02. Anthem (ANTM) was down early but swung to a gain of 1.5% to close at 128.75. Cigna (CI) shares jumped 5.5% to 135.80.Humana (HUM) surged nearly 4% to 186 as it seems the carrier's Medicare-heavy business would be largely shielded from any ObamaCare repercussions.Drug wholesalers reveled in Trump's election as it appeared they — along with pharmaceutical companies — would bask in a more pressure-free environment now that Democrat Hillary Clinton has been dispatched. Clinton had vowed to combat exorbitant drug pricing.McKesson (MCK), which fell sharply late last month on a disappointing earnings report, recovered some of that in Wednesday trading. Shares surged 8.6% to close at 141.68. The rapture extended to its main rivals, as AmerisourceBergen (ABC) also jumped more than 9.5% to 75.61 and Cardinal Health (CAH) climbed nearly 6% tp 69.25.

126,HUM,"Biotech stocks climbed for the third consecutive day Tuesday, with mid-cap Tesaro (TSRO) forging the way, but among the largest companies, Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG) are buyable now, says Mizuho analyst Salim Syed.Syed initiated coverage Tuesday on Amgen, Gilead and Celgene stocks with buy ratings. He also initiated on Biogen (BIIB), but with a neutral rating on the lack of near- or medium-term catalysts and uncertainty after former CEO George Scangos resigned in July.""To be clear, we still think Biogen has some good programs and it could be a matter of time before we get excited again ... just not right now,"" Syed wrote in a research report. He has a 290 price target on Biogen stock, which slipped 2 cents Tuesday to 295.60.IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group lifted a fraction on the stock market today. But the volatile election season has strangled shares, causing the group to topple 16% over the past seven weeks.IBD'S TAKE: Syed has a neutral rating on Biogen stock, but shares are looking better after Biogen and Ionis announced early efficacy in phase 3 testing of a spinal muscular atrophy drug. Check out Industry Themes for the full take.Syed likened Amgen to a jogger. He has a 164 price target on the stock, down a fraction to 138.45 on Tuesday.""Before Amgen's most recent Q3 call, we thought of Amgen largely as a 'ho-hum' steady stock, a jogger if you will,"" he wrote. ""However, since Amgen's Q3 call (about 1.5 weeks ago), the stock has come down about 12%.""Enbrel commentary during the Q3 call spooked investors, he says. Sales of the immunosuppressant were flat at $1.45 billion and, given contract negotiations, Amgen expects ""relatively little benefit from net selling price changes in 2017"" for Enbrel.Wall Street has been predicting a decline in Amgen's legacy businesses for some time. But Syed sees a silver lining in new drugs, like Amgen's Repatha, a cholesterol-busting PCSK9si rival of Sanofi (SNY) and Regeneron's (REGN) Praluent.Repatha already has U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, but sales have suffered on restricted access, Syed wrote. Repatha is currently in phase 3 testing to treat cardiovascular outcomes and, in September, met primary and secondary endpoints in a phase 3 test for coronary artery disease.CV data are expected in Q1. Syed calls this ""the most important data event for Amgen."" A positive event could pull Amgen stock out of the dumps. Shares hit a two-year low Friday, though they managed to close up fractionally for the day.Gilead managed the impossible in 2013-14 after it launched Hepatitis C (HCV) drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni and tripled its revenue to become a $30 billion company, Syed wrote in a separate report. But the duo are cures for HCV and, therefore, won't last forever.""The flip side of developing a cure is eventually the disease will be eradicated,"" he wrote. ""While great for patients, this means declining revenues over time. This has been weighing on Gilead's stock as the answer of slope of decline isn't exactly clear.""For Q3, Gilead's hep C trio -- Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa -- brought in $3.3 billion in sales, down 31% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Epclusa, which launched in June and July in the U.S. and Europe helped to offset declines in Sovaldi and Harvoni.Syed models 10% year-over-year declines in HCV sales for Gilead.But Gilead is working on its next leg of growth, Syed says. He has an 88 price target on Gilead stock. Its nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and Hepatitis B (HBV) drugs are still too early in their pipelines. Plus, Gilead is facing NASH competition from Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) and Allergan (AGN).Gilead isn't ""a table-pounding buy,"" but the stock is undervalued and the company will likely perform over time, rewarding patient investors, Syed wrote.Gilead stock rose 4 cents Tuesday to 74.04.If Celgene is a castle, chemotherapy drug Revlimid is its moat, Syed says. During Q3, Revlimid sales grew 30% vs. last year to $1.89 billion, driven by new market share gains and increased duration. Revlimid is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), multiple myeloma, and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).Revlimid ""allows Celgene to grow its next sources of revenue,"" Syed wrote in a separate report. ""(Revlimid is) still a growing part of the business and a value add to Celgene, but this part of the business is fairly well established and mature.""Inside its moat, Celgene has cancer drugs durvalumab and CAR-T in conjunction with AstraZeneca (AZN) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), respectively. Celgene is also working on its next-generation replacement for Revlimid, which is expected to go generic in 2022 and be fully generic in 2026.At its core, Celgene has ozanimod, currently in phase 3 testing for multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis, and GED-301, an investigational Crohn's disease drug. These are central to Celgene's investment thesis, says Syed. He has a 130 price target on Celgene stock, which rose 0.89% Tuesday to 108.45.RELATED:Which Four Biotechs Are Derisked And Buyable Ahead Of Election Day?Amgen, Gilead, Eli Lilly Eat Into AbbVie's Humira Sales: AnalystGilead NASH Drug 'Active And Promising,' But Lagging InterceptAllergan Challenges Intercept With Tobira NASH Drug
"
127,HUM,"President Obama weighed in on Thursday with two ideas that he says will make the ObamaCare exchanges work: Subsidies for the middle class and a public option to keep insurance companies honest and premiums in check.No doubt, providing subsidies to households earning just above the income cutoff at 400% of the poverty level would make some difference. But Obama's prescription is fundamentally flawed because he has overlooked ObamaCare's harsh reality: It's giving a bad deal not just to the middle class but to a wide majority of working-class households.Just 1 in 3 people earning between 150% and 250% of the poverty level, who lack insurance from other sources, are getting silver-level coverage that will protect them from financial disaster if they have a costly medical emergency, an IBD analysis finds. That's based on official enrollment data as well as estimates of the uninsured population by the Department of Health and Human Resources and Kaiser Family Foundation.Households in this modest-income group were supposed to be among the big beneficiaries of ObamaCare because they're eligible for both premium subsidies to help pay for insurance and extra cost-sharing subsidies to keep their deductibles low and their medical bills manageable. Yet 2 in 3 in this group either are uninsured or woefully underinsured, and — even worse — a few million people with working-class incomes are being forced to pay individual mandate penalties, giving up 2.5% of their income or more. In other words, for many modest wage-earners, ObamaCare makes income inequality worse.The Obama administration said this week that exchange enrollment had sunk to 10.5 million at the end of June, down from the 12.7 million people who selected, but didn't necessarily pay for, plans during the open-enrollment period that ended in early February. During the third-quarter, enrollment likely slid to 10 million or lower, consistent with the experience of UnitedHealth (UNH), which reported that its exchange enrollment fell by 6%, or 50,000, to 770,000 between June and September.Given that the fourth-quarter has previously seen big enrollment declines, as people who plan to switch plans take advantage of the law's grace period, it now looks like the Obama administration's worst-case scenario (9.4 million enrollees at year-end) has become the best outcome possible.IBD'S TAKE: While UnitedHealth and other insurers are reducing their exposure to ObamaCare, here's why the sector faces increased political risk as cost growth ramps up again.The extent of the decline, though due to many factors including people getting new employer coverage, is troubling because it's even worse than in 2015, despite the fact that ObamaCare's penalty for going uninsured got steeper. The problem is that millions of modest-income people see the available plans as either unaffordable or such a bad deal that they're willing to pay a fine during the next tax season (more than a year away) rather than paying premiums right away.Using the best and most up-to-date data, IBD estimates that, among those earning 150% to 250% of the poverty level, there are about 2.6 million people who are getting silver-exchange coverage. Meanwhile, roughly 600,000 in the same group are getting bronze coverage; 2.5 million are eligible for subsidies but remain uninsured; and another 2 million are uninsured but ineligible for subsidies because they work full time and have an offer of coverage from their employer.**(These estimates may be on the conservative side. The Kaiser Family Foundation says 4.5 million uninsured people who earn less than 400% of the poverty level are ineligible for subsidies because they're offered employer coverage. Meanwhile, the Obama administration said last year that 40% of the 10.5 million uninsured people eligible for subsidies earned between 139% and 250% of the poverty level.)Let's take the last group first. Probably nobody gets a worse deal from ObamaCare than modest-wage, full-time workers. Many employers have figured out that they can keep a lid on health insurance costs and still dodge ObamaCare's employer mandate penalty by offering ""affordable"" coverage that modest-wage workers find unaffordable. Consider single workers earning $20,000 a year, about 170% of the poverty level. For such workers, bronze-type coverage with a $6,000-plus deductible is deemed affordable in 2016, even if it costs $1,900 — just under 10% of income. That's about five times as much as it costs workers at the same income level to buy subsidized bronze-level policies via HealthCare.gov. The decision by ObamaCare's crafters to exclude modest-wage, full-time workers is both extremely unfair and really bad for the sustainability of the exchanges because it narrows the potential risk pool.Other decisions by the law's architects also shot ObamaCare in the foot. They were so intent on making sure that no one was underinsured that they made cost-sharing subsidies exclusive to people who buy silver coverage. This makes no sense. If people can't afford to pay after-subsidy silver-plan premiums — about $1,500, or 6.4% of income, for a single worker earning $23,500 or about 200% of the poverty level — it's a good bet that they won't be able to afford to pay bronze-plan deductibles of up to $7,150 in 2017. As a result, millions of working-class households have been left with the choice of buying coverage that won't do much to protect their finances in a pinch or paying a fine.On a related nanny-state note, the law's crafters decided to pay the cost-sharing subsidies directly to insurance companies. The size of ObamaCare's subsidies are big enough, but there is no flexibility in how they are used. Depositing some portion of the cost-sharing subsidy in a Health Savings Account to offset some out-of-pocket costs, or using it to reduce premiums, could have achieved much greater enrollment and a healthier risk pool.ObamaCare premiums are set to surge by about 25% this year, not including subsidies, as the high cost of ObamaCare's stunted exchange population is leading UnitedHealth, Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) to abandon most of the state exchanges where they're doing business in 2016. Ironically, though, higher premiums will mean stable after-subsidy silver-plan costs and outright cheaper bronze plans for most of ObamaCare's subsidized customers.The logical inference, backed up by the weak enrollment seen even before premium increases got serious this year, is that a more economical public plan isn't the answer to ObamaCare's unattractive value proposition for consumers.RELATED:ObamaCare's Invisible Uninsured Hordes Work Full-Time ObamaCare Is Ill But Hasn't Entered Death SpiralObamaCare Mandates Are Dead — Even If Hillary Wins

129,HUM,"ObamaCare exchange enrollment has tumbled from 12.7 million people who signed up for plans as of early February to 10.5 million at the end of June, the Department of Health and Human Services said on Wednesday.Even worse, an early snapshot of third-quarter enrollment on Tuesday from UnitedHealth (UNH) -- which saw its exchange enrollment slide by 50,000, or 6%, to 770,000 from June to September — suggests that national enrollment has fallen to 10 million, perhaps lower.The fact that the big drop in enrollment in the first half of the year even exceeds the attrition rate seen in the first half of 2015 should be a major concern, given that the cost of going uninsured jumped in 2016 with the ramping up of ObamaCare's individual mandate penalty to a minimum of $695, from $325 last year. This year, about 8 million people paid ObamaCare's penalty for going without coverage. When so many millions of people see the available plans as either unaffordable or such a bad deal that they're willing to risk paying a fine, ObamaCare's mounting problems should only serve to intensify questions about the wisdom and fairness of the individual mandate.What is more, the Obama administration is only expecting modestly better enrollment in 2017. The official estimate released Wednesday predicts 13.8 million people will select plans during the open enrollment period, with paid monthly enrollment averaging 11.4 million. Still, that's better than some outside analysts expect. Goldman Sachs predicted recently that enrollment could drop by 20% from 2016 levels amid surging premiums and the exit of major carriers including UnitedHealth, Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) from most of the exchanges where they do business this year.Other research analysts have warned investors that companies like Anthem (ANTH) and Centene (CNC) could take a profit hit in 2017 as they capture some of the enrollment from exiting players. JPMorgan Chase downgraded shares of Anthem to neutral from overweight this week, citing the company's exposure to the ObamaCare risk pool due to averse selection, as higher prices lead healthier customers to drop coverage.Political opponents of ObamaCare have hailed its run of really bad news, including some jaw-dropping rate hikes, as evidence that the exchanges are close to blowing up. The irony, though, is that the spike in premiums may help to temporarily stabilize the exchanges.IBD'S TAKE: While UnitedHealth and other insurers are reducing their exposure to ObamaCare, here's why the sector faces increased political risk as cost growth ramps up again. Here are three reasons why the near-term outlook for the exchanges may not be as disastrous as many critics expect, even though everyone should be against the status quo in which ObamaCare is failing far too many millions of Americans who could really use a better deal.Few insurance markets are more expensive than New York for young adults because the state is alone in imposing a 1:1 age rating on individual market insurers, meaning that 24-year-olds pay just as much as 64-year-olds. In most states before ObamaCare, insurers could charge a 64-year-old five times as much as a young adult. Some ObamaCare critics have blamed the law's age-rating restriction, allowing insurers to charge older adults only three times as much as a young adult, for the exchanges' failure to attract a younger, healthier risk pool.Yet New York is so expensive that subsidies actually make ObamaCare coverage relatively inexpensive — at least bronze-level coverage. Take the cost of a bronze plan this year for a 30-year-old earning about $32,500. For a full year, the bronze plan costs $3,577 in Albany, N.Y., but just $2,459 in Miami — before any subsidy. But a young adult at that income level gets no subsidy in Florida, even as the New Yorker gets a subsidy of $1,836, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation health insurance marketplace calculator. Bottom line: The individual in Albany saves $60 a month vs. the one in Miami.BlueCross BlueShield of North Carolina is boosting its ObamaCare premiums by 24.3% in 2017. That's higher than its original request of an 18.8% increase, which the insurer revised after UnitedHealth's exit from the market. But the bad news may turn out to be good news for many of its customers. Because of the way ObamaCare subsidies work, 72% of its customers will pay either the same or less than they're paying this year, the company explained.Those who don't qualify for subsidies because they earn more than 400% of the poverty level may get badly hurt by the coming premium hikes. That seems unfair because there is no income cap for getting tax-subsidized health insurance through one's employer. Still, about 85% of exchange customers get subsidies, and the Obama administration explained recently that 2.5 million of 6.9 million off-exchange customers have incomes low enough to qualify for subsidies. Many may be in the same situation as the young adult in the Miami example: unsubsidized because of the way age and income interact in ObamaCare's subsidy formula.Yet many people who get little or nothing in the way of subsidies this year may find that they qualify for substantially more in 2017. That's not to say that higher premiums and bigger subsidies will fix ObamaCare — they won't.  Many will qualify for bigger subsidies for policies that they still don't want. There's little doubt that the subsidy structure and coverage rules are failing a majority of those with income above about 175% of the poverty level — including millions of full-time workers who are ineligible for subsidies if their employer offers coverage that costs them close to 10% of income.With the increasing likelihood that Hillary Clinton will be the next president and she'll have to work with a Republican House of Representatives, there's a strong chance that the individual and employer mandates will be repealed in order to pave the way for the next chapter of health reform.While the ObamaCare exchanges are good for the near-poor and those with pre-existing conditions who qualify for big subsidies, there's little doubt that the subsidy structure and coverage rules are failing a majority of those with income above about 175% of the poverty level — including millions of full-time workers who are ineligible for subsidies if their employer offers coverage that costs them close to 10% of income.Here's one data point that drives home one of ObamaCare's biggest and most important failures. Back in 2013, the Obama administration set a first-year target of 2.7 million enrollees age 18 to 34 — and enrollment was expected to keep ramping up in a big way in subsequent years — but the best evidence suggests that young adult enrollment is currently south of that first-year goal, likely around 2.5 million.That inference is pretty clear because young adults made up just under 28% of signups in 2016, but the paid ObamaCare insurance pool gets older as the year progresses. Among the 5.6 million people who renewed their HealthCare.gov coverage this year (out of 6.3 million who held policies at year-end), just 1.35 million, or 24%, were age 18 to 34.RELATED:ObamaCare Individual Mandate Fine Hit 8 Million People This Year ObamaCare Mandates Are Dead — Even If Hillary Wins

130,HUM,"U.S. stock indexes suffered routine losses Friday afternoon as the market neared its final hour of trade.The Nasdaq slouched 0.2%, while the S&P 500 matched that loss. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was flat, but the small cap Russell 2000 dropped 0.7%. Volume in the stock market today was running slightly higher on the NYSE and slightly lower on the Nasdaq.The Dow Jones utility average delivered one of the day's better gains, up 0.6%. A weaker than expected payrolls report might have helped the dividend-paying utilities, but the utilities were also due for some kind of rebound.Consolidated Edison (ED) had dropped 10 sessions in a row, making Friday's gain a trivial triumph. Southern Co. (SO) fell nine sessions in a row, and it too rose Friday. The two utilities rose about 2% and 1% respectively but then reversed to nominal gains.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, five of the day's nine top gainers were from retail or the related apparel makers groups.Gap (GPS), the owner of the namesake and Old Navy chains, thrust 15% as it retook its 200-day and 50-day lines in huge volume. September sales were a bit more than expected. Francesca's (FRAN), another retailer in the same apparel/shoes group, popped 2%. The stock cleared a 16.30 buy point in an awkward pattern. Volume was below average.Other retailers doing well included department store Nordstrom (JWN), which added to Thursday's breakout; Best Buy (BBY), which climbed closer to an entry in a flat base; apparel maker PVH Corp. (PVH), which padded a recent breakout; and big box retailer PriceSmart (PSMT), which advanced 3% as it tries to build the right side of a pattern.On the downside, the day's worst performer was Food-Meat Products. Allegations that the poultry industry conspired since 2007 to fix prices rattled the group.

131,HUM,"UnitedHealth (UNH), the nation's largest insurer, sailed past third-quarter earnings estimates Tuesday, raised its 2016 earnings forecast, and indicated that it would likely boost 2017 guidance next month.Earnings per share climbed 23% to $2.17 vs. the expected $2.08, due to a drop in medical costs as a share of premiums and strong growth in its Optum health services unit, which has seen revenue growth of 34% year to date. Overall revenue rose 12% from a year ago to $46.3 billion, topping estimates of $46.09 billion.The company said it now expects to earn $8 per share for the full year, up from the prior guidance range of $7.80-$7.95 and above consensus estimates for $7.90. And CEO Stephen Hemsley also said 2017 earnings could top consensus views if 2016 ends on a strong note.UnitedHealth shares surged 6.9% to close at 143.39 on the stock market today, nearing a 144.58 buy point.Aetna (AET) rose 2.7%, Humana (HUM) added 2%, Anthem (ANTM) rallied 4.1%, Centene (CNC) rose 2.8, and Molina Healthcare (MOH) gapped up 3.1%.IBD'S TAKE: While UnitedHealth and other insurers are reducing their exposure to ObamaCare, here's why the sector faces increased political risk as cost growth ramps up again. UnitedHealth stock has outperformed its peers and is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Medical-Managed Care group. Generally, investors will maximize their chances for success by focusing on leading stocks in top-tier industry groups.Still, UnitedHealth's earnings reflect a company that is much more than an insurer. It also has a leading position in the pharmacy benefit management industry, as well as a provider of population health and revenue management technology services. And UnitedHealth's Optum unit is building walk-in clinics in 75 markets.The sum of its businesses is greater than the parts, allowing it to deliver better health at a lower cost, UnitedHealth management says, and so far its results are proving its value.The earnings release offered no update about the impact of the ObamaCare exchange business on the bottom line because things didn't get any worse. Previously, the company said it expects ObamaCare-compliant policies to be an $850 million drag on earnings this year. But with UnitedHealth set to exit all but three of the 34 state exchanges where it's doing business at year-end, 2017 earnings will get an automatic boost.Aetna and Humana also are scaling back their ObamaCare footprint in 2017 and may get an earnings lift as a result. On the other hand, Anthem, Centene and Molina Healthcare are likely to see their ObamaCare business grow, which some analysts think may be a negative for earnings.In the earnings-call question-and-answer portion, UnitedHealth management said that its ObamaCare exchange enrollment slipped from 870,000 at the end of June to 820,000 at the end of September. If exchange enrollment attrition was similar among other carriers, total exchange enrollment is likely around the 10 million mark, down from 12.7 million signups in February. UnitedHealth also has an additional 110,000 off-exchange members in ObamaCare-compliant products.The company said it will ""lean into"" subsidized markets that are working better, noting new Medicaid contract wins in Virginia and Missouri and the rollout of a new nationwide product for the Medicare prescription-drug market, though one analyst noted that some states are cutting Medicaid reimbursements.""Our growth indicators are positive as we conclude 2016, and we expect to be well-positioned in 2017 to better serve consumers and deliver more value to the health system overall,"" CEO Hemsley said in a statement.RELATED:UnitedHealth Profits To Jump As It Exits ObamaCare ObamaCare Medicaid Costs Rocket 49% Above Estimates

132,HUM,"Humana (HUM) and Cigna (CI) sank on Wednesday after government data showed that the managed health care providers had a much smaller portion of their members enrolled in higher-quality Medicare plans.The data, from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, showed that the percentage of Humana's membership on 4-star or higher plans declined to around 37%, from 78% in the prior year. For Cigna, members enrolled in 4-star or higher plans dropped to 19% from 67%, according to a Wells Fargo research note.The government uses a five-star rating system to evaluate the health-plan offerings. Plans with higher ratings get bonuses, plus bragging rights to tout to Medicare enrollees. The star ratings out today are used for the 2018 plan year.""Weakness in HUM's ratings is a surprise and could hurt HUM's competitive positioning for 2018,"" Wells Fargo analyst Peter Costa said in a research note.Humana said that the decline did not account for the company's plans ""to mitigate any potential negative impact of these published ratings on Star bonus revenues for 2018."" The company also said the ratings were ""not anticipated to materially impact Medicare membership growth for 2017.""Humana said the decline was likely due to a recent CMS audit that resulted in a civil penalty and downgrades to some Star measures. The company said it expected the impact of the audit on its Star ratings to be limited to the 2018 bonus year.""Humana believes that its Star ratings for the 2018 bonus year do not accurately reflect the company's actual performance under the applicable Star measures,"" the company said. ""Consequently, the company intends to file for reconsideration of certain of those ratings under the appropriate administrative process.""Humana tumbled more than 5% to 168.44 on the stock market today, puncturing the bottom of a flat base begun in August. Cigna fell 2.4% to 121.96.Out of the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, the Medical-Managed Care group was the worst performer.Humana nonetheless reported strong preliminary third-quarter earnings. The company gave preliminary Q3 EPS of $3.15, above forecasts for $2.88. Humana is set to report third-quarter earnings on Nov. 4.Largely on that strong Q3 figure, the health insurer raised its full-year EPS to $9.50, above views for $9.24. In August, Human said it had expected EPS of at least $9.25.IBD'S TAKE: As many large health insurers shrink their Affordable Care Act plan offerings, the law itself could face destruction or a massive overhaul depending on the outcome of next month's election.

133,HUM,"The main indexes closed narrowly mixed Wednesday afternoon after details of the Fed's September meeting left few doubts that a rate increase is looming.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 rose 0.1%. But the Nasdaq dipped 0.1%. Volume was lower across the board, suggesting a lack of appetite among institutional buyers.Minutes fr0m the Fed's Sept. 20-21 meeting left more signs that policymakers are inclined to raise interest rates by year's end. In fact, a rate hike last month was termed a ""close call"" by participants, who judged the economy strong enough to make a ""reasonable argument"" to raise the fed funds rate.Some officials voiced concern that a delay in a rate increase could hurt the Fed's credibility. Meanwhile, the Federal Open Market Committee saw Brexit risks receding and that the labor market has improved appreciably in past year. Those are ingredients for an increase in borrowing costs.Mining, retail and some building stocks led today's trading, while the health care sector continued to show broad weakness. Managed-care stocks made up a cluster of stocks down in unusually heavy volume.Humana (HUM) plunged 5% in heavy volume. The HMO had been forming a shallow base, but the sell-off has soiled the pattern. Humana announced preliminary Q3 EPS of $3.15 a share, above views. But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the company's share of members in four-star or higher-quality plans fell to around 37%, from 78% the prior year. The drop threatens to hurt bonuses that Humana earns.Aetna (AET), which is fighting antitrust issues to acquire Humana, fell 1.5% to the lowest level since May.Cigna (CI) was down more than 2% as its four-star-or-higher enrollments dived to 19% from 67%, according to a Wells Fargo research note. Anthem (ANTM), which is trying to merge with Cigna, was off nearly 1%. That deal also faces objections from the U.S. Justice Department.In other parts of the medical sector, Illumina (ILMN) continued to weaken following Tuesday's 25% crash on a lowered sales outlook. On Wednesday, shares were down 2%.RELATED:Humana Ups Earnings Guidance, Stock Sinks On Medicare Star RatingsExtraction Oil & Gas Prices IPO Above Range, Jumps Early In Debut

134,HUM,"In just the past year and a half, antitrust concerns have undone or jeopardized several merger deals, adding to doubts that AT&T (T) can consummate its $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner (TWX).AT&T agreed to pay $107.50 a share for Time Warner, but the media giant's stock fell 3.1% to 86.74 on the stock market today, well below the bid price and an indication investors are skeptical that the deal will go through. AT&T fell 1.7% to 36.68. Still, the companies see the deal closing in late 2017.The Obama administration has become more aggressive on mergers and acquisitions lately, either suing to block them or demanding conditions that were too onerous to accept. Donald Trump has said he would block an AT&T-Time Warner deal as president, while Hillary Clinton has voiced concerns.In February  2014, Comcast (CMCSA) agreed to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, combining the top two cable and broadband providers. The Federal Communications Commission raised concerns, with consumer groups and Netflix (NFLX) also objecting. With regulators expected to block the deal outright, Comcast gave up in April 2015.Charter Communications (CHTR) moved in, agreeing in May 2015 to buy TWC. That deal closed in May 2016.In November 2015, Pfizer (PFE) reached a deal to buy Allergan (AGN) for $160 billion in a so-called tax inversion that would've allowed Pfizer to change its domicile to Ireland and slash its tax bill.The deal, which would've created the world's largest drugmaker, came at a time when politicians were already bashing tax inversions. The Treasury Department introduced a series of new rules that made inversions less attractive.In April, Pfizer walked away from the deal, citing the Treasury rules.RELATED:Forget Allergan: Pfizer Has Its Sights On This Cancer Drugmaker Allergan, Pfizer Strike Off Down Separate Paths After Merger Killed As crude prices were collapsing in November 2014, oilfield services provider Halliburton (HAL) agreed to buy rival Baker Hughes (BHI) in a deal that was worth $34.6 billion at the time. It also would've put the combined companies above Schlumberger (SLB), prompting regulators to warn of a duopoly.Halliburton scrambled to find buyers for assets it sought to shed to win regulatory approval. But the Justice Department reportedly pushed Halliburton to sell more than $7.5 billion in assets to a single buyer.Then in April, the DOJ filed a lawsuit to block the merger, and in May the companies called off the deal, which by then was worth about $28 billion.RELATED:Why Halliburton's Failed Buyout May Actually Hurt CompetitionHalliburton Eyes New Deals After Ending Baker Hughes Bid In February 2015, Staples (SPLS) agreed to buy Office Depot (ODP) for $6 billion as the retailers faced pressure from e-commerce rivals like Amazon (AMZN).It was their second attempt. An earlier one was blocked by the Federal Trade Commission in 1997, but Staples and Office Depot said this time was different because the industry landscape was completely different, citing Amazon and other competitors.The FTC disagreed and sued in December 2015. In May, a judge sided with the federal government.In September 2014, General Electric (GE) inked an agreement to sell its home appliance business to Electrolux (ELUXY) for $3.3 billion as the industrial conglomerate sought to shed noncore assets and focus on areas like aviation, power systems, and oil and gas.The DOJ sued in July 2015, saying the merger would hurt consumers. Before a judge could rule on the lawsuit, GE walked away in December. The next month, GE sold the unit to China's Haier for $5.4 billion.In December 2013, top food distributor Sysco (SYY) agreed to buy rival US Foods for $3.5 billion. In February 2015, the FTC sued, arguing that a merger of the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the market would result in higher prices for restaurants, hotels and other companies that buy food and related supplies.In June 2015, Sysco abandoned the deal after a judge ruled in favor of the FTC.In July 2015, Anthem (ANTM) said it would buy Cigna (CI) for $54 billion, creating the largest health insurer by membership. It came just three weeks after Aetna (AET) reached a deal to acquire Humana (HUM) for $37 billion. The consolidation efforts came as the health sector struggled to find savings and address higher-than-anticipated costs associated with ObamaCare mandates.In July, the DOJ filed lawsuits to block both deals, saying much of the U.S. health insurance market would be controlled by just three companies. But in August, the DOJ signaled it might be willing to reach a settlement with Anthem and Cigna to allow their merger.In October 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) said it plans to buy Rite Aid (RAD) for $17 billion, bringing together the No. 2 and No. 3 drugstore chains and leapfrogging No. 1 CVS Health (CVS).Walgreens has been looking for buyers who could help the company offload stores and pass regulatory muster. Management is also in talks with the FTC and appeared to be making progress this summer.But Kroger (KR) seems unwilling to buy hundreds of stores that Walgreens and Rite Aid are trying to divest. Kroger had been interested, but wanted to close the locations and reopen them in its grocery stores. The FTC wants to preserve the stand-alone drugstores, sources told the New York Post.

135,HUM,"Verizon Communications (VZ) said Q3 revenue fell 6.7% to $30.94 billion, missing Wall Street views, as the phone company unexpectedly lost 36,000 wireless postpaid phone subscribers compared with a gain of 430,000 in the year-earlier period and vs. analyst estimates for a gain of 239,000.Verizon said third-quarter non-GAAP EPS fell 4% to $1.01, excluding 12 cents in pension and severance costs. Analysts had projected profit of 99 cents and revenue of $31.14 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Verizon stock touched a 16-year high just shy of 57 in early July. Shares of AT&T and Verizon have dropped since they reported Q2 earnings, amid expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates, a negative for dividend-paying stocks. Facebook, Edward Lifesciences, and Nvidia now top the IBD Big Cap 20. Wireless revenue fell nearly 4% to $22.1 billion from a year-earlier, the company said. Verizon' reported Q3 wireless profit margin of 44.9%, below views. Apple's (AAPL) rollout of the iPhone 7 in September is expected to pressure profit margins for Verizon, AT&T (T), T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S) as a result of their promotional offers.Verizon stock fell 2.5% to close the trading day at 49.14 on the stock market today, falling to its lowest levels since late January. Verizon has been slumping since touching a 16-year high near 57 in early July.Verizon management is expected to comment on the status of its $4.8 billion deal to acquire Yahoo (YHOO) on its earnings call Thursday morning, amid reports Verizon may seek to renegotiate terms because of an email breach at the web portal.Despite the net loss of wireless phone subscribers, Verizon said it had a net gain of 442,000 wireless postpaid subscribers in Q3, with most of the gains coming from its Hum-branded telematics auto service and tablet users. Verizon had 1.29 million overall postpaid subscriber additions in the year-earlier period.T-Mobile US and, more recently Sprint, have gained postpaid market share vs. AT&T and Verizon. Postpaid users spend more than prepaid subscribers that buy minutes as needed.AT&T reports Q3 earnings on Oct. 25.Verizon said it added 36,000 FiOS video customers vs. 45,000 in the year-earlier period. It added 90,000 FiOS Internet customers vs. 96,000 the prior year.AT&T shares fell 1.9% to close at 38.65, while Sprint slid 2.3% to 6.72 and T-Mobile 0.6% to 47.05.

138,HUM,"In the age of WikiLeaks, it's tough for powerful institutions to keep secrets. The same holds true for tech giants like Apple (AAPL) and Google.On Oct. 4, Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google held its biggest hardware product launch ever. But for many tech enthusiasts, the media event felt like deja vu. That's because all the big news — Pixel smartphones, Daydream View virtual reality headset and Google Home smart speaker — had leaked out in the press ahead of time.Google got a taste of what Apple has been experiencing in recent years with surprise-free product launch events, spoiled by websites spilling the beans ahead of time.""Certainly Google and other companies want the element of surprise in their back pocket,"" Gartner analyst Brian Blau told IBD. ""They don't want to tip their hand from a competitive standpoint.""IBD'S TAKE: Tech stocks often are considered more volatile than most, and that can be the case even with the biggies. But in general, even for the techs, bigger stocks are less volatile and yet still have a lot of potential upside. Alphabet is among the current IBD Big Cap 20 stocks, and as are a bevy of big techs.Still, Google, Apple and other big companies also know that hardware leaks don't tell the whole story.""Rarely do you get the whole picture"" from news leaks, Blau said. ""Most people realize that.""For example, it was well known that the iPhone 7 Plus would have a dual-camera system. But the capabilities of the system, such as taking digital SLR quality photos, were not fully known, Blau said. That technology reveal benefited greatly from demonstrations at Apple's media event.Breaking Apple news is something of cottage industry for journalists and securities analysts. Some have become expert at it, as revelations can impact the stock price of the Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant.Among the Apple news websites known for breaking news on the company are AppleInsider and 9to5Mac. In June, Bloomberg hired ace Apple reporter Mark Gurman, who built his reputation for exclusives at 9to5Mac.Others who have made a name for themselves disclosing Apple secrets include KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo; Steve Hemmerstoffer, editor of NowhereElse.fr; and Evan Blass, mobile reporter with VentureBeat.Tech journals like BGR, Recode, The Information and Taiwan-based publication DigiTimes also have had Apple scoops, as have big media organizations like the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and the New York Times.With all the coverage, Apple often isn't in control of its own news announcements.At Apple's Sept. 7 product launch event, the company's announcements — iPhone 7 and Apple Watch 2 — were greeted mostly with ho-hum responses from press and analysts because many details had leaked out weeks earlier.Hardware news tends to have the most accurate leaks because Apple relies on contract manufacturers and scores of component suppliers to make its products. For instance, photos of iPhone casings usually start showing up online months before Apple is ready to reveal its new handsets.Apple famously tried to plug the leaks a few years ago. In May 2012, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company was doubling down on secrecy.But when you're a company the size of Apple that's a bit like being an elephant hiding in the reeds.Now Google is facing the same sort of leaks that can take the wind out of a major hardware reveal.Hemmerstoffer, of NowhereElse.fr, says his favorite leak was a ""double feature"" last year when he exposed two Google Nexus phones, Nexus 5X from LG and Nexus 6P from Huawei, some six weeks before the official launch. He posted photos of the handsets that proved 100% accurate.A bigger issue is whether tech news leaks are even that big of a deal.Tech enthusiasts and Wall Street pay close attention to them, but the general public likely doesn't perk up until the actual announcements get coverage by the mainstream media, including television news.Consumers tend to be ""vaguely aware"" of news about product leaks from major companies, Roger Kay, an analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates, told IBD. He says they pick up on the major themes, but not the specifics. For example, they may gather from early coverage that the iPhone 7 will be a minor update and that the major revamp will come with the iPhone 8.Besides, he says big company media events are as much about presenting a bigger-picture view of company strategy as they are about showing off shiny new gadgets.""Everybody is trying to get beyond the point products and into the platform story,"" Kay said.For instance, search leader Google used its fall product launch event to deliver the message that it is focusing on artificial intelligence in everything it does.""We are heading from a mobile-first to an AI-first world,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said at the event in San Francisco. ""We want to build a personal Google for each and every user.""Similarly, action-camera maker GoPro (GPRO) used its fall product launch event on Sept. 19 to reposition itself.GoPro CEO Nick Woodman said the company's announcements of Hero 5 cameras, Karma drone and improved software for creating and sharing videos were an effort to ""transform GoPro into an end-to-end storytelling solution.""While tech journalists and analysts have a track record for revealing Apple's hardware news ahead of time, they've been less accurate with reports about Apple's business dealings and possible acquisitions.Nevertheless, erroneous or premature reports can get the market excited and move Apple's stock.For instance, in recent years, there have been occasional breathless reports about Apple negotiating with television content providers for a possible internet TV service. Despite all the smoke, there's been no fire there.Lately, Apple video service rumors have taken a back seat to reports that Apple is developing a self-driving electric car, or at least technology for future vehicles.On Sept. 9, the New York Times set tongues wagging with an article that suggested Apple's car venture, Project Titan, had been scaled back to focus not on an actual car, but on automotive technology. Apple has yet to confirm that it's working on advanced car tech.The Financial Times added to the frenzy with a report Sept. 21 that said Apple had been negotiating to buy luxury sports-car maker McLaren Technology Group. But McLaren dismissed the report as inaccurate.In recent months, Apple has been reported to be interested in acquiring a host of companies from Netflix (NFLX) and Twitter (TWTR) to music service Tidal. None of those deals as yet has come to fruition.The bottom line is that while hardware leaks often have panned out, other Apple scoops should be taken with a grain of salt.RELATED:Apple Intros Waterproof iPhone 7, But Few SurprisesAlphabet Stock Flat As Google Hardware Launch Has Few SurprisesTwitter Dives On Reports Apple, Google, Others Unlikely To Make Bid

139,HUM,"The Obama administration is illegally ignoring the text of the 2010 health law to overpay insurers by $3 billion and counting through ObamaCare's reinsurance program, the Government Accountability Office said Thursday.The Department of Health and Human Services ""may not use amounts collected for the Treasury to make reinsurance payments,"" the legal opinion from GAO General Counsel Susan Poling concluded.The finding could jeopardize a portion of reinsurance payments due to exchange participants to cover a portion of the bills for their costliest ObamaCare individual market customers in 2016.Even though financial losses are already driving UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) out of most ObamaCare exchanges next year, their earnings might take an incremental hit from reduced reinsurance payments. Likewise, Anthem (ANTM), Centene (CNC) and Molina Healthcare (MOH) also could see smaller reinsurance payments than they expect.Centene's latest earnings report says it has $217 million in reinsurance payments coming as of June 30, while Anthem received $753 million in reinsurance payments for the 2014 year. The program is temporary, with payments gradually covering a reduced share of costs in each year and phasing out altogether after 2016.IBD'S TAKE: The Medical-Managed Care group is ranked 173 out of 197 industry groups based on stock performance by IBD, but there have been plenty of health-related winners this year, like Veeva Systems and Intuitive Surgical. Use IBD Research Tools to identify potential winners and visit IBD University to learn how to time stock purchases and protect downside risk.The GAO opinion adds weight to the argument that Republicans in Congress have made that the Obama administration is ignoring the letter of the law. The 2010 law, officially the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, required insurers to submit a fee, $63 in 2014 and gradually declining, for each individual and small-group customer. Those fees were expected to tally up to $12 billion in the first year, but came in short of $10 billion.Part of those funds, including $2 billion in the first year, were supposed to be directed to the treasury, according to the law, which was likely done as a way to keep the cost of the law down in the contentious period leading to its passage.The GAO opinion notes that HHS ""received $7.9 billion in reinsurance claims (in 2014) and paid these in full, leaving approximately $1.7 billion in collections, which it carried over for reinsurance payments in subsequent benefit years. As a result, HHS did not deposit any amounts collected from issuers into the Treasury.""What happens next isn't exactly clear. Anthem's most recent annual report notes that it received its full 2014 reinsurance payment in the third quarter of 2015, so full payment for the 2015 year may already have been made. In that case, only 2016 payments might be jeopardized.The disputed reinsurance funds add to the huge amount of uncertainty already facing ObamaCare. Not only are premiums set to spike next year, but the government has said its risk-corridor program has no funds to cover insurer losses. Further, a federal judge ruled in May that the Obama administration violated the House's constitutional power of the purse by funding ObamaCare cost-sharing subsidies without an appropriation. That case will next be heard by a federal appeals court.UnitedHealth fell 1.5%, Anthem 1.9% and Centene 2% on the stock market today. Aetna fell 1.1%, Molina 1.5%, while Humana fell just 0.4%.

140,HUM,"President Obama pushed the Affordable Care Act as the end of a long debate over recasting U.S. health care. ""I am not the first president to take up this cause,"" he told a joint session of Congress in September 2009. ""But I am determined to be the last.""Seven years later, it's clear that Obama was wrong about that. No matter who wins in November, health care reform will be back on the front burner in 2017.The ObamaCare exchanges have grown increasingly unstable as huge losses lead insurers — including Aetna (AET), UnitedHealth (UNH) and Humana (HUM) -- to abandon the market.The latest news is that Blue Cross Blue Shield is pulling out of Nebraska's exchange and dropping plans in three of the biggest regions in Tennessee. Before this news hit, a Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that enrollees in almost a third of the counties in the U.S. will have only one insurance company from which to choose. Insurers that are staying are asking for, and getting, massive rate hikes to cover substantial losses. Phoenix Health Plans of Arizona wants an average 123% rate hike on its ObamaCare plans.Do You Use An Online Broker? Now's the chance to tell how well your needs are met. IBD's annual investor survey on brokers' performance is underway. Click to take the survey now. Overall enrollment in the ObamaCare exchanges this year was half what was expected — and young people aren't signing up at the levels needed to keep the market stable. Nobody expects that to change during open enrollment, which starts in November. Public support for the law is at all-time lows.Even ObamaCare's biggest fans, after years spent denying that anything was wrong, now admit that the heavily regulated insurance markets ObamaCare tried to create are at serious risk of failure.But what form ObamaCare 2.0 will take — and what it will mean for patients, providers, insurers, hospitals and investors — depends entirely on who occupies the White House in January, and who is in control of Congress.Although the issue rarely comes up on the campaign trail, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have vastly different plans for how they will deal with ObamaCare's many shortcomings.In the presidential debate on Sunday, Clinton said she will ""fix"" ObamaCare and that ""reining in the costs...has to be the highest priority of the next president."" But she would keep in place ObamaCare's marketplace regulations and add new benefit mandates to the menu. That includes a requirement that every health plan provide three free ""sick"" visits every year and a ban on charging out-of-network prices for any emergency medical procedures.Analysts say that these new mandates risk adding still more upward pressure on insurance premiums, which are skyrocketing by double digits. Yet at the same time, Clinton says she will crack down on ""unreasonable health insurance rate increases.""The combination of the two will likely drive still more insurers out of the ObamaCare exchanges.To deal with the high and rising deductibles in ObamaCare plans, Clinton wants to add a new income-based refundable tax credit of up to $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families for any out-of-pocket costs that exceed 5% of income.Other aspects of her plan would vastly expand government's role in providing direct coverage — at the expense of private health insurance.Clinton wants to push the remaining 19 states to expand Medicaid, which she said would add 3 million people to that government insurance program.""Some states adopted it, and those states have indicated some really interesting public health advances,"" said Patrick Riley, senior health care industry analyst at Frost & Sullivan. ""Hillary will push for that to move forward."" She's also advocated opening up Medicare to anyone 55 and older. An analysis by Avalere Health found that this would make 13 million people eligible for Medicare overnight.To deal with the lack of competition in the ObamaCare exchanges, Clinton wants to resuscitate an idea that liberal Democrats pushed when ObamaCare was being drafted — called the public option for health care. This would be a Medicare-like plan available to anyone in the ObamaCare exchanges.Centrist Democrats scotched this in 2009 out of concern that the public option — which would pay doctors discounted Medicare rates — would drive out private insurers from the market.  And, indeed, liberal reformers saw the public option as a steppingstone to a single-payer health care system.The net effect of all these government expansions would be to shift tens of millions of people from private to public health insurance programs that already cover nearly half the population.Clinton also has the pharmaceutical industry in her sights. She says that, if elected, she would deny tax write-offs for direct-to-consumer advertising, attack ""excessive"" profits, let the government set drug prices for Medicare Part D, and push for more generics.The industry argues that whatever savings these steps might produce would come at the cost of future drug innovation.Overall, Clinton's plans would add about $450 billion in ObamaCare subsidies over the next decade, according to the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget. That would come on top of the $1.9 trillion ObamaCare is already on track to spend.Donald Trump has been far less detailed in his reform plans than Clinton. So far, he's issued only a brief two-page outline.Trump says he will repeal ObamaCare and replace it. ""It will never work,"" he said at the Sunday debate. But Trump is sketchy on what he'd replace it with, other than to say he'd push ""Congress to make sure we have a series of reforms ready for implementation that follow free market principles"" and ""create a patient-centered health care system."" In the debate, Trump said his replacement plan would be ""absolutely much less expensive and something that works.""Republicans in the House have already produced a consensus plan, which include getting rid of ObamaCare's complex subsidy scheme and replacing it with an age-based refundable tax credit.Both Trump and the GOP plan have endorsed expanding Health Savings Account plans. HSAs let people put money aside, tax free, to pay for out-of-pocket costs. Since approved by Congress in 2005, they've exploded in popularity. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that this year almost 30% of workers are enrolled in a high-deductible health plan that includes an HSA, up from 17% just five years ago. The Employee Benefit Research Institute estimates that more than $30 billion worth of assets are in HSA accounts.Trump also says he'd allow insurance companies to sell across state lines. This idea has been a fixture of GOP health reforms for some time, but neither the insurance industry trade group — America's Health Insurance Plans — or the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association have endorsed the idea. And there is some question as to whether it would actually affect choice or prices.Rather than expand Medicaid, Trump and the GOP plan would turn it into a fixed block grant. As it stands, Medicaid's costs are open ended. The federal government shares costs with state governments, giving the states little incentive to hold down Medicaid spending. The block grant approach would give states a set amount of money but also provide them far greater flexibility on how they provide health care to their poor.Hospitals that fought for Medicaid expansion are likely to fight against such changes, analysts say. They backed the expansion believing that it would mean fewer unpaid hospital bills and a better bottom line. But a new Medicaid report from the Congressional Budget Office suggests that hospitals aren't getting much benefit from a bigger program. The CBO found that the additional revenue hospitals get from expanding Medicaid ""is not large enough relative to their revenues from other sources to substantially alter the projected aggregate margins.""Trump has also endorsed fixes that are anathema to the drug industry, including letting the government set drug prices for Medicare and allowing the sale of imported prescription drugs.On the latter point, Trump says that ""allowing consumers access to imported, safe and dependable drugs from overseas will bring more options to consumers.""The industry — as well as the FDA — has criticized drug importation on safety grounds. The FDA says there's no way for consumers ""to know whether drugs sold outside the U.S. meet FDA standards.""Whatever the candidates promise, the political realities they would face once in the White House mean neither Trump nor Clinton likely could do much without some sort of bipartisan agreement.Clinton would almost certainly face a Republican House and possibly a GOP-controlled Senate that would still want to repeal the law, not expand it. That means the public option, expanded subsidies, Medicare buy-in and other features are unlikely to go anywhere.If Trump is elected, Democrats in the Senate could filibuster much of his health care agenda. Republicans showed they can repeal most of the law without needing to overcome a filibuster, but getting Democrats to agree to the GOP replacement plan would present a huge hurdle.""The overriding issue is that there has to be bipartisan agreement,"" said Robert Laszewski, president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates.That means things like the hugely unpopular Cadillac Tax will likely be overturned, as well as the medical device tax, which even far-left liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren opposes because of the harm it's done to this industry.Beyond that, the two sides aren't even in agreement on what's wrong with ObamaCare, let alone what needs to be done to fix it.Plus, anything more than tinkering will take time to put in place.""It took three years for the administration to get ObamaCare up and running,"" Laszewski says. ""It's going to take that long to launch something different.""Note: This story was updated to include quotes from the Sunday presidential debate.RELATED: Is Obama Pushing Another Illegal ObamaCare Insurance Bailout?ObamaCare Death Spiral: Even Blue Cross Plans Are Bailing OutObamaCare's Working-Class Pill: 70% Marginal Tax Rate
"
141,HUM,"Roughly 8 million people faced ObamaCare individual mandate penalties this year totaling more than $3 billion, an analysis of the latest IRS data reveals.Despite the controversy and high-stakes legal battle that has surrounded the individual mandate, the scope of the penalties paid this year has gone unreported by major news outlets as attention has focused on ObamaCare's latest and most glaring problems: weak enrollment, surging premiums, and insurer losses that have provoked the exit of UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) from most state exchanges.Yet ObamaCare's mounting problems should only serve to intensify questions about the wisdom and fairness of the individual mandate. The root of all of those ObamaCare problems is that far too many people — even those eligible for big subsidies — see the plans as either unaffordable or such a bad deal that they're willing to risk paying a fine.Another reason for the lack of coverage may be that IRS Commissioner John Koskinen issued two ObamaCare reports to Congress on the extent of penalties paid last year, including one in July 2015, but has been silent about this year's mandate fines.Yet the IRS Taxpayer Advocate Service included some preliminary statistics on 2016 ObamaCare mandate payments, officially called the Individual Shared Responsibility Payment, when it issued its below-the-radar annual tax season review on July 7. As of April 30, 5.6 million tax returns included mandate payments averaging $442 per return, compared with 6.6 million tax forms including average payments of $190 at the same point in 2015.More recent data from the IRS wrapping the past tax year show that the final tally for 2015 ObamaCare Mandate fines included payments on 8.1 million tax returns averaging $210 for a total of $1.7 billion.If the final stats for 2016 reflect a similar increase after April due to filings past the initial deadline, that would mean ObamaCare individual mandate payments on 6.8 million tax forms in 2016, averaging $489. Some share of those tax returns will include fines for more than one adult or a parent and child, just as ObamaCare exchange applications often seek coverage for more than one individual. A conservative estimate of less than 1.2 penalties per return yields a rough estimate of 8 million people paying the fine this year.The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that about two-thirds of the people paying the individual mandate fines will have incomes below 400% of the poverty level, the cutoff for subsidies.IBD'S TAKE: The Medical-Managed Care group is ranked a lowly 175 of 197 industry groups by IBD based on stock performance, but there have been plenty of health-related winners this year, including Intuitive Surgical and Veeva Systems. IBD helps investors identify the best stocks before they stage a breakout in features and lists such as The New America and the IBD 50. IBD also will help you find the best buy point and teach you rules for selling.When the individual mandate has gotten attention recently, it has been because both the law's supporters and critics alike have noted that ObamaCare penalties are too weak to compel healthy people to enroll. In fact, some of the law's proponents on the left are calling for a harsher ObamaCare individual mandate.Yet it's now clear that the actual impact of ObamaCare's individual mandate tax penalty is far worse than the benign intent that the Obama administration claimed when it made the case for it.""What we're talking about is a penalty for the few people who will refuse to buy health insurance — even though they can afford it — and who expect the rest of us to pick up the tab for their care,"" a September 2009 White House defense of the individual mandate states.Even as politicians rail against income inequality yet defend ObamaCare, the individual mandate in 2017 will tax away close to 3% of pretax income from modest-wage earners unless they buy coverage that may prove of little use to them.On average, the cheapest bronze coverage this year costs $930, or nearly 4% of income, for 28-year-olds earning $24,000 a year, just over 200% of the poverty level. For someone of modest means, that's a lot to spend for a plan that won't cover much before the deductible is met. Many of the cheapest bronze plans will carry the maximum ObamaCare deductible of $7,150 in 2017.That's why many people may end up turning down coverage that's not much more than next year's mandate penalty of at least $695 per adult in 2017, up from a minimum of $325 this year. Another reason is that the bill for deciding to go uninsured starting in January doesn't come due until the tax-filing deadline 15 months later, so people who are struggling to set aside extra money may put off taking any bitter medicine.Although the individual mandate was tested on a small scale in Massachusetts, that mandate actually bore little resemblance to ObamaCare's. In 2013, the Massachusetts penalty was a lot smaller: $240 up to 200% of the poverty level and $468 up to 250% of poverty. But the RomneyCare mandate didn't need to be as forceful because modest-income households were mandated to buy policies with $0 deductibles, so the coverage was likely to provide real benefits.By far, the people who get the worst deal from ObamaCare and its individual mandate are modest-wage full-time workers, who are ineligible for the law's subsidies if they are offered what the law deems to be affordable care, even if it is in no way affordable.This year, a $20,000 earner who is eligible for ObamaCare subsidies can get a bronze plan for $359 per year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. But someone at the same income level who is offered insurance at the workplace might have to pay as much as $1,600 for bronze-type coverage — about 8% of income — or else face an ObamaCare fine.The Taxpayer Advocate Service also reported that 11 million tax returns claimed exemptions from the ObamaCare individual mandate through April of this year, up from 10.7 million a year earlier. Exemptions are allowed for a variety of reasons, including income below the tax-filing threshold, unauthorized immigrant status and coverage deemed unaffordable because it costs more than about 8% of income.

143,HUM,"The Obama administration told insurers on Friday that, as expected, they will get a big fat zero from ObamaCare's risk corridor program to offset billions in 2015 losses. But in a surprise twist, the Department of Health and Human Services essentially invited insurers to join in lawsuits against the government so that talks of a financial settlement can get started.That might be positive news for the likes of UnitedHealth (UNH), Anthem (ANTM) and Aetna (AET), which have been treating their risk-corridor receivables as a lost cause, and for Humana (HUM), which says it's owed $542 million under the program. HealthNet, acquired this year by Centene (CNC), is owed $212.5 million for excess losses suffered in 2014 and 2015.The biggest beneficiaries would be Blue Cross Blue Shield plans that have sustained massive losses and the nonprofit health cooperatives that have been driven out of business.HHS confirmed in the memo that any money collected under the risk corridor program for 2015 will be used to shrink its massive $2.5 billion shortfall in 2014, ""and no funds will be available at this time for 2015 benefit year risk corridors payments.""The twist came at the end: ""We know that a number of issuers have sued in federal court seeking to obtain the risk corridors amounts that have not been paid to date. As in any lawsuit, the Department of Justice is vigorously defending those claims on behalf of the United States. However, as in all cases where there is litigation risk, we are open to discussing resolution of those claims. We are willing to begin such discussions at any time.""Yet the prospect of a settlement is sure to stir a backlash among Republicans in Congress. Further, there's reason to doubt whether the U.S. faces much litigation risk based on past precedent. Lastly, HHS has been warning insurers that all risk corridor payments were ""subject to the availability of appropriations"" since early 2014 — well before 2015 premium prices were finalized. To the extent that the U.S. faces any risk of losing in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, that risk would seem to be limited to debts incurred in 2014.Health Republic of Oregon filed a $5 billion class-action lawsuit on behalf of insurers stiffed by the Obama administration risk corridor program, but the court hasn't yet granted class-action status, which would allow all insurers to sue as a group.The risk-corridor program, in its third and final year, transfers funds from firms that make ""excessive"" profits to those with excessive losses. (Excessive is defined as more than 3 percentage points of premiums net of administrative and related costs.)Those profits and losses were originally expected to balance out, but because ObamaCare customers turned out to be older and more costly than expected, few ObamaCare plans have been earning excess profits. For 2014, the roughly 50% of excess profits paid to the government came to just $362 million, while the 50% (or more) of excess losses amounted to $2.9 billion.While a number of analyses have found that ObamaCare losses deepened in 2015, and 2016 is shaping up to be a bad year as well, the Obama administration is still calculating how much insurers will have to pay out in excess profits for 2015 and how much they'll be owed for excess losses.IBD'S TAKE: The Medical-Managed Care group is ranked No. 172 out of 197 industry groups by IBD based on stock performance.

144,HUM,"As it has been doing since the spring of 2014, HHS continued to send mixed messages about making good on its promises. On one hand, HHS said that in the event of a shortfall, the department ""will explore other sources of funding for risk corridors payments, subject to the availability of appropriations. This includes working with Congress on the necessary funding for outstanding risk corridors payments.""That sounds iffy, at best, which is why UnitedHealth said in its latest 10-K filing with the SEC that ""We have not recorded any receivables under the temporary risk corridor program for 2014 or 2015 due to uncertainty over the level of government funding for this program and the ultimate collectability of these funds.""On the other hand, the memo suggests that the government can't duck its liability: ""HHS recognizes that the Affordable Care Act requires the Secretary to make full payments to issuers. HHS will record risk corridors payments due as an obligation of the United States Government for which full payment is required.""While insurers have plenty of reason to be upset that risk corridors hasn't lived up to their promises, legal precedents raise a big doubt that those insurers are entitled to a court judgment.The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service studied the question and found a somewhat similar case involving plaintiffs who were entitled to funds under the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program but were denied their fair share because the appropriated funds had been spent. The court found that plaintiffs couldn't be made whole by funds from the government's Judgment Fund and the only recourse was for the overseeing agency ""to seek additional appropriations from Congress.""RELATED:Health-Services Spending Takes Off, Raising Political RiskGovernment Survey Confirms Slowdown In U.S. Health Insurance GainsAetna's Exit From Most Exchanges Is Ominous For ObamaCare
"
145,HUM,"Spending on health care services surged a greater-than-expected 6.9%, or $37.1 billion, from a year ago in the second quarter, according to Census Bureau data released Thursday. The acceleration in spending growth is a worrying sign after a period of moderating growth that followed an ObamaCare-fueled rise amid Medicaid and individual-market coverage expansions.The obvious concern is that the latest surge isn't tied to more people getting coverage, but to faster per-person cost growth.The Altarum Institute, which tracks health spending, had expected a 5.3% year-over-year rise in spending on health services, equal to the year-over-year growth in the first quarter and consistent with a gradually moderating trend.The surprising re-acceleration in spending, if sustained, could create more headaches for the health care sector, which has already felt rising political heat due to drug pricing and spiraling premiums for ObamaCare exchange coverage.Democrats are pushing a government insurance option competing alongside private insurers as UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) have pulled back from the non-group insurance market. Higher spending growth also could step up the pace at which the ObamaCare-created Independent Payment Advisory Board will have to propose cost cuts to restrain Medicare's growth. Meanwhile, both presidential candidates have talked about letting Medicare negotiate drug prices, and Hillary Clinton has been quick to capitalize on the drug-pricing controversy, leading criticism of Mylan (MYL) for its EpiPen price hike.Political risk in a hard-to-predict election year has helped make health care the worst-performing of the eleven major S&P 500 sectors this year, with just a 1% gain, investment strategist Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research noted earlier this week. ""The sector has been haunted by controversy over egregious drug pricing, insurers pulling out of ObamaCare, and some disappointing news on the new drug front,"" he wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Overall, health care has lagged other stock sectors this year, but there have been plenty of health-related winners, including Intuitive Surgical, Veeva Systems and Healthequity. IBD helps investors identify the best stocks — before they stage a breakout. IBD writes about the best investment candidates in features such as The New America  and includes them in lists such as the IBD 50 and Sector Leaders. IBD also will even help you find the best buy point and teach you rules for selling.The 6.9% in spending on health care services reported in the Census' Quarterly Service Survey easily eclipsed the year-over-year growth reported since the recession — with one exception. The first quarter of 2015 saw 7.7% growth in health services spending, but that reflected the ObamaCare enrollment gains that, partly due to the HealthCare.gov technology glitch, didn't noticeably begin to push up health expenses until the second half of 2014. The services report doesn't detail prescription drug spending or health insurance spending.Hospital revenue jumped 6.6% from a year ago to $272 billion, even as the number of inpatient days dipped 0.1%. Meanwhile, hospital expenses on labor, supplies and overhead rose a more moderate 5.4%, signaling increased profitability. In this case, though, improvement is due to the tax-exempt sector. For-profit hospitals, such as those run by Tenet Healthcare (THC) and HCA Holdings (HCA), actually saw expense growth (10.3%) outpace revenue growth (8.3%). Yet for-profit hospitals still have higher profit margins than the tax-exempt sector.Spending on ambulatory care services jumped 7.3% from a year ago to $244.3 billion. Within that category, outpatient care center spending rose 9.2% and home health care services 6.8%. Medical and diagnostic labs showed relatively slow 2.7% growth. Spending at nursing and residential care facilities rose 6.3%.Overall, spending on health care services accounted for about 26% of total growth in services spending. That makes six straight quarters in which health care has accounted for at least one-fourth of the total growth in year-over-year services spending — twice as big of a share of growth as that seen as recently as the second quarter of 2014.

146,HUM,"It's been called a ""silent epidemic"" that's slowly wasting away the livers of millions of Americans while doctors have a paltry understanding of the disease and no approved treatments.But now, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, is in the sights of more than a dozen drugmakers. Allergan (AGN) became the latest Tuesday, announcing two deals to acquire NASH treatments in less than 12 hours. It's racing companies from startup Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) to giants including Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Pfizer (PFE) to reach an untapped market that could be worth $5 billion to $10 billion a year, according to a May estimate by RBC Capital Markets Corp. analyst Michael Yee.Drugmakers still are trying to determine how different components of the disease -- inflammation, scarring and metabolic changes -- interact and are experimenting with a variety of treatment mechanisms. With so many companies piling into the field, they'll have to work to distinguish themselves.""We're looking for something that's got a 'wow' factor,"" said Alex DePaoli, chief medical officer of closely held NGM Biopharmaceuticals Inc., which has a NASH partnership with Merck & Co (MRK). ""We want to develop something that pops your eyes out.""NASH occurs when fat accumulates in the liver along with inflammation and damage, and as much as a quarter of the U.S. population may have a precursor condition, called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The ailment develops slowly, and patients often don't show symptoms until their livers are heavily damaged. It's most common in people who are overweight or have diabetes, and doctors mainly prescribe diet changes and weight loss.IBD'S TAKE: The Medical-Biomed/Biotech sector is running hot, ranked eighth among IBD's 197 industry groups. The sector is led by Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN), and more can be found about it here.While doctors need to perform a biopsy to diagnose NASH, about 6 million to 15 million people in the U.S. alone are estimated to have the condition, and about 20% of them will go on to develop life-threatening cirrhosis. NASH will be the leading cause of liver transplants by 2020, according to Allergan. Drugs that treat it likely will command high prices, Elizabeth Krutoholow, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said.At the head of the race are Intercept and French biotech firm Genfit, with large trials underway. Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA), which Allergan agreed to buy Tuesday for as much as $1.7 billion, is preparing to recruit patients for a final-stage study. Investors also are watching for results from two of Gilead's mid-stage trials that are expected to be presented this year. On the acquisition news, Tobira shares soared by more than 721% Tuesday. Shares were up another 0.5% in afternoon trades Wednesday.Intercept is testing Ocaliva, already approved to treat a rare liver disease called primary biliary cirrhosis, against NASH. Enrollment of a final-stage trial of 2,000 people is expected to be completed next year, with interim results due in 2019.A potential concern is that in an earlier trial some patients experienced itching when taking the drug, in some cases so severe that it interfered with basic activities. Chief Executive Mark Pruzanski said in an interview that he hopes Ocaliva will become a backbone treatment, used in combination with other drugs.Genfit is developing elafibranor, a once-a-day-treatment that raises fat metabolism and fights inflammation, to ""treat the underlying cause of fibrosis,"" Dean Hum, Genfit's chief scientific officer, said in an interview.While elafibranor failed to meet a primary goal in a mid-stage trial last year, it showed promise in a subset of patients with moderate and severe forms of the disease. A final-stage trial in 2,000 moderate and severe patients is underway, and the company may have data by late 2018.Beyond the startup biotechs, some of the biggest companies are paying attention and ready to do deals. Merck said it will pay as much as $450 million for its partnership with NGM. Gilead, maker of the blockbuster hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni,  bought a NASH drug from Nimbus Therapeutics LLC for $1.2 billion, including milestone payments. Before that, Gilead also bought a drug from Phenex Pharmaceuticals AG for as much as $470 million.Gilead now has four NASH candidates in its portfolio and will have data from two later this year. The drugs target different aspects of the disease and will be developed individually, but may be used in potent cocktails. Allergan's Tobira is the biggest NASH deal so far, and on Tuesday the company also announced a $50 million purchase of Akarna Therapeutics Ltd., another developer of NASH treatments.Pfizer, the biggest U.S. drugmaker, may be a future acquirer. It has a NASH drug in trials and two more to be tested in humans by the end of the year. NASH is ""a major priority,"" said Morris Birnbaum, chief scientific officer of cardiovascular and metabolic disease. The company is trying to treat the disease in its early stages.It won't be easy. Along with Genfit, Tobira's mid-stage trial failed, and Raptor Pharmaceutical (RPTP) ended its program.""Data is starting to come out of studies, and a lot of confidence will be built and lost,"" said Jay Luly, chief executive of Enanta Pharmaceuticals (ENTA), which will begin testing an experimental treatment in patients this year. ""The same, I expect, will happen with money.""

147,HUM,"Now that Aetna (AET) has joined UnitedHealth (UNH) and Humana (HUM) in pulling back from the ObamaCare exchanges, the field is wide open for Centene (CNC) to make big enrollment gains. But that's not necessarily going to make Centene shareholders happy, Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte suggests in a new report.Gupte downgraded the stock to market perform from outperform on Monday but maintained an 80 price target. Shares dived 4.8% to 65.3 on big volume, though the stock found support at its 200-day moving average.Centene stock fell below its 50-day line in late August, along with Aetna, UnitedHealth and several other health insurers. Humana also is trending lower, but is still just above its 50-day and 200-day lines.Centene is turning a profit on its ObamaCare exchange business, which is an offshoot of its Medicaid managed care business. So why wouldn't even less competition on the exchanges yield even bigger profits?The potential risk for Centene and other insurers left standing is that they might inherit a lot of high-cost patients from the insurers who are pulling back from the exchanges amid financial losses. That risk could be exacerbated by the end of ObamaCare's reinsurance program, which is in its final year of covering a portion of the medical bills incurred by the highest-cost patients.Among a number of reasons for the downgrade, Gupte cited ""potential for downside risk from the HIX (health insurance exchange) exits by multiple plans and phaseout (of reinsurance in) 2017.""Gupte also said that ""margins in the core Medicaid business look to have peaked"" for Centene.That view seems consistent with the recent news that the government's cost for the ObamaCare Medicaid expansion exceeded per-person estimates by 49% in 2015.IBD'S TAKE: Learning when to sell a stock is as important as knowing when to buy. When Centene shares staged a breakout then fell below the buy point on July 26 after its earnings report, that triggered a key IBD sell signal. For a primer on protecting your profits and limiting your downside, visit IBD University.Gupte also noted some issues particular to Centene, involving a Pennsylvania Medicaid managed care contract that's now expected to produce losses in the near term and breakeven-at-best results from its Medicare Advantage expansion in four states next year.Bottom line: Gupte sees increased top-line growth, but with margin compression and earnings growth of 12% a year through 2019, down from prior expectations of 14%.Gupte lowered projected earnings for 2017 by 9 cents to $4.56 a share, well below the $4.87 average estimate of analysts.Shares of Molina Healthcare (MOH), another Medicaid managed care player that's fared better than most on the ObamaCare exchanges, gave up early gains as Centene plunged, but ended with modest losses.

148,HUM,"Health Reform: This is rich. Aetna was once a big supporter of ObamaCare, but discovered to its surprise that it was costing the company a fortune. So now Democrats who created this problem are bashing Aetna for being ""irresponsible.""In a letter to Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Ed Markey, Bill Nelson, Bernie Sanders and Sherrod Brown — some of the most liberal lawmakers in the Senate — demanded that he explain his company's decision not only to abandon its expansion plans, but to pull out of all but four ObamaCare markets.""We are particularly troubled,"" the senators wrote, ""that Aetna's decision to leave the ACA exchanges appears to have been motivated by the Justice Department's decision to challenge Aetna's proposed $37 billion merger with Humana.""This is politics at its absolute worst.It was ObamaCare that pushed Aetna (AET) to seek out this merger in the first place — just as it pushed Anthem (ANTM) to seek a deal with Cigna (CI). The costs involved in complying with ObamaCare's rules and regulations, as well as the ObamaCare-induced merger frenzy among hospitals, pretty much required it.But while ObamaCare was pushing the industry to consolidate, Justice decided to push back, leaving Aetna no choice but to pack up and leave.As an Aetna spokesman explained to Business Insider, ""we are one of many insurers, large and small, that has been forced to reduce its public exchange participation due to an increasingly unstable marketplace.""He's right about that. For-profit and nonprofit insurers alike are reeling from massive ObamaCare losses, which could reach almost $2 billion this year. Humana (HUM), UnitedHealth (UNH), and Blue Cross have pulled out of several markets, and more than half the nonprofit co-ops that ObamaCare itself created have since failed.The law is failing with the public as well. As more people find their insurance canceled, their premiums spike, their provider networks shrink, ObamaCare's popularity continues to suffer. The latest Gallup poll finds that 51% disapprove of the law, and far more say ObamaCare has directly hurt them as say it's helped (29% vs 18%).Attacking Aetna shows just how desperate Democrats are to pretend that ObamaCare isn't failing.But it also shows the perils of ""partnering"" with the federal government. As soon as things turn bad, politicians will blame the private companies involved, not the flawed law. In fact, Aetna's past supportive comments about ObamaCare are now being used against it by these senators, as if this somehow provides evidence of the company's bad faith.The answer isn't to look for scapegoats in the private sector for the ObamaCare train wreck, it's to repeal the law and start over with free market reforms that will actually work.RELATED:ObamaCare Conspiracy Theories Are Looking More Plausible By The DayObamaCare Is Destroying The Co-Ops It Spent Billions CreatingObamaCare Is Failing Exactly The Way Critics Said It Would
"
149,HUM,"The nation's progress in getting more people covered by health insurance slowed significantly this year, the government confirmed Wednesday in a report that tempers the Obama administration's signature achievement.About 1.3 million fewer people were uninsured the first three months of this year, driving the uninsured rate to a new record low of 8.6%, according to the National Health Interview Survey, an ongoing project of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Still, that progress is a fraction of the earlier gains seen under President Barack Obama's health care law. When the law's big expansion got underway in 2014, the number of uninsured people went down by nearly 9 million.The uninsured rate has been cut by nearly half under Obama's law, but that hasn't been enough to overcome political divisions. The survey estimated that 27.3 million people remained uninsured in the first three months of this year, about 21 million fewer than in 2010, when Obama signed the Affordable Care Act.The law offers subsidized private insurance for people everywhere who don't have access to job-based coverage, along with a Medicaid expansion geared to low-income adults in states that opt for it. Although a growing economy should also be contributing to coverage gains, experts say the law deserves most of the credit.The uninsured estimates are based on a first-quarter survey and may not fully reflect the extent to which the ObamaCare exchanges have seen a steep drop off in enrollment as the year progresses. As of early February, 12.7 million people signed up for the exchanges, but there were only 11.1 million paying customers. By the end of June, reports from major public insurers including Aetna (AET), Anthem (ANTM), UnitedHealth (UNH), Centene (CNC), Cigna (CI), Humana (HUM) and Molina (MOH) suggest enrollment fell to about 10.5 million.Premiums are expected to surge in 2017 as UnitedHealth, Aetna and Humana all dramatically scale back their exchange presence. That could keep a lid on enrollment going forward, especially for those who don't qualify for subsidies.In another notable finding, the report said the share of working age people and dependents with high-deductible health insurance has increased and now stands at 4 out of 10. Such plans require patients to pay a sizable share of their medical bills before insurance kicks in. The survey defined that as at least $1,300 annually for self-only coverage, and $2,600 for a family.The trend toward high-deductible plans started before Obama took office but advanced during his tenure as employers sought to limit their costs. In 2010, only about 25% of people under age 65 were in such plans. Policy experts credit rising deductibles for helping to restrain overall health care spending, but employees generally see that as a cost shift to them. Polls suggest the trend has undercut support for Obama's health care overhaul.The administration accentuated the survey's positive finding that the uninsured rate hit a new low.""Our country's march toward improving access, quality and affordability in health care goes on, and today's numbers show that the Affordable Care Act is continuing to drive historic progress,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a statement.The slower progress registered in the CDC report echoed recent findings from a major private survey, the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index.The government survey found 8.8 million fewer uninsured people in 2014. The following year, 2015, there was a reduction of 7.4 million. That compares with 1.3 million fewer uninsured people in the first three months of this year.The numbers for 2014 and 2015 are for full calendar years. But the new figures for the first three months of 2016 are considered a reliable indicator for the rest of the year. That's because the health care law's open enrollment deadlines drive sign-ups early in the year.The upcoming 2017 sign-up season looks tough, with sharp premium increases in many communities and a dwindling choice of insurers. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has promised to help the health care law regain its momentum, while Republican Donald Trump would make good on the GOP's vow to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with a new program yet to be defined.Some independent experts said the survey suggests that the health care law is approaching its limits, absent a change.""The share of the population without health insurance is lower than it's ever been ... but further gains are getting harder and harder to achieve,"" said Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""The pace at which people are getting newly insured has noticeably slowed.""""Low-income adults have come the farthest, but still have the farthest to go — nearly 25% of this population is uninsured,"" said Katherine Hempstead of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Covering more low-income adults is hindered because 19 states are still refusing the law's Medicaid expansion.""Multiple initiatives are needed to have a major impact on further reducing the uninsured population,"" said Paul Hughes-Cromwick of the Altarum Center for Sustainable Health Spending, a research and consulting group.
"
150,HUM,"""I will predict that within that year — now I may be wrong on this — but within the immediate future the Democrats are going to throw their hands in the air and say, 'It's not working. It's unaffordable. And we have to go to a single-payer system.' ""That was Sen. Orrin Hatch in 2013, arguing that ObamaCare was designed to fail so that Democrats could use it as an excuse for the government to take over the entire insurance industry.At the time, no respectable health care expert took Hatch — or any other conservative making such conspiratorial claims — seriously.But today, Hatch is starting to look absolutely prescient, even if his timing was off.Consider what is happening right now with ObamaCare. Enrollment is way below expectations. Insurers are putting in for double-digit rate hikes across the country, with some as high as 60%. UnitedHealth (UNH), Humana (HUM), and Blue Cross Blue Shield are pulling out of several ObamaCare markets, and most of the nonprofit co-ops created by ObamaCare have gone bust. As a result, the competition that was supposed to make ObamaCare exchanges the health care equivalent of Travelocity is evaporating.And Democrats? They are using these problems to push for a still bigger role for government in providing health insurance.The latest blow to ObamaCare came from Aetna (AET), which had been promising to expand its reach to 20 states, but instead is staying in just four. As a result, at least one county, this one in Arizona, faces the possibility that no insurer will be offering a health plan in the ObamaCare exchange.Even before Aetna's decision, 664 counties — more than a quarter of all counties in the country — had just one insurer in their ObamaCare exchange, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation report. Given that Aetna is exiting more than 500 counties, that number will only increase.Meanwhile, three entire states — Alaska, Alabama, and Wyoming — are down to one insurer, and there's no contingency if one of those insurers were to pack up and leave.That's not to say all of ObamaCare is falling apart — only the heavily-regulated private sector piece is.The law's Medicaid expansion, in contrast, is doing fabulously well, with enrollment climbing by nearly 15.5 million between the summer of 2013 and January 2016. That's a 27% increase. And that's despite the fact that more than a dozen states refused to expand Medicaid eligibility.So what's Hillary Clinton's answer to the failing private exchanges? Get more people on government insurance through what she calls the ""public option."" This would be a government-run health care plan offered in ObamaCare exchanges across the country.""The public option, Clinton says, ""will strengthen competition and reduce costs.""But wait a minute. The ""public option"" was pushed by liberal Democrats in 2009 when ObamaCare was being built, and it was rejected by centrists in the party because it looked too much like a steppingstone to single payer.As a matter of fact, that was the idea behind the ""public option"" in the first place.As Mark Schmitt explained in the liberal American Prospect, ""The public option was part of a carefully thought out and deliberately funded effort (to convince the single-payer crowd) they could live with the public option as a kind of stealth single-payer."" The idea was that the public option would be able to undercut private plans, driving them all out of the exchanges.But all those centrists Democrats who opposed the public option are gone from the Senate, and if Hillary Clinton gets elected with a more liberal Senate majority, the public option will likely be top of her agenda.With the vast Medicaid expansion, and the public option (as well as Clinton's proposal to expand Medicare), it's not far-fetched to say that soon the only people covered by private insurance will be the diminishing number who get it through work. (ObamaCare was also designed to shrink employer-based health.)So was this all in the grand plan when Democrats passed ObamaCare in 2010?Sen. Harry Reid, all but admitted as much in late 2013, when in an appearance on PBS' ""Nevada Week in Review,"" he said that ""what we've done with ObamaCare is have a step in the right direction, but we're far from having something that's going to work forever."" When asked if that meant a single-payer system, Reid said, ""Yes, yes. Absolutely, yes.""Ezra Klein, who at the time was a health care reporter with the Washington Post, explained that the left was pursuing a ""sneaky strategy"" to ""put in place something that over time the natural incentives ... move it to single payer.""Could it be that Hatch, Reid and Klein were all right? It sure seems like it these days.If so, the only way to stop the onward march to single payer would be to repeal ObamaCare and start over with free-market based reforms.Good luck with that if Hillary Clinton wins the election in November.

151,HUM,"Aetna (AET) announced late Monday that next year it will exit 11 of the 15 ObamaCare exchanges it currently operates in, citing heavy losses that have driven UnitedHealth (UNH), Humana (HUM) and others out of most markets, posing a major challenge for the Affordable Care Act.Aetna said in a statement:""Following a thorough business review and in light of a second-quarter pretax loss of $200 million and total pretax losses of more than $430 million since January 2014 in our individual products, we have decided to reduce our individual public exchange presence in 2017, which will limit our financial exposure moving forward.""When UnitedHealth announced early this year that it would exit all but a handful of exchanges, many dismissed the move. UnitedHealth, though the largest insurer, had been a late entrant into the individual marketplaces and was quick to complain about unexpectedly high costs.But Humana recently followed suit, planning to leave several states and the vast majority of counties that it had covered. As Aetna noted in Monday's statement, most co-ops have folded due to unexpected costs.Aetna's move means that many more counties will have only one exchange provider, with some having none.Aetna to drop Affordable Care Act plans in Arizona next year. @Aetna's exit means Pinal County, as of now, has no #ACA insurers for 2017.— Ken Alltucker (@kalltucker) August 16, 2016That Aetna, UnitedHealth, Humana and many others have decided they can't make money, even with premiums set to rise by double-digits in many parts of the country, suggests that the law still faces serious challenges.It appears that many patients -- perhaps with the connivance of some providers -- are gaming the system, overloading many insurers with unexpected costs.Medicaid managed care specialists Centene (CNC) and Molina Health (MOH) have expanded rapidly in recent years, offering ultra-high deductibles to limit premiums. But even Centene recently reported unexpected exchange losses from its recently acquired Health Net unit.Aetna and Humana may be less willing to stay in the exchanges, now that the Justice Department is trying to block the Aetna-Humana deal, as well as an Anthem (ANTM) deal for Cigna (CI).Related:ObamaCare Is Failing Exactly The Way Critics Said It Would
"
152,HUM,"Cigna (CI) and Anthem (ANTM) rallied Friday as a Department of Justice lawyer said the U.S. government is open to a settlement over the health insurers' proposed $48 billion merger.The DOJ has filed to block Anthem's takeover of Cigna, as well as the $37 billion merger of Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM).At a pretrial scheduling hearing Friday, the judge overseeing the Cigna-Anthem case said she would not be able to issue a ruling before the end of January. Judge Amy Jackson said the trial would likely start in mid to late November. Anthem has sought a ruling this year, concerned that Cigna may break off merger plans if there's no resolution by year-end.But Justice lawyer Jon Jacobs he was willing to engage in talks. The DOJ likely doesn't want to lose a high-profile antitrust fight. Then again, just because the government says it's willing to talk doesn't mean that the two sides will negotiate and reach a compromise. A settlement would likely involve significant asset sales to rivals.Cigna shares rose 5.3% on the stock market today, moving back above their 50-day moving average and approaching their 200-day line. Anthem rose 1.55%. Aetna edged up 0.3%, while Humana advanced 0.4%.
"
153,HUM,"Aetna (AET) on Tuesday said it intended to abandon its 2017 expansion plans on the Affordable Care Act exchanges and was reviewing future participation in the marketplaces, even as the health insurance giant reported second-quarter results that beat estimates.Just three months ago, Aetna said it planned to continue its ObamaCare business next year as it mulled an expansion to a few additional states.The company's shift makes it the latest health insurer to sour on the exchange marketplaces. Humana (HUM), which Aetna wants to buy, has said it planned to cut its exchange offerings next year. UnitedHealth (UNH) has also announced plans to leave most of its ObamaCare exchanges.Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI), which are also trying to merge, have also warned on higher costs from Affordable Care Act patients.""While we are pleased with our overall results, in light of updated 2016 projections for our individual products and the significant structural challenges facing the public exchanges, we intend to withdraw all of our 2017 public exchange expansion plans and are undertaking a complete evaluation of future participation in our current 15-state footprint,"" Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said in a statement.Aetna said it expected to lose more than $300 million on its Affordable Care Act plans offered this year.Aetna shares rose 1.1% in the stock market today, while Humana dropped 0.9%, and UnitedHealth dipped 0.2%. Anthem lost 1.6%, and Cigna eased 2.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Many health care stocks are struggling to find support at their 50-day lines. See IBD's Stock Checkup for more details. Health insurers' ObamaCare offerings have generally made up a small portion of enrollees. Still, Aetna has expressed concerns about the balance of healthy patients in the exchanges' risk pools. UnitedHealth has struggled with its higher-end exchange offerings, which patients are more likely to drop after a short period of time.Centene's (CNC) exchange offerings, targeted toward lower-income patients, had fared better, but its recent acquisition, Health Net, also reported losses on the exchanges.Meanwhile, Molina Healthcare (MOH) said it had agreed to buy some Medicare Advantage businesses from Aetna and Humana in a deal valued at roughly $117 million. Molina's purchase is contingent on the resolution of the Justice Department's lawsuit to block Aetna's combination with Humana.The Justice Department last month sued to stop that combination, as well as to halt the merger between Anthem and Cigna, arguing the new companies would be too big and limit competition.Aetna's second-quarter earnings per share rose 8% to $2.21, topping views for $2.12. Operating revenue rose 5% to $15.9 billion, surpassing estimates for $15.69 billion.The company's medical benefit ratio, or the percentage of premium revenue spent on health services, rose to 82.4%, as ObamaCare-related outlays increased.Aetna stuck to its full-year EPS guidance of $7.90-$8.10, vs. consensus for $8.05, but revised higher its expected medical benefit ratio, to 82%-82.5%, in part due to the exchanges.Health insurer WellCare (WCG), meanwhile, increased its full-year earnings per share guidance to $4.95-$5.05 from an earlier forecast of $4.55-$4.70, well above analyst estimates for $4.64. Second-quarter EPS and revenue also beat expectations, according to Thomson Reuters, and WellCare's medical benefits ratio fell during the quarter.Shares rallied jumped 4.7% to 111.91, moving above a 110.91 buy point.
"
154,HUM,"Cigna (CI) tumbled in the stock market today after becoming the latest health insurer to cite high ObamaCare medical costs. Cigna also issued weak guidance as the company is in limbo with its  troubled merger agreement with Anthem (ANTM), an analyst suggests.Cigna's second-quarter earnings per share fell 22% to $1.98, badly missing views for $2.39. Revenue rose 4% to $9.893 billion, short of expectations for $9.974 billion. The company said its Group Disability and Life Insurance segments weighed on results.The company's medical care ratio, or its expenses as a percentage of money taken in from premiums, rose to 81.7% from 80.2% a year earlier. That reflected higher-than-expected costs from patients via the ObamaCare exchanges.Anthem itself cited high ObamaCare costs in its Q2 earnings report. Centene (CNC), which has been aggressively expanding in the exchanges, reported some hefty ObamaCare losses in its recently acquired Health Net. Humana (HUM) recently announced that it would exit most ObamaCare markets, following a similar decision by UnitedHealth (UNH), due to exchange losses.Insurers' loses and exits are likely to push premiums significantly higher in 2017.Cigna stock closed down 5.2% to 128.96, gapping down below its 200-day and 50-day lines. Shares of Anthem fell 1.2%, Humana rose 0.2%, and Aetna (AET) dipped 0.5%. Centene rallied 0.8% and UnitedHealth added 0.3%.""Cigna's quarter was disappointing, and with the ANTM combination threatened by the government's attempts to block it, we expect the shares to suffer,"" Wells Fargo analyst Peter Costa said in a report. ""We wonder how much of the pressure is a result of focus on the merger, since some of the pressure seems to be related to non-core items.""Cigna's results come after the Justice Department last week sued to block Anthem's takeover of Cigna, as well as the combination of Aetna and Humana.The mergers, the government argued in a statement, ""would increase concentration and harm competition across the country, reducing from five to three the number of large, national health insurers in the nation."" Health insurers have been looking to consolidate to shore up against regulations from the Affordable Care Act.IBD'S TAKE: Like Cigna, Medicaid-focused health insurer Centene also took a hit in the stock market this week. Share prices of industry players have had a wild month due to DOJ action on mergers and struggles in the Affordable Care Act. See how the industry is performing in IBD's Stock Checkup.Cigna also said continued higher costs in its Individual Health business  -- ObamaCare exchange-compliant plans -- would cut into its full-year EPS outlook. The company slashed its 2016 earnings per share guidance to $7.75-$8.10 from an earlier forecast of $8.95-$9.35, far below the $9.29 analysts had expected.Other insurers have also struggled with their individual businesses this quarter, Costa noted.Higher costs due to Cigna's response to a recent audit by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services also weighed on the second quarter and the company's full-year outlook. CMS in January suspended Cigna from enrolling new customers to some Medicare plans due to what the agency called ""systemic failures"" in providing services to patients.

155,HUM,"Stocks moved sideways at all-time highs this week, but the week was packed with market-moving news. Alibaba (BABA) broke out as growth accelerated, while Acacia Communications (ACIA) exploded as fiber optic and IPO growth names sparked. Macy's (M) triggered a huge relief rally, and Wal-Mart (WMT) bought Jet.com to better compete vs. Amazon (AMZN). Oil prices rebounded, but solar stocks crashed.After weeks of the S&P 500 and Dow industrials hitting all-time highs, the Nasdaq eclipsed its 2015 peak. All three major indexes rose fractionally for the week -- the Nasdaq and Dow closed up 0.2% while the S&P 500 climbed 1 point. More quality breakouts appeared. Retailers, energy plays and some hot growth stocks led the market amid earnings reports and higher oil prices. But solar stocks tumbled on weak SunPower (SPWR) guidance. REITs struggled as investors sought growth names -- and worried about store closures.Alibaba reported revenue of $4.84 billion, beating the Wall Street consensus estimate of $4.53 billion. Revenue rose 59% in local-currency terms, the best gain since Alibaba's September 2014 IPO. EPS rose 33% to 74 cents, beating the consensus of 63 cents.JD.com reported revenue of $9.8 billion, slightly above the consensus and up 42% in local currency. It reported earnings per share of 4 cents, double the 2 cent consensus, but its Q3 revenue estimate fell short of projections. Both companies showed strong growth in mobile users.Alibaba stock soared 16% for the week, breaking out of a base to their highest level since January 2015. JD.com leapt nearly 13%.Next week, messaging giant Tencent (TCEHY), perhaps Alibaba's biggest Chinese rival, reports earnings. So do mobile gaming portal NetEase (NTES) and flash e-commerce seller Vipshop (VIPS).IBD'S TAKE: With the market at record highs, many growth names large and small are breaking out. To get an in-depth look at Alibaba, Acacia and other top-rated stocks -- and how they fare vs. rivals -- go to IBD Stock Checkup to develop your watch list.Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih hinted at a production freeze, which could come at a meeting on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum next month. But Russia's energy minister said he didn't see a reason for renewing talks. The International Energy Agency said the oil glut has disappeared, but it warned of weaker demand on a ""dimmer macroeconomic outlook"" in 2017. OPEC said Saudi Arabia pumped a record amount of crude oil in July, and the cartel left its 2017 demand outlook unchanged at 95.41 million barrels per day. The Energy Information Administration said that U.S. stockpiles rose by 1.1 million barrels to 523.6 million for the week ended Aug 5. And U.S. production fell by 0.2% to 8.44 million barrels, a second straight week of declines.U.S. oil rigs in operation rose by 15 to 396 in the week ended Aug. 12, Baker Hughes said. That's the seventh straight weekly gain and the highest level since late February.Still, U.S. crude oil prices closed the week at $44.49 a barrel, up 4.4%.Wal-Mart Stores, looking to keep pace with Amazon, agreed to buy Jet.com for $3.3 billion. Wal-Mart has sizable online sales, but growth has been decelerating. Wal-Mart also will put Jet.com CEO Marc Lore in charge of all of Wal-Mart's e-commerce operations, though Jet.com will remain separately. Lore previously founded Quidsi, parent of Diapers.com, before Amazon bought it.Wal-Mart stock rose 0.2%, hitting a 14-month high during the week.Solar stocks after SunPower cut its 2016 guidance and inverter-supplier SolarEdge (SEDG) cited a slowdown at U.S. installers. For Q2, SunPower's Q2 revenue growth and adjusted loss topped estimates. But SunPower sees Q3 revenue of just $700 million to $800 million vs. the consensus for $1.13 billion, as demand for utility-scale solar projects tumbles. And SunPower also cut its 2016 view to $2.8 billion-$3 billion, missing analysts' view for $3.3 billion.SolarEdge's $124.8 million in fiscal Q4 sales missed analysts' expectations for $129.4 million, but 44 cents EPS minus items beat by a nickel. The midpoint of current-quarter sales guidance for $130 million-$139 million trailed the consensus at $137 million, and EPS missed by a penny.SolarCity (SCTY), which has agreed to a takeover deal by Tesla (TSLA), topped analysts' Q2 projections for adjusted loss and revenue. But its current-quarter view for $155 million-$168 million in revenue lagged the consensus for $174.6 million.SunPower stock crashed 28% to a 3-year low.Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), involved in everything from gaming to autonomous driving and AI, rose 8.3% for the week to a fresh high after the Tesla partner reported $1.43 billion in sales and 40 cents earnings per share. That topped the consensus for $1.35 billion and 37 cents, and was up 24% and 700%, respectively, vs. last year. Nvidia sees current-quarter sales at $1.68 billion, plus or minus 2%, beating analysts' model for $1.45 billion.With China, telecoms and data centers spending heavily for higher-speed connections, makers of fiber optic components are seeing huge demand.Hot IPO Acacia Communications said Q2 revenue rose 101% to $116 million, and adjusted earnings soared 305%. Lumentum (LITE) and Inphi (IPHI) also reported stronger-than-expected figures. NeoPhotonics (NPTN) sales growth fell short due to sluggish demand for older parts, but production of 100-gigabit gear is ramping up. IBD's 14-company Telecom-Fiber Optics industry group hit a 15-year high Thursday and ranks No. 10 out of 197 groups.Acacia rose 41% Friday and nearly 50% for the week, blasting to new highs. Lumentum rose more than 4% and Inphi 16%, also to new highs. NeoPhotonics climbed 2.6% to 14.01, clearing a 13.85 buy point on Friday.Related:IBD'S TAKE: Acacia Communications is among several tech leaders that have risen 20% past a buy point, putting them in profit-taking zone. But when you should you sell these top stocks? IBD's latest Tech Leaders column explains when to hold onto winning stocks, and how those rules apply to Acacia, Weibo and others right now.Recent IPO Twilio (TWLO), a communications software firm, reported a narrower than-expected non-GAAP loss. Q2 revenue jumped 70% to $64.5 million, vs. Wall Street estimates of $58.2 million, although sales from its top customer, Facebook (FB)-owned WhatsApp, fell 8% year over year. Twilio's full-year guidance edged consensus estimates.Twilio shares surged 28% for the week, hitting a new high.Medpace Holdings (MEDP) soared 20% to 27.79 in Thursday's debut after pricing at 23, the high end of its expected IPO range. Shares edged up 0.9% to 28.04 on Friday. Medpace provides outsourced clinical development services for drug and medical device companies.Specialty drugmakers ended what had been a strong Q2 season for the drug industry on a more ambiguous note. Allergan (AGN), freshly divested of its generics business, beat expectations slightly but trimmed its sales guidance. Shares fell 1.7% for the week. Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) missed Q2 numbers but affirmed its guidance as it reorganized. It said its deal with Walgreens (WBA) was finally turning profitable and that it was willing to sell $8 billion worth of non-core assets. The stock soared 25% Tuesday, but pared weekly gains to 13.5% on a report that Valeant could face criminal charges of defrauding insurers.Medivation (MDVN) reported a ho-hum quarter, but profit will likely be flat until an expected market expansion for its drug Xtandi in Q4. Shares rose 4.4% to 66.02, a 14-month high and just barely in buy range from a 63.04 entry. Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) missed EPS estimates and lowered guidance, partly due to a change in tax reporting and partly due to higher costs. Its stock dropped 9.3%. Mylan (MYL) beat its profit estimate slightly and affirmed its guidance, with its controversially high-priced EpiPen making up for light generic drug sales. Mylan closed the week unchanged.Walt Disney (DIS) topped Wall Street estimates late Tuesday and said it had bought a 33% stake in streaming company BAMTech. As it vies to remain competitive in digital, the media conglomerate plans to launch an ESPN-branded over-the-top service, but it will not include current ESPN content. Q3 EPS rose 12% to $1.62 on 9% revenue growth to $14.28 billion. Shares were up about 1% for the week, but failed to hold above their 50-day line.Southwest (LUV) cut its third-quarter unit revenue outlook and said it expected higher unit costs due to 2,000-plus flight cancellations in July after a single router failure blacked out much of its technological infrastructure. The guidance came as Delta Air Lines (DAL) spent much of the week trying to recover from some 2,000 of its own flight cancellations caused by an outage early Monday. American Airlines (AAL), meanwhile, forecast an improvement in its Q3 unit revenue.Southwest and Delta shares fell 3.5% while American Air climbed 1.4%.Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) reported lower sales, while Macy's also had declining earnings and said it would cut 100 stores. But they both topped forecasts after weeks of bad news from consumer stocks such as Ford (F) and McDonald's (MCD). So Macy's and Kohl's skyrocketed 16.7% and 14.3%, respectively for the week. Nordstrom (JWN) and JCPenney (JCP) topped on earnings and missed on revenue, with their shares also soaring for the week. But overall, retail sales were flat in July -- and down 0.3% excluding autos -- according to the Commerce Department. Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Wal-Mart and Ross Stores (ROST) are among the retailers reporting this coming week.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose to a 14-month high in August, climbing 2.9 points to 48.4. That's still below the neutral 50 level.
"
156,HUM,"Centene (CNC) reported blowout second-quarter earnings, but the stock fell sharply after reporting big ObamaCare-related losses for Health Net.The Medicaid-focused health care provider also poured cold water on speculation that it would bid on assets put up for sale to clear the way for mergers, such as those being attempted by Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) or by Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI).Second-quarter earnings per share surged 70% to $1.29, well above views for $1.09, and the company's full-year EPS guidance of $4.20-$4.55 was above forecasts for $4.10. The company's health benefits ratio -- the amount of income paid out for insurance claims -- was 86.6%, better than 89.1% a year earlier.Revenue nearly doubled to $10.987 billion, above estimates for $10.785 billion, largely due to Centene's acquisition of Health Net in March.But Centene had to set a $300 million premium deficiency reserve, mostly due to Health Net's losses in the California and Arizona exchanges. Many other insurers, including UnitedHealth (UNH) and Humana, have also set some reserves.Centene says its overall performance in Affordable Care Act exchanges is strong.Centene shares fell 8.5% to 68.87 in the stock market today, plunging below a 71.63 entry point in a cup-with-handle base. But the stock closed above its 50-day line after tumbling as low as 63.44 intraday.IBD'S TAKE: Centene has been the leader in the Medical-Managed Care group, but other health insurer stocks are performing well. To compare Centene's vitals vs. objective criteria and its peers, go to IBD Stock Checkup.UnitedHealth and Humana have announced plans to exit most ObamaCare exchange markets, but Centene has been expanding its reach, pushing up deductibles to woo customers with lower premiums. The insurer has benefited strongly from the law's Medicaid expansion.Meanwhile, the Justice Department last week sued to halt the Aetna-Humana and Anthem-Cigna combinations. Centene and others were reportedly attempting to buy some of the Medicare Advantage plans Aetna might have to sell to help green-light its purchase of Humana.But Centene CEO Michael Neidorff on Tuesday said that the insurer ""has not participated and will not participate in bidding and auctions. So anything that indicates that would have to be considered a rumor.""Aetna fell 0.5% and Anthem 1.7%. Cigna lost 0.1% while Humana rose 0.55%. UnitedHealth edged down 3 cents at 141.70.
"
157,HUM,"The Justice Department filed lawsuits Thursday to block the Anthem merger with Cigna (CI), and the Aetna (AET) buy of Humana (HUM), arguing that they would reduce competition.Attorney General Loretta Lynch, in a morning press event, said the health insurance mega-mergers would have hurt consumers.Aetna, Anthem, Cigna and Humana, after modest initial selling, are up on the stock market today. Aetna rose 1.55%, Cigna 5.4% and Anthem 2.6%. Humana jumped 8.3%, though it found resistance at its converging 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Investors had largely priced in the risk of regulators blocking the deals after months of signals and reports that the DOJ was skeptical.All four insurers responded that they would fight the lawsuits in court. That would put the deals, announced in 2015, in limbo for several months.Aetna said Thursday that the DOJ move was a ""misguided step backwards."" Aetna had been in talks with other insurers, reportedly WellCare Health (WCG) and Centene (CNC), about selling assets to try to win DOJ approval. Aetna has said it would fight in court to keep the deal.Cigna, meanwhile, said it is ""currently evaluating its options"" given that the deal likely would not be approved, if at all, until 2017 at the very earliest.Humana shares rallied so much in part because it raised earnings guidance and said it would exit most of its ObamaCare markets. Humana now expects to earn at least $9.25 a share excluding various items, up from its prior target for at least $8.85  and analyst consensus for $8.87. Humana expects to lose $1.33 a share from individual markets, as it loses money on the ObamaCare exchanges.Humana is slashing its ObamaCare exchange exposure, exiting at least 88% of the counties it currently serves.""The company's 2017 geographic presence for its Individual offerings is expected to cover no more than 156 counties across 11 states, down from 1,351 counties across 19 states in 2016. Humana expects 2017 premiums associated with ACA-compliant offerings in the range of $750 million to $1 billion versus approximately $3.4 billion projected for FY16. The rate review and approval processes with the related states are ongoing.""UnitedHealth (UNH), the largest U.S. insurer, has already announced it will exit all but a handful of states for 2017. UnitedHealth shares fell 0.1% Thursday after hitting a record high on Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: None of the four insurers involved is highly rated, and all are relative laggards in the Medical-Managed Care group. Focus on leading stocks in leading groups. See the top health insurers' vitals at IBD Stock Checkup.

158,HUM,"The jobs report pushed stocks toward fresh all-time highs in a busy week. Tesla Motors (TSLA) announced a deal to buy SolarCity (SCTY) as tech M&A was strong. General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) fueled a sell-off in consumer-related stocks, while oil prices briefly undercut $40 a barrel. Also, the Bank of England cut rates and revived bond buying.The major averages were little changed through Thursday, but rallied Friday on the strong jobs report. The Nasdaq climbed 1.1% for the week for a record close Friday and just 10 points below its July 2015 intraday peak. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, hitting a fresh intraday best. The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.6%. Energy stocks fell as oil undercut $40 early in the week, but rallied as crude recovered somewhat.The U.S. economy added 255,000 jobs in July, the second straight month of much-better-than-expected hiring, allaying fears about the economy. ISM's manufacturing index and nonmanufacturing index fell a little more than forecast, but still pointed to growth. Strong hiring and wage gains should support consumer spending and housing demand, despite many consumer-related firms reporting stalling demand.Tesla took a step closer toward acquiring SolarCity for $2.6 billion as a special committee of ""independent and disinterested"" SolarCity board members evaluated the proposal and alternatives, stating its approval of the merger. The deal still needs to be approved by shareholders and regulators.Tesla reported Q2 earnings that missed estimates but showed improvements in electric-car production. Its production is on track to support about 50,000 deliveries in the second half of 2016, which reaffirmed previous guidance.The electric-car company's losses ballooned to $1.06 a share from 48 cents in the year-earlier figure, much greater than the 52-cent loss estimate. Tesla reported non-GAAP revenue of $1.56 billion, up 33% but missing the consensus of $1.62 billion.Tesla fell 2% for the week, while SolarCity lost more than 7%.Ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies is selling its Chinese operations to Apple (AAPL)-backed rival Didi Chuxing Technologies, capitulating on an expensive battle for a foothold in China. The deal has Uber swapping its Chinese business for a 20% stake in Didi, making the former foe the largest stakeholder in Didi. In turn, Didi will become the de facto ride-hailing leader in China, valued at more than $35 billion. Uber's most recent valuations put it north of $68 billion.Verizon Communications (VZ) agreed to buy Fleetmatics (FLTX), a vehicle tracking system maker, for $2.4 billion, or $60 per share. The acquisition expands Verizon' push into web-connected vehicles, part of the Internet of Things. Ireland-based Fleetmatics' mobile-software platform lets businesses manage commercial fleets by providing data on vehicle location, fuel usage, speed and mileage.Verizon fell 3.2% for the week, dropping below a buy point and its 50-day moving average. Fleetmatics jumped 38.5% to 59.50.Time Warner (TWX) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) both turned in mixed results, but Time Warner's move to buy a 10% stake in Netflix (NFLX) rival Hulu – joining current co-owners Walt Disney (DIS), Fox and Comcast (CMCSA) -- stole headlines. Viacom (VIAB) reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, as did Lions Gate (LGF), which posted a surprise Q1 profit.U.S. oil prices fell below $40 per barrel early in the week, following July's 14% tumble, as OPEC production climbed on strong output from Nigeria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia continued to pump out oil near record highs. U.S. crude stockpiles rose in the latest week, according to the Energy Information Administration, but U.S. production dipped and gasoline supplies fell. Shale producers Continental Resources (CLR), Oasis Petroleum (OAS), and Laredo Petroleum (LPI) all lifted their output forecasts. Oil closed the week higher, at $41.80.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) plunged 16% Friday after its cancer drug Opdivo ended a string of clinical-trial successes with its failure in a trial as a single therapy of newly diagnosed lung-cancer patients. Merck (MRK) had succeeded with a similar patient group in a trial of its competing drug Keytruda, though it was aiming at a smaller potential market. Merck stock jumped 10.4%, hitting its highest level since June 2001.Earlier, Merck was reported to be talking with Biogen (BIIB) about a possible Biogen buyout, as was Allergan (AGN). This further boosted Biogen's stock a day after its partner Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) announced the unexpected success of a clinical trial of nusinersen, a treatment for a rare spinal disease with blockbuster potential. Biogen rose nearly 9% for the week.Meanwhile specialty drugmakers Mallinckrodt (MNK) and Shire (SHPG) rose 19% and 3.5%, respectively, after they beat estimates and raised guidance, while Pfizer (PFE), Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) slipped after they beat Q2 numbers but issued so-so guidance. Animal-health company Zoetis (ZTS) also rose after beating and raising.General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) led auto stocks lower after reporting slower U.S. sales for the month of July, with Ford projecting U.S. industry sales to fall in 2016 and 2017 after years of big gains. Department stores, grocery stores, restaurants and airlines also declined, but recovered somewhat by week's end.The sell-off among consumer stocks triggers a warning for the broader U.S. economy amid falling business investment and homebuilder spending. Consumer spending rose at a strong 4.2% annual rate in Q2, but if that falters, the economy may not be able to match its anemic Q2 GDP growth of 1.2%.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) beat Q2 earnings estimates, with EPS up 57% to 47 cents, but revenue growth of 12% to $508.8 million missed views. The steakhouse chain also said early Q3 same-restaurant sales growth had slowed from Q2.The outlook comes amid growing worries about the restaurant sector overall. Starbucks (SBUX) and McDonald's both recently reported weak U.S. comps amid warnings from analysts about the retail sector.But pizza delivery chains including Papa John's (PZZA) are bucking the trend.

159,HUM,"Aetna's decision to abandon its ObamaCare expansion plans and rethink its participation altogether came as a surprise to many. It shouldn't have. Everything that's happened now was predicted by the law's critics years ago.Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said that this was supposed to be a break-even year for its ObamaCare business. Instead, the company has already lost $200 million, which it expect that to hit $320 million before the year it out. He said the company was abandoning plans to expand into five other states and is reviewing whether to stay in the 15 states where Aetna (AET) current sells ObamaCare plans.Aetna's announcement follows UnitedHealth Group's (UNH) decision to leave most ObamaCare markets, Humana's (HUM) decision to drop out of some, Blue Cross Blue Shield's announcement that it was quitting the individual market in Minnesota, and the failure of most of the 23 government-created insurance co-ops. And it follows news that insurance companies are putting in for double-digit rate hikes that in some cases top 60%, and news that the Congressional Budget Office has sharply downgraded its long-term enrollment forecast for the exchanges.Who could have envisioned such problems? Not ObamaCare backers. They were endlessly promising that the law would create vibrant, highly competitive markets that would lower the cost of insurance.Critics, however, were spot on. They said that, despite the individual mandate, ObamaCare wouldn't attract enough young and healthy people to keep premiums down.The Heritage Foundation, for example, said that under ObamaCare, ""many under age 35 will opt out of buying insurance altogether, choosing to pay the penalty instead."" That's just what has happened.Critics predicted sharp hikes in premiums and big increases in medical claims. That's what's happened.Critics said people would game the system, waiting until they got sick to buy insurance, then canceling it once the bills were paid, because of the law's ""guaranteed issue"" mandate. That's happening, too. In fact, administration officials are trying to tighten the rules to mitigate this problem.Critics said insurers would abandon ObamaCare amid substantial losses. Anyone want to dispute that this is happening?These dire predictions weren't pulled out of thin air. Several states had already tried ObamaCare-style market reforms in the 1990s, only to see their individual insurance markets collapse. A 2007 report by Milliman Inc. looked at eight states that had adopted the ""guaranteed issue"" and ""community rating"" reforms at the heart of ObamaCare.Like Obama, these states wanted to create insurance markets where no one could be denied coverage, or charged more, just because they were sick. But Milliman found that these regulations resulted in fast-rising premiums, a drop in enrollment in the individual market, and an exodus of health insurers.Sound familiar?By the time ObamaCare came around, most of those states either abandoned or overhauled this regulatory scheme, only to have it reimposed on them.ObamaCare architects figured they could avoid the fate of those state experiments by including the individual mandate and subsidies for lower income families.However, consulting firm Oliver Wyman correctly predicted in 2009 that these wouldn't work, either. ""The subsidies and mandates,"" it concluded, ""are not sufficient to drive high participation of younger, healthier members.""Aetna's Bertolini says that what's needed now to keep ObamaCare functioning are bigger and more generous taxpayer financed insurance subsidies — i.e., bailouts. Democrats say what's needed is a ""public option"" so that consumers in states abandoned by private insurers will be able to get coverage.How about instead policymakers listen to the original ObamaCare critics? For decades, they've been calling for reforms that lift myriad anti-competitive government regulations, as well as fixes to the tax code so that it no longer massively distorts the insurance market.The resulting free market competition in health care would do what it does everywhere it's allowed to function — improve quality while improving affordability. In other words, it would achieve the things ObamaCare promised but miserably failed to deliver.

160,HUM,"Top insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH) said Tuesday its 2017 earnings will benefit as it mostly exits the ObamaCare exchanges, its worst-performing business line.UnitedHealth reported second-quarter earnings of $1.96 per share, up 13% from a year earlier, handily beating analysts' estimates of $1.89. Still, the company just slightly raised its full-year earnings outlook to $7.80-$7.95 a share from $7.75-$7.95, roughly in line with consensus estimates for $7.89.The high end of its full-year 2016 earnings guidance held steady because worse-than-expected results in its ObamaCare individual market business called for a conservative outlook, management said in an earnings call.Shares closed up 1.3% to 142.59 on the stock market today. The stock has been trading near an all-time high and finished above buy range.The good news is that as UnitedHealth shrinks its presence in state exchanges, most of its projected $605 million in ObamaCare exchange losses in 2016 will evaporate. That equates to about 35 cents a share, one analyst offered on the earnings call. UnitedHealth plans to have no more than three state exchanges in 2017, down from 34 this year,UnitedHealth upped its exchange-related loss estimate for the year by $200 million, citing higher-than-expected enrollment and the increased prevalence of customers with chronic conditions such as HIV, diabetes and hepatitis C.UnitedHealth had 820,000 exchange customers at the end of June, up about 25,000 from the end of March. The higher total was a surprise, given that national enrollment has typically declined as the year progresses. Last year, UnitedHealth said the additional customers who signed up mid-year, after open enrollment had closed, tended to be sicker.Management said on the call that the company does not ""expect any meaningful financial exposure"" from the limited exchange presence next year, though it noted that some fixed costs of participating in the exchanges will remain.IBD's TAKE: With an 88 IBD Composite Rating out of a possible 99, UnitedHealth ranks second among health insurers, behind only Centene Corp. (CNC). Check out IBD's Stock Checkup on UnitedHealth here.UnitedHealth kept its cards close to its vest when asked about potential acquisitions, as Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM) mull selling off pieces to attain approval for their respective acquisitions of Humana (HUM) and Cigna (CI). But those deals may be in peril, as Bloomberg reported that U.S. government officials are poised to file lawsuits to block both acquisitions.Humana took the worst of it in Tuesday trades, dropping 3.9%. Aetna fell 2.7%, while Cigna lost 2.1%, and Anthem dipped 2.2%.UnitedHealth's revenue surged 28% to $46.5 billion in the quarter, trouncing the $45 billion consensus estimate, according to Thomson Reuters.""Overall, medical cost trends remain well-controlled and consistent with expectations,"" the company said, noting that the only unfavorable development came in its individual ObamaCare-compliant business. The results seem to validate UnitedHealth's decision to pull back from the exchanges.The company's medical-cost ratio, the share of premium revenue paid out for claims, rose 30 basis points to 82%.UnitedHealthcare, the insurance unit, saw revenue grow 14% and served 2.1 million more members than in the year-earlier quarter. On a sequential basis, membership grew 320,000.The real growth driver has been the company's Optum division, which saw revenues surge 52%. Within that group, the OptumRx pharmacy services unit boosted revenue to $15.1 billion, up 69%.Management said that they executed about $1 billion in stock buybacks in the first half, but they will slow the pace of such purchases in the second half.

161,HUM,"U.S. antitrust officials are poised to file lawsuits to block Anthem's (ANTM) takeover of rival health-insurer Cigna (CI) and Aetna's (AET) deal to buy Humana (HUM), according to a person familiar with the matter.Tasked with protecting competition, Justice Department officials are concerned the deals would harm customers by turning the health-insurance industry's five biggest companies into three, according to several people familiar with the situation. The fifth major health insurer is UnitedHealth (UNH), the biggest of the quintet.The final decision could come this week and will be made by the end of the month, one of the people said.Shares of the four insurers were all lower in morning trades. Humana was hit hardest, down 5.5%. Aetna dropped 4.1%, Anthem lost 3.2%, and Cigna gave up 2.4%. UnitedHealth, which is sitting on the sidelines at present and reported earnings Tuesday, sidestepped most of the damage but still was off 0.3%.News of the government's possible thwarting of the deals came a few days after Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell highlighted the importance of competition to insurance markets.Last week, Burwell said competition among insurers can reduce costs that consumers face and improve the quality of their health coverage. Burwell declined to comment on the proposed mergers, but said: ""When there is competition, that creates downward price pressure, and it also creates upward quality pressure.""Burwell went on to say: ""We've always thought and talked about why competition is an important part of the overall picture, and that's not just in the marketplace but overall for the nation in terms of our health care.""

162,HUM,"Here's how big of a mess the ObamaCare exchanges are: The insurer lauded as a model of success for turning a profit in its exchange business is actually increasing the ranks of the uninsured.Centene (CNC) ObamaCare exchange profits have been cited again and again, often by analysts on the left, as proof that UnitedHealth (UNH), Humana (HUM) and other companies losing their shirts are doing it all wrong.Yet, while Centene merits credit for being an efficient, low-cost provider in states where it has contracts to manage the care of the Medicaid population, there's another side to the story. A closer look at Centene's much-heralded success reveals that competition between insurers on the ObamaCare exchanges has become toxic. Rather than being a boon to consumers looking for a good deal, competition is hurting the very people it is supposed to help.Even as it distances itself from rival insurers in offering the cheapest plans available, Centene is turning Mississippi into ground zero for the ObamaCare individual mandate penalty, sinking subsidized enrollment both there and in Washington state.If Centene is a model of ObamaCare success, the logical takeaway is that there is little prospect of healthy competition in the exchanges as long as the customer base remains so narrow, so old and in such poor health. Not even the so-called public option — letting government compete against private insurers, as President Obama and Hillary Clinton are calling for — would be likely to help, if a level playing field were even possible. Rather, a fundamental rethinking of the marketplace is likely needed to broaden participation and create incentives that attract rather than punish the relatively young and healthy.Take a look at what's happening in Mississippi. Recall that in this, ObamaCare's third year, enrollment was expected to be on the upswing as the ramping up of the individual mandate compelled more people to get coverage after weak take-up in 2015. That happened to a very modest degree in many states, but not Mississippi, where the number of people getting subsidized coverage fell by 2,367, or 3.1%.To get a sense of just how lousy that is, consider that only 40% of the subsidy-eligible exchange population is enrolled in Mississippi, putting it dead last among states which didn't expand Medicaid and, therefore, cater to a more heavily subsidized group.Yet the fallout was entirely predictable. Although subsidies are pegged to the premium of the second-lowest-cost silver plan in each market, Centene has been scrunching down its silver premiums by making the plans more bronzelike — with deductibles as high as $6,500 this year and a $7,050 silver-plan deductible coming in 2017. That in turns shrinks the government subsidies that are supposed to help make coverage affordable. If customers can't afford, or don't like, the cheap Centene silver plans on offer, they'll have less of a subsidy to buy a bronze plan or a silver plan from a competitor.In the largest HealthCare.gov market in 37 states, the second cheapest silver plan costs, on average, 27% more than the cheapest bronze plan this year. But in Mississippi, where Centene's Ambetter brand is the low-cost provider, the gap between bronze and silver is only 12.6% in 2016, down from 34.8% in 2015.Just look at what happened to the cost of coverage as a result: A 30-year-old in Yazoo City earning about $25,000 (214% of the poverty level) has to pay $554 more for the cheapest bronze plan, $1,478 vs. $924 in 2015. While the cheapest bronze plan from Ambetter saw before-subsidy premiums rise 12%, the cost of its second cheapest silver plan fell 7.5%, shrinking the annual subsidy by nearly $300, or 25%.Try to put yourself in those modest-income shoes. If you're in good health and making $25,000 a year, here are your three unaffordable options: Buy the cheapest silver plan from Ambetter for $1,750, with a $4,500 deductible even after extra cost-sharing subsidies; buy a $6,800-deductible bronze plan for $1,450; or pay a $695 penalty, equal to 2.8% of your income.Next look at Washington state, another place where Centene's success has led to a decrease in subsidized enrollment. According to data from the Department of Health and Human Services, the number of paying ObamaCare customers receiving subsidies at the end of March was down over 14,000, or 11.3%, from a year earlier, 110,476 vs. 124,505.What might have precipitated the drop? A 30-year-old in Seattle earning 250% of the poverty level got a $319 subsidy in 2015 but no subsidy at all this year, boosting the after-subsidy cost of the cheapest bronze plan by 20%.Now Washington's enrollment of just 36% of subsidy-eligible customers is the worst of any state, except two with unusual circumstances. New York just shifted nearly half of the state's exchange members to a public plan, while the collapse of Colorado HealthOP at the end of 2015 left 69,000 exchange customers in the lurch.Meanwhile, in Indiana, subsidies for buying coverage are set to fall in 2017 for a second straight year, largely due to Centene's aggressive silver-plan pricing strategy. Next year's subsidy for a 30-year-old in Indianapolis earning about 250% of the poverty level will fall to $571, down from $627 this year and $1,012 in 2015. Hoosier State enrollment has been falling dramatically, though the state's Medicaid expansion in February 2015 partly explains the drop.The untenable nature of the competition within the exchanges has been underscored in recent weeks by the impending collapse of more nonprofit ObamaCare co-ops after they were hit with big risk-adjustment bills. That ObamaCare program is meant to compensate insurers which attract a relatively high-cost customer base by awarding them a portion of the premiums — sometimes 25% or more — collected by insurers with relatively healthy customers.Molina Healthcare (MOH) has sometimes been cited, along with Centene, as evidence that it's possible for insurers to make money in the exchange business. Yet that status is in doubt after Molina got hit with a $254 million risk-adjustment bill, $40 million more than it allowed for when it reported year-end 2015 earnings. Molina, in a quiet period before earnings, hasn't commented on the charge.
"
163,HUM,"Believe it or not, the text of the law known as ObamaCare demands that companies provide — not just offer — the same health coverage to most rank-and-file, full-time workers as they do to the CEO.So why did Starbucks (SBUX) just announce -- along with wage increases -- that it's going to let its store employees opt for a lower level of insurance and more take-home pay?""The new health care options allow partners to only pay for the coverage they want and will actually use,"" Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz wrote in a letter to employees.One reason Starbucks is making the move is likely because a lot of workers want that option, which might save them $800 a year. Another reason is that, six years after its passage, the IRS has never been able to translate ObamaCare's pie-in-the-sky dictate into a workable regulation and probably never will.No big deal, you might think, if it's truly pie in the sky. Yet beyond the happy talk of everyone getting the same excellent employer health coverage, the reality of ObamaCare's employer rules has been a disaster for modest-wage, full-time workers and their families.According to Kaiser Family Foundation estimates, there were as many as 4.9 million Americans who were uninsured last year but ineligible for subsidies to buy coverage via the ObamaCare exchanges because they — or a spouse — were offered coverage by an employer.This is the predictable result of employer mandate rules that shield companies from potential fines as long as they offer workers ""affordable"" coverage that costs much more than their modest-wage workers are likely to pay: as much as 9.66% of their gross income for a high-deductible bronze-type plan in 2016.Even low-wage employers offering a somewhat better deal haven't found many takers. Insurance take-up by fewer than 10% of low-wage workers at a company is commonplace, the New York Times has reported. Wendy's (WEN) initially expected its health insurance tab to jump by $25,000 per restaurant. But the burger chain cut that to $5,000 before the law got off the ground in 2013 because Wendy's found few interested employees.This year, for a 30-year-old full-time worker earning $10 an hour ($20,800 a year), ObamaCare deems a $2,000 annual premium for a $6,000-deductible employer plan to be affordable. Yet individuals at the same income level who have no offer of employer insurance can get a subsidized bronze exchange plan for $437 per year, according to Kaiser's health subsidy calculator.The rules don't just hurt workers; they also narrow the potential pool of exchange members, leaving a sicker group of customers that has swamped the likes of UnitedHealth (UNH) and Humana (HUM) with losses and forced them to the exits in a number of states.Amid an absence of more sensible rules, ObamaCare has encouraged employers to offer a type of coverage that the law's crafters thought was history: so-called ""skinny"" plans that don't cover hospitalization or surgery but cost little and will allow workers to avoid an individual mandate tax penalty. The plans are reportedly popular in the staffing and accommodation industry and among other low-wage employers. Another new twist to hold down employer costs is health insurance that doesn't cover outpatient surgery.A survey from the National Business Group on Health found that 16% of large employers in 2015 planned to offer workers the choice of skinny coverage or a more comprehensive but much less affordable plan that would keep the companies from having to pay a mandate penalty.The real fear about the ObamaCare employer mandate was that employers would cut workers' hours below 30 per week to dodge the fines for failing to offer suitable coverage. As Goldman Sachs pointed out recently, that's happened to at least a modest extent and partly explains why nearly 2 million more people are stuck working part-time than a decade ago. Yet companies haven't had to resort to cutting workers to part-time status in a major way because they have figured out how to minimize their liability under the law.Labor Department data confirm that ObamaCare's employer mandate has largely struck out when it comes to getting employers in low-wage industries to provide health coverage to their workers.Private service-occupation employers paid even less for employee health benefits in the first quarter of 2016 — just 89 cents per hour of work — than they paid before ObamaCare became law in 2010. That compares with health benefits of $2.71 per hour for workers in production occupations and $3.81 per hour of work for managers and professionals.The accommodation and food service industries still pay just 65 cents per work hour in insurance benefits, up a mere six cents in the past six years. Retailers now pay $1.25 per hour of work on employee insurance benefits, virtually unchanged from $1.24 per hour in early 2010. While Wal-Mart (WMT) said it faced $500 million in extra health benefit costs in 2014 (and responded by eliminating coverage for some part-time workers), other companies whose employment policies don't face such intense scrutiny have had a relatively easy time escaping the law's costs.The reality couldn't be much further from the idealized vision of low-wage workers getting the same coverage as their bosses.A small section of ObamaCare entitled ""Prohibition on Discrimination in Favor of Highly Compensated Individuals"" was supposed to extend rules governing self-funded plans to all employer-sponsored group plans. But benefits experts suggest the self-funded plan rules were fuzzy and often ignored in the past, and the IRS said it would review those rules even as it drew up regulations for fully insured plans.The self-funded plan rules essentially require that health benefit plans offered to top executives be offered on similar terms to 80% of full-time workers over the age of 25. Yet offering isn't enough: At least 70% of eligible workers must take the offer to prove nondiscrimination.

164,HUM,"Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) wiped out an initial boost in the stock market today, trading lower before Monday's close amid continued doubts about whether regulators will approve Aetna's $37 billion takeover of Humana.Monday's initial gains in both stocks came after Bloomberg reported on Saturday that Centene (CNC) and Wellcare Health (WCG) have both bid for some Aetna's Medicare Advantage policies, while others are considering snapping up other parts of Aetna. Aetna in recent weeks moved to put up Medicare Advantage assets for sale to stave off antitrust worries surrounding the Humana deal, Reuters reported.But DOJ officials are skeptical that Aetna asset sales will satisfy their concerns, according to a report by MLX, which covers regulatory issuesAetna rose for much of the day, but fell 0.5% to 116.44, closing just above its 50-day. Aetna is currently carving out a handle in a cup-with-handle base begun more than a year ago.Humana also reversed and skidded 2.6% to 154, hitting its lowest levels since February 2015. That followed a 2.6% loss Friday.Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI) also reversed modestly lower. Regulators also have serious doubts about Anthem's planned Cigna takeover.Humana plunged 9.6% on Thursday, its worst loss in years, while Aetna slid 4% on an MLX report that the Justice Department raised concerns that a potential combination with Aetna would reduce elderly customers' Medicare options. Aetna met with the Justice Department on Friday in attempt to address the agency's concerns.Centene rose 0.9% to 71.60 Monday after briefly topping a 71.63 buy point from a cup-with-handle base that begun last July. Volume was below average.IBD'S TAKE: Centene's below-average move Monday suggests its breakout lacks institutional support. For a top-rated company breaking out in robust volume, check out Ebix. Wellcare Health fell 0.6% to 105.96.Combined, Aetna and Humana provide Medicare Advantage coverage to millions of customers.

165,HUM,"Humana (HUM) shares slid nearly 10% Thursday, its worst one-day loss in years, on reports that the Department of Justice is seriously concerned about the planned $37 billion takeover by Aetna (AET).A report in antitrust trade publication MLex also said a meeting had been set up for the Department of Justice and the companies to discussed the proposed merger. The report noted that investigators are mostly concerned about whether the merger could limit consumer choices for Medicare Advantage health plans for seniors. Bloomberg also reported that Aetna will meet with top DOJ officials Friday.Aetna was prepared to sell several billion dollars of assets to meet regulatory requirements for the merger, Bloomberg last week reported. That report, citing sources close to the situation, said that Aetna had identified assets that it believed would reduce overlap between its operations and those of Humana. Humana is a big player in the growing market for Medicare Advantage insurance, making it an appealing target for Aetna. The development comes amid a consolidation wave in the health insurance industry.Cigna (CI) last year reportedly turned down multiple takeover offers before reaching an agreement with Anthem (ANTM). In recent weeks reports have said regulators are skeptical.Humana revenue growth has slowed over the last three quarters from 12% to 9%, 8% and 0% last quarter.Shares closed down 9.6% at 162.74 in the stock market today, crashing through its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Aetna fell 4%.IBD'S TAKE: Humana's IBD Composite Rating is down to 46, meaning that 54% of all stocks have performed better on key criteria such as earnings and share price performance. See how HUM and AET stack up vs. rivals in IBD Stock Checkup.UnitedHealth (UNH), world's largest health insurer with about $165 billion annual revenue, stands to gain as Aetna-Humana -- and Anthem-Cigna --- negotiations drag out.

But weaker-than-expected Americas comps were an ""anomaly,"" said CEO Howard Schultz. Starbucks rallied Friday to hit three-month highs. Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) turned in mixed results. Shares fell Thursday but rose 2.3% for the week.EBay (EBAY) gapped out of a base, spiking 16% for the week to a record high after reporting Q2 EPS growth of 2% to 43 cents, beating views by a penny. Revenue rose 6% to $2.2 billion, also topping. Top- and bottom-line guidance for Q3 was light, but eBay's full-year projections were strong. Yahoo (YHOO) Q2 EPS missed by a penny but revenue and Q3 revenue guidance easily beat forecasts. Reports say Verizon (VZ) may announce a Yahoo buyout deal within a few days.Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) reported mixed earnings. Intel's $13.5 billion and 59 cents earnings per share ex items for Q2 edged and topped the consensus, respectively. But Intel shares fell from an 18-month high on weaker-than-expected data center sales, though they closed the week down just 1.2%. Qualcomm reported $6 billion in sales and $1.16 EPS ex items for fiscal Q3, beating Wall Street expectations for a respective $5.58 billion and 97 cents. Qualcomm shares rose nearly 12% to a nine-month high. For fiscal Q3, Skyworks reported $751.7 million in sales and $1.24 EPS minus items, both down 7% vs. the year-earlier quarter but narrowly beating consensus expectations. Skyworks slid 8.6% on Friday and 3.8% for the week.After a long review, the Justice Department filed to block the Aetna (AET)-Humana (HUM) and Anthem (ANTM)-Cigna (CI) mergers, saying they would hurt competition and consumers. Shares rose on the news though, as investors had priced in skepticism that the deals would win approval. Meanwhile, Humana raised its EPS guidance and said it will exit many ObamaCare exchange markets next year. UnitedHealth (UNH), the largest managed care firm, topped EPS views and said 2017 profit will improve from exiting nearly all exchanges.United Airlines (UAL) beat Q2 estimates and cut full-year carrying capacity growth, as international uncertainties weighed. The carrier also said it would reduce winter flights to the U.K. Delta Air Lines (DAL) said in the prior week that it would do the same following the nation's Brexit vote. Southwest (LUV) forecast a Q3 unit revenue decline, which would be its first this year. The carrier also missed Q2 estimates, and, like Spirit Airlines (SAVE), indicated that heavy lower-fare competition persists -- good for customers, but bad for airlines' financial results. American Airlines (AAL) reported a Q2 profit drop that wasn't as bad as expected. American also said the Brexit may help, not hurt, global carriers.The Q2 season kicked off with three solid reports from big-cap drugmakers. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) beat estimates and raised guidance, driven by the strength of its pharma division. Novartis (NVS) also beat Q2 estimates, but its stock fell as it warned of rising expenses related to new drug launches, and also said the FDA had rejected its biosimilar version of Amgen (AMGN) drug Neulasta. Biogen (BIIB) rose after its beat and raised, but its CEO George Scangos said he was quitting after six years.J&J stock rose modestly to a fresh high. Novartis advanced slightly, and Biogen jumped nearly 11% as biotech stocks tried to recover.General Motors (GM) reported strong Q2 profit growth, topping estimates. GM revenue surged 11.5%, the fastest pace since 2010, although some industry officials say U.S. auto sales could level off this year. GM stock rose 4.5% for the week.. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU), which reports July 27, is under investigation by the Justice Department for unspecified fraud, according to people familiar with the matter. Ford (F) reports next week. Volkswagen (VLKAY) is mulling building an electric vehicles plant either at its Chattanooga, Tenn., site or in Mexico.General Electric (GE) reported a 65% EPS gain for Q2, much better than expected, but industrial orders fell 16%, and core organic revenue fell too. Honeywell (HON), another diversified industrial giant, topped EPS views but missed on sales. Honeywell cut its full-year organic revenue forecast to a small drop. GE and Honeywell shares fell Friday after hitting long-term highs earlier in the week.Lockheed Martin (LMT) raised its full-year outlook after reporting Q2 results above analyst estimates, but management warned it can't sustain its current level of F-35 spending unless the defense giant gets another production contract from the Pentagon soon. The attempted coup in Turkey isn't expected to weigh on the fighter's sales or production. Textron (TXT), maker of Cessna planes and Bell helicopters, reported a 10% jump in EPS, beating analyst expectations and revenue that climbed 8.1%, also above Wall Street views. It sees full-year EPS of $2.60 to $2.80. The midpoint is under analyst estimates for $2.72.Lockheed stock hit a record high during the week, closing the week up 0.1%. Textron rose 2.8%.

167,HUM,"Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, the biggest player in the state with 103,000 individual market customers, is the latest insurer to pull back from the state's ObamaCare exchange after piling up $500 million in losses.The hit to Minnesotans buying coverage on and off the exchange is just the latest in a series problems for what ranks as among the least-stable markets in the nation. In 2014, the dominant insurer in the marketplace, PreferredOne, dropped out of the exchange. For 2016, Blue Cross and Blue Shield hiked premiums by 49%.To top it off, marketplace demographics went from bad to nearly the worst in the nation as the relatively young and healthy shunned exchange coverage. As of April, just 20% of 2016 enrollees were in the 18-to-34 age group, down from 25% in 2015. Meanwhile, those 55 and over made up more than 38% of enrollees, up from 31% a year ago. Only West Virginia has an older tilt.Minnesota is far from the only state to see insurers leave or premiums spike. UnitedHealth (UNH)has said it will exit almost all of the 34 state exchanges where it is doing business this year. Humana (HUM) also has dropped out of multiple exchanges. Yet a close look at the Gopher State's plight provides an especially useful window on the failings at the heart of ObamaCare because the state recognized many of those problems at the outset.Starting with its launch in 2014, Minnesota's exchange was one of a kind: The state was alone in embracing ObamaCare's pseudo-public option, the Basic Health Plan. The BHP allows states to create a separate government managed care program for subsidy-eligible households earning up to 200% of the poverty level ($23,340 for a single this year).Why adopt such a program instead of just letting those low-income individuals and families buy an exchange plan? Minnesota recognized what some have labeled ObamaCare's ""bronze plan trap.""Silver-level coverage is really quite good for low-income purchasers, because it comes not only with generous premium subsidies, but also with cost-sharing subsidies that dramatically shrink deductibles and lower the ceiling on out-of-pocket costs. The problem is that many financially strapped households earning up to 200% of poverty are hard-pressed to pitch in up to 6.4% of their income on silver premiums. That leaves two lousy options: either buy a less-expensive bronze plan with a $6,000-plus per-person deductible — more than one-fourth of earned income — or go uninsured and face a fine.The harsh reality of the ObamaCare exchanges recognized by Minnesota — as well as New York, which launched its Basic Health Plan this year — is that they fail a high percentage of low-income individuals who could sorely use some help. That group includes low-income full-time workers who, along with their spouses, are ineligible for exchange subsidies if their employer offers coverage that qualifies as ""affordable"" under ObamaCare even if it is nothing of the kind.The Basic Health Plan fixes ObamaCare for some low-income households, those up to 200% of the poverty level who are eligible for subsidies. But it throws modest-income households under the bus and making things even worse for the middle class.Minnesota and New York are giving a great deal to the lowest-income group. Those up to 200% of the poverty level in New York get zero-deductible plans for up to $20 per month. Coverage via MinnesotaCare, carries a $3 monthly deductible. But that creates a bigger subsidy cliff to fall off for those who earn just above 200% of the poverty level. As one ObamaCare navigator helping Minnesotans to select the most appropriate plan wrote in an op-ed, ""a pay raise costs too much"" under the law. ObamaCare ""forces some people to make hard choices about how much more money they can really afford to earn,"" she wrote.For relatively young households with income modestly above 200% of the poverty level, MNsure really doesn't have any affordable options. The cheapest bronze plan in Minneapolis costs about $950 for 30-year-olds earning $24,000 and carries a $6,450 deductible. The cheapest silver plan for these modest earners costs almost $1,500, likely far more than most healthy individuals at this income level can rationalize spending for a plan with a $1,700 deductible and maximum of $5,000 in out-of-pocket costs for accessing medical services.Minnesota's effort to save low-income households from the bronze-plan trap is a big negative for middle-class households who qualify for little or no subsidy to buy coverage. The problem is that MinnesotaCare covers a lot of relatively young and healthy individuals, limiting the exchanges to a narrow, relatively high-cost slice of the population. While all states are facing this problem to some extent because of ObamaCare's affordability issues and the exclusion of low-wage full-time workers, it's even worse in Minnesota because it separates out another potential group of low-income enrollees.To its credit, Minnesota realizes the bad deal that modest-income households are getting, so it wants to expand its managed-care plan up to 275% of the poverty level via a waiver. Doing so will further narrow the exchange pool and likely send rates still higher. Further, improving coverage for this next income tier will, of course, cost the state more, so it's much more of a wealthy blue-state strategy than something that can be replicated around the country.One more problem with Minnesota's — and New York's — Basic Health Program: A federal judge recently ruled that the cost-sharing subsidies which help finance the program were illegally appropriated by the Obama administration, siding with House Republicans. Thus, this very flawed strategy for overcoming some of ObamaCare's serious failings remains in legal limbo.

168,HUM,"Top brass from Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX), Smith & Wesson (SWHC), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Anthem (ANTM) were among those involved in notable insider trades disclosed this week.Jan Koum, a director of the social-media giant and co-founder of WhatsApp, has sold 1.72 million shares worth $203 million. Chief Product Officer Chris Cox has sold 15,600 shares valued at $1.8 million.Facebook also reports second-quarter results on July 27.Shares ended the week down 0.3% and are making their way through a flat base.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook shares are trading near this buy point and could take that key level in the coming weeks with the company's earnings report likely a catalyst.Director Richard Barton has sold 1,400 company shares. The online video streaming company continues to earn critical acclaim for its original shows.On Thursday, Netflix received 54 Emmy nominations, with shows like ""House of Cards"" and ""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"" getting nods.But its subscriber growth has slowed recently, and the key metric will be under scrutiny when Netflix reports Q2 results on Monday.Shares were up 1.4% for the week.Director John Furman has sold 19,679 company shares. Shares of Smith & Wesson rose 4.7% last week in the wake of three separate shootings. In the first two, police shot two black men -- Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, La., and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minn. In the third, a sniper killed five police officers in Dallas at a demonstration against those shootings.Shares ended the week down 2.5%, as they work on the right side of a cup base.Directors Daniel Rosensweig and Edward Barnholt disclosed the sales of 19,300 shares and 25,000 shares, respectively.Earlier this week, Adobe rival Shutterstock (SSTK) announced an image-licensing deal that will give Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google access to Shutterstock's library of photos, illustrations and videos for digital and mobile ads.Adobe was up 1.1% for the week.Joseph Swedish, CEO of the health-insurance giant, disclosed the sale of 8,171 company shares. Anthem holds its second-quarter earnings conference call on July 27.Shares finished the week up 1.6% but have been under pressure lately amid reports of growing concern from regulators over its takeover of Cigna (CI) as well as the Aetna (AET)-Humana (HUM) merger.Insider transactions don't typically have a major impact on a stock or indicate major pending news. Rapid liquidation of all or most of an insider's holdings, however, can affect a stock.

169,HUM,"Federal regulators have expressed concerns about the Anthem (ANTM)-Cigna (CI) merger and could scuttle the $48 billion deal, according to reports. But so far, investors, while taking notice, aren't panicking.The merger would bring the number of health insurance giants in the U.S. down to three -- UnitedHealth (UNH), Anthem and Aetna (AET) -- including Aetna's pending acquisition of Humana (HUM).Anthem and Cigna management met with Justice Department officials and representatives of more than a dozen state attorneys general earlier this month, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited sources close to the situation.The government regulators expressed concern that the companies wouldn't be able to provide enough concessions to preserve competition in the health insurance sector. The companies outlined plans to make changes they hoped would be sufficient to ease those concerns, the report said.In addition, California's insurance commissioner last week in a letter to the Justice Department expressed doubts about the merger, Bloomberg reported, saying it would seriously hurt competition in the nation's most populous state.If the deal goes through, the merged company would have 40% to 50%-plus market share in California for a multitude of services in many counties. Anthem on May 26 announced that it had received approval from Indiana for the planned purchase, the 10th state to OK the deal.Combining the two insurers would create a company with annual sales of more than $118 billion a year. UnitedHealth has annual sales of about $132 billion.Anthem shares were up 0.3% to 132.72 on the stock market today. It has consolidating for more than eight months with a buy point of 173.69 and was trading below both its 10-week average and its 200-day line Monday. Cigna was down 1.3% to 127.94.Anthem, which operates Blue Shield Blue Shield plans and has annual sales of about $61 billion, proposed the deal nearly 11 months ago, on July 23, 2015.That same month, Aetna agreed to buy Humana for $35 billion. Aetna management said earlier this year that it expects that merger to close by end of 2016.Aetna shares climbed 1% to 122.34. Humana was up 1.5% to 189.90. UnitedHealth shares were up 0.6% to 138.55.

170,HUM,"Health Care: A new study shows that the average increase for low-cost ObamaCare plans in 2017 will be 11% — which is twice the rate from last year. Will the “rate shocks are a myth” crowd finally admit it's wrong?The latest annual report on ObamaCare rates from the Kaiser Family Foundation looks at premium increases for the lowest-cost Silver plan in 14 cities. What it found is that the weighted average premium increase will be 11% for these plans.Premiums for these plans will go down in just two markets -- Providence and Indianapolis -- but up as much as 26% in Portland.  Kaiser also found that premiums for the second-cheapest Silver plan in these markets will climb an average 10%.These rate spikes are especially important because Silver plans are the ones most people enroll in.Kaiser also found that the average number of insurers in these markets will have dropped from 6.4 in 2015 to 5.5 next year.Less competition and higher premiums are the exact opposite of what ObamaCare backers promised.The Kaiser report is just a sampling, but there is plenty of other evidence that the pain of higher premiums and fewer choices will be felt across the country when people go to sign up for insurance this fall.IBD’s Jed Graham found that major insurers offering ObamaCare plans in 30 states have put in for average rate hikes of 25%. Humana (HUM), for example, is seeking premium hikes of more than 38%, with UnitedHealth  (UNH) at 25% and Anthem (ANTM) 21%.The average weighted rate hike tops 56% in Tennessee. In Oklahoma it's 53%, and Iowa 32%.These are increases that, before ObamaCare, were cited as a reason for ObamaCare. Now, Obama and company dismiss these magnificent hikes as no big deal.First, backers say, people can choose a different insurer and possibly keep rates down. Except that doing so can be highly disruptive, since plan switchers will often end up facing a much higher deductible, and might have to switch doctors as well. In other words, they will not only have to drop a plan they like, but doctors they like, too.Plus, competition in the exchanges is dwindling. People living in three states -- Alaska, Alabama and Wyoming -- as well as those in hundreds of counties across the U.S. will have only one insurance company from which to ""choose."" More than half the counties will have two at most.Next, ObamaCare backers say, higher rates don’t matter because most people buying in the ObamaCare exchange are getting generous subsidies so they won’t feel much of the sting of these rate hikes.Except, as industry analyst Robert Laszewski points out, “half of the individual market does not get a subsidy,” which means half the market will face the full brunt of these rate hikes. And, since the subsidies phase out as income goes up, there will be plenty of middle income families stuck with huge premium increases they can't afford.Finally, ObamaCare supporters say that big rate hikes are to be expected in the short term, as insurers figure the market out. But fear not, sometime down the road premiums will stabilize and all will be well.That’s a bit like reassuring passengers on the Titanic that the sinking will stabilize once the ship takes on enough water.ObamaCare's government-created insurance markets aren't stabilizing. They are getting worse. No matter who the next president is, he or she is going to have to deal with this mess. Follow IBD Editorials on Twitter: @IBDeditorials.

171,HUM,"ObamaCare's employer mandate has largely struck out when it comes to getting employers in low-wage industries to provide health coverage to their workers, new Labor Department data confirm.Private service-occupation employers paid even less for employee health benefits in the first quarter of 2016 -- just 89 cents per hour of work -- than they paid before ObamaCare became law in 2010. That compares to health benefits of $2.71 per hour for workers in production occupations and $3.81 per hour of work for managers and professionals.The data help shed light on one of ObamaCare's harshest, though little-discussed, realities: The law has thrown millions of low-wage, full-time workers under the bus.Full-time workers are ineligible for exchange subsidies if their employers offer ""affordable"" coverage that costs much more than their modest-wage workers are likely to pay. The rules don't just hurt workers; they also narrow the potential pool of exchange members, leaving a sicker group of customers that has swamped the likes of UnitedHealth (UNH) and Humana (HUM) with losses and forced them to the exits in a number of states.The accommodation and food service industries still pay just 65 cents per work hour in insurance benefits, up a mere six cents in the past six years. Wendy's (WEN) initially expected its health insurance tab to jump by $25,000 per restaurant, but cut that to $5,000 before the law got off the ground in 2013 because the fast-food chain found few interested employees.Retailers now pay $1.25 per hour of work on employee insurance benefits, virtually unchanged from $1.24 per hour in early 2010. While Wal-Mart (WMT) said it faced $500 million in extra health benefit costs in 2014 (and responded by eliminating coverage for some part-time workers), other companies whose employment policies don't face such intense scrutiny have had a relatively easy time escaping the law's costs.The real fear about the ObamaCare employer mandate was that employers would cut workers' hours below 30 per week to dodge the fines for failing to offer suitable coverage. As Goldman Sachs pointed out this week, that's happened to at least a modest extent and partly explains why 2 million more people are stuck working part-time than a decade ago.Still, companies haven't had to resort to cutting workers to part-time in a major way because employers have figured out how to minimize their liability under the law. The New York Times reported that insurance takeup by fewer than 10% of low-wage workers is commonplace. While some may call it gaming the system, ObamaCare rules have invited such strategies despite their serious consequences. A few million full-time, modest-wage workers -- and their spouses -- have remained uninsured, with many liable for ObamaCare individual mandate penalties. Another roughly 1 million low-wage workers have opted for the kind of coverage that ObamaCare was supposed to do away with: skinny plans that won't cover hospitalization or surgery but will let them avoid paying an individual mandate penalty.Many other full-time, modest-wage workers are getting more comprehensive coverage via their employers -- but with $5,000-plus deductibles that could easily torpedo their finances in a health emergency.These are the direct effects of rules that deny full-time workers access to ObamaCare subsidies and let employers escape a fine -- if they offer bronze-level coverage costing a worker close to 10% of wage income for premiums alone. For a full-time worker earning $17,500, paying $1,690 for bronze coverage qualifies as ""affordable."" That's $1,000 more than someone at the same income level would have to pay for an exchange plan that caps total out-of-pocket expenses at about $550 in 2016.The fact that low-wage industries are relying more on part-time workers, who get almost nothing in health benefits, is one reason that their health insurance compensation costs per work hour have stayed roughly flat. Still, it's becoming increasingly clear that ObamaCare is of basically no help to low-wage full-time workers, and it is an outright negative in cases where those workers owe a fine for going uninsured.This is not at all how Democrats envisioned the future when the law passed. In fact, ObamaCare includes a provision that requires companies to provide the same coverage to rank-and-file workers as they do to the CEO. More than six years later, the IRS has yet to translate that pie-in-the-sky goal as a workable regulation.
"
172,HUM,"Insurers covering more than half the U.S. are seeking average premium hikes of 25% for 2017 for ObamaCare policies sold on and off the public exchanges.Although the requests are preliminary and filings for 20 more states are still due, there's now little doubt that individual market premiums are set for a shockingly large jump next year.An IBD analysis of rate hikes proposed by individual insurers finds a wide divergence, from an average 10.0% hike per customer requested by Centene (CNC) on the low end to the 38.1% increase sought by Humana (HUM). Among other participants, Molina Healthcare (MOH) is seeking an average 10.4% hike, Cigna (CI) 16.5%, Aetna (AET) 19.6%, Anthem (ANTM) 21.3% and UnitedHealth (UNH) 24.9% in the few markets it's not planning to exit.The data, though incomplete, suggest potential for big increases in market share by Centene and Molina, two Medicaid managed care companies that have quickly grown an individual market presence in the ObamaCare era, even as heavyweights like UnitedHealth and Blue Cross Blue Shield plans have been swamped ObamaCare exchange losses.Among states, Tennessee tops the list with a weighted average 56.4% premium hike requested by insurers. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee is asking for a 62% hike after requesting -- and receiving approval for -- a 36% rate hike in 2016.So far, insurers in 9 additional states are seeking average hikes of at least 25%, including Arizona (53.1%), Oklahoma (51.0%), Kansas (35.3%), Texas (35.1%), Nebraska (35.0%), Iowa (32.0%), Delaware (30.5%), Oregon (27.5%) and Louisiana (26.8%), according to ObamaCare enrollment tracker ACASignups.net.Big premium hikes threaten to stall growth of the ObamaCare exchanges by driving away healthy members, particularly those who don't get subsidies, making the relatively costly customer base even more so. Indeed, some insurers are pricing such adverse selection into their 2017 rates.Providence Health of Oregon, which saw a threefold jump in customers in 2016, said 5 percentage points of its proposed 29.6% hike reflects its expectation that 2017 customers will be in poorer average health. That’s in part because Providence said it mistakenly expected the risk pool would be healthier in 2016 than in 2015 with the ramping up of the individual mandate penalty. On top of that, Providence says, back-to-back years of big premium hikes will likely drive a portion of unsubsidized customers out of the market -- especially relatively healthy customers.The proposed increases also reflect the trend growth rate of medical costs as well as the end of ObamaCare's temporary reinsurance program that has helped offset the cost of insurers' most expensive customers. Yet 2017 premium hikes might be a couple of percentage points higher if not for a deal in Congress that shelved ObamaCare's health insurance tax for 2017, saving about $12 billion for the insurance industry, which passes such costs directly to customers.Last year, insurers requested premium hikes averaging about 14% for 2016. The Obama administration subsequently said that the actual rate hike experienced by customers, including millions of people who shopped for a cheaper plan, was only about 8%. IBD explained why that analysis from the Department of Health and Human Services understated actual rate hikes, primarily because people were buying less coverage for their money.The costlier reality experienced by ObamaCare customers is underscored by a new Kaiser Family Foundation survey. As Brian Blase, senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center noted, ""Individuals who switched plans are twice as likely to feel less financially protected with their new plan than more financially protected.""By Monday's close in the stock market today, Centene ended trading off 0.9% to 67.30. Humana fell 1.1% to 184.69, Molina dropped 0.5% to 50.49 and Cigna skidded by 1.2% to 126.50. Among the larger players, Aetna lost 1.1% to 119.18, Anthem gave back 0.6% to 130.68 and UnitedHealth was down 0.8% to 138.09.

173,HUM,"Shares of Aetna (AET) spiked nearly 4% to a nine-month high in the stock market today after the health insurance giant said it plans to issue some $13 billion in bonds to help pay for its purchase of Humana (HUM). Meanwhile, rival UnitedHealth (UNH) touched a new high.Aetna's big planned debt issuance is a sign that it expects to be able to close its Humana deal ultimately, despite tough regulatory scrutiny. Aetna in July said it would buy Humana for $37 billion, amid a wave of consolidation in the health care industry spurred in part by the Affordable Care Act.Aetna rose 4.1% to 120.03 on the stock market today. Aetna continues to climb out of a consolidation begun a year ago. But the midpoint of the handle is slightly below the midpoint of the base -- making the formation less than ideal for buying. The stock may form another, proper entry point as it builds the right side of its base.Humana followed Aetna's lead Wednesday, jumping 5.6%.UnitedHealth (UNH), the nation's largest health insurer, broke out of a five-week flat base above a prior base, rising 1.1% to 136.04. It hit a record 136.15 intraday.How healthy is UnitedHealth stock, and how does it compare to rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupUnitedHealth last month said it would pull out of most Affordable Care Act exchanges next year after struggling, like others, to find profitability in the marketplaces. However, exchange enrollment has comprised a small portion of the UnitedHealth's overall business.Managed care and several other medical groups rallied Thursday. Medical stocks often do well in markets that are choppy or grinding higher because they offer growth that is largely insulated from economic swings.
"
174,HUM,"Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, facing massive losses for its ObamaCare plans, has requested a 58% premium hike for 603,000 customers.The company is pricing in the claims experience of customers that's been far higher than expected after suffering a $770 million loss on its exchange plans in 2015, equal to 26% of premiums.Overall, individual market insurers requested a 35% ObamaCare premium hike for about 1.3 million customers, calculated ACASignups.net, based on the full range of insurer filings available.BCBS of Texas also is seeking an 18% increase for 353,000 members who buy plans via the small group market that caters to businesses with fewer than 50 employees.BCBS of Texas individual market customers will likely have far less expensive options to choose, though not necessarily with the same network of providers. Molina Healthcare (MOH), which this year offers the two least-expensive silver plans in Houston, has requested an average 9.6% hike for its 134,000 exchange customers in the state. Molina said its financial experience ""has met or exceeded expectations.""Yet there's an obvious risk that lower-priced insurers will dramatically underprice their coverage since the huge, costly customer base of BCBS of Texas may be looking for cheaper options. Even though higher subsidies may offset much of the premium hike for those who qualify, the subsidies are set based on the cost of the second-cheapest silver plan in each market. That means even subsidized BCBS customers will face huge premium hikes of 40% or more.Meanwhile, Aetna (AET) is seeking a 15.2% rate hike for 84,000 Texas customers with ObamaCare plans. Centene (CNC) wants a 15.5% rate hike for 47,000 members of its Ambetter ObamaCare plans. Humana (HUM), as in Pennsylvania and Michigan, has requested a rate hike of more than 40%, but has few individual market members in Texas.Insurers in other big states also are requesting major rate hikes, suggesting that the average national rate hike for ObamaCare plans in 2017 may fall closer to 20% than 10%. Insurers in Florida recently requested a 17.7% rate hike, while Pennsylvania market participants are seeking a 24% increase.
"
175,HUM,"Mostly bad news continues to roll in on ObamaCare premium hikes requested for 2017, with the latest out of Pennsylvania, where insurers are seeking rate increases of 24% for 500,000 individual market customers.That follows recent news from Florida's Office of Insurance Regulation that insurers are seeking an average 17.7% rate increase for exchange plans in the Sunshine State.In Virginia, which Hillary Clinton hopes to keep in the Democratic column, insurers proposed an average 18% ObamaCare premium hike last month.Customers will get their first peek at their 2017 premiums in the weeks before the voters go to the polls in November, which could deliver uncomfortable headlines for Democrats in presidential swing states if the election is competitive in the fall. While the vast majority of plan shoppers qualify for subsidies that will limit the increase in after-subsidy premiums, many also may be on the hook for higher deductibles.""Based on 2016 membership, claims experience for this market has been worse than anticipated,"" Aetna (AET) said in requesting a 17.2% rate hike for its 47,000 members in Pennsylvania with ObamaCare plans sold on and off the exchange.Highmark is seeking an average 41.4% rate hike for 60,000 members after losing more than $300 million on its individual market business in 2015.In Florida, Aetna's Coventry Health Care unit is seeking 17% rate hikes for about 200,000 customers. Humana (HUM), which will merge with Aetna if regulators approve, has requested a 43.6% rate hike for its nearly 100,000 individual market customers in the state.Molina (MOH) has proposed an average 11.3% rate hike for 250,000 members in Florida.Centene (CNC), which has requested just a 4.6% hike for its Ambetter plans in Florida, looks likely to further separate itself as the low-cost insurer on the exchange in Florida, as well as other states where it is competing. Yet Centene stands out in another way too: sky-high deductibles for silver plans that will rise to $7,050 in 2017.While Donald Trump has vowed to replace ObamaCare with an ill-defined alternative, Hillary Clinton is proposing to provide bigger subsidies to take the sting out of premiums and drug spending.A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation out last week found that 45% of people with ObamaCare individual market coverage see their plans as a good value, down from 55% in 2014. As premiums and deductibles continue rising, that number is likely to keep shrinking, even though the survey doesn't reflect the sentiments of people who turned down the coverage after window shopping or selected a plan and never paid.
"
176,HUM,"The Obama administration violated the constitution by funding ObamaCare subsidies without an appropriation, a federal judge ruled on Thursday.The subsidies at issue provide cost-sharing support that cut ObamaCare's high deductibles for households earning up to 250% of the poverty level. While the 2010 health law clearly makes an appropriation for premium subsidies, there's no such appropriation for cost-sharing subsidies.The White House initially requested an appropriation from Congress for the cost-sharing subsidies, which are expected to cost $130 billion over the coming decade. But when the House showed no sign of complying, Obama administration officials asserted the authority to pay out the subsidies anyway, saying the two sets of subsidies were inextricably linked.""The question is whether (the cost-sharing subsidies) can nonetheless be funded through the same, permanent appropriation (as the premium subsidies). It cannot,"" U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer wrote.Her ruling orders an immediate end to the subsidies, which are critical to making ObamaCare exchange coverage viable for low-income individuals and families. Yet Collyer stayed her order pending a certain appeal.With insurers in the process of setting premium rates for 2017, the ruling will create uncertainty about how the exchanges will operate next year.Already UnitedHealth (UNH) has said it will exit most exchanges, while Humana (HUM) is leaving some and planning big premium hikes in others. UnitedHealth fell 0.7% to 129.74 while Humana dropped 2.5% to 165.81 in the stock market today.  Among other major insurers, Anthem (ANTM) lost 2.5% to 136.08, Aetna (AET) fell 3.3% to 108.60 and Cigna (CI) dropped 1.9%.The effect of ending the subsidies is complicated by the fact that the law requires insurers to provide the cost-sharing support. Really the only way they'll be able to do so without losing money is to raise premiums to offset their extra costs, but that would only exacerbate ObamaCare's current difficulties by driving relatively healthy customers away.Even legal experts sympathetic to ObamaCare had said that appropriations law is straightforward and that President Obama broke the law. The only hope for the White House was that the judge would rule that the House lacked standing to sue. That was a real question because such a grant of standing was unprecedented. While the Obama administration argued that the House couldn't sue over questions of how a law is interpreted, Judge Collyer saw the question as a constitutional issue, not a statutory dispute.Uncertainty over the lawsuit's eventual outcome is heightened by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia and his eventual replacement, which could tilt the court in either direction. It's probably unsafe to assume that a more liberal court will side with the Obama administration. If there was ever a case in which the power of the purse was jeopardized, this was it. Not only did the White House assert the authority to spend money without an appropriation of Congress, but it determined to do so on a permanent basis.
"
177,HUM,"Humana (HUM) wasn't kidding when it hinted last week of big premium hikes for 2017 in those ObamaCare markets where it remains.This year, the nation's fifth-largest insurer offers the cheapest bronze and silver plans in Michigan's largest market, including Detroit. But Humana has filed for a 50% premium hike for its low-cost silver plan.The unsubsidized cost for a 40-year-old will jump from $210 a month to $315, if approved. On top of that, the maximum out-of-pocket cost for plan members will rise 9%, to $7,150 from $6,300 in 2016.Meanwhile, Humana wants a 38% premium increase for its lowest-cost bronze plan, from $178 a month to $246.Rate requests for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, an important player in the state, aren't yet available. But Humana isn't the only exchange participant eyeing massive premium hikes. Health Alliance Plan, a subsidiary of the Henry Ford Health System, has requested 30% premium hikes for its least expensive bronze and silver plans.But one carrier, so far, stands out as an exception. Molina Healthcare (MOH), is seeking just a 2% premium hike for its lowest cost bronze and silver plans. Even so, Molina's requested premium for its lowest-cost silver plan is 11% higher than Humana's this year, $234 per month vs. $210 for a 40-year-old. Also, while keeping its bronze premium hike to a minimum, Molina is boosting its deductible by one-third, to $6,650 from $5,000.Still, it appears that Molina, which was already one of the lowest-priced insurers in the state, may have an opportunity to grow by leaps and bounds in Michigan.Molina and Centene (CNC), another Medicaid managed care provider that established an individual market presence with the launch of ObamaCare, have seen exchange enrollment surge. Molina said its ObamaCare exchange membership more than doubled to 630,000 in the first quarter from 266,000 a year ago. But Molina's management said on its first-quarter earnings call that the customer growth was far more than it expected and acknowledged being overwhelmed by customer gains from Medicaid, exchanges and acquisitions. Earnings slipped to 43 cents per share from 56 cents a year ago.Molina seemed to indicate that its higher-than-expected costs stemmed from Medicaid enrollees, saying that the company expects 2016 exchange customers will tend toward the healthy side based on demographics that are similar to 2015 customers. Still, the recent slip-up and the huge premium hikes being sought by rivals raise a question of whether Molina has a secret sauce that's letting it deliver care much more efficiently or whether it risks getting swamped by unexpectedly high costs.Another unknown for Molina is how it will be impacted by ObamaCare's evolving risk-adjustment program. That program is supposed to balance risk among all insurers by transferring funds from carriers which attract low-cost customers to those that are a magnet for the sick. Risk adjustment hasn't worked as intended for a variety of reasons, including the failure to consider customer use of prescription drugs in weighing an insurer’s risk, but there seems to be growing recognition that the deck has been stacked against insurers like UnitedHealth (UNH) and nonprofit Blue Cross Blue Shield, with plans which have attracted sicker customers.UnitedHealth has said it will exit all but a handful of state exchanges for 2017. Humana, which is aiming to close its merger with Aetna (AET) in the second half of 2016, has already declared its intention to pull out of the exchanges in Alabama, Wisconsin, Virginia and Kansas.So far only Oregon, where insurers are requesting an average 27% premium hike, and Virginia, where insurers want an 18% hike, are the only two states to make all rate filings available. 
"
178,HUM,"Oregon's largest individual market insurer has filed for an average 29.6% rate hike for 2017 policies sold on and off the ObamaCare exchange.Providence Health, which saw enrollment nearly quadruple in 2016 to 100,900, grabbing 40% of the market, blamed the increase partly on next year's phase-out of ObamaCare's temporary reinsurance program, which covers some of the bills of the costliest patients.But Providence also is pricing in a 5-percentage-point hike because it expects 2017 customers to be in poorer average health. That's in part because Providence said it mistakenly expected the risk pool would be healthier in 2016 than in 2015 with the ramping up of the individual mandate penalty. On top of that, Providence says, back-to-back years of big premium hikes will likely drive a portion of unsubsidized customers out of the market — especially relatively healthy customers.Moda Health, Oregon's second-biggest individual market carrier even after losing one-third of its customers following a big premium hike this year, has proposed a 32.3% premium hike for its 62,600 customers.Premera Blue Cross, the fourth-place insurer through its LifeWise Health Plan, has said it's bailing out of Oregon amid financial losses.Overall, Oregon insurers are seeking an average 27% premium hike, as calculated by ObamaCare enrollment tracker ACASignups.net, weighted based on 2016 enrollment.Oregon is just the second state to make public initial rate requests filed by all insurers for 2017. Participants in Virginia's market are seeking an average 17.9% hike, including a 15.8% increase requested by Anthem (ANTM) for its 180,000 members in ObamaCare-compliant plans.In New Hampshire, Minuteman Health, the lowest-cost and second-largest exchange participant, has requested a 45.2% premium hike.Meanwhile, Humana (HUM) offered a somewhat bleak take on its ObamaCare experience in 2016 in its first-quarter earnings report, saying it may exit a number of states. UnitedHealth (UNH) recently said it would exit all but a ""handful"" of ObamaCare exchanges.Humana, which is aiming to finalize its merger with Aetna (AET) in the second half of the year, said its renewing customers ""were higher utilizers (of medical services and prescriptions) than those terminating coverage.""In addition, new customers signing up for Humana's off-exchange plans had higher hospital admission rates than renewing customers. Off-exchange plans are the same as those sold on the exchanges, but enrollees can't qualify for the exchange subsidies available to those with income up to 400% of the poverty level.Humana said it will try to make changes to retain a viable product, where feasible, but that's likely to mean ""certain statewide market and product exits both on and off exchange, service area reductions and pricing commensurate with anticipated levels of risk by state.""The company has 554,300 ObamaCare exchange customers and an additional 208,700 in the same plans bought off the exchanges. The total is down by about 180,000 from a year ago, in part because Humana discontinued plans serving 100,000 people due to unexpectedly high costs.Humana, Aetna and UnitedHealth shares fell less than 1% in afternoon trade on the stock market today. Anthem lost 2.3%.

179,HUM,"Walt Disney (DIS), Macy's (M), Gap (GPS), Kohl's (KSS), Fossil (FOSL) and others reported weak earnings or guidance, triggering a broad sell-off in retail and other consumer stocks -- but not for shares of Amazon (AMZN). Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) tumbled to a two-year low amid fresh evidence that iPhone demand remains weak. The major indexes ultimately closed modestly lower, with the S&P 500 and Dow industrials falling below key support.The major averages fell for a third straight week, with most or all of the losses coming Friday. The Dow fell 1.2% and the S&P 500 0.5%, both closing below their 50-day moving averages for the first time since Feb. 29. The Nasdaq, already below that key line, retreated 0.4%. The market uptrend remains under pressure. Retail and consumer groups were big losers after a raft of weak earnings reports and guidance from the likes of Walt Disney and Macy's. Oil prices rose to six-month highs during the week.Retail sales rose 1.3% in April, their best gain in more than a year. But that couldn't shake the gloom surrounding retail and consumer stocks.Macy's, Kohl's, Nordstrom (JWN), JCPenney (JCP) and Dillard's (DDS) tumbled on dismal first-quarter reports and/or guidance. Macy's and upscale Nordstrom slashed outlooks after sharp EPS declines. Kohl's posted a same-store sales drop that was the worst ""since the height of the Great Recession,"" according to Retail Metrics.Macy's stock fell 17% to a four-year low, and Kohl's fell nearly 14%, setting to its seven-year worst. Nordstrom, JCPenney and Dillard's lost 18.5%, 8% and 11%, respectively.Meanwhile, watchmaker and seller Fossil collapsed 31% after missing Q1 views and slashing guidance. Fossil hinted at competition from the Apple Watch and other wearables. Gap said Q1 same-store sales sank 5%, with April comps down 7% ahead of its full Q1 results on May 19. Its shares plunged nearly 19% to the worst since late 2011.Wal-Mart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), Ross Stores (ROST) also continue the flood of retail earnings next week.The media conglomerate delivered its first earnings miss in five years as per-share profit grew 11% to $1.36 and revenue grew 4% to $12.97 billion, short of consensus. ESPN lost subscribers once again, but the media networks segment didn't appear to disappoint Wall Street too badly. Studio revenue shot up 22% on ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" and ""Zootopia"" fanfare. ""Captain America: Civil War"" should keep movie box office receipts high in Q2.Disney shares tumbled 4.8% to 100.52, falling out of a cup-with-handle base and well out of buy range. Disney closed just above its 50-day line.Apple stock fell last week amid new evidence that Apple suppliers are seeing weak orders for the upcoming iPhone 7. That suggests Apple's sales woes may continue for quite some time. Separately, Apple will invest $1 billion in Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing service and app. Apple stock fell 2.4% to its lowest level since June 2014 and lost its market cap crown, barely, to Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).Amazon intensified its rivalry with Alphabet’s Google by launching a new video streaming service comparable to YouTube. Sanford Bernstein analyst Carlos Kirjner on Tuesday raised his price target on Amazon to a whopping 1,000.Wal-Mart (WMT) announced its subscription service would offer two-day free delivery vs. three days before. But, as brick-and-mortar retailers struggle, Amazon rose 5.3% to 709.92, with investors betting its share of consumer spending will keep expanding.Facebook released guidelines revealing that the social media giant relies far more on people for its ""trending"" news topics, contradicting earlier company claims that they were largely driven by computer algorithms. Earlier, Gizmodo suggested that Facebook was suppressing news stories from conservative media outlets. Facebook strongly denied the allegation, saying it has “rigorous guidelines in place” for its review team, seeking to ensure consistency and neutrality.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he would meet with conservatives to discuss Facebook's policies.Facebook stock rose 0.3% to 119.81 for the week, extending a recent breakout but still in buy range.Staples (SPLS) and Office Depot (ODP) called off their proposed merger late Tuesday after a federal judge agreed with the Federal Trade Commission that the deal would have limited office supply competition with big corporate customers. Staples crashed 19%, and Office Depot dropped 40%. The Obama administration has blocked several megamergers recently, including that of Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI). Analysts say health insurance consolidation could get a hard look, with Aetna (AET) seeking to buy Humana (HUM), and Anthem (ANTM) set to acquire Cigna (CI).The Treasury Department on Tuesday called for greater oversight of the nascent industry, whose quick, easy online payment and lending solutions threaten to upend traditional banking but have raised questions about safeguards and potential for abuse.That came a day after Lending Club (LC) said CEO Renaud Laplanche was stepping down after the company found misconduct within the online lending platform relating to loan sales and lack of financial oversight. Several large and small banks halted work with Lending Club. Shares shed 51%, hitting a record low.Peer-to-peer lending firm Prosper recently announced a large round of layoffs, and disappointing quarterly results from OnDeck (ONDK) have prompted worries over insufficient loan-volume growth.Online gaming platform NetEase (NTES) more than doubled revenue in Q1, beating estimates, boosted by mobile games such as “Fantasy Westward Journey” and newer releases such as “Kung Fu Panda 3.” EPS also topped. Shares rose 9.3% for the week, moving above the 200-day line.Weibo (WB), a Twitter (TWTR)-like social-media platform majority owned by Sina (SINA), fared well, helped by mobile-user growth, strong ad revenue and expansion beyond major cities. Shares rose 2.1% for the week.Online media company Sina itself also topped Q1 views, with better sales and a narrower net loss than expected. The strong Weibo performance was a key help. But ad revenue from its Web portal segment lagged. Shares lost 11.2%, plunging through the 50-day line but closing just above the 200-day.Online retailer JD.com (JD) reported a Q1 loss in line with expectations. Sales surged but were just below expectations, and Q2 revenue guidance was just shy of analysts’ consensus. Shares tumbled 10.2%.LGI Homes (LGIH) on Tuesday reported a surprisingly strong 73% surge in first-quarter adjusted earnings per share. But the entry-level homebuilder's revenue fell short, and gross profit margins declined. LGI Homes, which briefly flirted with a 29.87 buy point, fell 8.9% to 25.69.Trex (TREX), the world’s largest maker of wood-alternative decking and railing products, topped Q1 views. But Trex guided Q2 revenue below consensus. Shares reversed hard, down 9.6% this week.Gypsum wallboard and related products maker Continental Building Products (CBPX) Q1 profit climbed 173%. Shares rose 7.5%, breaking out of a base to a seven-month high. TopBuild (BLD), which installs building insulation, also bested Wall Street Q1 earnings and revenue estimates. Shares of the July 2015 IPO rose 2.8% after the prior week's breakout.Several housing reports, including housing starts and existing-home sales for April, are on tap for next week.SolarCity (SCTY) torched Wall Street’s Q1 sales views late Monday, but losses swelled, and the No. 1 residential installer cut 2016 installation guidance as bookings fell short after Nevada cut net-metering payments to solar customers.Also Monday, rival Vivint Solar (VSLR) reported a 93% revenue rise that still missed views as losses widened.But No. 2 installer Sunrun (RUN) late Thursday reported a surprise Q1 profit ex items, while revenue nearly doubled.SolarCity fell 10.3% for the week, while Vivint was off nearly 8.9%, hitting record lows. Sunrun was down nearly 12%, even with Friday's 7.5% pop.Israeli giant Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) beat Q1 earnings and sales estimates, but it guided Q2 slightly below consensus. Teva said its $40 billion buyout of the Allergan (AGN) generics business is on track to close in June, despite some earlier delays. Teva stock rose 3 cents to 50.30 for the week.Allergan reported mixed Q1 results -- earnings beat and sales missed -- but the drugmaker said it'll buy $10 billion in stock. Allergan, fresh off a failed takeover by Pfizer (PFE), signaled it'll focus more on improving operations than on making big buyouts in the near future. Shares rose 10.8%.A third generics giant, Perrigo (PRGO), hit a four-year low after its Q1 report on Thursday, though since it issued guidance last month there were few surprises. Perrigo fell 4.4% for the week, working on its fifth straight weekly loss.Smaller player Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) missed estimates, but its stock rose on news of a deal with two generic drugmakers not to sell knock-offs of its lead drug Xyrem until the end of 2025. Jazz shares closing up 0.9%. Meanwhile, Akorn (AKRX) finally reported its 2015 numbers after a long accounting overhaul, lifting shares more than 20%. It’s set to report its Q1 on May 17.JAB Beech will add Krispy Kreme Doughnuts (KKD) to its coffee empire, paying $21 per share, or $1.35 billion. Krispy Kreme shot up 25% to 21.14 --- slightly above the offer price. JAB Beech, a subsidiary of JAB Holding, owns Peet’s Coffee & Tea, Stumptown Coffee Roasters, Caribou Coffee, Einstein Noah Restaurant Group and Intelligentsia Coffee. It led an investor group to buy Keurig Green Mountain for $13.9 billion.
"
180,HUM,"Anthem (ANTM) said its ObamaCare exchange business gained market share in states like New York and Colorado, where nonprofit, government-funded co-ops went bust.The removal of low-priced competitors helped Anthem grow its exchange customer base to 975,000 at the end of the first quarter, up from 898,000 a year earlier. However, it's too early to tell whether its customers will be more or less costly than expected.Unlike UnitedHealth (UNH), which is pulling out of most of its exchange markets, Anthem has committed to the exchange business for the long haul. That's both because of long-term potential and short-term political necessity, as it seeks regulatory approval for its merger with Cigna (CI).Likewise, Aetna (AET) must maintain and grow its exchange presence -- at least in Florida -- to close its merger with Humana (HUM). State regulators said the combined Aetna-Humana must expand to five additional counties by 2018 and statewide by 2020.While Anthem officials said the company's exchange business is trending in the right direction, they still see a cloudy future.In an earnings call, Anthem CEO Joe Swedish described the company as well positioned ""if the market stabilizes to a more sustainable level,"" alluding to appropriate risk-based pricing of premiums.Later, he said, ""maybe a sustainable model can be built.""Swedish noted that Anthem is pressing the Obama administration to fix the risk-adjustment program that shifts funds from plans that attract healthier customers to those that attract sicker ones. He's also looking for a narrowing of the exceptions that allow people to enroll outside the open-enrollment period to start the year. Another stated problem is the grace period that puts insurers on the hook for bills run up by customers for a month after they've stopped paying premiums.Lastly, Anthem is looking for the flexibility to offer different types of coverage than currently allowed.The end of ObamaCare's temporary reinsurance program, which reimburses insurers for some of the claims of its costliest members, will alone boost premiums by 5% to 6% in 2017, Anthem said.The company has filed for a 15.8% premium hike in Virginia, where it had about 180,000 individual market customers, both on and off the exchange, in 2015. A filing by Anthem said its HealthKeepers plan got back $65 million in reinsurance payments from the government last year.
"
181,HUM,"Federal regulators have been on a roll when it comes to blocking proposed megamergers.The Staples (SPLS)-Office Depot (ODP) deal is simply the latest casualty. The victims have come from all walks of corporate life, from oilfield services giants Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) to cable television titans Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner Cable (TWC).Several more big takeovers are threatened. Health insurance behemoths Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) are looking to recite corporate nuptials as are Cigna (CI) and Anthem (ANTM), but already regulators are whispering their concerns. The  Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)-Rite Aid (RAD) deal also is in doubt.Is it politics, or happenstance? San Diego State University finance professor Nikhil Varaiya, an expert on M&A activity, cautions not to read too much into it even though there has been heightened scrutiny of mergers in the last year of the Obama administration. Varaiya agrees there's been more activity, but says it usually depends on the individual circumstances.""(It) could be because these companies are trying to merge in this time period,"" he said. ""Halliburton’s merger attempt, for example, reflected the lower demand for oil and their trying to reduce capacity. The concern by regulators might be that when the oil markets pick up, they might have a dominant company.""Halliburton and Baker Hughes called off their $28 billion merger on May 1, citing tough resistance from U.S. and European regulators. Still, Varaiya noted that future Justice Department actions on proposed mergers could hinge in part on who comes into power in the fall.""Any Democrat administration tends to be more concerned about concentration and competitiveness,"" Varaiya said. ""So it's likely they will bring more cases before a judge.""U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington late Tuesday agreed with Federal Trade Commission regulators that the pairing of Staples and Office Depot would violate antitrust laws and reduce competition.Shares of Staples gapped down 18% to 8.37 in the stock market Wednesday after the office supply giants announced they would no longer try to merge. Office Depot plunged 40% to 3.62.Roy Behren, partner and portfolio manager at Westchester Capital Funds in Valhalla, N.Y., said it would have been hard for Staples and Office Depot to satisfy the FTC.""In the case of Office Depot, which we have been monitoring carefully but declined to invest in because it involved creation of a monopoly, you essentially had the two main players in the market. That would create problematic market power,"" Behren said.But Behren doesn't rule out political influence in all cases.""We view that the Bush administration was much less inclined to prosecute what they perceived as antitrust or market concentration,"" he said. ""Obama administration regulators were aware in the case of Baker Hughes that Halliburton had agreed to divest $7 billion of revenue to get this done. That still didn’t get the job done.""Behren said the most scrutinized transaction at the moment is the Walgreens Boost Alliance deal to buy smaller drug store chain Rite Aid. Walgreens has agreed to divest stores to get the $17 billion deal done, but regulators are still scrutinizing it.""It’s possible that structural remedies could satisfy regulators,"" he said.Meanwhile, the list of failed mergers gets longer. General Electric's (GE) proposed sale of its appliance business to Sweden's Electrolux fell through in December after the Justice Department said the deal would unfairly reduce competition in that sector and asked a federal judge to block it. Last year's $3.5 billion bid by privately held US Foods for rival Sysco (SYY) was blocked on grounds that it would have created a food distribution behemoth.No. 1 cable company Comcast's $45.2 billion bid for Time Warner Cable was turned down in late August of last year after regulators threatened to issue a hearing designation that would have delayed its consideration for months or years.Instead, last Friday the FCC OK'd Charter Communications' (CHTR) offer for TWC, and Charter's separate purchase of Bright House Networks. The combined deals, valued at nearly $79 billion, will create the No. 2 cable TV and Internet provider, the FCC said.The DOJ also is eyeing health insurance consolidation.No. 3 U.S. insurer by revenue Aetna agreed to merge with Humana in a deal valued at $34 billion. But William Baer, assistant attorney general, said during a Senate subcommittee hearing last week that the proposed tie-up would be ""very, very carefully"" scrutinized.No. 2 insurer Anthem hammered out a deal with another major player, Cigna. But in a regulatory filing this month, Cigna said ""In light of the complexity of the regulatory process and dynamic environment, it is possible that such approvals may not be obtained in 2016.""Michael Shannon, another Westchester Capital managing partner and portfolio manager, said that with the national elections just months away some candidates are talking tough about regulating mergers.""In past elections, parties (running for office) would talk, saying we’re going to do this or do that. But regulators are under the law,"" Shannon said. ""At the end of the day, you can’t just rule as you want to.""

182,HUM,"Next year, the combination of a sicker-than-expected insured group and the end of a temporary ObamaCare program to offset the cost of the sickest patients will send premiums soaring in Virginia, the first state where 2017 rate filings have been made public.Anthem (ANTM) has requested a 15.8% rate hike in Virginia for ObamaCare plans that cover about 180,000 members on and off the exchange. But that's actually a bit below the average rate hike that state insurers requested: 17.8%, as calculated by ACASignups.net, which tracks ObamaCare enrollment.The details behind Anthem's requested price hike highlight one reason why ObamaCare exchange premiums throughout the U.S. may be in for a big hike in 2017: the end of the three-year reinsurance program.In 2016, the program covered 50% of bills between $90,000 and $250,000 that an insurer incurred for patients. For the Anthem HealthKeepers plans in Virginia, it translated to about $65 million in payments from the government, helping cut outlays on benefits by about 10%, filings show.On the other hand, Anthem had to transfer about $20 million to other insurers under ObamaCare's ongoing risk-adjustment program, which provides for transfers to insurers that wind up with a sicker overall population.Excluding such transfers, Anthem's incurred costs equaled 90.5% of premiums collected, leaving a narrow margin to cover administrative costs, much less profit.Doubts about whether ObamaCare's risk-adjustment program is accurately compensating insurers has led to complaints from UnitedHealth (UNH) and generated strong criticism from independent policy experts.The biggest apparent beneficiary of the risk-adjustment program was Optima Health, which received nearly $36 million in transfers from other insurers on top of nearly $21 million in reinsurance for its 34,000 members.Without such help, Optima would have been sunk. It reported that incurred claims totaled 105% of premiums. As it is, the insurer is requesting a 37% rate hike and said that it will exit a number of Virginia's regions.Humana (HUM), a small player in Virginia, submitted notice on Friday that it's quitting the state's individual market. Aetna (AET) unit Coventry has yet to submit a rate request, so it's not yet clear if it will remain in the market. Aetna does have a 50% stake in Innovation Health, which is seeking a 16% increase for 61,000 members.On the other hand, both UnitedHealth and Cigna (CI), which would be a new entrant, submitted rate requests, with UnitedHealth seeking a 9.4% rate hike for some 11,000 members, according to ACASignups.Kaiser Foundation Health Plan reported that its incurred costs totaled 94% of premiums in the state, but its request for a 10% rate hike could put it in position to gain market share. One reason why Kaiser could request a below-average rate hike may be that it depended less on the reinsurance program, getting back just $4.4 million.Some insurers also noted other factors contributing to higher rates, including market churn, with customers running up bills and then bolting, and the grace period that puts insurers on the hook for bills incurred in the first month after customers fail to submit their premium payment.UnitedHealth will kick off earnings for health insurers on Tuesday, with Wall Street investors and health care policy analysts paying attention to any ObamaCare-related comments. UnitedHealth last week said that it would exit the Arkansas and Georgia exchanges. Late Friday, Michigan officials said UnitedHealth would exit that state's exchange. The insurer has warned that it might exit the exchanges entirely.

183,HUM,"As it reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings Tuesday, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) said it would remain in only a ""handful"" of ObamaCare public exchanges next year, down from 34 state exchanges currently. Shares gapped up 2% near the close.UnitedHealth Chief Executive Stephen Hemsley said in a post-earnings conference call that the exchange business's smaller market size and ""shorter-term high risk"" suggested that the company could not broadly serve more than a handful of states as part of the Affordable Care Act, and added that UnitedHealth will advocate for ""more sustainable"" strategies.Hemsley offered no specifics as to the states where the company would continue to offer ObamaCare coverage. The insurer is already known to be exiting Arkansas, Georgia and Michigan.""They're experiencing more losses than they anticipated,"" analyst Ana Gupte of Leerink told Investor's Business Daily. ""Very few players are making a positive profit margin.""Georgia is likely UnitedHealth's most unprofitable state, Gupte noted, though she adds analysis of data in filings alone cannot definitively determine profitability of state exchanges. Other likely high-loss states ripe for exit include Florida, North Carolina, New York, Alabama and Louisiana, according to Leerink's analysis.UnitedHealth, the nation's largest health insurer, said it recognized $125 million in reserves in the first quarter to cover additional exchange-related losses. It had earlier expected $525 million in losses in 2016. But with its whittled-down profile in the exchanges, it doesn't expect negative financial exposure next year.Early indications show that the health status of exchange members got ""a little worse,"" one UnitedHealth executive said in the conference call.The insurer has long been a tentative participant in ObamaCare , shying away from offering coverage under the massive health care plan at first and then working its way in gradually during its first couple of years. The extent of its participation in various state exchanges was limited and far less than other carriers relative to their size such as Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM).""Aetna and Anthem are more exposed to the individual markets than United so they have less flexibility to leave,"" Gupte said, adding that less than 2% of UnitedHealth's revenue comes from the exchanges.UnitedHealth had around 795,000 exchange-compliant individual enrollees as of the end of the first quarter. Analyst Peter Costa of Wells Fargo pointed out in a note Tuesday that about half of the company's enrollment was new this year, and that these new members ""appeared to have a higher-risk health profile.""UnitedHealth's planned exits means it'll be more likely that the pending megamergers between Anthem and Cigna (CI) and Aetna and Humana (HUM) will be approved by regulators, partly because the consolidations will help to preserve access to exchange marketplaces, Gupte noted.UnitedHealth's overall first-quarter results were relatively strong, driven in part by strength in its Optum health services business, which uses advanced data analytics and technology. Total revenue rose 25% over last year to $44.53 billion, above the $43.96 billion expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. On an adjusted basis, it earned $1.81 a share, compared with expectations of $1.72.Net margin in the quarter declined to 3.6% from 4% a year earlier. UnitedHealth's medical care cost ratio -- the proportion of revenue spent on providing health services -- in the quarter increased 30 basis points over last year to 81.7%, reflecting an extra calendar day of service in the quarter, the company said. Medical cost trends in the quarter ""were well-controlled and consistent with management expectations,"" the company stated in the release.The company said it expects adjusted earnings for 2016 of $7.75 to $7.95 vs. prior guidance of $7.60 to $7.80, above analysts' views of $7.73, on revenue of $182 billion, up from $157.1 billion in 2015 and also above views.""As individual exchange losses are eliminated in 2017, bottom-line growth is likely to accelerate,"" wrote analyst Steven Halper of FBR & Co., who raised his 2017 EPS estimate by 10 cents to $8.90.Image provided by Shutterstock.

184,HUM,"UnitedHealth (UNH) is right: ObamaCare's insurance markets aren't working.That's not just the view of the nation's biggest insurer and other carriers losing money in the individual market. A new analysis from the Avalere Health consultancy confirms that ObamaCare is unintentionally punishing insurers that offer policies with lower deductibles and broader networks.Even the Obama administration understands that there are problems with a key feature of the law's individual market reforms -- the risk-adjustment program that's meant to neutralize the risk that some insurers will rack up losses because they attract higher-cost members, even as others with low-cost members reap profits.On Thursday, the Department of Health and Human Services is convening a full-day meeting of stakeholders to begin hashing out a plan to better level ObamaCare's playing field.That won't solve all of ObamaCare's problems. If the relatively young and healthy don't think ObamaCare plans are worth the price — even if they have to pay a penalty — then there may not be enough low-cost members to balance out those with higher costs.Yet the importance of effective risk adjustment shouldn't be underestimated. If risk adjustment can't be made to work, insurers will have no choice but to do everything they can to make their plans look as unappealing as possible to consumers facing high medical costs. Deductibles will rise as high as possible and networks will become as narrow as possible.In fact, there are signs that's already happening. For example, Centene's (CNC) Ambetter plans in a number of states are offering low-priced silver coverage with bronze-type deductibles -- as high as $6,500. Such policies cover some basic costs before the deductible. Primary care visits cost $30, specialist visits $60 and generic drugs $15. But big-ticket items like specialty drugs, emergency-room visits and surgical procedures aren’t covered until after a patient racks up $6,500 in in-network bills.(High-deductible, low premium silver plans also reduce subsidies available on other plans, because subsidies are based on the second-cheapest silver plan in any given market.)UnitedHealth and Humana (HUM), which have both racked up losses and said they may abandon the exchange business, will likely base their decisions at least in part on an assessment of whether risk-adjustment will work effectively.“If the risk-adjustment model is inaccurate, then plans that enroll a disproportionate share of sicker enrollees may experience financial losses and exit the market, even if they have priced premiums accurately,” Avalere's Tom Kornfield said in discussing the group's new critique of the program.Yet good news for UnitedHealth regarding risk adjustment may not be as positive for the earnings outlook for Centene, Molina Healthcare (MOH), and other companies profiting from the ObamaCare exchange status quo.The way that risk-adjustment is supposed to work is that insurers set their rates based on the overall health of the risk pool, which includes insurers operating on and off the exchange. Then, plans which enroll lower-cost enrollees subsidize plans with higher-cost enrollees through transfer payments, the size of which are determined by a complex set of criteria and calculations.In its analysis, Avalere highlighted three main problems with ObamaCare's risk-adjustment model.First, the model was constructed based on the health experience of the large-group employer market. Yet ""actual individual market enrollees tend to be older, lower-income, and have higher health needs,"" Avalere said. ""These enrollees also tend to move in and out of coverage throughout the year.""Second, the diagnosed diseases used to identify plans with a disproportionate share of high-costs patients ""are not reflective of the health needs of the population"" in the individual market, Avalere said.Lastly, ObamaCare's risk-adjustment model excludes information about prescription drugs an enrollee receives. As a result, ""plans may be systematically undercompensated for enrollees who use high-cost medications, because they are not used to inform disease identification and severity.""Avalere noted a perceived risk that the inclusion of prescription information in risk-adjustment calculations could encourage increased use of high-cost drugs ""in order to achieve higher risk scores and, thus, receive higher payments.""In other words, getting this right is not going to be easy.

185,HUM,"""Aging in place"" is the mantra of Baby Boomers hoping to live out their senior years at home, and Amedisys (AMED) is looking to play a role in realizing that.A home health care provider, Amedisys offers home nursing and rehab, life assistance and hospice services. And it’s growing organically and via acquisitions, while boosting its quality-of-care ratings. These ratings, put into place by Medicare last year, will have a dramatic impact on the health care services market in the next few years, according to Amedisys and market analysts.""We think health care is really changing; home health is a lower-cost care option,"" Brian Tanquilut, analyst with Jefferies LLC, told Investor's Business Daily. ""We’re very bullish on Amedisys; It’s the biggest in the space of the pure-play, publicly traded home health care companies.""He’s rated Amedisys a buy.""Home health care will be an ultimate winner"" of the move to aging in place, Frank Morgan, an RBC Capital Markets analyst, told IBD.Bigger players can invest in the computer systems and overall size to gain efficiency and improve performance. Paul Kusserow, Amedisys’ chief executive, spoke with IBD and says home health care is a ""highly fragmented market and it will continue to consolidate.""The company has already closed two acquisitions this year -- Associated Home Care for $28 million and Infinity HomeCare for $63 million.""We have a phenomenal balance sheet,"" Kusserow said. ""We’ve been paying largely cash for our acquisitions.""He says the company is in dialogues with ""20 to 30"" companies for possible acquisitions.""They have a lot of firepower to do deals,"" said Tanquilut. ""Bigger providers have the ability to scale, to train and to invest in (information technology).""""Star ratings and Medicare reimbursement dollars are being tied to outcomes and that favors the bigger, more sophisticated players,"" David MacDonald, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, told IBD. He rates Amedisys a buy.Two other companies specialize in home healthcare, LHC Group (LHCG) and Almost Family (AFAM). Large health care companies also have moved into the home health care space as well, including Kindred Healthcare (KND) and HealthSouth (HLS), which both acquired companies in the space.Morgan said: ""There’s a huge consolidation opportunity, as increasing regulatory and quality requirements will cause mom-and-pop companies to exit the business.""He has a market perform rating on Amedisys.Amedisys also is focused on gaining efficiencies through the adoption of a new patient care information technology system, called HomeCare Homebase. The software company of the same name is part of Hearst Corp.’s health network.""We’re all in on this"" tech project, said Kusserow, saying the whole company will be on it by the end of October.""We’re going to do it in a little over a year,"" even though the company initially predicted it would take two years, he said.""We think we’ll be able to deliver $40 million to $50 million in savings with this system -- we’ve said this to Wall Street,""  he said. Kusserow added that Amedisys has been running its business on three different software systems, which he says is ""very inefficient.""Tanquilut is convinced: ""The new (tech) system will improve quality.""The company sees more than 35,000 patients a day. Kusserow says the new cloud computing software, which stores records remotely, will allow care providers to use tablets instead of expensive laptops. And he says it enables ""better documentation, better reporting, and better, more-efficient staffing."" He says it’s also tightly coupled with billing and will improve the accounts receivable process.That’s a plus, but Amedisys already is producing some enviable numbers. Its net income for its fourth quarter, ended Dec. 31, 2015, was $13.1 million, up 41% from $9.3 million in the year-ago period. Diluted earnings rose 36% to 38 cents per share from 28 cents in 2014’s fourth quarter.Total service revenue for the fourth quarter grew roughly 13% to $338.4 million versus $300.5 million in the year-ago period. For the full year, total revenue grew 6.7% to $1.28 billion from $1.20 billion in 2014.Zack’s puts Amedisys’ first-quarter 2016 earnings at 34 cents a share and full-year 2016 earnings at $1.75 per share.Amedisys traded at around 13 back in June 2014, but closed above 30 by March 2015 and rose above 48 by August 2015. Amedisys hit a new intraday 52-week high of 49.50 on Monday.And margins for high-quality providers should improve with the government’s move to ratings and pay-for-performance.""In 2018, CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) will begin determining percentage bonuses and billing cuts for home health in nine states, based on a number of metrics,"" said Tanquilut. ""Providers in the top bucket in these states will get a bonus of plus 3% on their billing starting in 2018 -- minus 3% for those with the worst performance -- and by 2022 it goes to plus/minus 8%. So quality will matter.""Kusserow said: ""By moving to quality it creates differentiation. So we’re behind this change.""CMS is also rating providers now, and Amedisys’ initial score from the government in 2015 was 3.49 out of 5 possible stars. But Kusserow says 30% of its centers achieved 4.0-plus stars.""Our objective is by 2017 all our care centers will be at 4.0 and above,"" he said.That means making sure all of its roughly 14,000 employees are focused on providing high-quality care. Shortly after Kusserow joined Amedisys at the end of 2014, he brought over Larry Pernosky, a human resources executive from Humana (HUM), where Kusserow had been a senior executive.One of Pernosky’s missions has been to drive down turnover rates. Amedisys’ rate dropped to 29.3% in 2015 from 32.2% in 2014.""We hope to get to 25% by the end of 2016 and below 20% by the end of 2017,"" said Kusserow.Additionally, Amedisys tracks its own metric for patient care ""with engagement scores.""Even Kusserow’s pay package is partially determined by turnover rates and engagement scores.""We take this very seriously and everyone is incentivized around quality,"" he said.

186,HUM,"A new sheriff is en route, but that hasn't stopped the old sheriff from swinging his corporate billy club around town.The subject is company mergers and the instances in which the administration of President Barack Obama -- who promised to ""reinvigorate"" federal antitrust enforcement on the campaign trail back in 2008 -- is cracking down are piling up. This week, Obama's Justice Department sued to block the $35 billion merger of Baker Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton (HAL) over antitrust concerns.Also this week, Obama said the Treasury Department had taken further steps to curb tax inversions by which U.S. companies buy a foreign target and then re-domicile to avoid higher taxes. That scuttled a major acquisition on Wednesday as drugmakers Pfizer (PFE) and Allergan (AGN) called off their $150 billion deal.There also are several other instances in recent weeks and months when the administration has taken aim at big business. So, what gives? Is it a product of last year's robust M&A environment, which saw $4.3 trillion in global deals announced, or symptoms of a White House that critics have accused of being anti-business?""They’re definitely getting more aggressive,"" Max Jacobs, an analyst at London-based investment research house Edison, said of the administration. ""Historically, Obama has been a bit more on the liberal government intervention side of things.""Take the Pfizer-Allergan merger. The deal would have resulted in U.S.-based Pfizer relocating its headquarters to low-tax Ireland to benefit from that nation's 12% corporate tax rate. By doing so, it would have bypassed U.S. rates of 35%, the highest in the industrialized world.Terminating a deal that had been in the works for months, Pfizer now will pay Ireland-based Allergan a breakup fee of $150 million.""There is a political calculation here,"" said Dane Hamilton, editor at Mergermarket, speaking of tax-inversion deals. ""Obviously, the Obama administration would like to stop companies from moving overseas because they generate a lot of tax dollars.""Still, Obama's pending departure in January may not bring much relief. In terms of a friendlier face when it comes to M&A, there is a dearth of obvious presidential candidates at the moment.Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party's front-runner for president, wants to crack down on inversions, while fellow White House Democratic hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders has called the practice a ""tax-scam."" Meanwhile, Republican front-runner Donald Trump and party rival Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas propose lowering U.S. taxes to ward off inversions, but aren't coming out in support of them.Still, clamping down on tax inversions won't solve the corporate tax code's underlying problems, said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford University.""Our tax system very much put these incentives in place,"" she said. She added, though, that it's becoming more difficult to get inversion deals done.Tax inversions aren't the only target, though. The vigilant antitrust watchman that is the Obama administration has taken aim elsewhere.In addition to antitrust concerns over the Baker Hughes-Halliburton deal, which would combine the world's No. 2 and No. 3 oilfield-services firms, the Justice Department took Electrolux (ELUXY) to trial late last year, causing General Electric (GE) to back out of a $3.3 billion deal to sell its appliances unit. And the Federal Trade Commission has taken Office Depot (ODP) and Staples (SPLS) to trial to block the $6.3 billion deal between the two biggest office-supply chains.There's more. Last year, the administration quashed the $45 billion Comcast (CMCSA)-Time Warner Cable (TWC) merger, which would have combined the nation's two largest cable television companies. Yet in 2010, it approved Live Nation Entertainment’s (LYV) merger with Ticketmaster.Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, which favors more aggressive antitrust law enforcement, said the size of some of the companies merging raises ""red flags for enforcers.""But deals are still being struck despite politicians' griping.Major health insurers Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) combined in a $37 billion deal, and Anthem (ANTM) agreed to buy Cigna (CI) last year for $48.4 billion. The world's two largest beer makers, Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) and SABMiller, agreed to combine for $105 billion.For now, though, the old sheriff has a free hand, said Edison's Jacobs.""(Obama) has the benefit of not having to stand for election,"" he said.

187,HUM,"Small business optimism fell to a two-year low in February, the National Federation of Independent Business said Tuesday. Owners of small firms reported hiring and compensation plans weakening sharply since the end of last year, the latest evidence that labor markets are not as healthy as official government data indicate.NFIB’s sentiment gauge fell one point to 92.9, the lowest since February 2014 and well below historical norms.""A ho-hum outcome this month confirms that the small business sector is not performing with any strength,"" said NFIB Chief Economist William Dunkelberg.A net 21% still see the economy weakening, the worst since late 2013. That’s not surprising, given that small firms have reported sales have been falling consistently since June 2012.A big shift so far this year is in labor markets. A net 10% of small businesses plan to add staff, down from 11% in January and 15% in December. That’s the lowest since last June.Meanwhile, small firms are rapidly scaling back plans to raise worker pay and benefits. A net 12% intend to increase compensation, the fewest since July 2013. That’s down from December’s 21%, which was the most since 2001. It’s unclear if minimum wage hikes or ObamaCare/health care premium increases taking effect Jan. 1 had boosted year-end compensation plans.Regardless, February’s NFIB data followed the February employment report, which showed that weekly earnings tumbled 0.5% vs. January. Hourly wages dipped 0.1%.The same report showed the U.S. adding 242,000 jobs last month while the labor force surged, so economists weren’t too concerned by the wage data.But tax withholding data suggest significant deterioration. Tax revenue withheld rose just 2.1% over the last four weeks vs. a year earlier, down from 4% at the start of the year and around 5% for much of 2015.Also, the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing and nonmanufacturing surveys both indicated job declines.Announced layoff plans have been high, with the 12-month trailing average the highest since mid-2012. Halliburton (HAL), Yahoo (YHOO) and Wal-Mart (WMT) are among the major companies setting plans for job cuts in recent weeks.Halliburton said on Feb. 25 that it would cut 5,000 jobs, bringing total planned reductions to 26,000 since 2014's oil-prices plunge. Yahoo plans to cut 15% of its staff, while Wal-Mart is slashing payroll as it closes 154 stores.Energy, manufacturing and export sectors are struggling, affecting small firms directly or indirectly.In the NFIB survey, 12% of small businesses said finding qualified labor was their top problem, behind taxes and regulation. The number was down from 15% in January and 16% last September.One factor could be a recent rush into the workforce. In the last three months, 1.523 million people joined the labor force -- the best gain since March 2000, the very peak of the dot-com stock market bubble. The rise could be easing skilled labor shortages but also depressing wages.Another factor for weaker wages: In addition to weaker sales, a net 4% reported lower selling prices, the worst in more than 5 years.Image provided by Shutterstock.

188,HUM,"Core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 0.3% in January and 2.2% from a year ago, the fastest annual rise since June 2012, the Labor Department said.Overall prices were unchanged for the month and up 1.4% from a year ago. Energy costs slid 2.8% for a second straight month, but the yearly decline slowed to 6.5% vs. 12.6% in December and 18.4% in September, as comparisons get tougher.Core prices were driven by gains in the cost of medical care, health insurance and housing, including lodging away from home.Health insurance costs rose 1.1% for the month and 4.8% from a year ago — the biggest increase since April 2013, before the ObamaCare exchanges were launched. Although subsidies help reduce the prices, inflation measures take into account the added government costs as well. Despite rising premiums, UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) have warned of losses in the exchanges, with UnitedHealth the most explicit about possibly exiting the market if conditions don't improve.The cost of medical care rose 0.5% in January, bringing the yearly increase to 3%, tied for the highest since early 2013. Prescription drug companies such as Gilead Sciences (GILD)and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX)  have been under fire for high costs, but the annual rise in prescription costs has decelerated to 3% from 6.4% at the end of 2014.The cost of medical service rose 0.5% for the month and 3.3% from a year ago, the biggest annual rise since April 2013.Rent of primary residence rose 0.3% in January and 3.7% from a year ago, matching December's annual gain for the biggest since June 2008.Lodging away from home, which sees volatile swings from month to month, rose 2% in January and 3.1% for the year.All items excluding food, shelter and energy still were up a more moderate 1.5% from a year ago.The core inflation rate has risen above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. But the Fed pays more attention to another price gauge, the core PCE deflator, which has shown little pickup in recent months.UnitedHealth shares fell fractionally on the stock market today in morning trade. Aetna, Humana and Gilead Sciences fell 1.3%. Valeant Pharmaceuticals tumbled 7.6% after Wells Fargo downgraded the drugmaker, saying there are ""too many questions.""

189,HUM,"Right on, REIT ETFs: High-yielding real estate investment trusts have won investors' favor in the current stock market.These businesses typically pay out taxable income as dividends to shareholders. And they make it a breeze for the average investor to own a chunk of commercial real estate -- from office complexes and apartment buildings to warehouses and shopping centers or nursing homes.Rising interest rates can hurt some yield-bearing REITs, but not always. Higher rates driven by economic growth and job growth boost the demand for commercial real estate. After all, companies are looking to expand and consumers are looking to spend.For equity REITs, that translates to higher occupancy rates and rent growth at their facilities, and, ultimately, to rising profits.A handful of property REITs have emerged on the IBD 50 list as the market uptrend resumes. They include Public Storage (PSA), Equity Lifestyle Properties (ELS), Sovran Self Storage (SSS), CoreSite Realty (COR) and Store Capital (STOR).Each has a Composite Rating of 98 or 99, meaning they're rock-solid on a range of fundamental and technical measures, including earnings-per-share growth.Vanguard REIT (VNQ), the largest sector-equity exchange traded fund, holds all five of these REITs in its 151-stock portfolio. VNQ yields 4.07%.The ETF rose 2.8% to close above its 200-day moving average for the first time in nearly two months Tuesday and edged up further Wednesday. That's a bullish technical sign, but the downward-sloping 200-day line hints at its holdings' recent struggles.So does the ETF's 76 Relative Strength Rating and D- Accumulation/Distribution Rating. The former translates to ho-hum price performance; the latter to tepid institutional demand.Public Storage is VNQ's second-largest holding, at 5% of assets. It's a rarity among stocks, with uninterrupted quarterly earnings and revenue growth since June 2011.Public Storage stock is trading near a 52-week high of 257.98. It rallied above its 50-day moving average after beating analyst estimates in its Feb. 16 earnings report.As millennials move to dense urban cities for work and find themselves in small apartments, they need a place to store stuff. That's helping companies that rent out storage units grow sales and profits, industry experts say.VNQ is not only the largest REIT ETF, but it's also one of the cheapest to own. It has $26.99 billion in assets and a 0.12% expense ratio.The ETF slightly outpaced the broad market last year and has narrowly held up better so far in 2016, with a 3.8% loss. It absorbed $572.7 million in new investor money in the first two months of 2016.The property REIT group ranks 12 out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, up from No. 14 one week ago and No. 20 eight weeks ago.Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), the third-largest sector-equity ETF, also finished above its 200-day line Tuesday for the first time in 2016. It was trading flat intraday on the stock market today.The remaining 3 of the 5 largest sector-equity ETFs are testing their 50-day but are sitting well off their 200-day lines.They include Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF), Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) and Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE).Image at top of page provided by Shutterstock.

190,HUM,"Health Reform: It wasn’t that long ago when ObamaCare fans were wagging their fingers at critics, saying industry profits proved that the law was working. They’ve been noticeably silent as insurers report huge losses.“It turns out that the law that the insurance industry's shills demonized has been awfully good to insurance-company investors.” That was from a piece in the Huffington Post almost exactly a year ago, after UnitedHealth Group released its Q1 earnings.The writer went on to point out that the good news was reported in the pages of IBD, while our editorial page has long been critical of the law. “I can't wait,” Wendell Potter concluded, “to see how IBD's editorial writers spin UnitedHealth's ObamaCare success.”We can’t wait to see how Potter and other ObamaCare fans are spinning the law’s “success,” now that insurance companies are showing big, sustained losses and threatening to pull out of the program next year.The latest to join the list is Humana, which just reported that profits fell 30% in the last quarter of 2015 and has set aside a reserve for expected losses this year. It’s now saying it “continues to evaluate its participation” in the individual insurance market.A few days earlier, Aetna said it lost up to 4% on its ObamaCare policies in 2015 and said it had “serious concerns about the sustainability of the public exchanges.”And UnitedHealth Group said it expects losses from its ObamaCare enrollees to top $650 million this year and next. “We cannot sustain these losses,” is how CEO Stephen Hemsley put it.Humana, as with other insurers, discovered that ObamaCare enrollees were sicker and more expensive to cover than they anticipated. And worse, they're finding that ObamaCare officials are letting too many people game the system by waiting until after they are sick to enroll for coverage, knowing they can get it guaranteed.Spiraling premiums, an unstable insurance market, people gaming the system. These were predictions made by ObamaCare’s free market critics, including IBD, who said this is where the law's mountain of regulations would inevitably lead.So, what say you now, ObamaCare fans?

192,HUM,"Scouting out potential winners before they take off on a big run isn't easy. But IBD helps makes the task a little less daunting with its Composite Rating.This broad-based metric takes into account IBD SmartSelect Ratings including Earnings Per Share, Relative Strength, Sales + Profit Margins + Return On Equity and Accumulation/Distribution, then assigns stocks a number ranging from 1 (worst) to 99 (best). How far a stock is from its 52-week high is also factored into the Composite Rating.A 99 Composite means a stock's combined ratings outperform 99% of all others tracked by IBD.Keep in mind that just because a stock gets a 99 doesn't mean it's an automatic buy. The Composite Rating offers a good place to start your search for watch-list contenders, since it helps narrow the field. A high grade implies that the stock meets certain fundamental and technical criteria. From there, further due diligence is required, including studying the stock charts as well as company news, industry group action and the overall market.While a high rating indicates that a stock is an outperformer, you shouldn't limit yourself to just those with a 99 Composite Rating. Many leading stocks will not have a 99 when they break out. So if you look only at those, your pool of candidates will not just be tiny, it might also include stocks that are already extended in price. An Investor's Corner column late last year looking at three stocks with 99s for their Composite, EPS and RS ratings proved this point.That's why it's important to use IBD's SmartSelect Ratings as one component of your stock-picking routine, not as a way to avoid doing further digging. Filtering for stocks that earn a Composite Rating of say, 90 or better, will leave you with a solid list of companies to delve into for your watch list. Always check the daily and weekly charts too, to see if a stock is basing and where potential buy points are, and to analyze price and volume action.You can find the Composite Rating in the stock tables each day, in any of the mini stock charts in the paper, and on Stock Checkup at Investors.com.Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) can help illustrate why it's tough to catch a winning stock based solely on its ratings. The stock was slowing down from a two-year run and moving mostly sideways as it started forming a base in the week ended March 15, 2013. It went on to shape a nine-week cup with handle, with a buy point at 60.30.Shares broke out in the week ended May 24 and surged 193% through late February 2014, when they paused to digest the big gains and work on a new base.

193,HUM,"Amazon (AMZN), Nike (NKE), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) are among the companies based in the 10 hottest housing markets for 2016, according to a report from online real-estate research company Zillow this week.Topping the list is Denver, followed by Seattle and Dallas-Fort Worth. Other places that made the list are Utah markets Ogden and Salt Lake City, along with Omaha, Neb., and Boise, Idaho.To determine which markets would be hot, Zillow looked at home value appreciation, low unemployment rates and strong income growth.""Trendy tech centers like San Francisco, Seattle and Denver hogged the spotlight in 2015,"" noted Zillow Chief Economist Svenja Gudell in the report. ""But this year, the markets that shine brightest will be those that manage to strike a good balance between strong income growth, low unemployment and solid home value appreciation. As the job market continues to hum and opportunity becomes more widespread, the best housing markets are no longer limited to the coasts or one-industry tech towns.""Omaha, home of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, among others, has the lowest unemployment rate of the 10 hottest markets — just 2.9%, the report noted.Denver, home of Chipotle and numerous other big companies, saw housing values rise 16% in 2015, and Zillow forecasts that they will rise another 5% in 2016. Denver's recent income growth is 1.1%, and the unemployment rate is 3.1%, the report noted.Zillow also forecasts that Portland, Ore., which is close to power brand Nike's home base of Beaverton, will see a 5% rise in home values this year vs. a year earlier. Income growth is 1%, while the unemployment rate is 5%.Seattle, home of Amazon and Starbucks (SBUX), to name a couple, is estimated to enjoy 5.4% home value appreciation this year. Income growth is 1.1%, while the unemployment rate is 4.5%, Zillow noted.Zillow forecasts that Dallas-Fort Worth, home of such companies as Exxon Mobil (XOM) and AT&T (T), will see an estimated home appreciation of 5.6% this year vs. a year earlier. Income growth in Dallas-Fort Worth is 1.1%, while the unemployment rate is 4%.Richmond, Va., home of tobacco giantAltria Group (MO), is expected to see home price appreciation of 2.2% vs. a year earlier. Its recent income growth is 1.2%, while its unemployment rate is 4.4%.""A strong and diverse economy is the driving force behind Richmond's high income growth, with government, finance, education and manufacturing jobs robust in the area and expected to continue in 2016,"" the report noted.Boise, Ogden, Salt Lake City and Sacramento, Calif., all have high forecast home value appreciation, the report said. Homes are expected to appreciate an average of about 5% over the next year.

194,HUM,"The ObamaCare exchanges have added so few customers in the past three weeks that it almost seems like there must be some kind of glitch. With less than three weeks left to enroll, the exchanges still have fewer customers than signed up in 2015, yet the rate of new sign-ups now appears to be slower than it has been since the glitch-filled launch in the fourth quarter of 2013.That's worrying news for insurers like UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM). Without an infusion of fresh blood during this final sprint, the exchanges will tilt a bit older and not much bigger than 2015's make-up that prompted double-digit premium hikes and UnitedHealth's threat to exit the exchanges if losses don't end.It's also troubling for ObamaCare's supporters who have hoped that a jump in the individual mandate penalty to a minimum of $695 for going without coverage in 2016, more than double 2015's minimum hit, would result in a big increase in enrollment rather than a big jump in the tax penalty millions of people will have to pay. Since there's no glitch holding down enrollment as the individual mandate penalty spikes, the problem must be in the marketability of the plans.Just 74,000 Sign-Ups Last WeekIn the past week, HealthCare.gov, which handles operations for 38 states, added just 74,000 customers, or less than half the 163,000 customers added in the same week a year ago.In fact the totals in each of the past three weeks are the three slowest weeks since the Obama administration began breaking out weekly HealthCare.gov totals at the start of 2015 enrollment. The three-week total of 231,800 new sign-ups is likely the worst stretch since late 2013 because the weakest month since then (February 2014) still saw close to 700,000 sign-ups.So far there's no hint that activity is accelerating as the clock winds down on 2016 open enrollment. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell made no mention of a pick-up in her statement announcing the latest figures, referring only to a burst of activity in mid-December. One leading indicator of sign-up activity also has lagged. Over the past two weeks, 451,000 customers submitted applications, a necessary precursor to selecting an exchange plan. That's down by nearly one-fourth from the 579,000 application filers in the same period a year earlier.The drop in applications provides confirmation that sign-up activity is genuinely slow, rather than just an illusory effect of a shift in accounting for plan cancellations. Like last year, the HealthCare.gov states are subtracting customers when people cancel their plans, and each week's total represents the net addition of customers.In addition, insurers in HealthCare.gov states will strip out customers who never pay as their deadlines for monthly payments pass, rather than waiting until the end of open enrollment to do so.An example of what that culling of nonpaying customers looks like comes from Rhode Island, which operates its own exchange. This week, the state reported 30,015 paying and nonpaying customers, down 15.3% from the prior week's 34,627.There's no indication of any similar purging of nonpayers in the HealthCare.gov states. Two states did report that their sign-up totals edged lower last week. Montana sign-ups fell by 78, or 0.1%, from 55,555, and Pennsylvania's slipped by 1,239, or 0.3%, from 412,914. It's not clear whether those mild declines are just related to stripping out plans actively cancelled by consumers or whether an insurer here or there has started to winnow nonpayers.Aetna, Humana Signal Enrollment WeakFurther suggestions ObamaCare enrollment is weak have come from Aetna and Humana (HUM) recently. This week, Aetna told investors that its first-quarter individual market enrollment will be at least as high as at the end of 2015. That's a pretty low bar considering that Aetna's exchange enrollment shrank by more than 100,000, or 11%, in the third quarter as customers dropped coverage and likely continued to fall in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, Humana reported that its individual enrollment will shrink by 200,000 to 300,000 by the end of 2016. (Aetna has agreed to buy Humana, but regulators have yet to approve it.)While Medicaid insurers such as Centene (CNC) that have been more aggressive in pricing premiums lower may be stealing customers from the competition — often with high deductibles — the size of the pie is likely to be smaller than companies were expecting.In 2015, 11.7 million sign-ups dwindled to 10.2 million paying customers by March and likely fewer than 9 million by year-end. The Obama administration's estimate of 11.4 million enrollees at the end of 2016, which had seemed shockingly low compared to the Congressional Budget Office's projected annual average of 20 million paid enrollees, now looks on the money and possibly optimistic.Follow Jed Graham on Twitter @IBD_JGraham.Related:ObamaCare Employer Mandate Is Worse Than Feared.

Yet, at $2,500, the silver plan may be too much of a stretch, leaving bronze the only realistic option for a family that doesn't expect massive medical bills.

211,HUM,"Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said Tuesday that 8.25 million people signed up in time for Jan. 1 coverage via HealthCare.gov.Despite the upbeat tone after a last-minute rush led officials to push back the Dec. 15 deadline by a few days, the total so far trails the 8.8 million who signed up during open enrollment for 2015 coverage.At this point a year ago, HealthCare.gov sign-ups already had eclipsed its first-year total, so the news may be a sign that there's no great untapped ObamaCare demand. HHS touted 2.4 million ""new"" enrollees, but that includes people who previously signed up and dropped their plans.When the Obama administration projected that national enrollment would end 2016 at 11.4 million — at best — most analysts figured the estimate was intentionally way too low. Yet that's beginning to look plausible. Certainly, the Congressional Budget Office estimate of 21 million exchange enrollees in 2016 looks divorced from reality.Only 5.8 million people of the 7.2 million who held policies in June renewed coverage via HealthCare.gov, which operates exchanges for 37 states. An apparent auto-renewal snag means that this figure will rise slightly.Bad News For Insurers?People are automatically renewed if they don't visit the exchanges to select a plan. Though data from the other 13 states and D.C. haven't yet been compiled, the implication is that national enrollment in 2015 plans dived between June and December to roughly 9 million, down nearly one-fourth from the 11.7 million initial sign-ups. Big insurers, including Anthem (ANTM) and Molina (MOH), reported losing an average 8% of exchange members in Q3.Tuesday's news may not be a great sign for insurers like UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) that have been losing money in their ObamaCare exchange business. While the jump in 2016 premiums and deductibles will make a difference in insurer bottom lines, making plans less affordable may be taking a toll on consumer demand.UnitedHealth warned that it would exit the exchanges after 2016 unless things turned around. So far, at least, there's no clear evidence of a turnaround.Even the same kind of surge in January and February as last year would only put sign-ups roughly in line with HHS' modest target.Bronze Age, ContinuedHHS predicted that national sign-ups could rise as high as 14.1 million but end the year nearly 20% lower as people drop out, either because they get coverage from another source (employer, Medicaid or Medicare) or go uninsured.Another datapoint may be just as important as the overall gain in enrollment: How much of the sign-up rush is really a surge of people selecting bronze plans. That's key when it comes to modest-income households earning up to 250% of the poverty level, since they qualify for extra cost-sharing subsidies that shrink their deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs.

231,HUM,"New ObamaCare exchange enrollment via HealthCare.gov continued to lag behind last year's pace during Thanksgiving week. That's an unwelcome sign for the insurance industry and the Obama administration, which has been expecting the ramping up of the individual mandate to boost new sign-ups by as much as 30% this enrollment period.Comparing new enrollment with last year's sign-up period is tricky, because this period runs from Nov. 1 to Feb. 1, while last enrollment season went from Nov. 15 to Feb. 15. As the mid-December enrollment deadline for being covered on New Year's Day approaches, activity will pick up.So ObamaCare supporters needn't panic yet that HealthCare.gov has signed up only 714,000 new customers through the first four weeks of open enrollment, nearly 40% below the 1,176,000 through four weeks of enrollment last year.Still, even comparing the last two full weeks of November with the same period a year ago, new enrollment ran 6% below last year's pace.ObamaCare Stakes High In 2016The stakes are high for ObamaCare in 2016: UnitedHealth (UNH), the nation's largest insurer, says that it may bow out of the individual exchange business if it can't turn a profit this year. Other insurers, including Aetna (AET), Anthem (ANTM) and Humana (HUM), marked down their expectations after seeing a big outflow of customers in the third quarter. While they're expressing patience, a weak enrollment year could lead to another big round of premium hikes for 2017.A ruling on the House lawsuit against the Obama administration for spending never-appropriated billions on cost-sharing subsidies will come during the spring, and a victory for Republicans would cast further doubt on ObamaCare's future.So far, the Obama administration is releasing data for only the 37 states whose exchanges are operated by HealthCare.gov. New enrollees include anyone who didn't hold an exchange policy when they signed up in the current enrollment period — even if they had signed up previously and dropped their coverage for whatever reason.New enrollment is only part of the equation. Getting current members to re-up also matters. So does getting people who sign up to pay for coverage. The Department of Health and Human Services expects up to 14.1 million people to sign up, including as many as 5.4 million new members, but it sees paid enrollment falling to a maximum of 11.4 million at year-end 2016.Some analysts see 11.4 million as a low-ball estimate. In any case, a total of 5.4 million new sign-ups doesn't look likely, since the pace of sign-ups is running behind last year's total, which ended below 4.2 million.Follow Jed Graham on Twitter @IBD_JGraham.

232,HUM,"Apple (AAPL) chip supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) got a price target cut Wednesday despite this week's favorable regulatory ruling against a Tesla (TSLA) supplier, while Northrop Grumman (NOC) scored an upgrade, and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) was started with a bullish rating.Cowen cut Qualcomm's price target to 67 from 69 and maintained its outperform rating on the stock. Topeka Capital Markets also cut its price target on the Apple supplier to 52 from 61 and maintained its hold rating.On Monday, the U.S. International Trade Commission sided with Qualcomm and Samsung, upholding an earlier ruling that neither company violated Tesla chipmaker Nvidia's (NVDA) patents on graphics processing chips.

Apple climbed 0.8%, Tesla rose 6% and Nvidia added 0.6%.Defense contractor Northrop Grumman rose 1% after it was upgraded to overweight from neutral by JPMorgan, which also raised its price target on the stock to 212 from 198.Recent consolidation in the defense industry has fueled speculation about whether a Northrop-Boeing (BA) merger might make sense, though the Pentagon is pushing for more power to block defense mergers and preserve competition.Boeing's stock price climbed 1% Wednesday.JPMorgan also upgraded fellow defense aerospace supplier B/E Aerospace (BEAV) to overweight from neutral. B/E shares rose 3.2%.Credit Suisse initiated coverage on a number of managed care stocks.

249,HUM,"The general consensus is that real estate investment trusts aren't a great place to be at the moment amid the prospects for higher interest rates. Many REITs carry a lot of debt, which gets more expensive as rates rise. Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs.But REITs' general performance this year hasn't been all that bad. IBD's property REIT industry group is down about 2% year-to-date, in contrast to a mostly flat performance for the S&P; 500.The group has rallied nicely since bottoming in early September. There's no shortage of tattered charts in the space, but several REITs in today's IPO Leaders screen are showing relative price strength that shouldn't be ignored.National Storage Affiliates (NSA) went public in April at 13 a share. It's a small company, but the operator of self-storage facilities has plenty of positive qualities.It's turned a profit in the past two quarters, and year-over-year sales growth has averaged nearly 100% in the past four quarters. Funds from operations (FFO) are expected to come in at 24 cents a share this year, with growth ramping up in 2016, rising 138% to 57 cents a share.What National Storage has going for it is that the self-storage space is not where you find long-term leases typical in many other areas of the REIT market. If economic growth continues to hum along, or even get better, self-storage REITs can raise monthly fees easily and make more money.National Storage also has a sound chart. It's currently seeking support at its 10-week moving average for the second time after a breakout from a first-stage IPO base in September. It currently yields around 5.1% on an annualized basis.Fundamentals also look strong when it comes to data-center REITs. QTS Realty Trust (QTS) has doubled from its IPO in October 2013. Big Data isn't going anywhere anytime soon. In fact, it's probably going to get even bigger, so data-center REITs like QTS stand to benefit. FFO are seen surging 41% in 2016 to 72 cents a share. QTS offers a yield of 3%.Store Capital (STOR) is also small and somewhat volatile, but it's working on a cup-with-handle base with a 23.23 entry. Goldman Sachs brought the company public one year ago at 18.50. Store invests in single-tenant real estate and currently yields around 5%.

251,HUM,"Shares of Centene (CNC) moved higher Tuesday after the managed care firm topped quarterly earnings views, helped by a strong rise in managed care membership.The Q3 results followed news that Centene is a step closer to finalizing its $6.8 billion buyout of Health Net (HNT).On Friday, Health Net shareholders overwhelmingly approved the adoption of the merger agreement. Also Friday, Centene shareholders voted to approve the issuance of Centene common stock to Health Net stockholders in connection with the deal, which was originally announced in July.Meanwhile, Centene logged Q3 earnings of 84 cents a share before the open Tuesday. That was up from 67 cents the prior year and well ahead of consensus estimates of 78 cents. Revenue climbed 31% to $5.8 billion, roughly in line with views.Managed care membership grew 24% to 4.8 million. The company posted a Health Benefits Ratio of 89% for the quarter vs. 89.7% the prior year.""The quarter reaffirms our strong fundamentals and momentum that positions us well for the balance of this year and 2016, including the combination with Health Net,"" CEO Michael Neidorff said in a statement.Centene upped its full-year EPS guidance to a range of $2.84 to $2.90, up from prior guidance of $2.74 to $2.82. Before the Q3 earnings report, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected full-year EPS of $2.81.Centene shares closed up 4.8% to 60.84 on the stock market today. Shares are still well down from the high of 83 set in early July.Health Net's stock price rose 2.8% to 65.17.Centene's Health Net buyout is one of a few big deals to hit the managed care sector this year.In July alone, UnitedHealth (UNH) closed its $12.8 billion buyout of Catamaran, a pharmacy benefits manager; Aetna (AET) announced plans to buy Humana (HUM) in a $37 billion cash and stock deal; and Anthem (ANTM) said that it would acquire Cigna (CI) for $54.2 billion.Follow Vance Cariaga on Twitter: @IBD_VCariaga.

266,HUM,"ObamaCare exchange enrollment sank by more than 300,000, or about 8%, from the end of June through September, eight big insurers disclosed in third-quarter earnings reports.
"
267,HUM,"On Friday, Humana (HUM) helped fill out the picture, reporting that it lost 61,800 exchange customers, or 9.2% out of the 671,400 total at the end of Q2.
"
268,HUM,"These eight big insurers, including UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Aetna (AET), accounted for just under 40% of national exchange enrollment in June. Their results suggest that national enrollment has continued to sink from 9.9 million at the end of June to perhaps 9.5 million or lower at present. A drop below 9 million by year-end looks like a good bet based on the decline during last year's fourth quarter.
"
269,HUM,"ACASignups.net, which compiled the data, noted that if national enrollment fell in Q3 at the same rate as it did for this group of insurers, it would have dropped to about 9.2 million at the end of September, but the actual decline was probably more modest. Charles Gaba, who runs the enrollment-tracking site, also posted data from a small sample of states that saw roughly flat enrollment in Q3, while exchange membership jumped in Massachusetts, which has no cut-off date for signing up.

Exchange customers at Centene (CNC) fell 7%, from 167,400 to 155,600. UnitedHealth Group saw a relatively tame decline of less than 2%, from about 550,000 to 540,000.

281,HUM,"Follow Jed Graham on Twitter @IBD_JGraham.ObamaCare exchange enrollment sank by more than 300,000, or about 8%, from the end of June through September, eight big insurers disclosed in third-quarter earnings reports.On Friday, Humana (HUM) helped fill out the picture, reporting that it lost 61,800 exchange customers, or 9.2% out of the 671,400 total at the end of Q2.These eight big insurers, including UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Aetna (AET), accounted for just under 40% of national exchange enrollment in June. Their results suggest that national enrollment has continued to sink from 9.9 million at the end of June to perhaps 9.5 million or lower at present. A drop below 9 million by year-end looks like a good bet based on the decline during last year's fourth quarter.ACASignups.net, which compiled the data, noted that if national enrollment fell in Q3 at the same rate as it did for this group of insurers, it would have dropped to about 9.2 million at the end of September, but the actual decline was probably more modest. Charles Gaba, who runs the enrollment-tracking site, also posted data from a small sample of states that saw roughly flat enrollment in Q3, while exchange membership jumped in Massachusetts, which has no cut-off date for signing up.Molina Healthcare (MOH) saw ObamaCare marketplace membership sink from 261,000 to 226,000 during the quarter. The 13.4% drop was the biggest on a percentage basis among the eight publicly traded insurers. Still, Molina is feeling pretty positive after having just 15,000 members at the end of 2014.Aetna saw enrollment slide just over 11%, from about 920,000 to 815,000. Anthem (ANTM) saw enrollment fall by 69,000, or 7.7%, to 824,000. Exchange customers at Centene (CNC) fell 7%, from 167,400 to 155,600. UnitedHealth Group saw a relatively tame decline of less than 2%, from about 550,000 to 540,000.HealthNet (HNT) said its ObamaCare-plan customers fell from 350,000 to 334,000 in the quarter, a 4.6% decline, but that includes off-exchange customers, which make up about one-fourth of the total. Cigna (CI) saw individual market enrollment slip 3.6%, from 223,000 to 215,000, but it didn't disclose how many of those are in exchange, off-exchange or grandfathered plans.Low enrollment is a concern for ObamaCare because the exchanges are having trouble getting enough young adults to balance out the risk of a customer base that has higher medical costs than expected.

302,HUM,"Environment: The only thing more outrageous than the EPA's release of three million gallons of toxic waste into Colorado's Animas River has been its cavalier response to the disaster in the days since.On Sunday night, EPA regional director Shaun McGrath told a town hall meeting in Colorado that the EPA would ""hold ourselves to the same standards that we would anyone that would have created this situation."" Right.This is an agency that will aggressively fine businesses, municipalities and anyone or anything else for even the slightest violation of its ridiculously strict standards, but that will face zero fines for its own environmental catastrophe.It's an agency that claims that even the tiniest levels of pollutants are extremely hazardous, yet has been busy downplaying the damage after its own incompetence caused the release of millions of gallons of toxic waste.A few hours after the spill, an official EPA statement described it as nothing more than a ""pulse"" that had ""dissipated in about an hour.""Previous pollution had already killed off most fish in the Animas, it said, so there was no real risk to wildlife.The agency didn't even bother to notify New Mexico officials until almost 24 hours after the breach about the menace heading their way.In the days following, EPA officials kept telling the public that no health hazard had been detected and that there was no threat to drinking water.As late as Monday, McGrath was still saying he couldn't give an assessment of potential harm to people.He couldn't? The EPA allows only minuscule amounts of these same metals in the air and water because it thinks they are so harmful.The ""safe"" level for arsenic in drinking water is a tiny 10 parts per billion. Its hugely expensive mercury and air toxic rule was designed to get coal and oil plants to cut already tiny emissions of mercury, cadmium and other such pollutants.Yet tests have shown lead spiking at thousands of times higher than government-approved levels, arsenic at 800 times and extremely high levels of beryllium, cadmium and mercury because of the EPA spill.And the spill has affected seven water systems in New Mexico and Colorado — where the EPA is now delivering bottled water.When it comes to pollution, the EPA appears to have one set of rules for itself and another for everyone else.

A day before the Aetna-Humana announcement, mid-sized insurers Centene (CNC) said it would acquire Health Net (HNT) for $6.3 billion.Still, the number of health insurance giants could fall to three — UnitedHealth, Anthem and Aetna — in the near future.That is, if antitrust regulators allow the takeovers to go forward. Investors aren't so sure. Humana is trading at a significant discount to Aetna's offer, while the spread has widened on the Centene-Health Net deal. Cigna's relatively modest rise late Wednesday also may indicate market doubt that the deals will get down.On the one hand, a handful of big insurers may have more market power to raise premiums or limit benefits. But they also could drive harder bargains with hospitals and drugmakers, helping consumers.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter: @IBD_ECarson.

339,HUM,"In a research report, Trefis said the decision ""benefits insurers such as UnitedHealth"" partly because ObamaCare customers ""may not be able to afford private health insurance without the subsidies.""
"
340,HUM,"Maintaining the subsidies ""means that the private health insurance market should be able to sustain its growth going forward,"" Trefis said. ""Furthermore, UnitedHealth should be able to maintain its industry-leading market share in private health insurance, which is a major business for the company. ""UnitedHealth Group (UNH) should log solid if slower growth when it reports Q2 earnings on Thursday. Meanwhile, some industry watchers wonder whether the nation's biggest health insurer might be interested in entering the industry's consolidation sweepstakes.Reuters, citing tweets from CNBC, reported on Thursday that UnitedHealth ""was looking to bid for Cigna (CI)"" even as Cigna and Anthem (ANTM) have reportedly rekindled merger talks. Last month, Cigna spurned a $47.5 billion takeover from Anthem.Another mega-merger, between Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM), is already in the works.UnitedHealth's stock price rose more than 2% to 122.12 in afternoon trading Friday. Shares set a new high of 124.11 on June 26. The company boasts a very strong IBD Composite Rating of 98.All of this plays out as UnitedHealth prepares to report Q2 earnings before the open on Thursday. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS of $1.59, up 12% from the previous year. Revenue is seen climbing 9.5% to $35.66 billion. If those results hold up, it would mark the third straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth for UnitedHealth.During the first quarter the company grew earnings 33% and revenue 13%. It was the biggest earnings gain since the second quarter of 2012 and the biggest top-line increase in at least three years.Q1 results featured another strong performance from UnitedHealth's Optum Health Services platform, which delivered a 15% year-over-year revenue gain to $13 billion. Optum includes a managed care business, software and consulting unit, and pharmacy benefit management (PBM) service provider.The PBM unit, OptumRx, will get much bigger when UnitedHealth closes its $12 billion acquisition of Catamaran. That deal, announced on March 30, is expected to close during the fourth quarter.The combined entity will serve 65 million customers, which should give UnitedHealth's PBM business the kind of scale and bargaining power to land better deals on drugs and make it more competitive with CVS Health (CVS) and Express Scripts (ESRX), analysts say.Meanwhile, UnitedHealth and other managed care stocks appear to have gotten a lift from last month's Supreme Court decision to uphold the health care subsidies allowed by the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare.In a research report, Trefis said the decision ""benefits insurers such as UnitedHealth"" partly because ObamaCare customers ""may not be able to afford private health insurance without the subsidies.""Maintaining the subsidies ""means that the private health insurance market should be able to sustain its growth going forward,"" Trefis said.

393,HUM,"As consolidation fever grips the managed care industry, Molina Healthcare (MOH) prefers to ""stick to our knitting,"" as chief financial officer John Molina likes to say.Its knitting since its founding in 1980 by Molina's father, David Molina, has revolved around the health care needs of low-income people who face barriers to care.Based in Long Beach, Calif., not far from where it was founded, Molina operates health plans in 11 states and Puerto Rico, most of them managed-care Medicaid programs for low-income and needy populations.If the pending merger of Centene (CNC) and Health Net (HNT) goes through, Molina would be ""the purest of the pure plays"" in Medicaid managed care and, more broadly, government-aided programs for low-income populations, Molina said in an interview with IBD.""We don't want to get into the broad commercial business. We don't want to take care of Medicare retirees who play golf three times a week,"" he said.Managed-Care MedicaidAs it happens, the managed-care Medicaid market is the fastest growing segment of the managed care industry, says Brian Wright, an analyst with Sterne Agee CRT.""About 28% of all Medicaid expenditures are in managed-care Medicaid,"" he said. ""Our view is that this is a market that can triple from where it is (today).""Molina is benefiting from that growth as states shift Medicaid patients to managed care programs. It also has gained business from state exchanges under ObamaCare, covering the ""lowest income levels,"" says Wright.Molina's largest number of members are in California, Washington, Florida, Ohio and Texas.In April, Molina added Puerto Rico to its roster, covering around 350,000 members for more than 3.3 million in total. It's currently bidding for new business in Iowa and Georgia. But the company is also looking to grow in existing markets such as Florida and Texas.""We're hiring folks. We're expanding. At the same time, we're sticking to the core business dad put us into 35 years ago,"" Molina said.The company is still a family business of sorts. Molina's older brother, Mario Molina, is the CEO; his sister, Martha Molina Bernadett, is an executive vice president. Both are physicians. ""I went to law school and became the numbers guy,"" Molina said.Through various trusts, the Molina family owns a 25%-30% stake in the company, Molina says. The company went public in 2003.New contract wins and privatization of Medicaid programs will continue to drive Molina's top-line growth, says Ana Gupte, an analyst with Leerink Partners.Revenue has grown around 26% on a compounded annual rate over the last two years. But growth has picked up sharply this year. In the first quarter, revenue jumped 53% over the earlier year to $3.2 billion. Enrollment grew 38% across all its health plans.Its Florida health plan alone added 185,000 federally subsidized exchange members in the quarter, resulting in a tripling of premium revenue over the prior year.Earnings per share in the quarter soared to 56 cents a share from 10 cents. Second-quarter results will be released on July 30.Economies Of ScaleAnalysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate that Molina's revenue for all of 2015 will jump 49% over last year to $14.4 billion, slightly above Molina's forecast for $14.3 billion. They see earnings rising 99% to $2.59 per share.""We have the lowest (general and) administrative costs in the managed care industry,"" said Molina, noting that it's around 8% of revenue compared to the average 12% to 15%. The company forecasts a 7.6% ratio for the full year.Even though it's a relatively small managed-care player compared with UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Anthem (ANTM) and Aetna (AET), which plans to acquire Humana (HUM), ""scale and critical mass give it leverage to improve fixed costs,"" Gupte said.Rather than drive costs down through a merger, Molina seems more intent on improving net profit margin to 2% from less than 1% by increasing revenue on its own. It raised around $400 million in a secondary equity offering in June and has since announced three small acquisitions for putting that capital to work.The three are in Florida, Michigan and Illinois, states where it already has business.Molina's scale in local markets is viewed as more crucial by some than scale across state borders. ""The benefits of scale (through mergers) have been greatly exaggerated in this industry,"" Wright said. ""You have to have local market share. There are plenty of quite successful (companies) of smaller scale such as Molina. It's growing nicely organically. I think it has enough scale in the Medicaid business in its major markets to compete quite effectively.""Analysts have speculated that Molina might indeed get swept up in merger mania, though. Much of the speculation has centered on a combination with WellCare Health Plans (WCG) . Molina wouldn't comment as a matter of policy.But Molina did offer an argument against a merger: ""There is a notion people have that being larger is beneficial. Medicaid is in some respects unique because it is one state at a time. You don't do Medicaid across three states at once, so economies of scale are a little different.""Wright doesn't rule out a potential merger. But he doesn't think Molina ""needs to be bought.""""I think there are plenty of people interested in buying it,"" he said. ""The question is, at what price? The issue with price is that people don't want to pay what its value will be three years down the line. Potential acquirers have vastly underappreciated the growth of the company and the Medicaid business in general.""

It's just the latest example of AP's steepening political slant.Five photos AP snapped of Cruz at a ""Celebrate the 2nd Amendment"" event, held Saturday at a shooting range in Iowa, included images of handguns seen in the background so it appeared one was aimed at Cruz's forehead.AP claims the chilling juxtaposition was an accident, even though it moved five of these obscene photos.AP photographer Charlie Neibergall knew from his digital camera what his photo would look like, yet he shot more. The photo was tightly cropped to frame just the head and gun, and AP's editors OK'd it for release.Putting Cruz, the ""Tea Party"" poster boy and the object of media elite scorn, in crosshairs was no mistake.""The images were not intended to portray Sen. Cruz in a negative light,"" an AP spokesman vainly insisted.Yes, just like photos it's taken of President Obama at angles that make circular objects behind him appear to frame his head like a halo weren't meant to portray him as, well, saintly. Please. AP demonized a conservative it detests in the same way it beatified a liberal it reveres.Studies show that the vast majority of national journalists — including AP — vote Democrat, not Republican.A Rasmussen poll conducted last decade found almost three times as many Americans see AP as ""tilting to the left when reporting the news"" than leaning to the right.With each election, the news agency's political advocacy becomes more transparent.Last month, AP issued strikingly different headlines announcing the presidential candidacies of Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Carly Fiorina.""Hillary Rodham Clinton, in kickoff to 2016 campaign, embraces her potential to make history,"" AP gushed. Compare that love note to the ho-hum headline for Fiorina, who also could be the first female president: ""Former technology executive Carly Fiorina says she's seeking GOP presidential nomination.""On foreign policy, AP is no less tendentious.In fact, a former Mideast correspondent for AP last year charged his old employer with a deep-rooted bias against Israel. Ex-AP reporter Matti Friedman accused the organization's Jerusalem bureau of having an innate ""distaste for Israel"" in its conflict with Hamas terrorists. He said, for example, that explicit orders were given ""to never quote"" pro-Israel research groups.AP also advises reporters in its influential stylebook to use benign terms such as ""rebels"" or ""militants"" to describe Islamic terrorists. Bowing to pressure from Islamist groups, it cautions against using the term ""Islamist"" to describe Muslim radicals or extremists.Three years ago, AP banned the phrase ""illegal immigrant"" entirely from its lexicon.In its coverage of the black church shooting in South Carolina, AP shamefully lumped together the racist white shooter with police officers who have had to use deadly force to subdue black suspects violently resisting arrest or attacking them. AP's reporter made it seem as if these black men were killed simply for ""coming into contact"" with cops, leaving out how jurors found police actions justified.AP also claimed that there's a recent history of murderous racist attacks on black churches in the U.S., when in fact the most recent event involving murder took place 52 years ago. Sadly, the nation's premier news service can no longer be relied upon to deliver news straight.

499,HUM,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is expected to produce its best performance in years when it reports first-quarter results Thursday, while its stock price continues to trade near record highs following a major acquisition at the end of March.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the nation's No. 1 health insurer to post Q1 earnings of $1.34 a share, up 22% from the prior year. If that holds up, it would be the biggest gain since the third quarter of 2012.Revenue is seen rising 9% to $34.6 billion, which would be the biggest top-line increase since the September 2013 quarter.In Q4 2014, UnitedHealth topped sales and earnings views, as its Optum Health Services platform delivered a 23% revenue gain. Optum includes a managed care business, a software and consulting unit, and pharmacy benefit management (PBM) provider.The PBM unit, OptumRx, will get a lot bigger when UnitedHealth closes its $12 billion acquisition of Catamaran (CTRX), which was announced on March 30. The deal is expected to close during the fourth quarter.The merged entity will serve 65 million customers — nearly twice the 35 million that Catamaran currently serves. That should give UnitedHealth's PBM business the kind of scale and bargaining power to land better deals on drugs, analysts say.""The combination of the two entities will take the total annual prescriptions filled to nearly 1 billion and make it the third largest player in the industry with a market share of around 20%,"" Trefis analysts noted in a recent report.In comparison, the report said, ""CVS Health (CVS) and Express Scripts (ESRX), which together control more than 50% of the PBM market, filled around 1 billion prescriptions each in 2014.""Trefis says OptumRx was the fastest-growing business in the entire Optum division in 2014: ""OptumRx revenues have almost doubled since 2010, and there was improvement in the bottom line as well. This is exhibited by the fact that EBITDA margins improved from under 3% in 2011 to 4.4% in 2014.""UnitedHealth has an IBD Composite Rating of 92.

576,HUM,"Monthly premiums for stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plans will likely fall next year as a number of sponsors consolidate offerings into lower-cost plans, according to a study released Monday by Avalere Health.After analyzing data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the health care advisory firm estimated that average premiums would fall by 2% to $38.95, from $39.88 in 2014.As premiums decline, Avalere warns, Medicare Part D sponsors ""may be shifting more cost-sharing responsibilities to beneficiaries."" For example, the proportion of prescription drug plans with zero deductibles in 2015 will drop to 42% from 47% in 2014.In addition, Part D sponsors ""continue to move away"" from offering coverage in the drug-coverage gap, or donut hole, as the Affordable Care Act gradually closes the gap. Some 74% of such plans will not offer coverage of drugs in the gap next year, Avalere said.""While beneficiaries will welcome lower premiums, they will need to look at other facets of benefit design, including how their medications are covered, cost-sharing responsibilities and total out-of-pocket spending,"" stated Christine Harhaj, senior manager at Avalere.Avalere noted a wide variance among the top plans. For example, a consolidated plan from Aetna (AET), called Aetna Medicare Rx Saver, will reduce premiums by 31% to $24.46, while WellCare Health's (WCG) Classic plan will go up by 52% to $31.46.The two most expensive plans are Humana (HUM) Enhanced at $52.81, up 11% from 2014, and the AARP MedicareRx Preferred from UnitedHealth (UNH) at $50.15, up 16% over 2014, Avalere said. The latter plan is also the largest by number of enrollments, at nearly 3.8 million.Humana also has among two of the lowest-priced 2015 plans: the Humana Preferred Rx Plan at $26.40 and Humana's Wal-Mart (WMT) Rx Plan at $15.67.The second largest plan by enrollment (at nearly 2.5 million), SilverScript Choice, will see average premiums fall by 21% in 2015 to $23.16, Avalere said. SilverScript Choice is offered by SilverScript Insurance, a CVS Caremark company, part of CVS Health (CVS).Another plan from UnitedHealth, the AARP MedicareRx Saver Plus, will have an average premium of $28, Avalere said.As for Medicare Advantage plans, Avalere found that the number of those plans will drop 3% amid continued government reimbursement cutbacks.

"
580,HUM,"Six years after the passage of ObamaCare, Republicans are no closer to settling on an alternative way of providing affordable private coverage to people in the individual market.The reason is clear. For all of ObamaCare's serious problems and unpopular mandates, and despite the bad deal it gives to far too many millions of working-class households and young adults, the reality is that it is helping millions of people. Low-income households and people with pre-existing conditions who couldn't afford decent insurance now can get the care they need.The problem with the GOP plans proposed by members of Congress and presidential candidates is that in crafting a deal that works better for people who aren't served well by ObamaCare, they overlook the consequences for those who would be lost without it.Donald Trump's plan would replace ObamaCare's premium and cost-sharing subsidies by letting people deduct individual market premiums from taxes. That would provide help to people in high tax brackets who earn too much for ObamaCare subsidies.But consider what it would mean for 64-year-old couples at 150% of the poverty level. Under ObamaCare, they can buy a plan with a $1,000 cap on out-of-pocket costs for about $1,000. Under TrumpCare, the same level of coverage would cost them just as much as an elite mentorship at Trump University: $20,000, or about 80% of their total income. (The higher cost factors in the reduction in subsidies as well as the repeal of ObamaCare's age-rating limit that lowers premiums for older adults.)While Trump's plan is worse than other GOP proposals on this score, they all make it impossible for low earners to afford an appropriate level of insurance. For example, under the Empowering Patients First plan authored by Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., the same plan that costs that 64-year-old couples $1,000 now might cost $18,000.GOP policymakers seem to understand that they'll have a big problem selling such a change to the public, so a who's who of conservative health experts recently unveiled a plan to kill ObamaCare softly. The trick is that the plan would let people choose between ObamaCare and the GOP vision of reform, the idea being that people will embrace the free-market Republican version of their own volition.""Some individuals would find themselves better off remaining in their ACA-purchased coverage for a time and could do so,"" wrote health policy wonks assembled by the American Enterprise Institute.They add that a GOP version of health reform is ""more likely to be reached if an ACA (Affordable Care Act) replacement plan wisely includes short-term transition provisions to defuse opposition.""Here’s the catch: The people who will have a reason to embrace the GOP plan will tend to be relatively young, healthy, moderate-income individuals who get little or no subsidies from ObamaCare and have to pay a penalty if they don’t buy coverage. Compared with their current treatment, getting even a modest subsidy to buy lower-cost coverage will be a fantastic deal.Draining younger, healthier people from the ACA individual market risk pool would undoubtedly trigger the kind of death spiral that conservatives have warned about, and facing this prospect, many insurers would simply refuse to participate. Already, UnitedHealth (UNH) has said it’s fed up with losing money and will exit the ObamaCare exchange business after 2016 if things don’t turn around. Aetna (AET), Humana (HUM) and many other insurers around the country also are losing money as they cover an insured group that’s less healthy and higher-cost than expected.If any insurers didn’t exit the exchanges at the outset of this transition plan, they would have no choice but to send premiums soaring, which could easily make after-subsidy premiums triple overnight.While Ohio Gov. John Kasich hasn't laid out how he would replace ObamaCare in detail, he seems to be starting with the right idea and likely the only idea that can lead to a workable plan — giving a better deal to the millions who get a bad deal under ObamaCare without taking away the good deal on which millions of vulnerable people depend.Among the few specifics he's offered, Kasich has said he would keep ObamaCare's guarantee that individuals can purchase insurance without being penalized if they are sick. (Trump initially said the same, then put out a plan that said the opposite.) That's a huge red flag for GOP policy wonks — and Democratic ones as well — because they see the individual mandate and coverage guarantee as a package deal: You can’t have the latter without the former, or else people will wait until they are sick to get covered. That would leave the insurance market prone to adverse selection, yielding excessive premiums and the risk of a death spiral.Yet those concerns are relatively simple to address. There is a logical path that starts by offering people a good deal and the flexibility to choose a plan that fits their budget, including no-cost plans that come with a Health Savings Account deposit for modest earners.Other key steps include easing age-rating for high-deductible and catastrophic coverage; broadening eligibility to include millions of low-wage, full-time workers that ObamaCare threw under the bus; and creating a level playing field between the middle class who get no help to buy individual market coverage and their peers who get government tax subsidies to buy employer coverage.Lastly, instead of imposing fines for not buying coverage, the government could gradually reduce the level of future health insurance tax subsidies for those who go uninsured, making it a no-win proposition for young invincibles to gamble that they won’t get sick.

642,HUM,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH), the country's largest health insurer, will be the first of the ""Big 5"" to report fourth-quarter results on Thursday. Analysts aren't expecting major surprises.They've already lowered their earnings estimate to $1.40 a share from $1.43, the consensus prior to the company's so-so Q3 results. But that would still be a gain of 17% over last year.In Q3, earnings just met views for $1.53 a share, up only 2% from the prior year. Revenue missed slightly, rising 12% to $30.6 billion. Revenue is seen climbing 8% in Q4, to nearly $31.1 billion.""The quarter is going to be pretty much in line, maybe a little higher than expected but not very much,"" said analyst David Windley of Jefferies & Co.Upside would likely come from stronger-than-expected results from UnitedHealth's OptumHealth, he says. In an investor day in early December, UnitedHealth said it expects ""exceptional"" growth from the health services business in 2014.Analysts will also be watching for commentary on the company's substantial Medicare Advantage business, the privately run version of the government's Medicare program, which has been impacted by reimbursement cuts.In a filing last week, Humana (HUM) said it expects gross sales and terminations for individual Medicare Advantage plans for 2014 to be ""meaningfully better"" than previously projected, resulting in Advantage membership gains in 2014.""UnitedHealth had taken the position that membership was more likely to be flattish and margin would be down some beginning in 2014,"" Windley said. ""So it will be interesting to watch if UnitedHealth's (Medicare Advantage) will also be better than expected.""He thinks the open enrollment period for this year will show higher numbers than expected.But Humana, in the same filing, increased its prior estimate regarding 2015 Medicare Advantage funding pressures from 4% to 5% to 6% to 7%, based on an update of medical cost trends from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.Deutsche Bank analyst Scott Fidel upgraded UnitedHealth's stock last week to buy from hold, based on expectations for 2014, namely higher price increases than its peers and a more conservative approach to the public exchanges than its peers.UnitedHealth may be considered a bellwether in the health-insurance industry, but it's been a contrarian on ObamaCare. Unlike its peers, UnitedHealth is largely sitting out the public exchanges this year, participating in only a handful of state exchanges.That may turn out to be a wise move. In the same filing last week, Humana said it now expects the ""risk mix"" of members enrolling in the exchanges to be ""more adverse than previously expected,"" presumably meaning more older, sicker enrollees than ""young invincibles.""Deutsche Bank downgraded Humana to ""sell,"" noting it has the softest premium increases of its peer group. Humana will report Q4 results on Feb. 5, with Aetna (AET) and Cigna (CI) following over the next two days.On Thursday, Credit Suisse upgraded Aetna to ""outperform"" on ""muted cost trends"" and synergies from its acquisition of Coventry Health Care last year.The other ""Big 5"" insurer, WellPoint (WLP), will report on Jan. 29.

"
667,HUM,"Cloud computing is no different. While the cloud has changed the way users can access, share and store data over the Internet, it also has opened up new avenues for hackers and other cybercriminals to ply their trade.
"
668,HUM,"Such risks, in turn, have boosted the need for precautions, opening up new opportunities for companies that make security and compliance applications geared to cloud computing environments.
"
669,HUM,"Qualys (QLYS), one such company, has seen demand rise for its solutions as more IT departments seek protection from security breaches that can happen via the cloud.
"
670,HUM,"Broadly, Qualys provides cloud security and compliance solutions designed to help customers identify security risks to their IT infrastructures and protect their systems from cyberattacks.

"
676,HUM,"The lion's share of Qualys' business comes from subscriptions to its vulnerability management solution. Organizations use it to manage their security with centralized reports, threat remedies and a remediation workflow. The reports let customers identify the severity of their security issues, find out how long it will take to fix them, and understand how they can impact business.
"
677,HUM,"Qualys has ample room to grow its vulnerability management business, Owens says. He notes that ""only 20% to 25% of existing customers are fully deployed on (vulnerability management) across their entire infrastructure and 75% own just one Qualys solution.""
"
678,HUM,"Meanwhile, Qualys has also taken steps to diversify its revenue stream.
"
679,HUM,"On a third-quarter conference call with analysts, Qualys CEO Philippe Courtot indicated that 84% of the company's revenue through the first three quarters of 2013 came from its vulnerability management solutions.

694,HUM,"""We remain upbeat on the company's opportunity as a leading provider of cloud-based security and compliance solutions as additional solutions are increasingly adopted by the installed base,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Breza noted.If there's one certainty in business, it's that anytime someone comes up with a new way of doing things, someone else will come up with a new way to rip it off.Cloud computing is no different. While the cloud has changed the way users can access, share and store data over the Internet, it also has opened up new avenues for hackers and other cybercriminals to ply their trade.Such risks, in turn, have boosted the need for precautions, opening up new opportunities for companies that make security and compliance applications geared to cloud computing environments.Qualys (QLYS), one such company, has seen demand rise for its solutions as more IT departments seek protection from security breaches that can happen via the cloud.Broadly, Qualys provides cloud security and compliance solutions designed to help customers identify security risks to their IT infrastructures and protect their systems from cyberattacks.The firm's QualysGuard Cloud Platform is an integrated suite of solutions that includes vulnerability management, Web application scanning and malware detection as well as policy compliance and payment card industry (PCI) compliance features.Its product lineup also includes Qualys Secure Seal, which lets businesses scan their websites for malware, find network or Web application vulnerabilities and validate the integrity of SSL certificates, which are a key part of secure browsing.Qualys' revenue has more than doubled in the past five years as rising use of cloud applications has driven greater demand for security products and solutions.""With the shift to cloud, enterprises are increasingly in need of solutions that can identity and prioritize threats,"" Rob Owens, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, noted following Qualys' third-quarter earnings report last week. ""Qualys is well-positioned to capitalize on these secular trends within compliance and application security.""Insights On RiskThe lion's share of Qualys' business comes from subscriptions to its vulnerability management solution. Organizations use it to manage their security with centralized reports, threat remedies and a remediation workflow. The reports let customers identify the severity of their security issues, find out how long it will take to fix them, and understand how they can impact business.Qualys has ample room to grow its vulnerability management business, Owens says. He notes that ""only 20% to 25% of existing customers are fully deployed on (vulnerability management) across their entire infrastructure and 75% own just one Qualys solution.""Meanwhile, Qualys has also taken steps to diversify its revenue stream.On a third-quarter conference call with analysts, Qualys CEO Philippe Courtot indicated that 84% of the company's revenue through the first three quarters of 2013 came from its vulnerability management solutions. While that's still a pretty big percentage, it is down from 87% the previous year.""We continue to make meaningful progress diversifying our revenue base ... due to increased sales of our Web application scanning and policy compliance solutions, both of which continue to show strong growth,"" Courtot said.With Qualys' Web application scanning tool, clients can test their apps without having to install or maintain software.

718,HUM,"On Jul 5, Centene Corp.’s (CNC  -  Free Report) shares hit a 52 week high of $128.02, ending the day a tad lower at $128.00.Recent positive developments, which includes the completion of Fidelis Care acquisition, securing New Hampshire Department of Corrections contract and other buyouts, seems to have spurred the stock.In a year’s time, the stock has gained a significant 57.5% compared with the industry’s growth of 28.5%. In fact, its performance looks more illustrious when compared with others in the space such as UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) and Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), which have registered gains of 33.3%, 28.5% and 25.3%, respectively.What’s Behind the Rally?The Fidelis Care buyout is a catalyst for Centene as the acquisition would poise the company well in the country’s four largest states. It will also aid expansion in Medicare Advantage and Exchanges.Recent Medicaid contracts in five states of Arizona, New Mexico, Iowa, Florida and Washington will bolster the company’s revenues.The recent acquisition of MHM Services positions the company well in the rapidly growing business managing benefits for correctional facilities. The company’s correctional health plans business has grown over the past year and the deal will expand its correctional presence to six states.Also last month the company’s subsidiary Centurion of New Hampshire was re-approved a contract for continuing the provision of medical and dental professionals to the New Hampshire Department of Corrections.In March, Centene completed the acquisition of Community Medical Group (CMG), which highlights its targeted approach toward vertical integration in healthcare. In addition to CMG’s primary care services, its specialty care, transportation and a suite of social and other support services is likely to enhance Centene’s service portfolio.In the same month, Centene made an equity investment in RX Advance, a full-service pharmacy benefits manager. The company expects to utilize RX Advance’s cloud-based technology platform to significantly reduce administrative cost and affordable drug-impacted medical cost.The company also acquired an additional 61% investment in Interpreta in March. It is an innovative health IT company focused on clinical and genomic data, as well as real-time analytics. These deals will help the company in developing its PB business, consequently aiding in savings by significantly reducing both administrative and drug impacted medical costs.Will the Momentum Stay?The company’s re-procurement wins, expansion into new markets, and future growth pipeline will drive its long-term growth. Moreover, the diversification into other businesses such as advisory services, data analytics, forging government partnerships in new markets   positions the company  for strong growth ahead.There seems to be no hindrance in the stock’s growth trajectory at the moment. Moreover, the stock looks attractively valued with a PEG ratio of 1.1 comparing favorably with the industry’s PEG ratio of 1.4.Centene carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

719,HUM,"At this time when the fears relating to trade war are flaring up, posing risk and uncertainty to a wide range of sectors and imparting volatility to the indexes, the U.S. health insurance industry is in safe waters.It is primarily domestic operations and relatively inelastic demand that have rescued the health insurance industry. Alongside factors such as changing demography, increasing employment, which fuels demand for employee health insurance, bodes well for the industry’s revenue growth.Also, factors such as increasing contribution from complementary businesses, product modifications, improved service, better claims handling, medical cost management, technological investment and upgrade, mergers and acquisitions plus healthy balance sheets have long sustained the mojo for health insurers, and there is no reason for a blip in the trend. The overall bullish scenario reinforces our sentiment in the growth cadence of the sector over the long run.The industry has rallied 12.25% year to date compared with the 1.7% increase clocked by the S&P 500 index.The buoyancy in the health insurance space is further confirmed by its  Zacks Industry Rank within the top 13% (33 of the 255 plus groups). In such a situation, it is a wise idea to invest in health insurance companies.Some stocks promising sturdy growth in this flourishing industry are Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report), Magellan Health, Inc. (MGLN  -  Free Report), Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report)  and WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report) .Each of these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) except Molina which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Let’s indulge in a comparative analysis of two health insurers — WellCare and Humana — to decide which is a better stock.While Molina Healthcare has a market capitalization of $6.4 billion, the same for Wellcare is $11.2 billion. While Molina Healthcare has gained 30% year to date Wellcare rose by 26%.Let's scan certain other parameters to find out which company is better positioned.Earnings ExpectationsEarnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company’s strong prospects.Molina’s current-quarter earnings are projected to grow 11,200% compared with 18.7% rise for Anthem. Looking at the full-year 2018 picture, Molina’s earnings are estimated at 725% growth while the same for Wellcare is expected to increase 20.5%.Thus, Molina has an edge over Wellcare in terms of quarterly and annual earnings growth projections.Earnings Surprise HistoryA stock’s earnings surprise history helps investors get an idea about its performance in the previous quarters.Both companies boast a decent earnings surprise history. Wellcare surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four reported quarters, while Molina beat in three.However, Molina visibly has a vantage point over Wellcare in terms of its four-quarter average positive earnings surprise, which reads 112.27%. Wellcare’s average beat is 51.7%.Return on EquityReturn on equity is a profitability measure, which reflects profits generated using shareholders’ equity.Hence, higher ROE reflects the company’s efficiency in using shareholders fund and is preferred by all classes of investors.The ROE of 20.1% for Molina Healthcare compares favorably with Wellcare’s ROE of 17.8%. However, both companies beat the industry ROE of 16.6%.ValuationThe price to earnings ratio to growth (PEG) ratio measures the price of a stock, the earnings generated per share (EPS), and the company's expected growth. A lower number or multiple is preferred to a higher one.The trailing 12-month PEG ratio multiple for Molina and Wellcare is 1.34 and 1.6 respectively, while that of industry is 1.35.This clearly shows that Molina is more valued than WellcareBottom LineOur comparative assessment shows that Molina is much better placed than Wellcare on all fronts.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

(KND) along with other companies, namely TPG Capital (“TPG”) and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe (“WCAS”).Per the agreement, Kindred’s long-term acute care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation facilities and contract rehabilitation services business were separated from its home health, hospice and community care businesses, which is collectively known as Kindred at Home.While Kindred Healthcare would be operated and owned by TPG and WCAS, Kindred at Home will be run as a standalone company by Humana, which owns 40 % stake in it. TPG and WCAS are entitled to a 60 % interest.

Kindred at Home being the largest home health company in the country would enable Humana to provide better clinical facilities, integrated with the member’s lifestyles.Care in the home is aimed at improving the health of senior members with chronic conditions within the comfort zone of their homes. The robust data sharing between Humana and Kindred at Home would offer a transformative platform for a brighter future with advanced capabilities such as remote monitoring, telehealth, digital interactions, etc.The buyout structure will provide Humana with an improved geographic and clinical scale in a capital efficient manner as well as reduce the company’s upfront capital outlay.

721,HUM,"Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has completed its acquisition of substantially all the assets of Fidelis Care for a transaction worth $3.75 billion. With this buyout, the company would be able to establish its presence in the state of New York.Fidelis Care, the leading government health plan provider in New York, would enable Centene to expand its nationwide dominance in government sponsored healthcare as well as enter New York, the country’s second largest managed care state in terms of membership. Centene will secure a leadership position across the country’s four largest managed care states including California, Texas and Florida, adding around 4,000 dedicated team members to its family. The transaction is effective Jul 1, 2018.Both companies are dependent on each other for respective experience, industry knowledge of their officers and other employees for executing business plans. The companies are closely aligned on various levels and expect to provide a better, accessible and cost-effective healthcare to communities they serve. The two corporate entities would also be able to create a space in government sponsored healthcare programs in the state.The acquisition will establish Fidelis in Obamacare, Medicaid and Medicare Advantage markets in New York. Medicare and Medicaid, the health plans for retirees are highly coveted by health insurers. Aging American population with baby boomers increasingly touching the retirement age on a daily basis act as a catalyst for heavily demanding Medicare Advantage, a private version of government sponsored plans.Medicaid is the third largest domestic program in the federal budget after Social Security and Medicare and the share managed by private insurers is rising as states shift more of their Medicaid population to managed care plans.These plans thus present a huge growth opportunity and players in the industry are vying for the same. Revenues from government business for UnitedHealth, Anthem, Aetna, Cigna, Humana have more than doubled since the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).Centene has always been dynamic and has widened its markets efficiently through mergers and acquisitions. In the past few years, the company grew its Medicaid membership and forayed into various international markets with consistent efforts. These inorganic endeavors are expected to boost the company’s top line in the coming years.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock have soared 54.80% in the past year, outperforming its industry’s rally of 29.32%.Key PicksInvestors interested in the Medical HMO can look into some better-ranked stocks like Molina Healthcare, Inc (MOH  -  Free Report), WellCare Health Plans, Inc.

722,HUM,"Changing U.S. demography with baby boomers entering retirement age in hordes has pushed up demand for products such as Medicaid and Medicare. This has led to strong membership growth with states turning to private players to manage these plans.Also, development of ancillary business in recent years to diversify revenue sources, in the wake of tough regulations laid on the health insurance business, has opened up new avenues of growth. These businesses, mostly in the form of health care services, are growing rapidly and forming a large part of the industry’s total revenues.Companies attach great importance to health services business, which enables them to play a role of a comprehensive health care provider and thus have made huge investments for expansion. Therefore growth in this business should continue, thus providing resilience to the industry’s top line.Despite revenue growth, medical cost increases and laws relating to minimum medical loss ratios have put pressure on the bottom line. Moreover, a shift in business mix in recent years from Commercial full risk to the less-profitable administrative services only, has partially offset the otherwise strong revenue growth.Nonetheless, better claims handling, medical cost management, technological investment and upgrade, application of blockchain technology, mergers and acquisitions, and healthy balance sheets should help health insurers stand tall going forward.Outstanding Industry ReturnsImposition of tough regulations from the Affordable Care Act and the subsequent regulatory uncertainty brought in by the Trump’s administration did not deter the industry’s growth. In fact, the health insurance industry has put up a good show and gained from an increase in insured rates, which have directly led to an increase in revenues, membership and earnings of the players in the industry. Strong capital levels across the industry have enable disciplined capital management via share buyback and dividend payments, which have further drawn investor attention.The Zacks Medial-Health Maintenance Organization industry, which is a stock group within the broader Zacks Medical Sector, has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.We see that the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 29.3% over the past year, while the Zacks S&P 500 Composite have rallied 12.8% and Zacks Medical Sector have declined 2.1%.One-Year Price Performance Health Insurance Stocks Look AttractiveThe industry’s outperformance over the last year explains to some extent its high steep valuation. We look at the industry’s price-to-earnings ratio (PE) ratio, the most appropriate ratio for valuing a health insurer as its earnings stability.The PE ratio essentially measures the company’s share price relative to its earnings. It tells how much an investor should pay for per unit of the company’s earnings.The industry currently has a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 17.6, which is at its median level over the preceding year. In the past year, the industry has traded in a range of 15.9 to 20.1.The space looks a bit stretched when compared with the market at large as the trailing 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 16.7.Price-to-Earnings Ratio (F12M)However, going a step further and considering the industry’s growth rate, which is reflected by its PEG ratio, we find the industry attractively valued. Its forward 12-month PEG ratio of 1.3 compares favorably with that of 1.7 for the S&P 500. This indicated the industry’s superior growth potential and an attractive valuation.PEG Ratio (F12M)Outperformance May Continue Despite Soft Earnings OutlookIncreasing demand for retirement products from the aging U.S. population should lead to an increase in Medicaid and Medicare products, which should aid the top line. Moreover, increasing employment will also drive employers’ demand for insurance for their employees. The formation of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) — a group of health care providers aimed at providing efficient care at lower cost — should help to keep a check on medical care cost, thus aiding margins.But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead. The earlier valuation discussion shows that market participants have been willing to pay up for these stocks already, potentially limiting further upside from the current levels.One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects for a solid price performance going forward is its earnings outlook. Empirical research shows that earnings outlook for the industry, a reflection of the earnings revision trend for the constituent companies, has a direct bearing on its stock market performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations from it and the aggregate stock market performance. The red line in the chart represents the Zacks measure of consensus earnings expectations for 2019, while the light blue line represents the same for 2018.Price  and Consensus: Medical HMO Industry This becomes even clearer by focusing on the aggregate bottom-up EPS revisions trend. The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018.Please note that the $10.98 EPS estimate for the industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom-up EPS estimate for every company within the Zacks Life Insurance industry but rather an illustrative aggregate number created by our proprietary analytics model. The key factor to keep in mind is not the industry’s earnings for 2018 but how this estimate has evolved recently.Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate RevisionWhile the consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Foreign Banks industry of $10.98 per share implies a decent year-over-year improvement (up 15.2%), the trend in earnings estimate revisions has not been favorable lately.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 0.8% downward since May 31, 2018.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates ImprovementThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all-member stocks.The Zacks Life Insurance Industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #93, placing it at the top 36% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Health Insurers Promise Long-Term GrowthThe long-term prospects for the industry are bright. When compared with the broader Zacks S&P 500 composite, the long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Health Insurance industry appears promising.Though the group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has moderated a tad since January 2018, when it was 13.29%, to reach the current level of 13.13%, the same compares favorably with 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.Mean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth RateIn fact, the basis of this long-term EPS growth could be a steady top line that the Zacks Health Insurance industry has sustained since 2010. Bottom LineContinuing consolidation in the industry should transform health insurers into comprehensive health care providers, which will enable the companies to offer superior care at lower cost thus aiding margins.Recently the Department of Labor released the final rule on Association Health Plans for small businesses across the United States, which is expected to benefit approximately 11 million citizens of America, working for such firms. This would also lead to higher demand for health insurance plans.Also, development of products and services, which include care delivery, population health management and engagement, health financial services, health IT, benefit operations, care operations and pharmacy care services, which complement their core business lines — Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid products — and enable enhanced service delivery and experience to their customers and will accrue to revenues and earnings.In recent years, health insurers have been moving to international markets. This shift is expected to continue given that the international markets remain underpenetrated. This should provide immense scope for growth.Therefore keeping the long-term projections in mind, investors could take advantage of the attractive valuation and bet on a few health insurance stocks with a strong earnings outlook.Below are four stocks with positive earnings estimate revisions and a bullish Zacks Rank.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)WellCare Health Plans, Inc.

723,HUM,"Estimates for Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) have been revised upward over the past 30 days, reflecting analysts’ confidence in the stock. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 earnings being raised 0.60% and 0.59%, respectively.Anthem is poised to gain from a thriving health insurance industry. A strong U.S. economy has enabled the health insurance industry to stand in good stead. A record-low unemployment rate and a gradual wage increase bode well for this space. High employment and wage growth fuel demand for health insurance and various other health-related services provided by insurers. Anthem flaunts an impressive Value Style Score of A. It also sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank of 1 or #2 (Buy) offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 28.39% in the past year, underperforming its industry’s growth of 34.18%. Now, let us focus on some important factors that make Anthem stock an investor favorite.Raised 2018 Guidance: The company has lifted its 2018 guidance. It expects its adjusted net income per share to be more than $15.30, a 27% increase from the level in 2017 and up from the prior projection of more than $15. Medical membership of the company is estimated in the range of 40.1-40.3 million, up from the past prediction of 40-40.2 million. Operating revenues are anticipated in the $91-$92 billion band, higher than the earlier forecast of $90.5-$91.5 billion. Consolidated medical loss ratio is assumed to be 84.4% plus or minus 30 basis points, a 10-basis point improvement at the midpoint from the previous outlook.Increasing Membership: The company has successfully grown its membership base, backed by solid acquisition strategies, rollouts of health insurance exchanges and national accounts in the commercial segment as well as Medicaid expansion in the government segment. Although in the first quarter of 2018, the medical enrollment dropped by new account wins in national and local group businesses. The company hopes to increase its membership base during the remaining months of 2018, banking on more investments.Growing Net Investment Income: Due to low interest rates, the company has been suffering at length. But the metric grew 15% in 2016, 11.2% in 2017 and 10.6% during the first quarter of 2018 on a year-over-year basis. This upside was attributable to Anthem’s impressive business strategies.Effective Capital Deployment: The company continued with its dividend payouts and share repurchases by dint of its strong capital and cash position. Initiated in 2011, the company has successfully hiked its dividend by around 160% over the past five years. During the first quarter of 2018, it further increased the dividend by 7.1%. The company also boasts aggressive share buybacks. In the first quarter, it bought back shares worth $395 million and had $6.8 billion of shares remaining under its repurchase authorization as of Mar 31, 2018.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the medical-HMO industry might take a look at a few better-ranked stocks like WellCare Health Plans, Inc.

724,HUM," On Jun 22, 2018, Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report) hit a 52 week high of $103.27 but ended the trading session at $101.48. The stock seemed to have gained investors’ attention after the recent receipt of Florida Medicaid contract.In a year’s time, shares of the company have surged 43% compared with the industry’s growth of 33%. What Led the Shares to RallyMolina Healthcare was awarded contracts to continue serving Florida Medicaid members in Region 8 (includes Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties) and Region 11 (includes Miami-Dade). Although the awards might currently diminish the size of its Florida Medicaid footprint across seven regions of the state, it still looks an upside for the company, which received no award during the first procurement, which would have otherwise caused a revenue loss from the entire Florida contract.The company was however, successful in getting contracts for two regions after it challenged the state’s decision. The company will also be able to expand and sustain the Marketplace as well as Medicare businesses in Florida.  These contracts are likely to fetch $550 million in annual revenues for the company starting Jan 1, 2019.The news brought in much relief to the company having recently lost Medicaid contract in Mexico.  Moreover, the Florida market presents a very good Medicaid growth opportunity for Molina Healthcare, given a large population of the state being enrolled in Medicaid plans.  Also, the receipt of Florida contract provides investors with a positive view on the company, reflecting its fare chances of performing well in the upcoming Pureto Rico and Texas Medicaid contracts.This further throws light on the efforts made by the company’s CEO Joseph Zubretsky to focus more on growing the most important area of the company’s business, which is, request for proposals to  provide greatest returns on investment.Further Upside Left?Moving ahead, the stock should get a further boost as it is showing marked changes from transformation initiatives, undertaken recently. New leadership, cost-cutting efforts, profit improvement initiatives and a focus on improving efficiency of core operating processes should aid the company’s results.The company’s first-quarter results, beating estimates by 111.11% and its increased 2018 guidance bear an evidence of early success, achieved from its transformational plans. Moreover, the company recently disclosed its progress on turnaround initiatives in detail, which showed that it is well on track for overall, well-balanced growth.Zacks RankMolina Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company’s significant nationwide presence, large and growing enrollment base, diversified premium revenues, business strategy and developed risk management program play an instrumental role behind its sturdy balance sheet and operating trends.The solid risk-adjusted capitalization is supported by consistent profitability, conservative high credit quality asset collection, etc. However, it was partially offset by dividends to the parent entity. A significant level of liquidity at the company’s insurance operations is led by growing operating cash flows that are again supplemented by credit facilities with the parent company.The operating performance of the company has been commendable along with top-line growth, rate hikes and organic growth. The credit rating agency expects the company’s operating margins to stay stable with the bottom line boosted by increased premium revenues.A.M. Best also expects the company’s membership o continue growing but at a moderate pace, driven mostly by Medicare and Medicaid.

726,HUM,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Triple-S Management (GTS  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move, with the stock up 14.7% over the past month. GTS hit a new 52-week-high of $41.92 in the previous session. Triple-S Management has gained 67.9% since the start of the year compared to the 2.3% move for the Medical sector and the 13.7% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 8, 2018, Triple-S Management reported EPS of $0.60 vs. the Zacks Consensus of $0.24, while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 4.93%.For the current fiscal year, Triple-S Management is expected to post earnings of $1.90 per share on $3.04 billion in revenues. This represents a 0.53% change in EPS on a 4.89% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $2.20 per share on $3.17 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 15.79% and 4.27%, respectively.Valuation MetricsTriple-S Management may be at a 52-week-high right now, but what might the future hold for GTS? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Triple-S Management has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 21.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 14.5X versus its peer group's average of 15.3X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.2. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Triple-S Management currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Triple-S Management fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though GTS shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does Triple-S Management Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Triple-S Management have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including WellCare Health Plans (WCG  -  Free Report), Anthem (ANTM  -  Free Report), and Humana (HUM  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Medical-HMOs industry is in the top 24% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for GTS, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

That is because the Jun 22, 2018 $260 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Humana shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Humana is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Medical - HMOs industry that ranks in the Top 40% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while seven have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $4.09 per share to $3.80 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Humana right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

728,HUM,"The Ensign Group, Inc. (ENSG  -  Free Report), has acquired the real estate and operations of McCall Rehabilitation and Care Center, a 40-bed skilled nursing facility located in McCall, ID. The acquisition came into effect on Jul 1, 2018.This acquisition reflects the company’s efforts to deepen its reach in the skilled nursing space, which is enjoying huge demand from an aging U.S population.  Per the company, between 2010 and 2030, the number of individuals aged 65 plus is projected to nearly double from 39 million to 73 million, a growth rate nearly five times higher than the 17% increase expected for the total population. This demographic change provides the company with immense scope for growth.Ensign Group has an established track of successful acquisitions. Much of its historical growth can be attributed to its expertise in acquiring real estate or leasing both under-performing and performing post-acute care operations, and transforming them into market leaders in clinical quality, staff competency, employee loyalty and financial performance.With each acquisition, the company applies its core operating expertise to improve these operations, both clinically and financially. In years when pricing has been high, the company has focused on integration and improvement of its existing operating subsidiaries while limiting its acquisitions to strategically situated properties.Over the last several years, the company’s acquisition activity accelerated, allowing it to add 169 facilities between Jan 1, 2008 and Dec 31, 2017, which added 12,434 operational skilled nursing beds and 4,433 assisted and independent living units to its operating subsidiaries.Ensign's growing portfolio consists of 185 skilled nursing operations, 22 of which also include assisted living operations, 51 assisted and independent living operations, 22 hospice agencies, 20 home health agencies and four home care businesses and one office building across 15 states.  The company also owns the real estate at 68 of its 236 healthcare operations. Last month, the company acquired an office building located in San Juan Capistrano, CA.  The acquisition was effective Jun 13, 2018.These acquisitions have led to a revenue and EBIDTA CAGR of 16% and 17%, respectively, from 2007-2017.We expect to hear about more of such deals since the company’s management stated that the organization is actively seeking opportunities to acquire real estate and lease both well-performing and struggling skilled nursing, assisted living and other healthcare-related businesses throughout the United States.The company’s acquisition strategy is also aided by its strong balance sheet, with low leverage of 31.7% (net debt to capital) compared with the industry level of 101.9%.In a year’s time the stock has gained 70.4% compared with the industry’s decline of 6.7%.Ensign Group currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

729,HUM,"A number of macroeconomic and political events like an increase in interest rates and inflation, trade tariffs, rise in oil prices have lent uncertainty and volatility across the markets this year, affecting a numbers of sectors and industries. But one industry that still has its head held high is health insurance, primarily because the relatively inelastic demand for its products and services largely has a domestic focus, which keeps it well insulated from international headwinds, including trade war fears and tariff concerns.Unlike last year, when there was a lot of noise in the industry from change in regulations, which ultimately saw the repeal of the individual mandate, the industry so far this year has been quiet on this front. Positive regulatory news, however, came up last month when the U.S. Department of Labor announced the new Association Health Plans (AHP).Higher Enrollment and Other CatalystsWith the U.S. economy on firm footing and regulations slowly easing, the industry looks well rooted for growth. Rising enrollment and top-line growth,  increasing contribution from complementary businesses, product modifications, improved service, demographic changes, expansion of international operations, better claims handling, medical cost management, technological investment and upgrade, mergers and acquisitions and healthy balance sheets have held the mojo for health insurers.Per a McKinsey & Co. report, the private payor market in North America is expected to grow from €583 billion in 2010 to €1,421 billion in 2025.Strong Growth From Retiring Baby BoomersMedicare and Medicaid — the government sponsored programs for the retiring population and the under privileged — have been in great demand from a huge population of baby boomers entering retirement ages. Moreover, the expansion of Medicaid has led to an increase in enrollment in this plan. Both these plans have seen increased participation of private health insurers as states reach out to them to effectively manage costs of these plans, which have been a huge burden on the federal budget.Medicare and Medicaid together account for nearly 60% of the revenues for the major health insurers. Revenues from these plans have more than doubled from 2010-2016.Increasing Revenues From Other SourcesThough health insurance coverage remains the main business in this industry, players have started to develop additional sources of revenues for diversification benefits. Major health insurers have developed a portfolio of products and services aimed at creating a holistic and integrated approach to individual health and wellness. These products and services, which include care delivery, population health management and engagement, health financial services, health IT, benefit operations, care operations and pharmacy care services complement their core business lines.In this context, UnitedHealth’s health services segment Optum is its poster child. The segment has been growing for the past many years and now accounts for a greater portion of the company’s total revenues.What Will Keep the Momentum Alive?The recent regulation regarding the affordable health plans for small businesses across the United States which will be effective from Sep 1 should be a net contributor to health insurers’ revenues. The plan aims to provide the same healthcare benefits to employees of smaller companies that are enjoyed by workers of bigger businesses. Such a provision provides small firms the power to negotiate costs and flexibility of healthcare coverage.The move is touted to assist small businesses that are vulnerable to the rise in healthcare costs. Further, approximately 11 million Americans, working for such firms would benefit from this development. This would also lead to higher demand for health insurance plans.Moreover, efforts to control costs via the formation of Accountable Care Organizations, which is a network of healthcare providers aimed at providing efficient care at low cost, use of blockchain technology, preventive care techniques and big data will aid earnings.A strong balance sheet across the industry characterized by an increase in free cash flow will lead to increased share buyback and in turn aid the bottom line. Also, investments in business should lead to long-term growth.Year to date, the industry has gained 10.9% compared with the 2.2% growth of the S&P 500 index and a decline of 1.5% for the Zacks Medical Sector.Attractive StocksThe industry’s growth has been relentless and there appears no roadblock in the near future. Thus investing in this space should be a wise choice especially at a time when the other sectors are facing the heat.Thus we point out four stocks with a Zacks Rank # 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) that have witnessed positive estimate revision for their current-year earnings.

730,HUM,"Credit rating giant Moody’s Investors Service recently downgraded the ratings of Community Health Systems (CYH  -  Free Report). The ratings include Corporate Family Rating (CFR), which were lowered to Caa2 from Caa1 and the Probability of Default Rating (PDR), which deteriorated to Caa2-PD/LD from Caa1-PD. The ratings outlook remains stable.The above was based on the company’s announcement of the final results of its debt exchange wherein holders exchanged part of unsecured notes due 2019, 2020 and 2022 for new junior lien notes due 2023 and 2024. The credit rating agency considered this transaction a distressed exchange, in other words, a default according to them. Moreover, Moody’s appended the PDR with an ""/LD"", indicating a limited default. However, it will be removed after three business days.The transaction largely addresses the company’s 2019 and 2020 notes maturities. The agency expects that Community Health will seek to amend or extend the maturity of its Term Loan G in the upcoming weeks. If the Term Loan G is successful, then the next significant debt maturity will be due Jan, 2021.Although the progress in extending maturities exists, the downgrade of the CFR and PDR ratings indicates the agency’s prediction of weakening interest coverage, cash flow and liquidity. It forecasts that the negative free cash flow over the next 12 to 18 months and interest coverage (EBITDA-capex/interest) to stay below 1.0x. A Caa3 rating was also assigned to the new secured junior lien notes due 2023 and 2024 by Moody’s. Additionally, the ratings on the remaining unsecured notes due 2019, 2020 and 2022 from Caa2, reflects the subordination to the new junior lien debt.The credit rating body has also downgraded the rating on the first lien secured debt from B2 to B3. The Speculative Grade Liquidity Rating was affirmed as SGL-3.Ratings RationaleCaa2 Corporate Family Rating indicates the agency’s expectation that the company will continue its operation with high financial leverage over 8.0x. The rating agency also anticipates negative free cash flow over the next 12 to 18 months because of the company’s significant capital requirements and high interest costs.Another concerning factor is the industry-wide operating headwinds which would limit operational improvement despite Community Health’s turnaround initiatives. The ratings have been supported by the company’s large scale, demographic diversity and divestiture plans.The proceeds would be used for repaying the debt of the company.Future Rating ActionMoody’s can downgrade the ratings provided there is deterioration in the company’s earnings, declines in liquidity or a rising risk of payment failure or wearing off credit recovery potential.The agency could upgrade the ratings if operational initiatives result in better volume growth as well as margin expansion. Also, declining leverage or improving free cash flow by dint of which, Community Health’s ability to refinance future debt maturities along with sustaining the current capital structure might lead to rating upgrade.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 13.38% quarter to date, outperforming its industry’s growth of 7.73%. Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the medical industry might take a look at a few better-ranked stocks, namely WellCare Health Plans, Inc.

731,HUM,"Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report) recently announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Molina Healthcare of Florida, Inc., has been granted Medicaid Managed Care contracts by the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA ) in Regions 8 and 11 of the Florida Statewide Medicaid Managed Care Invitation to Negotiate (ITN). Services under this new contract are expected to commence on Jan 1, 2019.The managed healthcare service provider caters to around 105,000 Medicaid members residing in the above-mentioned areas including Miami-Dade, Monroe, Sarasota, DeSoto, Charlotte, Glades, Hendry and Collier Counties. Revenues from these regions account for around $550 million.The contract awards will enable the company to serve quality health care to the Medicaid members in Regions 8 and 11 as well as expand its Marketplace and Medicare businesses in Florida. Moreover, this geographic footprint would contribute to the enterprise business portfolio of the company, lending it an overall boost.Molina Healthcare has filed protests of AHCA’s Medicaid Managed Care awards across all the 11 regions of Florida in May 2018. The outcome of these negotiations between Molina Healthcare and AHCA is the grant of awards in Regions 8 and 11. The company has withdrawn its protests from all the regions at present. Apart from the two regions where Molina Healthcare will provide care for Medicaid beneficiaries in 2019, the company would also continue to offer Medicare as well as Marketplace products across Florida.Medicare is a federal program that offers hospital, medical insurance and drug benefits to senior citizens aged 65 and above as well as to disabled people. Molina Healthcare, a primary operator in the government plans for Medicare and Medicaid, has grown its Medicaid membership from the expansion of Medicaid in 2014 under the HealthCare Reform Act.

732,HUM,"Credit rating giant Moody’s Investor Service recently assigned an A3 senior unsecured debt rating to the planned issuance of around $4 billion senior unsecured debt of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report). The total amount is due in June 2021, 2023, 2028 and 2048. The rating outlook stays stable.Net proceeds from the same would be used for repaying commercial paper borrowings as well as general corporate expenditure of the company (that might consist of redeeming or repurchasing outstanding securities or refinancing debt).Ratings RepresentationThe credit rating agency expects the proceeds to be primarily used for paying back $4.4 billion of commercial paper outstanding as of Mar 31, 2018. As such there should not be any considerable change in the company’s indebtedness.Moody’s debt-to-capital was 42.5% as of Mar 31, 2018, above the high end of its rating expectation. Moreover, the agency notes that the $4.9 billion worth acquisition of DaVita Medical Group, which is expected to be closed in 2018, would be paid through a combination of commercial paper, cash and debt. This acquisition will effectively increase the leverage ratio of the company to more than 44%, lying above the rating agency’s benchmark.As on Mar 31, the parent company had $587 million in cash and cash equivalents.The A3 senior unsecured debt rating and A1 insurance financial strength rating of UnitedHealthare based on its  strong business profile, primarily driven by its national presence, brand value, membership base, diverse benefits and services product offerings as well as an impressive level of unregulated revenues.The ratings also find support in a solid financial profile characterized by a steady, consistent earnings performance, a conservative and well-diversified investment portfolio plus a strong interest coverage from both regulated and unregulated operations. However, all these are partially offset by the aforementioned high leverage and a significant amount of goodwill and intangibles from past acquisitions.Factors That May Lead to  Rating ChangePer Moody’s, the ratings of the company may be upgraded if its financial leverage is maintained below 35%, EBITDA interest coverage is above 15x and a consolidated risk-based capital ratio is more than 275% of company action level.Additionally, the ratings can get downgraded if the financial leverage of the company is maintained above 40%, the RBC (risk-based capital) ratio is sustained below 250% of CAL as well as with a significant write-down or increased likelihood of goodwill or intangibles.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has surged nearly 40.6%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 34.6%. Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the Medical-HMO industry can also check out some other top-ranked stocks like WellCare Health Plans, Inc.

734,HUM,"UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) the health insurer major has carved a niche for itself in the health care industry by building up pieces of businesses that has given it enormous diversification benefits, both across product and geography.UnitedHealth’s business diversification has been achieved by fortifying its health service business, Optum, which over the years has grown to claim a greater share of the company’s total revenues. One of the main reasons for the company to nurture this business was that it remained largely insulated from the regulation which is applicable to another segment UnitedHealthcare, still the major contributor to total revenues.UnitedHealth has complemented its organic growth with targeted acquisitions that have helped it to achieve more in much lesser time. Its Optum business which provides services via three business segments — OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx — provide service capabilities in data and analytics, pharmacy care services, population health management, health care delivery and health care operations. Together, these capabilities represent a $1.4 trillion market opportunity, which implies huge growth for years to come.Coming to the other segment, UnitedHealthcare, has grown organically by more than 12 million people domestically since 2010, achieved via balanced, vibrant growth, serving increasingly diverse markets. The growth profile should continue given the company’s strong standing in the government business, which presents immense potential.  UnitedHealth is also one such company that has been able to lower medical cost for its customers via Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). These ACOs are groups of providers that are paid on the quality of service provided and not on the quantity of service provided as prevailed earlier.The company currently delivers more than $60 billion in care annually through contracts, with value-based features and is on course to raise that number to $75 billion by 2020.We expect the company’s impressive growth to continue as it remains an active acquirer of other businesses to strengthen an existing business or platform or provide a new platform for future growth or avail tools, technologies or skills that cannot be otherwise obtained or developed more efficiently.Moreover, in 2018 and beyond, we see the potential for sustained growth across markets served by the company, particularly in expanding government programs.Also, UnitedHealth remains the frontrunner in applying digital tools and data for health decision-making for its consumers. It is also using blockchain technology in its operations, which should enhance its overall business efficiency.Year to date, the stock has gained 14% compared with the industry’s growth of 12%. Its performance looks better than the growth of 4% and 5% for Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Aetna Inc.

735,HUM,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Humana (HUM  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 4.1% over the past month. HUM hit a new 52-week high of $301.81 in the previous session. Humana has gained 21.5% since the start of the year compared to the 1.5% move for the Medical sector and the 12% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 2, 2018, Humana reported EPS of $3.36 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.21 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0.39%.For the current fiscal year, Humana is expected to post earnings of $13.99 per share on $56.22 billion in revenues. This represents a 19.47% change in EPS on a 4.56% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $16.98 per share on $60.73 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 21.37% and 8.03%, respectively.Valuation MetricsHumana may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for HUM? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Humana has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 21.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 19.7X versus its peer group's average of 14.6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.56. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Humana Inc. Price and Consensus  Humana Inc. Price and Consensus | Humana Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Humana currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Humana passes the test. Thus, it seems as though HUM shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.

737,HUM,"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has decided to raise 2019 Medicare Advantage reimbursement rate by 3.4%. Notably, CMS previously proposed a hike of 1.84% in February but this rate increase is higher than expected.Following the announcement, shares of companies with exposure to the MA business like UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) and Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) rallied.Medicare Advantage (“MA”) plans were initiated by the government some years ago to control the rising cost of Medicare, a government program for the retirees. Notably, this MA plans were administered by private insurance companies. The health insurers often add extra benefits to make these plans more appealing to consumers, thus justifying its name — Medicare Advantage. The government reimburses a certain amount per enrolee to the health insurers in return of the care provided.Why Is Government Pitching for High Reimbursement Rates?MA reimbursement rates for private plan increased by 0.45%, 0.85% for 2018, and, 2017, respectively. The higher-than-expected increase in reimbursement rate for 2019 is meant  to attract the private health insurance players with the aim of increasing managed care participation. This move will alleviate government healthcare which is reeling under high Medicare costs.According to CBO, total Medicare spending is expected to increase from $708 billion to $1.4 trillion from 2017 to 2027.  Medicare spending is anticipated to rise more rapidly relative to GDP owing to a number of factors, including the aging population and faster growth in health care costs compared with growth in the economy on a per capita basis. In an effort to decrease the government’s burden of rising healthcare costs, it intends to rope in health insurers who are effective in managing costs.In fact, the government has actually witnessed cost reduction by delegating Medicare to the private players and is encouraging customers to opt for Medicare Advantage. The recent higher-than-expected rate highlights the government’s efforts to stabilize these plans and provide enough resources to the insurance companies to support beneficiaries enrolled in private Medicare plans.A Cash Cow for Health InsurersMeanwhile, these plans have been highly profitable for the health insurers. Since MA members have higher medical utilization rates, they bring in about three times more revenues than commercial members. This trend has aided top-line growth of the companies engaged in MA. Further, the health insurers have been able to maintain profitability in these plans by keeping claim cost down via measures such as preventive healthcare and accountable care organizations. This business has proven to be boon for the health insurance industry.In a year’s time the industry has gained 33.7% compared with the S&P 500 growth of 11.9%.MA — the Catalyst Behind Mergers and Acquisitions in the IndustryThe lucrative nature of this business along with the players’ intention to stake a claim in this rapidly growing market has fueled a number of mergers and acquisitions in the industry.According to KPMG, MA has only been around since 2003 but it is rapidly gaining popularity as a health plan and also among seniors dissatisfied with traditional Medicare. MA plans are in great demand amid the baby boomers, a rapidly growing generation, presenting an immense business opportunity.  KPMG projects the baby boomers population to be nearly 72 million by 2030 and almost 87 million by 2050. Per Anthem CEO Gail Boudreaux, 11,000 baby boomers age into Medicare eligible population ever single day.Analysis from Strategy&, PwC’s strategy consulting business, projects annual revenues for MA plans to rise from US$215 billion in fiscal year 2017 to more than $500 billion by 2025.The most recent merger speculation doing rounds is that of Walmart’s intention to buy Humana (which has nearly two thirds of its revenues coming from MA). Notably, this buyout also hinges around the coveted MA business. Its crystal clear that Walmart is planning to cash in on the MA business via Humana, an established player in this field.Recently Anthem stated that it is working to capture its fair share of the MA market.Other big acquisitions in this arena in  were UnitedHealth Group’s buyout of XLHealth Corporation, Preferred Care Partners and Medica HealthCare Plans. Further, Cigna's acquisition of HealthSpring, Humana’s takeover  of MD Care and Aetna Inc.'s (AET  -  Free Report) buyout of Genworth’s Medigap business are also noteworthy.  In the same vein, WellCare Health Plans, Inc. acquired Universal American Corp. last year and is still on hunt for MA opportunities.Bottom LineGiven that MA is one of the few areas which has a bipartisan support, its future remains bright. Industry analysts believe that the recent increase in reimbursement rates will lead to strong enrollment growth in this business in next five years.Also the players thirst for MA business still remains unquenched; consequently we expect more mergers and acquisitions on this front.Among the companies discussed above UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Anthem, Humana and Aetna all carry a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).

738,HUM,"Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) does it again. It looks like this omni-channel retailer is leaving no chance to strengthen operations and remain in focus – as evident from its latest plans to launch “Walmart2World” money transfer service. In a move to ease payments, the company plans to introduce this “game-changing model” in collaboration with MoneyGram International (MGI  -  Free Report), which is a money-transfer service provider across the United States and globally.Apart from this, there was a lot of buzz about Walmart being in talks to take over pharmacy start-up, PillPack – a news that broke out just few days after sources revealed chances of the big-box retailer to strengthen ties with Humana (HUM  -  Free Report). Though some analysts are skeptical about the Walmart – Humana deal, which could also be the reason behind the supermarket giant’s fall of 3.8% during yesterday’s trading session, many remain hopeful about the prospects.In fact, Walmart’s robust headways in healthcare space seem to have rattled investors of Rite Aid and Walgreens, as these stocks declined nearly 3% and 3.6%, respectively yesterday. Moreover, all these moves highlight Walmart’s assiduous efforts to take on Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), which dropped 5.2% on Apr 2. The e-commerce giant, which has taken retail competition to the next level, has also been making efforts to grab a hold in the healthcare space.Walmart2Walmart to Walmart2World: Lets Delve DeepWell, Walmart’s plans to launch Walmart2World, also marks another initiative to enhance consumers’ experience, which may help the company combat competition from Amazon. In fact, this is not the first time when Walmart has undertaken such a move. The retail giant introduced a low-cost Walmart2Walmart money transfer service about four years back, which generated customer fees savings worth about $700 million since then.While Walmart2Walmart serves customers on a domestic level, Walmart2World will help them send money to any MoneyGram agent location across about 200 countries in a jiffy, and at a low cost. Sources revealed that this global wire service, slated to hit all Walmart stores this month itself, is aimed at serving those U.S. customers who are classified unbanked per the World Bank's Global Findex.Further, with an exclusively transparent pricing structure; favorable exchange rate and speedy deliveries, this service stands apart from other international transfer services. Clearly, such features are likely to steer more traffic to Walmart’s stores, thus being a boost for its top line. Talking of boosting traffic, Walmart also opened its first high-tech supermarket in China, per a Reuters report issued on Apr 2. In this small supermarket, customers can use smartphones to make payments for products that are usually sold on Walmart’s stores on JD.com.PillPack to Enhance Walmart’s Healthcare Business?Moving to the rounds about Walmart buying online medication delivery provider PillPack for less than $1 billion, we note that both Walmart and PillPack remained silent for any comments. However, media sources, PillPack, which raised nearly $118 million as venture funds, is likely to ease Walmart’s customer orders and prescription management processes.Apart from filling prescriptions, PillPack also sorts pills according to individual doses; provides timely deliveries of refills and offers non-stop customer service. These services, particularly the pre-sorting as per time and date, is a benefit for customers taking miscellaneous medicines including aged customers. In fact, the company also introduced a prescription management software last year, called PharmacyOS – which is a boon for customers with complicated medications. Thus, we believe that PillPack’s acquisition will help Walmart drawing customers and enhance its healthcare services. The company operates pharmacies in most of its stores and Sam Club locations, while it also has in-store clinics in Georgia, South Carolina and Texas – per media sourcesWill These Efforts Keep Walmart Firm Against Amazon?Markedly, these constant initiatives should keep Walmart well placed against Amazon, which is planning to adopt a different way to ease experiences of potential customers with no bank accounts. Sources revealed that the online giant was in talks with J.P. Morgan Chase and other such financial institutions to serve young and unbanked shoppers. In fact, there were rounds that Amazon also approached PillPack at some point, which along with other strategies underscores its quest to dominate the healthcare space too. Nevertheless, Walmart has been neck-to-neck with Amazon, so much so that the company emerged as an omni-channel retailer officially earlier this year. In fact, with strength across its stores and online, this world’s largest retailer has rallied 21.7% in a year, in comparison with the industry’s growth of 20.9%. We expect such dedicated endeavors to help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company continue taking on Amazon.

740,HUM,"On Jun 19, President Donald Trump and his team made the final move toward affordable health plans for small businesses across the United States. The development originates from the executive order that Trump had signed in October 2017. The motive of such an order was to provide alternatives to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare.The move is touted to assist small businesses that are vulnerable to the rise in healthcare costs. Further, approximately 11 million citizens of America, working for such firms would benefit from this development. This would also lead to higher demand for health insurance plans. Under such circumstances, investors should consider betting on health insurance stocks.Terms of the New OrderThe U.S. Department of Labor presented the Republican answer to Obamacare earlier this week. The Association Health Plans (AHP) aims to provide the same healthcare benefits to employees of smaller companies that are enjoyed by workers of bigger businesses. Such a provision provides small firms the power to negotiate costs and flexibility of healthcare coverage. The plan will come into effect on September 1.Under the new plan, companies as well as individuals located in the same region or involved in similar businesses are allowed to form associations. Moreover, just like large employer group plans, AHPs would not be required to necessarily cover 10 types of essential benefits, including hospitalization, drugs and maternity care. Such requirements were compulsory under Obamacare.However, other ACA rules, such as the out-of-pocket maximum (OOP) that an individual has to pay in a year, bans on lifetime maximums and annual limits, would be applicable to AHPs. Moreover, preventive care services would be treated the way they were under ACA, wherein the beneficiary would not have to pay the OOP. Finally, the provision also ensures that coverage would not depend on how healthy or sick a beneficiary is.Small Retailers and Restaurants to Purchase More Health PlansAs a result, local restaurants and retailers from a specific area would form groups to participate in Small Business Health Plan. This not only provides cheap insurance but also boosts overall sales of health plans.From 2006 through 2016, there was a dip in health plan sales to a paltry 56% of all small business employees due to rising healthcare costs. Provisions under the AHP tackles this by allowing health policies to be available at extremely affordable prices. Most importantly, it allows such businesses to choose and create their own health plans to suit their needs.Experts believe that accessibility to affordable healthcare stems from the fact the people should have the ability and freedom to choose the coverage that suits their requirements. Increased federal spending and imposition of mandates only reduce the ability to insure one self.4 Best ChoicesTrump’s latest order to provide an alternative to the ACA would provide millions of Americans the freedom to choose their own health policies. Small business owners and retailers participating in group health plans would witness a reduction in administrative costs arising out of economies of scale. Such developments would not only improve the ability to insure oneself but also boost the overall sales of insurance policies.In this context, we have selected four stocks that are expected to gain from these factors. These four stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.WellCare Health Plans, Inc.

741,HUM,"Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) has decided to collaborate with Walgreens for providing better primary and other services to senior citizens via primary care clinics. Notably, Walgreens is a provider of trusted care, included in the Retail Pharmacy USA Division of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report). This alliance is part of the ongoing and shared commitment of both companies to the health and well-being of the Kansas City community.The partnership forged between Humana, a leading health and well-being company and Walgreens, the provider of trusted pharmacy services and care would essentially create a senior-focused neighborhood approach to health, which would include primary care, pharmacy, in-person health plan support and additional services for Medicare beneficiaries. The companies are also interested in expanding this collaboration into other markets in the near future.Partners in Primary Care, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Humana, would operate senior-focused primary care clinics (on a pilot basis) in two Walgreens stores in the Kansas City, Missouri area. Located most conveniently, the clinics are expected to open doors this fall with a spacious area of around 2,500 square feet and would complement Walgreens pharmacy services along with the four Partners in Primary Care centers, inaugurated last year in Kansas City.The clinics cater to aged people participating in a few Medicare plans.

Additionally, the unit caters to developing long-term relationships with patients suffering chronic conditions.Humana currently provides health-related programming and resources to its more than 65,000 Medicare Advantage and Medicare stand-alone Part D Prescription Drug plan members in the region. While Walgreens supports more than 75,000 Medicare beneficiaries in the Kansas City community through above 50 neighborhood pharmacies and other points of care.Humana expects its initiative with Walgreens to deliver a way simpler and better experience for people, which would in turn encourage them to take care of their health more seriously while being closely in touch with the doctors. This senior-focused care by the company is a continuation of its strategy to revolve around integrating care via clinical programs intersecting health with lifestyle. The humanitarian service also supports Humana’s multi-faceted approach to healthcare in general.The win-win program has aided Walgreens to expand its pharmacy services and expertise plus drive the digital tools and other programs, aimed at helping the grey populace in the community. It is one of Walgreens’ efforts to make cost-effective healthcare accessible to patients, providing them with a value-for-money experience.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have rallied 20.86% year to date, outperforming the industry’s growth of 12.87%.

(AET  -  Free Report), which should expand the combined entity’s scale and size in the industry.These health-oriented pacts point to the blurring of the boundaries between two subsectors of the healthcare industry such as, the pharmacies and drug stores and health insurers.

742,HUM,"On Jun 8, the stock of UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week high of $251.50, but ended the day’s trading session at $250.68. The news of dividend hike, a new share buyback plan, and tie-ups with a laboratory and a diagnostic company must have led to the surge in the share price.Catalysts in DetailInvestors viewed favorably UnitedHealth Group’s recent announcement to increase its quarterly dividend by 20% to 75 cents per share. The company’s current dividend yield of 1.24% is higher than 1.06% for the industry.  UnitedHealth is all the more attractive given lower dividend yields for the companies in the same space. For instance, Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) and Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) currently have a dividend yield of 1.14%, 0.69% and 0.02%, respectively.UnitedHealth has been increasing dividend every year since 2010 by a good double digits.

This board action replaces the June 2014 authorization, under which there were approximately 29 million shares remaining as of May 31, 2018.Late last month, UnitedHealth Group struck two long-term deals with laboratory-services companies Quest Diagnostics Inc. and Laboratory Corp. Via these agreements the insurer intends to control  soaring medical costs, since the payment for services to these labs will be made on the quality of the service provided compared with earlier mode of payment on the basis of quantity of service.These agreements will also enable UnitedHealth to utilize patient’s data available at these labs to provide more specific services to its customers.  Other factors that have led to a consistent rise in the company’s share price are its strong first-quarter earnings and 2018 earnings guidance increase, as well as the acquisition of Empresas Banmédica, a Chilean company, early during the year.In a year’s time, the stock has gained 40% compared with the industry’s growth of 33%.Further Upside Left?The company strong fundamentals featured by its vastly diversified operations, a strong balance sheet and growing membership should drive revenues and earnings going forward.

The bottom line, however, declined 12% year over year.Adjusted consolidated pretax income of $576 million declined 17% in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower earnings in the company’s Retail and Healthcare segments. This was partially offset by higher earnings in the Group and Specialty segment.In the fourth quarter, the company reported revenues of $13.2 billion, up 2.4% on higher Retail segment revenues from the company’s Medicare Advantage business and Group and Specialty segment.

Also higher earnings from the company’s military service business resulting from the TRICARE contract drove the upside.Healthcare ServicesRevenues of $6.02 billion decreased 6% year over year, primarily due to the company’s Pharmacy Solutions business as well as the impact of the optimization process associated with its chronic condition management programs.Operating cost ratio deteriorated 60 bps year over year to 96%.Adjusted pretax income for the segment was $227 million, down 19% due to optimization process associated with the company’s chronic care management program and higher operating cost ratio.Individual CommercialIndividual Commercial membership was 128,800 as of Dec 31, 2017, down 80% year over year, primarily due to a decline in number of countries where the company offers on-exchange coverage as well as the discontinuance of off-exchange products.Benefit ratio came in at 80.3% compared with 285.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year improvement primarily resulted from the planned exit from certain markets with higher benefit ratio and premium increases.The segment’s operating cost ratio came in at 25.9%, down from 51.3% in the year-ago quarter.

746,HUM,"Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) has sealed the acquisition of America’s 1st Choice, a privately held, for-profit Medicare Advantage (MA) organization.Financial terms of the transaction were kept under wraps and the transaction is expected to be slightly accretive to earnings in 2018.Positives for AnthemAmerica’s 1st Choice is a perfect fit for Anthem given its vast presence in Florida, a state which houses a large retiree population.Anthem should benefit from America’s 1st Choice’s proprietary technology tools, managerial processes and member engagement programs that deliver efficient, cost-effective health care services to its members.The acquisition aligns with Anthem’s long-term strategy to grow in the thriving Government business. The deal will allow the company to serve more than 130,000 members in Florida.Share Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, the stock has surged 42%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 38%. Given its progress on fundamentals and strong recent results the rally in the stock should stay alive.Industry TrendMedicare Advantage, a private version of the government-sponsored health insurance for retirees that provides extra benefits and services to seniors, has been in huge demand from the rising population of baby boomers.A number of acquisitions small and big have materialized as the players have been scrambling to grow in this line of business. Some of the notable ones are Cigna Corp.’s (CI  -  Free Report) acquisition of HealthSpring and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) buyout of XL Health Inc.The failed mergers of Anthem Inc. with Cigna Corp. and Aetna with Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) were also aimed at expanding the Medicare Advantage business.Our TakeThis deal comes as no surprise to us given Anthem’s desire to grow in the lucrative MA business. This deal will help especially after its blocked merger with Cigna, which would have made it one of the largest players in the MA market.  The company recently acquired HealthSun, one of the fastest-growing integrated Medicare Advantage health plans and health care delivery networks in Florida.The company is aggressively seeking to put its capital to use and is readily open to attractive acquisitions.

748,HUM,"United Health Services Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) owns and operates outpatient facilities, acute care hospitals plus behavioral healthcare facilities along with its subsidiaries.The company flaunts a favorable VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum with the score being a weighted combination of all three factors.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock have inched up 1.35% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s growth of 13.12%. Now, let’s focus on some important points that make United Health Services stock an investor favorite.Increasing Top Line: United Health Services has been witnessing steady revenue growth since 2013, riding high on the strength of solid inorganic growth as well as strong segmental performances, namely Acute Care and Behavioral Health. The company is expected to retain its revenue momentum in the future as well, backed by a robust performance across all its segments.Strong Performance of the Acute-Care Segment: The company has been experiencing a sturdy rise in this segment since 2012. Acute care mainly focuses on providing short-term healthcare to patients requiring urgent attention. Under this segment, the average number of licensed beds in the hospitals has been increasing, boosting the company’s revenues in turn. In 2017, net revenues earned from this segment improved 4.7% year over year. Last reported quarter, the trend continued with 4% improvement.Solid Performance of the Behavioral Segment: Focusing on treating patients with eating disorders, sexual trauma, disorderliness and autism, the Behavioral platform has witnessed a spurt in the number of licensed beds since 2012. This has favored the top line, nudging it up 1.7% year over year in 2017. In first-quarter 2018 as well, the segment rose 3%. Sound acquisitions in this segment have also led to growth in the addiction and mental health disorder market. The segment is likely to grow in the upcoming quarters as well, backed by the new laws.Underpriced: Shares of United Health Services are undervalued at the moment, which is a highly attractive proposition for investors. The company has a trailing 12-month price-to-equity ratio of 14.53, falling below the industry’s average of 15.07.Price Performance: In a year’s time, shares of the company have gained 1.35%, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s rise of 13.12%. However, the strong fundamentals are anticipated to drive the stock higher in the upcoming quarters.Acquisitions: The company’s buyout of adult services division of Cambian group in 2016 is assumed to expand the company’s presence in the U.K. along with its market presence in Nevada, courtesy of the Desert View Hospital purchase. The company is projected to widen its international base with more such integrations in the future.Profitability: The return-on-equity (ROE) of the company stands at 15.2%, comparing favorably with the industry average of (193.1)%, thereby underlying the stock’s growth potential. This also shows the company’s efficient usage of its shareholders’ funds.Growth Projections: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings per share is pegged at $9.41, representing a year-over-year increase of 24.97% on 4.42% higher revenues of $10.87 billion.For 2019, the consensus estimate for earnings per share stands at $10.20 on revenues of $11.4 billion, translating into a respective 8.46% and 5.15% year-over-year rise.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the Medical industry are WellCare Health Plans, Inc.

749,HUM,"Health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) has renewed its long-term strategic partnership with LabCorp, a leading global life sciences company providing comprehensive clinical laboratory and end-to-end drug development services.Per the agreement, LabCorp will continue to serve as UnitedHealthcare’s exclusive national laboratory provider till Jan 1, 2019. However, effective this date, Quest Diagnostics will become an “in network” lab for more than 48 million enrollees covered under the UnitedHealthcare plans. UnitedHealth has entered into a long-term agreement with Quest Diagnostic for the same.Via these agreements, UnitedHealth intends to bring the accountable care arrangements (ACOs) model of payments to the diagnostic companies. Both companies will together provide a variety of value-based programs, with the same aligned incentives and enhanced patient experience to lab services, like what we see in accountable care arrangements with UnitedHealthcare and more than 1,100 hospitals and 110,000 physicians.This would result in payment based on final outcome and quality of care provided compared with fee for service, which emphasized volume of care rather than quality.Under the fee-for-service model, unnecessary lab tests were prescribed by physicians which resulted in high reimbursement from insurance companies. A shift to value-based care is the need of the hour to make the healthcare system more efficient and reduce medical cost.UnitedHealth expects that within 10 years, half of all Americans will be receiving health care from physicians operating in highly evolved and coordinated value-based care designs because the outcome clearly demonstrates improved quality and consumer satisfaction while reducing the cost of health care. The company is working toward this structural shift from fragmented fee for service.Year to date the stock has gained 10.5% compared with the industry’s growth of 7.8%.Value-based reimbursement of services has gradually gained ground, but now all the major players Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report), Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) are moving full speed ahead.UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

750,HUM,"Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report), a health insurer, primarily dealing with government insurance products such as Medicare and Medicaid, is rapidly evolving into a diversified healthcare enterprise.Centene has resorted to a number of acquisitions and investments, which will add substantially to the company’s business portfolio. In April, Centene agreed to certain undertakings with the New York Department of Health. This includes a $340 million contribution to the State of New York to be paid over a five-year period. This contribution will be used for initiatives consistent with Centene's mission of providing high-quality healthcare to vulnerable populations within the state.In the same month, Centene completed the acquisition of MHM Services, a national provider of healthcare and staffing services to conventional systems and other governmental agencies. This acquisition adds one new state to Centene's portfolio to 13 states.In March, the company completed the acquisition of Community Medical Group (CMG), which represents the company’s targeted approach toward vertical integration in healthcare. In addition to CMG’s primary care services, its specialty care, transportation and a suite of social and other support services should enhance Centene’s service portfolio.In the same month, Centene made an equity investment in RX Advance, a full-service pharmacy benefits manager. The company expects to use the company's cloud-based technology platform to significantly reduce administrative cost and affordable drug-impacted medical cost.Also in March, the company made an additional 61% investment in Interpreta. This is an innovative health IT company focused on clinical and genomic data, as well as real-time analytics.These transactions testify to Centene’s continued execution on its diversification strategy. This would enhance its position as a healthcare enterprise and a leader in government-sponsored healthcare. Adding capabilities in the provider  pharmacy and technology categories should provide growth and margin opportunities for Centene well into the future.Centene has given a strong operational performance for the past many years, a trend which continued in the first quarter, marked by solid top and bottom-line growth and robust operating cash flows. Membership at the end of the first quarter increased 6%, revenues were up 13% and earnings per share surged 94%.Its robust results led to a 6.5% surge in share price, outperforming the industry’s growth of 1.9%.Centene carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are WellCare Health Plans Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report), Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Humana Inc.

751,HUM,"The healthcare sector is fast catching up with the digital revolution. Some of the trending hashtags in the healthcare space are #3DPrinting #BigDataAnalytics #BioPrinting and #ArtificialIntelligence, with #Blockchain being one of the favorites.Now, let’s take a look at how blockchain technology has been opening up avenues for investors who are keen on betting on the healthcare space.Blockchain’s Claim to FameBlockchain came into the limelight as the underlying technology for the most popular cryptocurrency — Bitcoin.An article on Investor’s Business Daily has defined blockchain technology as a shared public ledger, also known as a distributed database, which tracks and records transactions in a transparent and tamper-proof way.The estimates for the uptake of this technology are mind-boggling. Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (DB  -  Free Report) expects blockchain systems to record transactions for about 10% of worldwide GDP by 2027. Furthermore, Gartner Group believes blockchains have delivered $4 billion in business value-add or technology innovation in 2017, with that likely to swell to $21 billion, $176 billion and $3.1 trillion by 2020, 2025 and 2030, respectively (per the article on Investor’s Business Daily).Blockchain and HealthcareGiven the rising need for integrating data across plans and providers, the Healthcare sector is poised to gain the most from blockchain’s distributed ledger technology. This hi-end technology has the power to revive the healthcare industry by reorganizing operations, generating new business models and integrating patients’ medical records.On Apr 2, leading health care companies like Humana (HUM  -  Free Report), MultiPlan, Quest Diagnostics (DGX  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group’s (UNH  -  Free Report) Optum and UnitedHealthcare formed an alliance to launch a pilot program on this revolutionary technology. This program will study how the technology can be applied to cut down costs related to data management along with enhancing data quality and accuracy.In February, a Medicalchain ICO project, leveraging on the blockchain technology to maintain health records, was launched. Medicalchain allows different organizations like doctors, hospitals, laboratories, pharmacists and health insurers to seek permission for accessing a patient’s health record and store these transactions on the distributed ledger.3 Major Factors Driving the Blockchain & Healthcare IntegrationSystems for recording and managing medical data are slow, centralized and often extremely vulnerable. This in turn leads to a chain of issues that are adversely impacting overall healthcare services. Let’s discuss such problems in detail.Escalating Administrative CostsDoctors, hospitals and diagnostic information service providers, all have been shelling out roughly $2.1 billion every year to manage and hold records of healthcare provider data.We take a note that, recently a major alliance has been formed between Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report). The corporate behemoths came together to put a check on spiraling medical treatment costs by forming an independent health care company for employees in the United States.Medical Error — Leading Cause of DeathU.K.-based publisher of medical journals and clinical research, BMJ stated in a 2016 podcast that around 250,000 deaths every year in the United States are caused by medical errors (per an article on Crypto Currency News). The blockchain technology gives providers instant and complete access to a patient’s medical records.Growing Need to Strengthen Data SecurityThere is a growing need for healthcare organizations to prevent data hacking and phishing while maintaining confidentiality of patient’s health information. In this regard, a Cognizant research report states that around 49% of respondents in a survey stated that the transparent and tamper-proof nature of the transactions stored using the blockchain technology platform helps enhance customer satisfaction.Challenges Impeding the TransitionSince blockchain is a relatively new technology, it indeed is a challenge for key decision makers to understand its functionality and applicability.One of the most common problems faced by adopters of this technology is to maintain and streamline operations between different blockchains. Complicating the situation is the availability of various networks, each with different market strategies and structures. These networks are continuously competing to become the TCP/IP standard for blockchain. Per a Cognizant report, 62% of the respondents have cited this issue as a major bottleneck.Legal and regulatory issues also make adoption of this technology tough. Per a Cognizant report, healthcare payers and providers need to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) standards for governing the privacy and availability of Protected Health Information which impedes the uptake of blockchain.  Wrapping UpBlockchain technology holds immense potential to completely alter the healthcare space by addressing the key issues plaguing it.  In the words of Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld, blockchain “is the biggest opportunity set we can think of over the next decade.”Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

752,HUM,"The health insurers continue to gain traction from increasing enrollment, product development, business diversification, cost-control efforts, increased operating efficiencies and a strong capital position. All these led to both top and bottom-line growth for most players in the field. Many in the industry have also kept raising their full-year guidance at the end of each quarter, thus indicating their rising operational excellence.Banking on the above positives, the industry has gained nearly 35.9% in a year’s time, outperforming the S&P 500 average of 11.3%. The Zacks HMO industry is placed among the top 21% of the Zacks Ranked industries. Nevertheless, higher medical costs, public exchange woes, stiff competition, stringent regulations and compliance costs were a drag.Government Plans Look LucrativeDespite the prevalent uncertainty surrounding the efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, the industry continues to put up a good show in 2018.  We see sustainable growth potential in expanding government programs. The recent announcement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regarding raising 2019 Medicare Advantage reimbursement rate by 3.4% also proves that. This action will definitely attract the private health insurance players with the aim of increasing their managed care participation. Since the government plans have already been highly profitable for health insurers, their increased participation is likely to result in significant top and bottom line growth.Apart from this upside, an increasing focus on preventive and value-based care, growing accountable care organizations, international business expansion, mergers and acquisitions also keep the industry’s growth trend alive.Thriving Economy, Rising Interest Rates, Changing Demography Fuel GrowthGrowing demand for health insurance products and services on the back of changing demographics, increasing income, low unemployment and jobless claims continue to aid the insurance stocks. A strong economy enables people to spend more on their healthcare needs that again opens up scope for the health insurers. An ageing U.S. population also boosts demand for Medicare Advantage plans, especially designed for the retirees to control the rising Medicare costs. This in turn encourages more participation from health insurers ensuring profitability on this ground.Additionally, the recent interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve also bodes well for health insurers. The managed care companies benefit from the rising rates owing to a generally sizeable investment securities portfolio coupled with manageable debt levels.Consolidation in the IndustryOf late, increasing consolidation has been a major phenomenon in the health insurance industry. This in turn leads to market concentration, which should help players enhance their operational scale as well as gain a substantial market share.Health insurers are trying to integrate with pharmacy benefits managers to streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain. The recently announced acquisitions of Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) by Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report) and Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) underline the growing trend of two healthcare sector industries coming together to amicably provide a comprehensive care.Retailers have also expressed their interest in the health insurance industry. Humana has been in talks to get acquired by Walmart Inc. Eyeing the rewarding Medicare business provided to the surging baby boomers population, the retail major intends to invest big time in the health insurance industry.

753,HUM,"Shares of Tenet Healthcare Corp (THC  -  Free Report) scaled a 52-week high of $33.67 in yesterday’s trading session before closing a tad lower at $33.50, generating a skyrocketing year-to-date rate of nearly 121%. The stock has therefore substantially outperformed the industry’s 12.5% rally. This uptrend was primarily driven by the company’s solid performance in the first quarter and its raised guidance for 2018. We believe this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock to possess great growth potential, which is also apparent from its favorable Growth Score of B. Its long-term earnings growth rate stands at 13%.Now let’s dig deeper to analyze the reasons behind the company’s stock appreciation.Solid 1Q18 Results: Tenet’s shares have surged 39.9%, ever since the diversified healthcare services company exhibited a sturdy performance in all its segments.  The bottom line of 57 cents per share came in against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 2 cents and rebounded from the previous year’s loss of 27 cents.Banking on first-quarter outperformance, the company raised its 2018 guidance. Adjusted earnings per share are projected between $1.36 and $1.70, up from the earlier expectation of 73 cents-$1.07. Revenues are estimated in the range of $17.9-$18.3 billion. Tenet Healthcare anticipates adjusted free cash flow of $725-$925 million, up from $675-$875 million. It also lifted the upper end of the outlook provided for net cash from operating activities by $0.1 billion and now predicts the same between $1.245 billion and $1.550 billion.Executive Appointments: On May 16, Tenet announced to have appointed Paola Arbour as Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer and Marie Quintana as Senior Vice President and the Chief Marketing Officer. The expertise and knowledge of both should drive the company's performance in the future.Rating Upgrade: Recently, Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the B2 Corporate Family Rating and B2-PD Probability of Default Rating, senior secured rating of Ba3, Speculative Grade Liquidity Rating of SGL-2 and unsecured rating of Caa1. The rating agency upgraded the outlook to stable from negative to account for the benefits of $250 million derived from cost-reduction plan as well as a slight recovery in patient volumes.To wrap up, the above-mentioned factors along with the company’s core strength are likely to help Tenet continue its bull run.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors looking for other stocks worth considering from the same industry might also check out WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report), Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report).WellCare Health provides managed care services for government-sponsored health care programs.

754,HUM,"Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) has clearly emerged as the biggest contender, when it comes to taking new initiatives to strengthen its foothold against Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). From speedy deliveries to payment systems, from selling grocery to offering meal-kits online, both players have been in a raging competition for quite some time.Taking it further, Walmart’s plans to extend ties with Humana (HUM  -  Free Report) to enhance healthcare offerings, seems another bullet shot by the former in its war against the e-commerce king. Sources recently revealed that Walmart is in talks to enhance relation with Humana, which offers health insurance plans and other benefits for Medicare, individual or group insurance.  While both Walmart and Humana have remained silent over the issue, reports suggest that the deal between two giants could also be a merger or acquisition — where Walmart would scoop up the healthcare biggie. If the buyout of Humana (which currently has a market cap of about $37.1 billion) materializes, it will serve as Walmart’s biggest acquisition till date.Amazon Threat Responsible for This Move?Well, a move like this had to surface, given Amazon having its eyes on the healthcare space. Incidentally, there has been too much buzz about this e-commerce giant planning to foray the healthcare industry, especially since it announced plans to curtail health expenses and enhance care to U.S. workers, by teaming up with Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan. In another move, Amazon was also looking for ways to enter the pharmacy space, evident from its plans to hire workers to figure out a strategy for the same.  Apart from the supposed Walmart-Humana deal, there have been many other transactions in the healthcare space, largely stemming from fears instilled by Amazon that shook the grocery industry with its major buyout of Whole Foods Market last year. CVS Health’s potential buyout of Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), Cigna Corp's plans to buy Express Scripts and Rite Aid’s (RAD  -  Free Report) merger with Albertson's are some examples in this regard.   What the Walmart-Humana Deal Could Lead toComing back to Walmart, the supermarket giant has been expanding in healthcare for a while now. The company operates pharmacies in most of its stores and Sam Club locations, while it also has in-store clinics in Georgia, South Carolina and Texas – per media sources. Humana, on the other hand also has its own pharmacy benefits division, apart from about 200 standalone clinics for its Medicare members.While both the companies already share a Medicare drug plan aimed at lowering consumers’ drug costs, an extended alliance or buyout of Humana is likely to help Walmart emerge stronger in the field of providing primary care. Enhanced connections with Humana is likely to help Walmart leverage Humana’s patients and steer them to its stores. Further, combining retail and healthcare arms would help the companies undertake greater wellness endeavors and health plans for customers, like offering incentives for healthy food options.To this end, Walmart has already been working with Humana’s wellness rewards plan for more than four years now, which offers discounts on healthy food choices to customers who take an online health valuation. Such efforts not only help Walmart increase sale of its products like “Great For You” and “Go360”, but it also helps the retailer promote healthier lifestyle and reduce health care expenses.That said, we believe that the aforementioned Walmart-Humana merger or buyout (if materialized) is likely to be a win-win for both entities, especially for Walmart by strengthening its customer base and augmenting top line. This, in turn will solidify the big-box retailer’s position in the Amazonian retail world. Notably, Walmart’s continued efforts to battle Amazon’s growing dominance has helped its shares rally 26.8% in a year, surpassing the industry’s rise of 21.2%. We believe that with strength across both stores and e-commerce, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is likely to witness further growth.

755,HUM,"Keeping in line with the projected time of completion of the Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) deal, CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) recently announced that its shareholders have voted in favor of the $69-billion acquisition of the health insurance giant. While the market is abuzz with this historically biggest healthcare deal nearing a step closer toward completion, investors are hesitant about its effectiveness.The deal surfaced when three corporate behemoths — Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Berkshire Hathaway  and JPMorgan Chase & co. (JPM  -  Free Report) — disclosed their plans to transform America’s healthcare landscape through their newly formed joint venture in the space. This is forcing investors to think that the deal is an attempt by the healthcare giants to hold on to their position.Supporting this, the former Aetna CEO John Rowe, in a CNBC report stated that both CVS Health and Aetna are trying to expand their footprint in healthcare with the entry of e-commerce and financial giants. According to him, “It's not quite explicit yet what they're planning on doing but whatever it is, it's scaring CVS.”Vision in Favor of the Deal — A Vertical Integration?According to CVS Health, with the closing of this consolidation, the combined company is expected to bring together two complementary businesses. This will lead to the creation of a new community-based open health care model that is user friendly and less expensive.Rowe and many other economists also opined that this merger has fair chances of passing the regulatory hurdles. They see this consolidation as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one, thus leading to efficiency gain and a formidable cost-cutting strategy of CVS Health’s PBM (Pharmacy Benefit Management) platform. Notably, a horizontal integration dreads the chances of forming a monopoly powerhouse in the market.An article by Dana Blankenhorn published in InvestorPlace stated that based on this $69 billion deal, insurers will finally achieve the vertical integration they need to control costs. Per the article, the Humana (HUM  -  Free Report) acquisition proposed by Aetna was earlier rejected by the Obama administration because of its horizontal acquisition.The economists are looking forward to this development as they think this vertical integration might finally put brakes on America’s soaring health-care costs. Notably, total medical cost has inflated in the 6-7% range over the last four years based on the increasing bills of doctors, hospitals, medical devices and drugs (data published in The Economist article). Also, going by 2018 Deloitte data, global health care spending is projected to increase at an annual rate of 4.1% in 2017-2021, a significant escalation from just 1.3% in 2012-2016.Blankenhorn, in his article stated that to counter this problem, the CVS Health-Aetna deal will enable insurers to buy pharmacies to fight high drug prices through formularies and the lists of medicines that will be prescribed for various conditions. Using generics in formularies or choosing from branded drugs wherein generics aren’t available is a method to keep drug prices in check.The OppositionThose opposing the buyout are of the opinion that despite the two companies trying to strengthen their footprint in health care, both may finally end up paying severely for the merger. Akin to the supporters of the deal, the contrary view also underscores the cost-control agenda highlighting that the consolidation will apparently push the third-largest U.S. insurer Aetna’s huge client base into CVS Health drugstores to get the prescriptions filled through CVS Health’ drug plans. This move will in turn eliminate the middlemen’s role and other intermediaries, resulting in reduction of drug price and overall healthcare cost.However, the critics believe this to be a short-lived scenario and in the long term patients could end up incurring more medical expenses. Per a recent Vox report, this is because mergers like this will gradually make it more difficult for the new insurers to enter the market since they won’t be able to negotiate lower drug prices like larger firms. This will, in fact, diminish competition in the sector leading to inflated prices.CVS Health and Aetna both carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

760,HUM,"Observing the growing awareness on Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) worldwide and with the industry introducing advanced treatment options, CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) has recently launched a program on RA. Known as Transform Rheumatoid Arthritis Care, this newfangled initiative claims to be helpful for the company’s pharmacy benefit management (PBM) clients for better care and cost management of RA.Per management, this latest RA offering will be accretive to the company’s condition-specific, highly personalized Transform Care programs. This will further add value-based management strategies including outcomes based contracts and indication-based formulary for autoimmune conditions to CVS Health's integrated pharmacy care model. Notably, RA is an autoimmune disease causing chronic inflammation of the joints and other areas of the body (as per medicinenet). CVS Health has stated that this complex physical condition is now a top driver of specialty drug trend for PBM clients. On a positive note, the cost and utilization of drugs to treat RA are a top drug trend and spend driver, accounting for nearly half of overall specialty drug trends. Per CVS Health, this new multi-pronged approach propels a trend guarantee based on the program's ability to improve both clinical care and cost management for RA. Besides, this integrated pharmacy care model will help the company provide personalized, whole-patient support through specialty pharmacy and embedded AccordantCare nurses. The Transform RA Care program is aiding an appropriate use of lower-cost therapies through pharmacy network and utilization management tools along with value-based management strategies. Per the company’s prediction, clients enrolled in the Transform RA Care program could expect to see up to 5% savings on their annual RA drugs spend.  Significantly, the burden of RA is considerable. Per the Global Data report, the RA space across eight major markets of the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, Japan and Australia is set to expand to around $28.5 billion by 2025 from $19.5 billion in 2015, representing a CAGR of 3.9%. According to CVS Health, RA is the second most common form of arthritis, impacting more than 1.5 million people in the United States. Further, the treatment process is complex. Statistics show that approximately a quarter of patients on an autoimmune drug discontinues the therapy within 180 days, which may lead to poor health outcomes as well as higher costs for payors and members. We believe this latest program from the CVS Health stable will acquire a huge customer acceptance. In fact it effectively targets all the complications of RA treatment procedure.Share Price Performance  This leading provider of integrated services across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care has been outperforming the broader industry over the past six months.

761,HUM,"On Jan 16, we issued an updated research report on Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (CSII  -  Free Report). The company is a medical device manufacturer developing and commercializing innovative solutions to treat patients suffering from peripheral and coronary arterial diseases including those with arterial calcium.Shares of Cardiovascular Systems have outperformed the broader industry in the past 30 days. The stock is up 10.2%, better than the broader industry’s 2.9% gain. Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. Price Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. Price | Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. Quote A strong revenue performance has been consistently contributing to the upside in earnings of late. Also, an improved gross margin is encouraging. Additionally, the company’s fiscal 2018 guidance instills confidence in investors.Cardiovascular Systems firmly stands to gain from several favorable trends existing in the peripheral artery disease (PAD) as well as coronary artery disease (CAD) market spaces. Per estimates delivered by the American Heart Association, as many as 8-12 million Americans suffer from PAD. Moreover, an aging population coupled with increasing incidence of diabetes and obesity, is further likely to propel the prevalence of PAD. This offers a huge scope for the unique PAD Orbital Atherectomy System (OAS) of Cardiovascular Systems.Per management, another major concern is underdiagnosis with patients failing to show symptoms and/or physicians misinterpreting the same. So we believe, the PAD market space is still underpenetrated at large, providing Cardiovascular Systems with significant opportunities to expand in the market place.Among the recent developments, this St. Paul, MN-based Cardiovascular Systems has received an FDA approval for Radial Access Diamondback 360 Peripheral Orbital Atherectomy Device. Besides, the company has been conferred with a grant from Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS Micro Crown.On the flip side, the company operates in the competitive medical device industry, significantly affected by product introductions. Failure to expand business overseas might hamper growth. Also, on the profitability front, Cardiovascular Systems has a long history of net losses since its inception in 1989 with no immediate recovery in sight. Management still expects to incur net loss of $1-$1.9 million or loss per share of 3-6 cents in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.Zacks Ranks & Key PicksCardiovascular Systems carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

763,HUM,"Humana Inc.(HUM  -  Free Report) will report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 7, before the market opens.The company has an impressive surprise history. It has delivered positive surprises in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 6.6%. Last quarter, the company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 3.7% backed by solid performance of its Retail segment. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Humana’s retail segment has been performing well over past many quarters driven by the company’s Medicare and Medicaid expansion initiatives. The same trend is expected to continue in the fourth quarter as well. This is supported by the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.1 billion for the segment’s revenues, reflecting 1.6% year-over-year growth.The company’s consistent growth in premium revenues has been largely driven by Medical membership growth. Humana has seen solid medical membership increase in its Individual Medicare Advantage and Group Medicare Advantage businesses. The fourth-quarter 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate for total premiums is currently pegged at $12.8 billion, up 1.6% year over year.Other FactorsThe company is likely to witness growth in standalone Prescription Drug Plans membership in the fourth quarter, adding significantly to the Medicare business.However, Humana has been witnessing a rise benefit expenses over past many years. The same trend is expected to continue in the fourth quarter as well, putting pressure on margins.Humana’s Individual commercial membership has remained a drag due to the rise in premiums along with benefit redesigns in place since the beginning of 2016. Along with other companies like Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report), UnitedHealth Group, Inc (UNH  -  Free Report) and many more, Humana has also started scaling down this business and plans to exit it in 2018. This segment is expected to have continued to affect the company’s results in the fourth quarter as well, putting pressure on membership and the overall revenue growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Humana has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat estimates this quarter.Zacks ESP: Humana's Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.01%. The positive ESP is a leading indicator of a likely earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Humana Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Humana Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Humana Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: Humana carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

764,HUM,"In some market shaking news, e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced that they are partnering with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway  and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) to build a healthcare company in order to cut costs for their U.S. employees and improve worker satisfaction.As a result, shares of health sector companies are sliding in intraday trading. Insurance players like Anthem (ANTM  -  Free Report), Cigna (CI  -  Free Report), Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), and Humana (HUM  -  Free Report) are all down between 2.5%-5.5%, while pharmacy giants CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), and Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report) each dipped around 5%. Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report) is down nearly 6% as well.The goal of the partnership is to create a company with the sole intention of providing healthcare for its workforce, and the future entity will not aim to make a profit, but instead focus on the technology that will provide “simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare.”Amazon, Berkshire, and JPMorgan said that the kind of healthcare to be provided to employees will be long-term, and that they hope to bypass the frustration associated with securing healthcare from a third-party provider who is ultimately concerned with their own bottom line.“The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,” said Berkshire Chairman and CEO Buffett. “Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.”Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said that “Hard as [forming a new healthcare company] might be, reducing healthcare’s burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort,” while JPMorgan’s chief executive Jamie Dimon said the ultimate goal is to “create solutions that benefit our U.S. employees, their families and, potentially, all Americans.”There have been rumors of an Amazon entry into the pharmacy business for a while now—that so-called Amazon Effect—so this announcement is not entirely a surprise. The healthcare company is still in the “early planning” stages, though there is a temporary management team in place with leaders from each organization.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more. Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk. Bitcoin sank 25% or more 3 times in 2017.Zacks’ has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly.

767,HUM,"Humana Inc.’s (HUM  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results, scheduled to be reported on May 2 (before market open), is expected to see an increase in individual Medicare Advantage membership growth. This should be driven by better retention and strong sales during the recently completed Annual Election Period, or AEP. Market share gains in most states, with some of the company’s largest gains in Florida, Texas, Arizona and Illinois, would lead to MA business growth. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Individual Medicare Avdantage membership should be 3 million, up 7.1% year over year.This MA membership growth should drive the company’s Retail segment revenues, which are expected to be $12.2 billion, up 7%, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, investments made in this segment for long-term sustainability will lower its pre-tax margin. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for income before taxes is $282 million, down 23.8% year over year.The productivity initiatives undertaken in 2017 are expected to result in hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental savings for 2018, a portion of which will be classified as a reduction in medical costs versus operating costs. We expect to see the favorable affect of this on first quarter margins.  Humana’s pre-tax income from Healthcare Service is expected to be down in the first quarter. This will be due to three factors. First, impact from the optimization of chronic care management programs that took place throughout 2017, and second the company’s provider services business will experience lower pre-tax due to lower Medicare rates year over year in geographies where the company’s provider assets are primarily located as well as the cost of the organic build-out of its primary care assets in certain markets. Finally, this segment will bear some of the costs of the incremental investments made by the company as a result of tax reform. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, pre-tax income from this segment is $232 million, down 4.9% year over year.Share repurchases made by the company should provide an extra cushion to its bottom line.  Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 6.96%.

769,HUM,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Triple-S Management (GTS  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 17.9% over the past month. GTS hit a new 52-week high of $33.48 in the previous session. Triple-S Management has gained 32.1% since the start of the year compared to the -0.4% move for the Medical sector and the 7.9% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 8, 2018, Triple-S Management reported EPS of $0.6 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.24 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 4.93%.For the current fiscal year, Triple-S Management is expected to post earnings of $1.9 per share on $2.94 billion in revenues. This represents a 0.53% change in EPS on a 1.37% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $2.2 per share on $3.04 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 15.79% and 3.55%, respectively.Valuation MetricsTriple-S Management may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for GTS? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Triple-S Management has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 17.3X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 11.4X versus its peer group's average of 14.4X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.73. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Triple-S Management Corporation Price and Consensus Triple-S Management Corporation Price and Consensus | Triple-S Management Corporation QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Triple-S Management currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Triple-S Management passes the test. Thus, it seems as though GTS shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does Triple-S Management Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Triple-S Management have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks, including WellCare Health Plans (WCG  -  Free Report), Anthem (ANTM  -  Free Report), and Humana (HUM  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 26% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for GTS, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

771,HUM,"Given that repealing and replacing Obamacare was on the top of the Trump administration’s agenda, the healthcare sector exited 2017 quite creditably. Such gains are likely to continue with the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) up 23% over the last one year, a shade higher than the S&P 500’s increase of 22.1%. Also, though the individual mandate for Obamacare has now been abolished, prospects for the sector continue to remain bright.The all too familiar factors of an ageing population and steady demand for healthcare services, irrespective of economic conditions, continue to make stocks from the sector a lucrative option. Further, earnings and revenues from the sector are likely to improve in the fourth quarter, which makes it a good idea to pick up select healthcare stocks which are also slated to outperform their earnings estimates.2017’s “Repeal and Replace” ScareOne of President Trump’s clarion calls on the campaign trail, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act was always going to be high on his agenda. Initially, in March, the Trump administration unveiled the American Healthcare Act, which proposed to ring in radical changes, such as eliminating the taxes mandated under Obamacare. At the same time, it sought to retain some of the existing law’s more popular provisions.While the House of Representatives voted to pass the Bill on May 4, albeit by a narrow margin, the draft legislation failed to garner the requisite support in the Senate. Faced with a serious legislative reversal, President Trump instead issued an executive order and took other steps, all of which sought to weaken, if not replace, Obamacare entirely.Ultimately, the Trump administration sought to achieve its primary objectives, tax cuts and a new healthcare legislation, through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The new legislation effectively repeals the individual mandate, which is essential for the proper functioning of Obamacare.Healthcare’s Prospects Remain Undiminished And yet, after all of the current administration’s assaults, healthcare’s prospects remain as strong as ever. Data from Standard & Poor’s shows that up to September 30, 2017, healthcare had featured as the second best performing among the 10 major sectors for half of the last decade. Further, it had held on to third place for two more years. This implies that healthcare has been among the three top performing sectors for seven out of the last 10 years. This data alone is sufficient to guide investors into making investments in the healthcare sector.Further, we have the familiar factors of near undiminished demand, even during a downturn, and a rapidly aging population. There is no denying that healthcare isn’t among the leading prospects of sectors likely to ace fourth quarter earnings. Even so, total Q4 earnings for the sector are expected to be up 2.8% on 4.6% higher revenues.That’s far better than the more vaunted consumer discretionary and transportation sectors, earnings for which are expected to decline by 2.6% and 1.1%, respectively during the fourth quarter. Overall, total Q4 earnings are expected to be up +9.2% from the same period last year on 7% higher revenues. (Read: JPMorgan's Positive Kick-off to Bank Earnings)Our ChoicesHealthcare stocks have had a banner year, despite the continuous assault on Obamacare. However, the new administration’s approach to the healthcare industry in general has been more benign. For instance, little has been heard of the complaints about drug overpricing, an issue which both candidates touted steadily in the run up to the last Presidential elections.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement.

774,HUM,"Teladoc, Inc. (TDOC  -  Free Report) gains traction from a strong first-quarter 2018 earnings release as well as a solid guidance. The stock hit a 52 week-high of $47.15 on Thursday.What Drives the Stock?This telehealth service provider rides high on an inorganic growth profile, strong demand for its telehealth services, an increasing clientele base and a gradual march toward a breakeven profitability. All these factors have held stock in a good shape.Since the release of the company’s results on May 1, 2018, shares have rallied 22%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 2%. In a year’s time, the sock has returned 60%, significantly higher than the industry’s rise of 9.3%. Let’s look at the catalysts for this bull run:Investors note that the company is in growing stage and the consistent bottom-line losses over the past several quarters are a result of heavy expenditures incurred on marketing and substantial investments made to acquire new clients, build a proprietary network of healthcare providers and develop technology platform.All the more encouraging is that these investments are reaping fruits, reflected by a strong increase in membership, visits and client base. These upsides have contributed to an upsurge in revenues at the company, which has witnessed a CAGR of 74% during the 2014-2017 period. The top line skyrocketed 109% year over year in the first quarter of 2018.  The company’s inorganic strategies have provided enough fuel to its overall growth. A number of acquisitions, namely Best Doctors, HealthiestYou, StatDoc and BetterHelp completed in the past three years have enhanced growth in membership and visits. Both metrics registered a CAGR of 42% and 70%, respectively, during the 2014-2017 phase. The two were also up 41% and 57%, each in the first quarter.Investors are also confident about a decline in the expenditures with the company gradually starting to realize leverage from the scale of operations. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company reported a positive EBIDTA (first ever since its IPO), which shows that it is on track to achieve a bottom-line profitability. Though the company posted a negative EBIDTA in first-quarter 2018, management has issued a positive guidance for adjusted EBIDTA in the second quarter and also for the full year.Stock’s Unique Position in a Thriving IndustryTeladoc is fast gaining ground in the rapidly growing telehealth services industry in the United States with ample scope for flourish owing to concerning health care cost following inefficient care, duplication of services, significant waste and extreme variation in access, cost and quality of care.Teladoc can address this inefficiency in care by providing superior quality of care through a platform that caters to consumer demand and physician availability in real-time and in various modalities such as video, web, mobile and telephone.

777,HUM,"Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce first-quarter 2018 results on May 1, before the opening bell.The company is expected to gain from the projected increase in net income and adjusted earnings resulting from lower taxes, strong growth in individual Medicare Advantage products and group Medicare Advantage products, as well as lesser losses from the exiting Individual Commercial products in 2018.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 21.5%. This is depicted in the chart below:Aetna Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Aetna Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Aetna Inc. QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Aetna beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Aetna is +0.43%.Zacks Rank: Aetna has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsHigher Membership in Government Business: We expect higher membership in this business given the company's expansion focus. The Medicare business performed exceptionally well in the past several quarters and the trend is expected to continue in the to-be reported quarter, led by its strong star ratings, attractive product designs and increasing geographic presence. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, membership in the company's Medicare Advantage business should be 1.66 million, up 15.2% year over year. The same for Medicare Supplement should be 774,000, up 8.9% year over year.Tax Reform Upside: As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was effective in December 2017, Aetna projects its corporate income tax rate to decline. Aetna estimates that the tax reform will increase gross 2018 adjusted earnings by approximately $800 million, of which at least 50% will accrue to adjusted earnings. Thus the tax reform should benefit the company’s margins in the first quarter.Reduced Loss From Pubic Exchange Business:  Aetna has been suffering losses on its public exchanges business for the past two years. Lackluster results have forced the company to substantially reduce its risk exposure to these products for 2017. The company has significantly reduced its exposure to Individual Commercial products for 2018. The curtailment of this business will help in reduction of losses.Lower Revenues:  Aetna's revenues are expected to remain under pressure in 2018 owing to the sale of its domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance and absence management business lines; the previously disclosed Medicaid contract termination; exits from Individual Commercial products and continued repositioning of its ACA compliant small group Commercial products. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is $15.3 billion, down 1.13% year over year.Zacks Rank and Other StocksHere are some other companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Humana Inc.

778,HUM,"Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has extended the existing partnership with Tivity Health, Inc. (TVTY  -  Free Report) through Dec 31, 2022. Per the terms of the alliance, Humana would offer Tivity Health’s SilverSneakers fitness program to its Individual Medicare Advantage and Group Medicare Advantage members.What is SilverSneakers?Tivity Health’s SilverSneakers, founded in 1992, is an overall wellness program offered to Medicare-eligible and group retiree members of participating health plans. It offers a variety of options for all fitness levels and abilities with access to exercise equipments, classes and fun social activities at thousands of locations across the nation.Apart from Humana, another leading health insurer — UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) —  has also been providing Tivity Health’s SilverSneakers programs to its members.What Aids Humana?Humana is associated with SilverSneakers since 2004. The company has been successful in significantly motivating its Medicare Advantage members to actively improve their physical health. The extension of the alliance enables Humana to remain committed toward its Medicare Advantage members in order to help them achieve their best health.Humana’s constant approach toward connecting health and lifestyle has led it to include SilverSneakers as a key element in many of its Medicare Advantage plans to take care of one’s complete health with both physical benefits and social enrichment.The pact with SilverSneakers reflects the company’s focus on preventive healthcare, which benefits both the consumers and the company.  Preventive healthcare saves the consumers from serious sickness by educating them about various health precautionary measures. The company, on the other hand, gains from lower medical cost due to healthier consumers, which reduces its claim cost.Recent Alliances or PactsHumana has always been engaged in building strategic partnerships to improve the health of its Medicare Advantage members. In August 2017, the company joined forces with biotechnology company Amgen Inc (AMGN  -  Free Report) to improve health outcomes and efficiency. Prior to that, in July 2017, the company partnered with Oscar Health to offer commercial health insurance to small businesses in a nine-county Nashville area.Share Price PerformanceAlthough, last year, shares of Humana have gained 29.3%, underperforming the industry’s rally of 43.2%, its strategic initiatives are likely to favor the stock going forward.Zacks Rank                      Humana carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

779,HUM,"The year 2017 witnessed a lot of regulatory noise surrounding the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Also, health insurers scaled back their participation due to continued loss on public exchanges. Rising consolidation was another major issue.The ACA had brought more Americans under health insurance plans. It largely benefitted the industry through a reduction in uninsured population, consequently adding to medical enrollment.However, everyone was focused on President Trump’s decision to abolish the act. Although the ACA is still not repealed, Trump signed the ""Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"" into law on Dec 22, which would make significant changes to the law.The tax act ends the “individual mandate” — a major component of ACA — that requires individuals to have health insurance or face a penalty fee. In the absence of the individual mandate, healthy people are likely to opt out of medical insurance. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this would increase the count of uninsured Americans by 13 million and push premiums up by an average of around 10% from 2018 to 2027.Despite facing stringent regulations, health insurers have shown impressive operating performance in 2017, with most of the top players clocking solid top line, bottom line and membership growth. Companies like WellCare Health Plans Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report), Anthem (ANTM  -  Free Report), Humana (HUM  -  Free Report), Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) have kept raising their full-year guidance at the end of each quarter, indicating their rising operational excellence.Increasing consolidation in the health insurance industry has led to a reduction in the number of players. Although the effect of market concentration might not have been good for consumers due to higher medical cost, it has helped the players enhance the scale of their operations and gain market share.In 2017, although two big merger deals — Anthem with Cigna and Humana with Aetna — have been blocked by the U.S. Department of Justice, mergers and acquisitions activities continued to be rife.The recent merger deal between two of the industry stalwarts — Aetna and CVS Health — is worth a mention here. The deal, if finalized, would join two branches of the industry, in this case health insurance and pharmacy benefit management.However, public exchanges, formed to serve the underprivileged and patients, have not been much profitable for the insurers. They failed to attract sufficient enrollments from healthy and young individuals, which was required to balance the risk-return trade off. Health insurers like Humana, Aetna, UnitedHealth and Anthem have already started scaling back their participation from these exchanges after incurring mounting losses.Increasing operating costs related to regulations, investments in information technology, levy of fees and taxes also weigh on health insurers’ margins. The insurers, however, are trying to manage this cost issue with the help of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs).Despite the challenges, the industry has gained nearly 40.6% for 2017, outperforming the S&P 500 average of 20%. The HMO industry is among the top 4% of the Zacks Ranked industries.Stocks in FocusWe zeroed in on three stocks that have outperformed in 2017 and have also seen upward estimate revision in the last 60 days.Molina Healthcare, Inc.

780,HUM,"Dow futures have rocketed up more than 200 points in this morning’s pre-market on news that the Senate has passed its version of a tax reform bill in the wee hours of Saturday morning. The corporate tax rate shedding 15 percentage points — 35% to 20% — is one of the main items the Senate version shares with the House bill, which now faces reconciliation to make its way to President Trump’s desk, which he would surely sign.Same with the pass-through rate and the elimination of the estate tax. In fact, many of the main tenets of each bill fit together, which should help reconciliation (made necessary because the tax cuts were decided on purely party grounds: no Democrats voted for either bill, with only a few defectors from the GOP voting against). There are still some wrinkles that both sides will need to iron out, but because this is far from a bipartisan effort, common ground should be fairly easy to reach.More difficult will be those who were against the tax bills before they even saw the contents of them. Now that we can all see what’s inside, be prepared to see economists, former Treasury Secretaries, etc. to voice their opposition. Republican representatives of “blue” states — those which tend to follow Democratic policies which generally include higher taxes at state and local levels — should be preparing themselves to hear from their voting constituencies, once these citizens recognize that their taxes are likely to go up, not down.In order to help pay for the big tax cuts, elimination of tax write-offs such as state and local, medical costs and waived college tuition look to add tax burdens on millions of households. At the same time, wiping out the estate tax (dubbed the “death tax” by supporters of the current bills) and the Alternative Minimum Tax appear to be clear handouts to singularly high-wealth individuals. And the drastic corporate tax rate cut will already be a boon to shareholders of publicly traded corporations, another main piece of evidence that these tax reform packages are not aimed at working- and middle-class families, as regularly claimed by supporters, but those much farther up the economic food chain.All this is to say that the hard work may be yet to come. House Representatives and some Senators also face re-election in the coming year; if their voting constituencies see the current tax proposals as being sell-outs to the Wall Street upper class — which Candidate Trump explicitly campaigned against, it is worth noting — they may feel the expressed need to make their displeasure known.Return of the Vertical MergerPharmacy retailer CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) has come to terms to buy managed health care giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) for a cool $69 billion. This move looks to transform the way health care is managed, with agents of the deal calling the timing “perfect.” The idea is that costs for employer-supported healthcare will be more effectively managed by joining the retailer with the coverage. Recall a year ago, when a similarly sized merger between Aetna and competitor Humana (HUM  -  Free Report) — a horizontal merger, not a vertical one — did not pass antitrust regulation. This morning’s vertical arrangement may be seen more palatable by these same regulators.That’s not to say all vertical merger agreements get a free pass: AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) proposal to buy Time Warner  faces litigation from none other that the U.S. Department of Justice. Government antitrust regulators for this $85+ billion deal claim the merger woulds harm competition and raise consumer prices. Yet thus far, we do not hear similar rhetoric from the Justice Department on the CVS-Aetna merger. We will keep our ears and eyes open, going forward.

782,HUM,"Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has completed the joint acquisition of Curo Health Services (Curo) with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe (“WCAS”), collectively known as the Consortium. The transaction was approximately valued at $1.4 billion. Humana will own a 40% minority interest in this deal.A  nationwide leading hospice operator, Curo caters to patients at 245 locations across 22 states. Acquiring Curo is one of the latest moves by Humana in order to expand its medical care services portfolio to complement its evolving Medicare Advantage business that has been showing solid performance from past many years.Of late, Humana also completed its buyout of Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (KND) jointly with TPG Capital (“TPG”) and WCAS. Under this consolidation, Kindred Healthcare would be operated and owned by TPG and WCAS whereas Kindred at Home will be operated as a standalone company wherein Humana would hold a 40% ownership. This in turn, provides Humana with extensive geographic coverage.The Consortium intends to combine Curo with the hospice business of Kindred at Home for creating one of the largest hospice operators in the United States. This is also an excellent opportunity for Humana and its partners to establish themselves in a leading position in the continuum of home health, palliative care and hospice.The consortium has been actively investing and building businesses with a view to provide patients with modern and enhanced healthcare within the comforts of their homes. The integration of Curo is in line with its growth strategy since the consortium is well-equipped with a capable management team, is tech-enabled and has a centralized model, quite appropriate for hospice care.With Kindred Healthcare and Curo Health Services, the company is making full efforts to expand its presence in the growing home health and hospice care business.  These deals will enable Humana to provide enhanced services to its approximately 3.5 million aged Medicare Advantage members, which will open an additional source of revenues from the same customers.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have rallied 27.4% year to date, outperforming its industry’s growth of 14.1%.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks from the same industry include Molina Healthcare, Inc (MOH  -  Free Report), WellCare Health Plans, Inc.

783,HUM,"On Jul 10, President Donald Trump escalated fears of a trade war further by threatening to impose 10% tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods. The move comes within days of the two countries imposing tit-for-tat tariffs on goods worth $34 billion. This once again made investors jittery, leading to huge selloffs on Tuesday.Trade war fears have been keeping markets volatile for some time now and there seems to be no sign of the Trump administration pulling back anytime soon. Given this scenario, there are still a few sectors with domestic focus that seem to be safe from the ongoing U.S.-China trade spat.Trade War Fears Escalate AgainOn Tuesday, Trump once again raised his stake in the trade dispute, with China threatening to impose additional 10% tariffs on goods worth $200 billion. The new list contains more than 6,000 items that include food items, tobacco, chemicals, steel and aluminum, minerals and consumer goods. Per Bloomberg, the new list could be released by the end of this week.However, China’s commerce ministry didn’t say how it would retaliate but stated that it was “shocked” and would complain to the World Trade Organization. Understandably, China too is taking measures to retaliate to Trump’s threats, which will only extend the already-hostile relation between the two countries.Situation Worsens for U.S CompaniesU.S. companies have been feeling the heat for quite some time now, with Trump constantly threatening to impose tariffs on a host of Chinese goods. Finally, on Jul 6, the United States imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods. Consequently, China retaliated with tariffs on a similar amount of U.S. goods.Trump had already said that the United Stated could impose tariffs on goods worth as much as $500 billion if China retaliated. Understandably, Trump is going by what he had said and has hit back with tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. Many U.S. companies generate a significant portion of their revenues from China. Trade war fears had kept U.S. companies under pressure for the last few months. The markets finally took a beating on Tuesday, with Trump announcing a new set of tariffs. It goes without saying that fresh tariffs are a clear indication that the trade war is unlikely to come to a halt anytime soon.Our ChoicesTrade war fears are unlikely to ebb which and U.S. companies’ revenues from China are likely to decline from the raging trade storm. And a second wave of tariffs has only escalated these fears. Given this scenario, U.S. companies with a domestic focus look a lot safer as these remain insulated from the trade tensions.  So it makes sense to add stocks with domestic focus to your portfolio right away.However, picking winning stocks may be difficult. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report) is the leading builder of quality new homes in the most desirable real estate markets across the nation.The company has an expected earnings growth of 37.5% for the current year.

784,HUM,"Molina Healthcare Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 net loss of $4.10 per share against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 68 cents. The bottom line also compared unfavorably with earnings of 58 cents in the year-ago quarter.Operational UpdateIn the second quarter, total revenue of $5 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.4%. The top line has also grew 15% year over year, primarily due to an increase in premium revenues and investment income.For the quarter, total operating expenses rose 24% year over year to $5.3 billion. This was due to higher medical care costs, increased cost of service revenues, rise in general and administrative expenses, higher premium tax expenses as well as depreciation and amortization costs and impairment losses.For the quarter, medical care cost increased 25% year over year to $4.5 billion due to out-of-period claims development, particularly at the Florida, Illinois, New Mexico and Puerto Rico health plans.Continuously rising debt burden resulted in Molina Healthcare’s interest expenses increasing 8% year over year to $27 million.Molina Healthcare Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Molina Healthcare Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Molina Healthcare Inc QuoteFinancial UpdateAs of Jun 30, 2017, Molina Healthcare’s cash and cash equivalents increased 6% from year-end 2016 to $3 billion.Total assets grew 15% from the end of 2016 to $8.6 billion.The company’s shareholder equity declined 7.8% from year-end 2016 to $1.5 billion.Net cash used in operating activities totaled $47 million in the second quarter, down from $139 million used in the year-ago quarter.Restructuring and Profit Improvement PlanDue to the Molina Healthcare’s poor operating performance, it intends to implement a comprehensive restructuring and profitability improvement plan. Under the plan the company would streamline its organizational structure to improve efficiency as well as the speed and quality of decision-making.The company would re-design core operating processes, remediate high cost provider contracts and build high quality, cost-effective networks. Molina Healthcare will also restructure its existing direct delivery operations and review its vendor base.The company expects the Restructuring Plan to reduce annualized run-rate expenses by approximately $300 million to $400 million upon its completion in late 2018. Molina Healthcare also estimates that total pre-tax costs associated with the Restructuring Plan will be approximately $130–$150 million for the second half of 2017, with an additional $40 million to be incurred in 2018.Molina Healthcare expects a reduction of $200 million to annualized run-rate expenses resulting from staff reductions expected to be achieved by the end of 2017 and in time for full realization in 2018.Direct delivery operations will be restructured during the second half of 2017 and Marketplace participation will be terminated in Utah and Wisconsin in 2018.2017 GuidanceAt the end of first-quarter 2017, the company projected earnings per diluted share and adjusted earnings per diluted share to be $2.53 and $2.90, respectively for 2017.However, at the end the second quarter, the company withdrew its 2017 earnings guidance owing to uncertain medical cost trends in the Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, and Puerto Rico health plans, uncertainty around the funding of Marketplace cost sharing subsidies and potential variability in the timing of benefits achieved and costs incurred as a result of the Restructuring Plan.Our TakeDespite its numerous restructuring initiatives, Molina Healthcare's disappointing second-quarter results along with several headwinds faced by the company make us skeptical of its ability to return to profit any time soon. The company’s internal road blocks along with continued regulatory uncertainty in the health insurance industry will make the operating conditions difficult in days ahead.Zacks RankMolina Healthcare currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Performance of Other InsurersAmong the other firms in the medical sector that have reported second-quarter earnings so far, the bottom lines of Anthem Inc.

785,HUM,"Humana Inc.’s (HUM  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 operating earnings per share of $3.49 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by approximately 13%. The bottom line improved 6% year over year, primarily driven by the company’s individual Medicare Advantage and Individual Commercial businesses,partially offset by lower pretax earnings in the Group and Specialty and Healthcare Services segments.Operational UpdateAdjusted consolidated revenues of $13.3 billion grew 2% on higher Retail segment revenues from the company’s Medicare business, excluding the impact of revenues from its Individual Commercial business. However, revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.6 billion.Humana’s adjusted consolidated benefit ratio of 83.4% deteriorated 90 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017.Adjusted consolidated operating cost ratio of 10.7% improved 130 bps from the year-ago quarter, also due to the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for 2017.Quarterly Segment ResultsRetail SegmentRevenues from the Retail segment were $11.30 billion, up 3% year over year, primarily owing to higher revenues from the company’s Medicare Advantage business.Benefit ratio of 85.8% deteriorated 50 bps year over year, primarily due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017. The segment’s operating cost ratio of 8.5% improved 130 bps year over year because of the same reason.Adjusted pretax income of $613 million jumped 18% year over year, primarily due to lower benefit and operating cost ratios.Group and Specialty SegmentRevenues from the Group and Specialty segment were $1.83 billion, down 2% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due a decline in average group fully-insured and ASO commercial medical membership.Benefit ratio deteriorated 100 bps year over year to 78.4%, due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017. Operating cost ratio improved 110 bps year over year to 21.6%, due to the same reason.Adjusted pretax income of $102 million decreased 19% year over year due to the timing of revenues under the company’s TRICARE contract primarily relating to medical cost trend incentives and amounts for additional services requested under the contract.Healthcare ServicesRevenues of $5.98 decreased 5% year over year, primarily due to the company’s Pharmacy Solutions business as well as the impact of the optimization process associated with its chronic condition management programs.Operating cost ratio remained flat year over year at 95%.Adjusted pretax income for the segment was $281 million, down 3% year over year due to ongoing pressures in the company’s provider services business. This reflects lower Medicare rates year over year in specific geographies, as well as the impact of the optimization process associated with the company’s chronic care management programs.Individual Commercial SegmentIndividual Commercial membership was 0.2 million as of Jun 30, 2017, down 77% year over year, primarily due to a decline in number of countries where the company offers on-exchange coverage as well as the discontinuance of off-exchange products.Benefit ratio of 34.8% rose 106 bps from second-quarter 2016. The year-over-year improvement primarily resulted from the effect of the $208 million increase in the PDR in the prior-year quarter, planned exits in 2017 in certain markets that carried a higher benefit ratio, and per-member premium increase.The segment’s operating cost ratio deteriorated 140 bps from the year-ago quarter to 16.2%, primarily due the loss of scale efficiency from market exits in 2017The company witnessed a pretax income of $118 million, which compared favorably with a pretax loss of $225 million in the prior year quarter. This was owing to the exit from certain markets in 2017 and per-member premium increases.Humana Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Humana Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Humana Inc. QuoteFinancial UpdateAs of Jun 30, 2017, the company had cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities of $18.92 billion, down 1% sequentially.As of Jun 30, 2017, cash and short-term investments held by the parent company was $2.82 billion, up 65% from Mar 31, 2017.Debt-to-total capitalization as of Jun 30, 2017 was 31.3%, down 260 bps from Mar 31, 2017.Cash flows used in operations totaled $83 million compared with $296 million in the prior-year quarter. The improvement was primarily driven by higher earnings year over year and the timing of working capital changes, partially offset by the portion of taxes paid in the quarter related to the merger termination fee.Share Repurchase and Dividend UpdateIn Feb 2017, Humana’s board of directors approved a $2.25 billion share repurchase authorization, which will expire on Dec 31, 2017.The company subsequently entered into an agreement with a third-party financial institution to bring into effect a $1.50 billion ASR program under the authorization.Given the outstanding ASR, the company did not execute any share repurchases in the second quarter.The company paid cash dividends to its stockholders of $57 million in the second quarter.Guidance Raised Humana increased its 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to $11.50 from the previous guidance of at least $11.10.

786,HUM,"Community Health Systems, Inc. (CYH  -  Free Report) recently announced that one of its units has signed a definitive agreement to sell 291-bed AllianceHealth Deaconess hospital in Oklahoma City, OK along with other related businesses to a subsidiary of INTEGRIS Health. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions.Post the sale, the leading operator of general acute care hospitals would be able to continue its operation across the seven hospitals in Oklahoma. The hospital to be put on sale is among the additional planned divestitures, discussed on the company’s first-quarter 2018 earnings call.Earlier this year, the company’s subsidiaries also completed their sale of 60-bed Byrd Regional Hospital and its associated assets to the subsidiaries of Allegiance Health Management;  85-bed Tennova Healthcare – Jamestown in Jamestown, TN and its associated assets to the subsidiaries of Rennova Health, Inc.; three Tennessee hospitals including 225-bed Tennova - Dyersburg Regional in Dyersburg, 150-bed Tennova-Regional Jackson in Jackson and 100-bed Tennova Volunteer Martin in Martin alongside their associated assets to West Tennessee Healthcare. All three transactions were effective Jun 1, 2018.The company has been consistently divesting hospitals for strengthening its portfolio as well as generating funds to manage its costs. It is selling its non-core assets and currently focusing on its core business. Notably, Community Health sold as many as 30 hospitals last year.The company’s divestitures are allowing it to focus on the most sustainable markets for better growth. The divestments would also help the company reduce its debt. The company has been effectively lowering its debt over the past few years. It has decreased its debt by 16.3% over the last three years. It expects that the hospital divestitures would be able to generate $1.3 billion of gross proceeds in 2018. A lighter portfolio of hospitals will enable Community Health to manage its corporate cost proactively.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) player have gained 2.68% in the past three months, underperforming the industry’s growth of 4.71%. Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks from the medical industry include WellCare Health Plans, Inc.

787,HUM,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.’s (WBA  -  Free Report) Retail Pharmacy USA division continued to witness comparable prescription growth as well as strength in retail prescription market. Several planned developments, early benefits of new pharmacy contracts as well as an increase in volume owing to previously announced pharmacy partnerships have been driving growth in this space over the past few quarters. We expect this momentum to get reflected in fiscal first-quarter 2018 results, which are scheduled for release on Jan 4.Moreover, rising expenditure on prescription drugs and growing demand for specialty drugs have been strengthening the retail pharmacy market. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board expects this trend to continue. Per the report, prescription drug spending is projected to grow roughly 7% between 2018 and 2019.Challenges in the Retail Pharmacy USAPer management, the pharmacy business is affected by reimbursement pressure and a shift in pharmacy mix toward 90-day at retail (one prescription that is equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions) and Medicare Part D prescriptions. Moreover, the company expects these factors to affect first-quarter fiscal 2018 results.Moreover, collaborations among generic producers and a rise in generic dispensing rate (the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed) raise caution.The speculated entry of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) in the retail pharmacy market has aggravated matters. To counter competition, Walgreens Boots will have to add more digital and customer-friendly programs.Intensifying competition owing to mergers and acquisitions is also a matter of concern. In this regard, CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) announced a historic decision to acquire health insurance giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report). Following the announcement of the CVS-Aetna deal, another leading health service company — Optum, part of the UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) — announced plans to acquire DaVita Medical Group, a leading independent medical group and a subsidiary of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report). Moreover, it is being speculated that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) might soon announce the acquisition of health and well-being company, Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) to fend off competition.Steps to Counter ObstacleWalgreens Boots has been leaving no stone unturned to counter challenges.In this regard, the company has been developing and expanding relationships with commercial third-party payers to permit new and enhanced market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks. Notably, CVS health has announced plans to set up a new 30,000-store performance-based pharmacy network fixed by CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens Boots, as well as up to 10,000 community-based independently-owned pharmacies in the United States.Per management, the prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time. The company’s 90-day at retail prescription drug offering is a lower margin one in comparison to 30-day prescriptions. However, it helps the company tap into opportunities pertaining to patients with chronic prescription needs. It also offers increased convenience and cost efficiency. The company’s U.S. loyalty program, Balance Rewards, also bodes well. Notably, as of Aug 31, 2017, the number of active Balance Rewards members totaled 88.2 million.Rite Aid Deal a PositiveWe currently look forward to the company's agreement to purchase a limited number of Rite Aid Corporation (RAD) stores. While the transition process of these stores is underway, the company expects this phased acquisition to be completed by spring 2018. Notably, Walgreens Boots has purchased 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for a total transaction value of $4.375 billion.Although the deal is not going to impact the yet-to-be-reported quarter’s results, a number of aspects of it should prove beneficial in 2018. In this regard, the final Rite Aid deal agreement retained the clause to allow Rite Aid to buy generic drugs sourced through a Walgreens Boots’ affiliate at a cost equivalent to Walgreens Boots’ for about 10 years. Also, Rite Aid will provide Walgreens Boots with certain transition services for up to three years post deal closure.This apart, the deal’s financial value is quite attractive. Post the transaction’s initial closing, synergies of $300 million are expected to be realized within four years. This will be derived primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters.Per Walgreens Boots, this modified merger contract will extend its growth strategy and offer operational plus financial benefits. It will also help the company expand and optimize retail pharmacy network in key U.S. markets, including the Northeast. Notably, the stores to be purchased are located primarily in the Northeast and Southern United States, while the sites of three distribution centers to be bought are in Dayville, CT; Philadelphia, PA and Spartanburg, S.C. However, to achieve the desired results, the company will have to incur huge expenditures to fully integrate and rebrand the retained stores.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Walgreens Boots is likely to beat earnings in first quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Walgreens Boots has an Earnings ESP of +3.97%.

788,HUM,"Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) has completed the acquisition of HealthSun, one of the fastest-growing integrated Medicare Advantage health plans and health care delivery networks in Florida.Financial terms of the transaction were kept under wraps and the consolidation is expected to be slightly accretive to the company’s earnings in 2018.Benefits for AnthemHealthSun is a perfect fit for Anthem given its rapidly-expanding Medicare Advantage (MA) business with vast presence in Florida, the state which houses a large retiree population.Anthem should benefit from HealthSun’s superior health care services through an effective network of primary care clinics, pharmacy support and transportation services plus a narrow network of physician specialists and integrated medical cost management.The acquisition aligns with Anthem’s long-term strategy to grow in the thriving Government business. The integration will allow the company to serve more than 650,000 members in Florida.Share Price PerformanceYear to date, the stock has surged 59% outperforming the industry’s growth of 43%. Given its progress on fundamentals, the recently inked buyout deal should keep alive the momentum in the stock going forward.Industry TrendMedicare Advantage, a private version of the Government sponsored health insurance for retirees, which provides extra benefits and services to senior citizens, has been in huge demand of late from the rising population of baby boomers.A number of small and big acquisitions have been witnessed by the industry with the involved parties scrambling to grow this line of business. Some notable takeovers are Cigna Corp.’s (CI  -  Free Report) acquisition of HealthSpring and UnitedHealth Inc.’s (UNH  -  Free Report) buyout of XL Health Inc.The unsuccessful mergers of recent times namely Anthem Inc.’s with Cigna Corp. and Aetna’s with Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) were also aimed at expanding the Medicare Advantage business.Our TakeThe above-mentioned deal comes as no surprise to us, given the company’s desire to flourish in the lucrative MA business. This deal will boost the company to progress in the business line, especially after its blocked merger with Cigna, which could have elevated it as a leading player in the MA market.  The company is also on track to acquire America’s 1st Choice, a privately held Medicare Advantage organization for profit offering HMO products including Chronic Special Needs Plans (C-SNP) and Dual-Eligible Special Needs Plans in Florida.The company is aggressively seeking to put its capital to fruitful use and is readily open for attractive acquisitions and we expect to hear more from its end on these lines.Anthem carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

789,HUM,"Teladoc Inc. (TDOC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce first-quarter 2018 results on May 1, after the closing bell. Its quarterly revenues are expected to improve year over year.We expect Teladoc’s first-quarter earnings to see earnings upside from the recent flu season (which started from October-November and lasted through March) and is touted to be the most severe epidemic in a decade. This severe flu season must have driven healthcare utilization,which should increasetotal visits at the company. In fact, the company expects the flu season to lift its first-quarter visits by 10%.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company does not have an attractive earnings surprise history, having missed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 8.4%. This is depicted in the chart below:Teladoc, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Teladoc, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Teladoc, Inc. QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Teladoc beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Teladoc is +3.63%.Zacks Rank: Teladoc has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.Factors to Affect Q1 ResultsThe company’s Telehealth services are gaining rapid acceptance due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness and superior quality, which are driving demand. Consequently, the company witnessed increased patient visits in the first quarter. Also, the acquisition of HealthiestYou and Best Doctors have driven visits and call volumes and the trend must have continued in the quarter under review. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for patient visits is 555,950, reflecting an improvement of 44.5% year over year.A major component of the company’s revenues is subscription access fees, which account for 80-85% of revenues. We expect a surge in this revenue component driven by the number of clients and services used.The company’s efforts on consistently gaining clients by virtue of its superior service, a wide network of doctors and round-the-clock medical assistance, cross-selling multiple services to clients should give a boost to subscription service. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the same was up 115% year over year.The company expects adjusted EBITDA to dip to negative in the first quarter due to costs of onboarding new members and the activation of several of the company’s material new contracts.Company’s Guidance for Q1For the first quarter of 2018, the company expects total revenues between $86 million and $88 million, an EBITDA loss between $12 million and $13 million, an adjusted EBITDA loss between $2.5 million and $3.5 million, total U.S. paid membership of approximately 19.5 million to 20 million members and total visits between 575,000 and 625,000 visits. Net loss per share based on 61.9 million weighted average shares outstanding is expected to range from a loss of 43 cents to a loss of 45 cents.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Humana Inc.

790,HUM,"HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 1.Higher flu-related volumes combined with the anticipated benefits from the income tax reform should support HCA Healthcare’s results. The company  should see an earnings upside from favorable exchange rates.However, the company’s first-quarter results are expected to suffer from industry-wide softness in volumes. Factors like payor initiatives to move volumes away from hospitals, rising deductibles and the prevalence of high deductible health plans, and an increased proportion of hospital care to be paid by consumers are likely to lower volumes.As result of the recent passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we currently estimate the company's effective tax rate in 2018 at 25%, and reduction in cash taxes in 2018 of approximately $500 million.With respect to workforce development, the company is undergoing investments of approximately $300 million in four important areas that will continue for the next few years. Though these initiatives will create better opportunities for career growth and capabilities to serve patients, these costs will weigh on the bottom line before generating profits.The company’s revenues have been rising over the past few years on the back of accretive acquisition of other hospitals and we expect the trend to continue in the first quarter. The number of hospitals in the first quarter, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 179, up from 171 in the year-ago quarter. An increase in the number of hospitals should also drive admissions volume growth. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, total admissions should be up 3.5% year over year.The company has been deploying capital in terms of share repurchases to enhance investors’ value. Share buyback programs taken up during the first quarter are likely to favor the bottom line, limiting the share count.Earnings SurpriseThe company beat earnings estimate in one of the trailing four reported quarters and missed in two. However, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 2.23%. This is depicted in the chart below:HCA Healthcare, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise HCA Healthcare, Inc.

Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.20%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Anthem’s revenues have been consistently growing over the past several quarters, driven membership growth. The company’s fully insured and self-funded memberships have boosted the total enrollment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $22.5 billion, reflecting a year-over-year rise of nearly 1%.The company’s Government business has been performing well over  a considerable period of time, supported by increasing Medicaid and Medicare enrollment. The consensus mark for total operating revenues of Government business is pegged at $12.8 billion, up 7% year over year.However, higher medical costs for individual ACA-compliant products and more claims leading to an escalated benefit expense ratio from its Medicaid business are expected to drain the bottom line.Additionally, continuing with the earlier trend, Anthem is anticipated to have witnessed higher administrative costs in the first quarter.Anthem’s results are also likely to be affected by a persistent softness in its Individual business.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Anthem is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

The company’s firm decision to continue with its public exchange business despite other health insurers exiting it, has aided its Medicaid membership growth. This momentum is expected to continue in the first quarter as well.

But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Centene has an Earnings ESP of -1.77%.

However, a company needs to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Hence, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies from the same space that you may want to consider as these have the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around:Humana Inc.

795,HUM,"The First Trust Rising Dividend Achievers ETF (RDVY  -  Free Report) was launched on 01/07/2014, and is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.The fund is sponsored by First Trust Advisors. It has amassed assets over $462.46 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.Value stocks are known for their lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, but investors should also note their lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. When you look at long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets. But in strong bull markets, growth stocks are more likely to be winners.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.50%, making it one of the more expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 29.40% of the portfolio. Consumer Discretionary and Information Technology round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) accounts for about 2.22% of total assets, followed by Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) and Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 21.44% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskRDVY seeks to match the performance of the NASDAQ US Rising Dividend Achievers Index before fees and expenses. The Index is designed to provide access to a diversified portfolio of companies with a history of paying dividends.The ETF has gained about 1.08% so far this year and was up about 17.51% in the last one year (as of 04/17/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $26.13 and $31.88.The ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 15.19% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 50 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.AlternativesFirst Trust Rising Dividend Achievers ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, RDVY is an excellent option for investors seeking exposure to the Large Cap ETFs segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The Vanguard Value ETF (VTV  -  Free Report) and the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD  -  Free Report) track a similar index. While Vanguard Value ETF has $36.06 B in assets, iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $36.42 B. VTV has an expense ratio of 0.06% and IWD charges 0.20%.Bottom-LinePassively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency.

796,HUM,"Health insurer Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) has signed an agreement to acquire Kindred-at-Home, a unit of Kindred Healthcare Inc.Details of the DealTPG Capital and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe and Humana have formed a joint venture to buy Kindred for nearly $4.1 billion including the acquired company’s debt. Humana will occupy a 40% stake for $800 million in Kindred-at-Home, which will be separated from the rest of the company after the deal. The transaction will see light by the summer of 2018 and will be slightly accretive to the company’s earnings per share in 2019 and beyond.Essence of the Deal for HumanaThe deal will provide a vertical integration for Humana and aligns with the company’s strategy to grow in the home healthcare arena. The deal will allow the company to provide an improved care to patients at low cost.This transaction will provide Humana with an extensive geographic coverage with approximately 65% overlap with Humana’s individual Medicare Advantage membership. The company will also have full access to extensive clinical capabilities to better serve its members.A deal of this kind comes as no surprise to us given that the company had kept its eyes wide open for such attractive acquisitions after its failed merger with Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) earlier in the year. The company’s balance sheet with strong financial flexibility also provides enough support for capital deployment activities.Last week, the company’s board of directors approved a new share repurchase program to buy back its common stock worth up to $3 billion.Share Price PerformanceYear to date, the stock has rallied 21%, significantly underperforming the industry’s growth of 43%. Nonetheless, the recent announcement, a well-poised Medicare business as its solid balance sheet should drive the shares higher.Industry TrendA spate of similar deals is witnessed in the industry of late, driven by the increasing trend of health insurers foraying into patient-care business. The mega merger of CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) with Aetna aims to dispense affordable cure to patients at their convenience closer home or at an outpatient location.Further competition is lent by UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), which is voraciously spreading its business in this space via its OptumCare unit by acquiring doctor clinics, urgent care facilities and surgery centers. Recently, UnitedHealth Group’s Optum unit announced that it would pay nearly $5 billion to buy DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc.’s (DVA  -  Free Report) Medical Group along with its clinics and urgent care centers.The central tenet for all these deals is to cut costs and improve care. These developments mark the coming forward of health insurers to play a more direct role in providing actual medical services and move beyond offering insurance.These deals seeking to reduce hospitalizations, lower emergency room visits and allowing physicians and clinicians to extend their care all the way to a patient’s home are, however, detrimental to hospital companies’ business and survival.Going ForwardThe ripple of shakeup in the health care industry started by CVS-Aetna deal continues to trend higher. One after another player continues to join the bandwagon of consolidation. Given the urgent need (in the rapidly-transforming health care industry) for increase in heft and size, restraint of sky-high medical costs plus diversification of business, we won’t be surprised if we hear more of deals along similar lines going forward.Humana carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

797,HUM,"Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) recently entered in to a value-based agreement with Einstein Healthcare Network. Per the agreement, both the companies would join forces to offer improved services to Humana’s Medicare Advantage (MA) members.Value-based care has gained prominence in recent years in the healthcare industry. Health insurers have been forming strategic alliances for adopting this model that aims at providing coordinated, accessible, affordable and personalized health care to patients.The deal, which extends the existing network contract between both the companies, would continue to provide access to Einstein Healthcare’s wide range of health care services to Humana’s MA members. The agreement also combines Humana with Einstein Healthcare’s Accountable Care Organization, Einstein Care Partners, in order to improve patients’ healthcare experience and outcomes in the Philadelphia area.Humana’s wide presence of value-based care with more than 900 value-based relationships across 43 states and Puerto Rico impresses. The company had 1.9 million individual MA members as of Sep 30, 2017 along with 149,000 commercial members covered by 51,500 primary care providers.Moreover, this new partnership will allow Humana’s MA members to spend more personal time with health professionals and enjoy personalized care customized for each person’s unique health situation. It would also provide Humana’s MA members access to proactive health screenings and programs focused on preventing illness. This value-based model would also offer better health solutions for people living with chronic conditions so that they can avoid health complications in an easier way.The partnership would also build on updated technologies such as data analytics that would better connect physicians so that the coordinated effort can ensure better health outcomes for the patients. Moreover, the fee-for-service payment method for the physicians that considers the quality of the services being provided instead of the quantity, will also ensure better results.This value-based care program aligns well with Einstein Healthcare’s mission to improve population health outcomes and reduce health disparities. It has a vision of providing high-quality and low-cost health care to the communities they serve.Humana’s shares have gained 26.7% year to date, underperforming the industry’s rally of 44.1%. However, the company’s strategic alliances and strong fundamentals are likely to favor the stock going forward. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderHumana sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The bottom line improved 6.6% year over year driven by lower share count.However, adjusted consolidated pretax income of $915 million declined 2% due to charges associated with voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction program and lower pretax earnings in the company’s Healthcare services segment.

Revenues, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2%.Humana’s adjusted consolidated benefit ratio of 82.4% deteriorated 90 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017.Adjusted consolidated operating cost ratio of 11.8% improved 70 bps from the year-ago quarter, also due to the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for 2017.Quarterly Segment ResultsRetail SegmentRevenues from the Retail segment were $11.05 billion, up 2% year over year, primarily owing to higher revenues from the company’s Medicare Advantage business resulting from increased membership.Benefit ratio of 84.3% deteriorated 70 bps year over year, primarily due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017.

802,HUM,"A strong U.S. economy has enabled the health insurance industry to stand in good stead. A record-low unemployment rate and a gradual wage increase bode well for this space. High employment and wage growth fuel demand for health insurance and various other health-related services provided by insurers.Rising enrollment and top-line growth,  increasing contribution from complementary businesses, product modifications, improved service, demographic changes, expansion of international operations, better claims handling, medical cost management, technological investment and upgrade, mergers and acquisitions plus healthy balance sheets have long sustained the mojo for health insurers. The overall bullish scenario reinforces our sentiment to believe that the growth cadence for the sector should continue in the long run.Per a McKinsey & Co. report, the private payor market in North America is expected to grow from €583 billion in 2010 to €1,421 billion in 2025.Furthermore, health insurance is one industry, which remains unperturbed by the flaring trade wars and volatile oil prices, causing indexes to fluctuate wildly. Hence, it has performed quite well compared with the broader markets.The industry has rallied 13.3% year to date, more than thrice the 4% increase clocked by the S&P 500 index. The buoyancy in the health insurance space is further confirmed by its  Zacks Industry Rank within the top 40% (102 of the 256 plus groups). In such a situation, it is a wise idea to invest in health insurance companies.Some stocks promising sturdy growth in this flourishing industry are Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), Triple-S Management Corp. (GTS  -  Free Report) and WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report).While Humana, Anthem and Triple-S carry a respective Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), WellCare sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Let’s indulge in a comparative analysis of two health insurers — Anthem and Humana — to decide which is a better stock.While Humana has a market capitalization of $42 billion, the same for Anthem is $62.3 billion.As both staffing firms hold the same robust Zacks Rank, we are using certain other parameters to find out which company is better positioned.Earnings ExpectationsEarnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company’s strong prospects.Humana’s current-quarter earnings are projected to grow 8.9% compared with 23.4% rise for Anthem. Looking at the full-year 2018 picture, Humana’s earnings are estimated at 19.5% growth while the same for Anthem is expected to increase 27.9%.Thus, Anthem has an edge over Humana in terms of quarterly and annual earnings growth projections.Earnings Surprise HistoryA stock’s earnings surprise history helps investors derive an idea about its performance in the previous quarters.Both Humana and Anthem boast a decent earnings surprise history with the metric having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four reported quarters for each company.However, Anthem visibly has a vantage point over Humana in terms of its average positive earnings surprise, which reads 7.2%. While Humana’s average beat stands below at 6.2%.Net MarginNet profit margin aids investors to evaluate a company’s business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and operating efficiency. It also shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.With a TTM net margin TTM net margin, Anthem compares favorably with the Humana’s ROE of 3.3%. Though both companies lag the industry’s 4.9% TTM net margin, Anthem still commands a better margin profile.ValuationThe Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) metric is used for measuring a company's value in relation to its earnings. In general, a lower number or multiple is preferred to a higher one.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for Anthem and Humana is 15.2 and 19.8, respectively, while that of the industry is 17.9.Going a step further and baking in both the companies’ growth rates shows a 12-month PEG ratio of 1.44 for Humana and 1.30 for Anthem compared with the industry’s PEG ratio of 1.37.This clearly shows that Anthem is more valued than Humana.  Bottom LineOur comparative assessment shows that Anthem is much better placed than Humana on all fronts.From a fundamental perspective too, Anthem dwells on a firmer ground with guidance raised for 2018, increased membership strength, a sound balance sheet, numerous accretive acquisitions as well as growth in service business, which seem to drive the stock in the coming months.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

803,HUM,"Tenet Healthcare Corporation (THC  -  Free Report) will report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 30 after market close.Tenet Healthcare’s first-quarter results are likely to reflect the industry-wide softness in volumes. Factors such as payor initiatives to move volumes away from hospitals, rising deductibles and prevalence of high deductible health plans, increased proportion of hospital care to be paid by consumers, are driving away volumes and the same is likely to be seen in the to-be-reported quarter. These might in turn result in lower admissions inducing a decline in patient revenues.However, an unusual flu season in the first quarter must have led to a surge in patient admissions as more patients seek treatment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues are pegged at $2.5 billion and $1.4 billion, reflecting 5.2% and 7.6% decline, respectively, over the year-ago quarter.The consensus mark for - adjusted patient admissions in the quarter to be reported is pegged at 0.3 million, down 5.5% year over year.Other FactorsTenet Healthcare’s Ambulatory segment has been performing well over the past many quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues stands at $486 million for the first quarter, reflecting 7% rise year over year. We expect the same to further benefit from this solid segmental performance.The company’s cost management program primarily comprised headcount reductions and the renegotiation of contracts with suppliers and vendors. Its enterprise-wide cost-reduction initiatives are likely to decrease expenses and favor margins.Further, the company’s share buybacks during the first quarter are expected to aid its bottom line.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Tenet Healthcare has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat estimates this quarter.Zacks ESP: Tenet Healthcare has an Earnings ESPof +121.43%.

Optum serves the global healthcare marketplace, including payers, care providers, employers, governments, life sciences companies and consumers.The company is investing in this segment with an aim to diversify earnings and seek protection from the highly regulated health services business. Other companies in the industry, Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) are also diversifying into the health services business to become a comprehensive healthcare entity.  Optum has been a jewel for UnitedHealth. Its revenue CAGR of 24% from 2014 to 2017 is highly impressive. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the segment is $23.6 billion, up 11.3% year over year.Revenue growth from this segment should be driven by increased contribution from each of its sub-segments, OptumHealth, OptumInsight, Optum Rx.Revenues from OptumHealth should be aided by organic growth acquisition-related growth in care delivery. The segment has been indulging in market expansion in care delivery, as well as growth in consumer health engagement products and services, behavioral health services and health financial services. Increase in the number of consumers served and a rise in average revenue per consumer will contribute to the segment’s top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.69 billion for revenues from this segment represents 20.2% growth year over year.OptumInsight’s revenues will see accretion from growth in revenue management services, business process services and data analytics.

805,HUM,"We expect higher revenues at UnitedHealthcare and Optum segments to drive UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s (UNH  -  Free Report) first-quarter results scheduled to release on Apr 17, 2018. Results should benefit from a reduction in corporate tax, partly offset by decline in premium revenues due to minimum loss ratio and lower net health insurance fee recapture effects.Alongside, the company is expected to incur additional investment and operating costs in order to accelerate existing initiatives and artificial intelligence, data analytics, individual health record custodianship, digital health, net promoter score improvements and health related initiatives in local communities. These accelerated investments will lead to $200 million to $300 million in incremental operating expense for 2018. A part of these spend will be borne by the company in the first quarter, which might increase operating expense.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsRevenue Growth at UnitedHealthcare: This segment is expected to witness an increased revenue led by growth in the number of individuals served across its business lines and price increases for underlying medical cost trends, which might be partially offset by a reduction in the number of people served in ACA-compliant individual products. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues is $44.7 billion, up 11.5% year over year.Higher Membership: We expect membership enrollment growth at the company. This should be led by broad-based growth across group sizes and regions in the commercial group market on the back of gains in services to small groups, which should drive membership in risk-based benefit plans. Fee-based commercial group business might be under pressure due to the non-renewal of one public sector customer. We expect to see higher Medicare advantage membership from growth in individual and employer-sponsored group Medicare Advantage plans. Strong customer retention and new sales should cause higher membership in Medicaid.Higher Contribution from Optum: Results should also show an increase in revenues from its health services’ segment Optum, driven by higher contribution from sub-segments OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx. Revenues and earnings from operations increased at OptumHealth primarily due to organic and acquisition-related growth in care delivery. OptumInsight should see growth in revenue management services and business process services, whereas OptumRx should see an upside from client and consumer growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the segment is $23.6 billion, up 11.3% year over year.The bottom line should further get a cushion from the shares bought back in the first quarter.UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated QuoteHere is what our quantitative model predictsOur proven model does not conclusively show that UnitedHealth is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

807,HUM,"Teldoc Inc. (TDOC  -  Free Report) third-quarter results, scheduled for Nov 1, are expected to witness an increase in patient visits, one of the major driver of the company’s revenues.Telehealth services provided by the company are fast gaining acceptance due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness and superior quality, which are driving demand. This must have consequently propelled patient visits in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the acquisition of HealthiestYou closed in 2016 is expected to result in higher visits and call volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is set at 293,721, up 45% year over year. The company’s guidance for the same is between 275,000 and 300,000.  A major component of the company’s revenues, subscription access fees which account for 80% to 85% of the company’s revenues, is driven primarily by the number of clients, the number of members in a client’s population, the number oof services contracted for by a client and the contractually negotiated prices of the company’s service.Since the company has been continuously adding a number of clients by virtue of its superior service, a wide network of doctors and round-the-clock medical assistance, this revenue component is expected to see a surge in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $51 million, which translates into year-over-year growth of 83%.The company is in its growth phase and incurring heavy expenditure in the form of substantial investments made to acquire new clients, build its proprietary network of healthcare providers and develop its technology platform.Thus, the bottom line will see a drain from huge expenses on higher advertising, sales, technology and development, general and administrative functions, and depreciation and amortization. We, however, expect expenditures to decline as the company has started to realize leverage from the scale of its operations.Teladoc, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Teladoc, Inc.

808,HUM,"Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25 after  market close.Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 6.3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The company’s two segments, Acute Care and Behavioral Health, have been performing strongly over the past many quarters. The segments have been continuously witnessing a rise in admissions, licensed beds as well as patient days that have significantly resulted in higher revenues.  This yet-to-be-reported quarter is also likely to see the same bullish trend.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenue is pegged at $2.6 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 8%.  Our consensus estimates for revenues from Acute Care and Behavioral Health segments are currently pegged at $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, up 10% and 6.4% respectively, year over year.Since 2012, the average number of licensed beds in the Acute Care hospitals and Behavioral Health centers kept increasing and the trend is expected to continue in the third quarter.. Our consensus estimates for Average Licensed Beds in Acute Care and Behavioral Health are pegged at 6.1 billion and 23.1 billion, up 3% and 6% year over year, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Admissions in Acute Care and Behavioral Health is pegged at 73.1 billion and 120.7 billion respectively, up 5% and 7% year over year, respectively. This in turn is expected to aid the company’s top line in the third quarter significantly.Other FactorsUniversal Health’s efforts to enhance shareholders’ value through share repurchases might have boosted its bottom line by limiting share count.Nevertheless, rising costs related to interest payment, reserves for settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, plus impairments of long-lived assets might have put pressure on margins.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Universal Healthis likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

809,HUM,"Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) will release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.7%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Anthem has been witnessing revenue appreciation over the past many quarters, backed by membership growth. Both its fully insured and self-funded memberships have grown consistently. The third quarter is also expected to witness the same uptrend.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenue is currently pegged at $22.1 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of nearly 5%. Our consensus estimates for fully insured and self-funded memberships stand at 15.3 million and 25 million, up 0.7% and 1.2%, respectively.Total medical enrollment has also been steadily rising on the back of Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion. For the soon-to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medical enrollment is pegged at 40.3 million, up 1% year over year. The Government business of Anthem has been a major contributor behind this increase in Medical enrollment. Our consensus estimate for total operating revenue of Government business is $11.8 billion, up 3% year over year.Operating revenues of its Commercial business have also been impressive over the years. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total operating revenue from Commercial business is $10.1 billion, up 5% year over year.Other Factors at PlayMedicare Advantage product offerings might have supported Medicare enrollment growth, again boosting the company’s top line.However, Anthem expects to witness higher medical costs for individual ACA-compliant products as was the case last quarter.In addition, the company is likely to have experienced higher benefit expense ratio from its Medicaid business due to higher claims.Administrative costs are likely to have risen during the third quarter continuing the previous trend.The Individual business is also expected to remain a drag in the third quarter.Earnings PredictionsOur proven model shows that Anthem has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat estimates this quarter.Zacks ESP:Anthem has an Earnings ESP of +1.55%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

810,HUM,"The U.S. health insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) reported upbeat third-quarter results. It topped our estimates on the bottom line and raised its full-year outlook.Net operating earnings per share of $2.66, comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.57 and were 22.6% higher year over year. Higher revenues, strength in both its segments, UnitedHealthcare and Optum, and membership growth led to the outperformance.The company posted net revenues of $50.3 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues were up 8.7% year over year. The company reported medical care ratio of 81.4%, up 110 basis points year over year.Buoyed by its strong earnings performance, the company raised its outlook for 2017 earnings. The company now expects 2017 GAAP net earnings to touch $9.45 per share (versus $9.20 to $9.35 per share guided earlier) and adjusted net earnings to near $10.00 per share (versus previous guidance of $9.75-$9.90).Market ImpactThe market has welcomed UNH’s earnings beat and its strong outlook. Shares of UNH jumped as much as 5.5% following its earnings announcement on about 3.28 times elevated volumes. After all, the stock has a VGM (Value, Growth, Momentum) Score of B and its Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 28%.Since UnitedHealth is the first insurer to report earnings and a bellwether, the result has acted as a cornerstone for the broad health insurance sector with stocks of other players in the space in green at the close on the day. Some of these players include Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) – up 2.9%, Anthem (ANTM  -  Free Report) - up 1.9%, Cigna (CI  -  Free Report) – up 1.2% and Humana (HUM  -  Free Report) – up 1.4%.Given UnitedHealth’s strength to lift the health insurer corner of the broad health care space and the solid run up in its share price, some ETFs heavily invested in UnitedHealth could be worth watching for investors seeking to ride out the recent surge.

811,HUM,"In the complex world of investment, debt financing is a well known strategy adopted by the majority of corporations for expanding their business operations from time to time. Dearth of ample funds is the primary driving force behind this strategy. Yet, resorting to debt is still considered a taboo as it carries the burden of interest payments.In particular, companies with large debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt in the worst case scenario. Of course, companies may resort to equity financing as an alternative option to boost their financial resources. However, it is the easy and cheap availability of debt that makes it more popular among corporations.In fact, statistics indicate that America, the richest economy in the world, is the biggest borrower too. Notably, huge spending on wars, big tax cuts and stimulating economic programs have all added to the nation’s burden over the years. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the debt held by the public will rise to 150% of the economy’s GDP in 2047 from 77% currently.Nevertheless, this should not discourage investors from spending on U.S. stocks, since debt has been part of the economy since its foundation and yet the country stands atop others. What investors need to do is choose stocks with caution, thus avoiding those that carry high debt loads.Here comes the significance of leverage, better to say financial leverage, which indicates the degree to which a company utilizes debt to boost its operations and earn escalated profit margins. Usually investors tend to avoid companies bearing higher degree of financial leverage.The next question that comes to our mind is that how can we measure a company’s degree of financial leverage. To this end, several leverage ratios have been constructed as efficient tools to evaluate a company’s credit level to support prudent equity investments.The most popular among them is the debt-to-equity ratio.Analyzing Debt-to-EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business, thereby making it a more worthy investment opportunity.With the Q3 reporting cycle set to gain steam in the coming weeks, an investor must be looking for solid growth stocks. Blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth without considering their debt level might not be a wise move. As, uncertainty can hit the global equity market any time, it is reasonable to expect that investors will be more attracted to companies with low leverage than high earnings growth.The Winning StrategyIn theory, the optimal capital structure for a company is one  with the ideal debt-to-equity ratio that maximizes its value and minimizes its cost of capital. Since, in practice, screening stocks based on these criteria is a bit difficult, herein, we choose low leverage stocks as these are considered safe bets.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy): No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 46 stocks that made it through the screen.Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report): It is a health services company that facilitates the delivery of health care services through networks of providers to its medical members. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2 and came up with an average positive earnings surprise of 7.24% in the trailing four quarters.Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report): The companyoperates online and mobile marketplaces in retail and wholesale trade, as well as cloud computing and other services.It carries a Zacks Rank #2 and delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 12.16% in the trailing four quarters.Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report): It is a global diversified technology and manufacturing company with a wide range of aerospace products and services.

812,HUM,"WellCare Health Plans, Inc.(WCG  -  Free Report) continues to maintain a leading position in the industry on the back of its growth strategies. The company’s revenues have been consistently rising over the last 10 years.The ObamaCare Act (ACA) implemented by the former U.S. President Barrack Obama contributed significantly to the company’s top-line growth. However, there remains uncertainty around “Repealing and Replacing” the ACA under the Trump administration. The Medicaid funding change is on gun point of the lawmakers which if materialises might hurt the company.Despite the regulatory uncertainty prevailing in the industry, WellCare Health remains an attractive pick for investors.Apart from the contribution of the ACA, the company’s revenues have also been supported by strategic acquisitions, partnerships and alliances since 2011. These initiatives not only strengthened the company’s presence in existing markets but also helped in geographic expansion.Moreover, consistent cash inflow has helped it increase shareholders’ value through several capital deployment initiatives like share repurchases, dividend payment etc.  Year to date, its shares have gained 45% while the industry has rallied 43%. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 47.37%. In the second quarter, its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year on higher revenues.Pursuant to the earnings beat, the company also raised its earnings and revenue guidance for 2017 that boosted shareholder optimism in the stock. The company has seen its Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 earnings being revised upward by 0.6% and 0.2%, respectively, in the past 60 days.However, it suffers from rising level of debt that increases the borrowing cost, eventually draining the bottom line.Also, the company has been witnessing a steep increase in the total expenses that are weighing on the margins.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the same space can consider stocks like Humana Inc.

813,HUM,"Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) has recently signed a new value-based agreement with Community Care Physicians (“CCP”). The deal is aimed at providing in-network access for Humana Medicare Advantage (“MA”) members through CCP’s 248 primary care and specialty physicians at its 37 practices across the Capital District.Moreover, per the value-based agreement, five urgent care facilities of CCP in Delmar, Niskayuna, North Greenbush, Albany and Latham will also serve Humana’s MA members.The new agreement will enable the physicians to use new tools and have access to better information. Improved and updated technologies, such as data analytics are likely to maintain a smooth network among the physicians that would help them work as a team and deliver coordinated care to each patient.Continuous access to proactive health screenings and programs focused on preventing illness are likely to help the physicians bring out better health outcomes. People living with chronic conditions are expected to be treated in an improved manner with focus on avoiding unnecessary health complications.The physicians are also expected to spend more time with the patients covered under Humana MA plans, per the agreement. As each patient will be given enough time of treatment, the consolidated health outcome is expected to improve significantly.The agreement includes physicians’ reimbursement on the health outcomes of their patients instead of the number of services they provide.

"
815,HUM,"The role of pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) in the U.S. healthcare sector has been evolving. From being just third-party administrators of prescription drug programs, PBMs have come a long way. PBMs currently play a major role in managing pharmaceutical spending and enhancing health benefits for end-users.Notably, PBMs are mainly accountable for the development of formularies, discussing discounts with major drug manufacturers and pharmacy contracts. These firms also play an important role in the settlement of prescription drug claims.As per Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, PBMs have the potential to save as much as 30% in total drug spending relative to unmanaged purchasing (data published in ‘The Economic Benefits of Pharmacy Benefit Managers’ by Orszag and Green).Undoubtedly, the PBM market is expected to continue the solid trend. Per a report by Market Research Reports.biz, the PBM market will see a CAGR of 7.16% between 2014 and 2019.Factors Driving PBMHistorically, there have been a number of factors supporting growth in the PBM market. Rising healthcare expenditures along with higher cost of drugs and other healthcare services have driven demand for PBMs who act as middlemen between the payer and other entities in the system.We are also encouraged by a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board on rising U.S. healthcare spending. Per the report, the U.S. healthcare spending is projected to rise to around $5.5 trillion by 2025, representing 19.9% of Gross Domestic Product (based on assumptions that the Affordable Care Act will continue through 2025).The PBM market largely benefits from an aging population which tends to depend on drugs and pharmacy benefit plans. Per a report by Technavio, nearly 14.4% of the U.S. population is aged 65 years and above which buoys optimism.Many analysts believe that rising expenditure on prescription drugs and growing demand for specialty drugs have also been strengthening the PBM market. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board predicts a continuation of this trend. Per the report, prescription drug spending is projected to grow roughly 7% between 2018 and 2019.Per a 2017 Economic Report on U.S. Pharmacies ad Pharmacy Benefit Managers, specialty drugs accounted for about one-third of the pharmacy industry’s revenues in 2016.Mergers & Acquisitions Change PBM LandscapeThe PBM market has always been dominated by a handful of large players. In 2007, CVS’ merger with Caremark Rx to form CVS Caremark, now CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report), had a huge impact on the functions and scope of PBMs. Again, CVS Health announced a historic decision to acquire health insurance giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report).People in support of the merger view it as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one which will lead to efficiency gain and solid cost cutting at CVS Health’s PBM business. Notably, a horizontal integration increases the chances of monopolistic practices in the market.Following the announcement of the CVS-Aetna deal, another leading health service company — Optum, part of the UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) — announced its decision to acquire DaVita Medical Group, a leading independent medical group and a subsidiary of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report).Moreover, it is being speculated that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) might soon announce the acquisition of health and well-being company, Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) to counter competition.3 Stocks to Scoop UpAs the PBM industry is constantly expanding, this industry is worth keeping an eye on. Here are three PBM companies with promising prospects.CVS Health: Headquartered in Woonsocket, RI, CVS Health, with its subsidiaries, provides integrated pharmacy health care services. This leading PBM company has a market cap of about $73.8 billion. Its earnings are estimated to grow 9.1% in the next three to five years.Apart from the Aetna deal earlier, CVS health has announced plans to set up a new 30,000-store performance-based pharmacy network fixed by CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report), as well as up to 10,000 community-based independently owned pharmacies across the United States. Through this initiative, the company intends to promote cost saving and enhance clinical outcomes which will eventually reduce costs for CVS’ PBM customers.CVS Health Corporation Price CVS Health Corporation Price | CVS Health Corporation QuoteExpress Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Saint Louis, MO, Express Scripts operates as a PBM company in the United States, Canada and Europe. The company has a market cap of about $38.83 billion. Its earnings are estimated to grow 9.7% in the next three to five years.Notably, the company’s PBM segment offers clinical solutions, specialized pharmacy care, home delivery and specialty pharmacy, retail network pharmacy administration, benefit design consultation, drug utilization review, drug formulary management, administration of a group purchasing organization, and consumer health and drug information services. Moreover, this segment provides Medicare, Medicaid, and health insurance marketplace products.The company recently announced plans to acquire privately-held and evidence-based medical benefit management services provider — eviCore healthcare. Notably, by integrating eviCore's medical benefits management (MBM) platform with its PBM offering, Express Scripts intends to combat rising healthcare costs.Express Scripts Holding Company Price Express Scripts Holding Company Price | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteRite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report): Operating through Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Services segments, Rite Aid owns a chain of retail drugstores in the United States. The company has a market cap of about $1.91 billion.Notably, the company’s Pharmacy Services segment provides PBM services and a range of pharmacy-related services. This segment also provides prescription adjudication services for other PBMs, offers integrated mail-order and specialty and compounding pharmacy services, and provides infertility treatment as well as drug benefits under the Medicare Part D program.Rite Aid Corporation Price Rite Aid Corporation Price | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteBottom LineAlthough these companies have solid prospects, they are exposed to challenges like legal regulations, reimbursement pressure and the speculated entry of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) in the PBM market.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

816,HUM,"CVS Health Corporation’s (CVS  -  Free Report) historic decision to acquire health insurance giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) has created quite a buzz in the entire healthcare space. Most economists consider this coming together of two stalwarts — consolidation of CVS Health’s pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) business with Aetna’s large and unshakable insurance base — as a new dimension added to healthcare landscape. However, critics are of the view that the gains from this combined entity will be short-lived for the healthcare society at large to benefit from.Vision in Favor of the DealPeople supporting this proposed integration between CVS Health and Aetna opine that this merger has fair chances to pass the regulatory hurdles. They see this consolidation as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one, thus leading to efficiency gain and a formidable cost-cutting strategy of CVS Health’s PBM platform. Notably, a horizontal integration dreads the chances of forming a monopoly powerhouse in the market.An article by Dana Blankenhorn published in InvestorPlace stated that based on this $69 billion deal, insurers will finally achieve the vertical integration they need to control costs. Per the article, the Humana (HUM  -  Free Report) acquisition deal proposed by Aetna was earlier rejected by the Obama administration because of its horizontal acquisition.The economists lapping up the deal are looking much forward to this development as they think this vertical integration might finally put the brakes on America’s soaring health-care costs. Notably, total medical cost has inflated in the 6-7% range over the last four years based on the increasing bills of doctors, hospitals, medical devices and drugs (data published in The Economist article).Blankenhorn in his article stated that to counter this problem, the CVC-Aetna deal will enable insurers to buy pharmacies to fight high drug prices through formularies and the lists of medicines that will be prescribed for various conditions. Using generics in formularies or choosing from branded drugs wherein generics aren’t available is a method to keep drug prices in check.The OppositionThose opposing the buyout comment that despite the two companies trying to strengthen their footprint in health care, both may finally end up paying severely for the merger. Akin to the supporters of the deal, the contrary view underscores the cost-control agenda highlighting that the consolidation will apparently push the United States’ third-largest insurer Aetna’s huge client base into CVS drugstores to get their prescriptions filled through CVS’ drug plans. This move will in turn eliminate the middlemen’s role and other intermediaries in queue, finally resulting in reduction of drug price and overall healthcare cost.However, the critics believe this to be a short-lived scenario and in the longer term, patients could end up incurring more medical expenses. Per a recent Vox report, this is because mergers like this will gradually make it more difficult for the new insurers to enter the market since they won’t be able to negotiate lower drug prices like larger firms. This will in fact diminish competition in the sector leading to inflating prices.To know more in detail, please read: CVS Health's Aetna Buyout to Change Healthcare LandscapeShare Price ComparisonShares of CVS Health have outperformed the broader industry over the past three months.

817,HUM,"Humana, Inc.’s (HUM  -  Free Report) strong Medicare business positions it for long-term growth. Medicare membership has witnessed a five-year CAGR (2011-2016) of 6.6%. The same trend continued in the first nine months of 2017 as well.The company has been witnessing a consistent growth in revenues since 2002. In fact, the company’s revenues have increased at a CAGR of 16% over the last 11 years. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare contributed significantly to the company’s top line. However, the Trump administration is making every effort to repeal and replace the ACA. Despite the unpredictable nature of regulations and its impact on the industry, Humana continues to be an attractive pick for investors.The company maintains a consistent record of earnings outperformance. In each of the last four quarters, Humana’s bottom line surpassed expectations with an average beat of 6.6%. Following strong third-quarter 2017 results, the company raised its earnings and revenue guidance for 2017.

Along with other health insurers like Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group, Inc (UNH  -  Free Report), Humana is planning to scale back its participation on this loss-making business in 2018.

818,HUM,"President Donald Trump’s plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare have created quite an uproar among health insurers. ACA has been contributing significantly to health insurers’ top line.Despite the volatile regulatory scenario, health insurers recorded a solid third quarter and continue to remain profitable picks for investors.Health insurance bigwigs like Humana Inc (HUM  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report), UnitedHealth Group, Inc (UNH  -  Free Report) have seen solid growth in the top and bottom line as well as membership in the third quarter. Their strong capital position also reflects profitable operations.Business diversifying strategies with primary focus on ancillary services and products have also boosted the revenue base.Q4 TrendsContinuously rising demand for government plans, especially Medicare and Medicaid, continues to favor health insurers. Hence, revenues of the companies offering these plans are likely to witness a consistent improvement in their government businesses.Moreover, an aging U.S. population that has boosted the overall demand for medical coverage is likely to prove favorable.ObamaCare has significantly benefitted the industry through a reduction in uninsured population, boosting medical enrollment and aiding bad debt management. This trend is likely to drive the fourth-quarter results as well.A diversified product portfolio along with proposed mergers and consolidations are also likely to accelerate growth for health insurers in terms of global expansion as well as strengthening of foothold in existing markets.However, the companies have been facing higher losses on public exchanges that have compelled them to scale back operations or plan an exit from the business.Moreover, health insurers have been seeing escalating operating costs related to regulations, investments in information technology along with fees and taxes that continue to hurt profits. The companies, however, are trying to tackle the rise in costs with the help of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs).Stocks to ConsiderDespite the challenges, the health insurance ndustry has gained nearly 8% quarter to date, outperforming the S&P 500 average of 3.5%. The Health Maintenance Organization industry is among the top 10% of the Zacks-ranked industries.  We have boiled down on three stocks that have outperformed in the third quarter and have also seen upward estimate revision in the last 30 days.

819,HUM,"Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report) is well poised for long-term growth on the back of its membership base that has strengthened due to strategic acquisitions, growing national accounts in the commercial segment and the Medicaid expansion in the government segment. Apart from this, Anthem’s revenues have also been driven by net investment income that started increasing since 2016 due to the interest rate hikes.Anthem’s capital management, backed by solid cash position, also impresses.  The company has been witnessing a consistent rise in its cash flow from operations. This has enabled Anthem to continuously enhance shareholders’ value through several capital deployment initiatives like share repurchases, dividend payouts, etc. In a year’s time, its shares have gained 61%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 40%.The company maintains a consistent record of earnings outperformance. In each of the last four quarters, Anthem’s bottom line surpassed expectations with an average beat of 11.5%. Following strong third-quarter 2017 results, the company raised its earnings and revenue guidance for 2017 for the second time this year. This upbeat guidance boosts shareholders' confidence in the stock.However, Anthem has been incurring mounting loss in its public exchange business that has been weighing on the company’s bottom line and top line. It has been witnessing significant decline in enrollment in this business since 2016. Along with other health insurers like Humana Inc (HUM  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group, Inc (UNH  -  Free Report), Anthem is planning to scale back its participation on this loss-making business in 2018. Although curtailment of this business is likely to save the company from losses, it will lead to a fall in revenues.Moreover, the company’s rising level of debt not only increases financial risks but also raises interest expenses, which weighs on margins.Anthem has also been suffering from higher expenses over past few years, primarily caused by increasing benefit expenses along with selling, general and administrative expenses. This continues to hurt the company’s profitability.Zacks RankAnthem presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

821,HUM,"Public exchanges, formed to serve the underprivileged and patients, have not been too successful in serving the insurers. This is evident from losses incurred by most of the health insurers participating in these exchanges.Affordability-Risk Pool Trade OffThe exchanges saw a deluge of very sick patients buying insurance cover online, thanks to the subsidies provided to the enrollees. They, however, failed to attract sufficient enrollments from healthy and young individual, which was required to balance the risk-return trade off. This led to increase in claims on business conducted on these exchanges.Let us discuss how the big four insurers have been affected by this public exchange business.Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report), one of the nation’s largest health insurance companies, recently announced that it would pull back its participation from public exchanges, expecting a loss of $200 million in 2017. Aetna incurred pre-tax operating losses of $450 in 2016.Lackluster results from this line of business prompted the company to substantially reduce its risk exposure to these products for 2017. Aetna carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, is another big insurer offering plans on Affordable Care Act (ACA). Anthem suffered a decline in enrollment in 2016 and the same continued in the first-half 2017.This prompted the company to scale back its participation in this loss-making business for 2018. It pulled out of exchange plans in 11 states for 2017.Although management has been taking steps to ensure both a stable and sustainable individual market as well as a smooth transition for consumers, uncertainty remains.UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) lost more than $1 billion on the exchanges in 2015 and 2016. After two years of losing money from plans sold on the ACA insurance exchanges, it exited nearly all of the exchanges for 2017. UnitedHealth presently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) has already declared that it will exit its Individual Commercial business in 2018. After incurring mounting losses in this business in 2015 and 2016, Humana pulled back its participation from 11 states in 2016. The insurer anticipates incurring a modest $45 million loss on ACA exchange plans in 2017, excluding the effect of which, it estimates the earnings per share for 2017 to be at least $11.50. The company also carries Zacks Rank #3.Continued UncertaintyThe health insurers that have been making significant losses on ACA exchange plans are uncertain about thefinal verdict from the Trump administration. This is because the administration has been vocal about removing cost reduction subsides that help insurance companies pay claims of patients buying coverage on public exchanges.These players have been lobbying to keep these subsidies intact, which would otherwise lead to the health plan enrollees facing cost increases of 20-25% for 2018 coverage.The U.S. Senate is working on a bipartisan approach for shoring up the ACA’s public exchanges by funding cost-sharing subsidies for low income patients.The uncertainty on the CSR funding puts a question mark on the sustainability of these  exchanges. In the event of an unfavorable outcome, it will not be surprising to see an exodus of insurance companies from these exchanges.  This exit will lead to more Americans finding themselves with fewer healthcare options, causing an increase in uninsured rates, defeating the central tenet of the Health Care Reform Act.4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye OnWith news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity.

822,HUM,"The Healthcare sector has been in the limelight since the election of President Donald Trump, a vehement opponent of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). His proposed changes (some of which go against the interest of the insurers), via the proposal to repeal and replace, raised concerns across the space.Repeal and replace, however, has been left hanging in midair due to lack of sufficient government support. Therefore, continued regulatory uncertainty persists in the sector.Industry TrendsThe health insurance industry, meanwhile, continues to grow profitably as evident from the rise in its top line, as by most companies in the recently reported quarter. Many companies like Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report), UnitedHealth Group Inc.(UNH  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) raised their outlook for 2017. This is indicative of significant growth opportunities in the industry.Players in the industry are well positioned for long-term growth on the back of continuously increasing demand for government plans that primarily include Medicare and Medicaid. Revenues of the companies dealing with these plans like UnitedHealth Group, Anthem and Humana have been witnessing consistent upticks on the back of government business.Thanks to the ACA, the industry has been benefiting from a reduction in the uninsured population that aided in medical enrollment as well as helped companies lower bad debts.Rapidly increasing business diversification, focus on ancillary services and products contributing significantly to the insurers’ revenues help the companies combat the effects of stringent regulations.Also, as the median age of the U.S. population grows, overall demand for medical coverage continues to rise.Nevertheless, health insurers continue to suffer from underperforming public exchanges as these businesses have resulted in significant losses for most of the players.Increasing operating cost related to regulations, investments in information technology, levy of fees and taxes also weigh on health insurers’ margins.Although the U.S Senate has rejected the appeal of President Trump to repeal and replace the ACA as part of regulatory reform, an uncertainty has risen regarding the future of the deal. This is expected to result in higher uninsured rates and weak patient volume in the United States.The Congressional Budget Office’s estimation also states that reduction in government spending will lead to a loss of insurance for 23 million people over the next 10 years.Industry Rank & Price PerformanceDespite the challenges, the health insurance industry is currently ranked #20, which represents the top 8% of the Zacks Industry Rank.It has also been able to perform well as evident from its rally of 47.8% in the last one year compared with 16.4% gain registered by the S&P 500.Stocks Worth ConsideringWe bring to you three health insurance stocks that have a solid Value Score, a favorable Zacks Rank and has delivered average positive earnings surprise in the last four quarters.Aetnais a provider of healthcare, dental, pharmacy, group life, disability, and long-term care benefits.

823,HUM,"Humana Inc.(HUM  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 8, before the market opens.The company has a decent surprise history. It pulled off positive surprises in all of the last four quarters with an average beat of 7.2%. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.84% on the back of strong performance by its Retail segment. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The company’s retail segment has been performing well over past many quarters driven by its Medicare and Medicaid expansion initiatives. We expect the trend to continue in the third quarter as well. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues is pegged at $11.2 billion that reflects a slight decrease of 1% year over year.The company’s consistent growth in premium revenues has been largely driven by Medical membership growth. Humana has seen solid medical membership increase in its Individual Medicare Advantage and Group Medicare Advantage businesses. For the quarter, Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 14 million, up 48% year over year.Other FactorsThe standalone Prescription Drug Plans membership is likely to have grown, adding significantly to the Medicare business.Nevertheless, Humana is expected to suffer from rising benefit expenses that keep putting pressure on margins.Individual commercial membership is expected to remain a drag due to the rise in premiums along with benefit redesigns in place since the beginning of 2016. Along with other companies like Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report), UnitedHealth Group, Inc (UNH  -  Free Report), Humana has also started scaling down this business and plans to exit it in 2018. This segment is expected to affect the company’s results in the third quarter as well.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Humana is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Humana has an Earnings ESP of -1.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $3.32 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $3.27.

824,HUM,"Envision Healthcare Corp. (EVHC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31, after market close.Last quarter, this health services company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.7%. However, earnings declined year over year due to an increase in expense, which outdid revenue growth.The company does not have an impressive surprise history. Though it missed estimates in only one the last four quarters, the average is a negative earnings surprise of 0.7%. This is depicted in the graph below:Q3 FlashbackThe company is likely to see lower revenues from its Ambulatory Services segment, which experienced soft business volumes in the past few quarters.Moreover, the company is reeling under escalating operating expenses for several quarters, due to higher salaries and benefits expenses. Most alarming is the rate of increase in operating expense, which has overshadowed the revenue growth rate, thereby thwarting bottom-line growth. The same is expected to be seen in the to-be-reported quarter.A huge debt load is also niggling Envision Healthcare. Its total debt has been swelling since 2013, leading to a spike in interest expense. This, in turn, will dent its operating margins.The quarter is likely to see increased interest expense as a result of increased borrowings related to the merger and incremental term-loan borrowings to fund recent acquisitions.We, nevertheless, expect to see an increase in revenues from the company's Physician Services segment (which contributes nearly 84% of the company’s revenues), driven by synergy from recent acquisitions as well as organic growth. Revenue growth is expected to come from higher patient volumes as well as improved pricing. We also expect to see improved EBIDTA which must have benefited from merger-related synergies.The company’s Ambulatory service segment will likely report a decline in revenues due to disposal of centers.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Envision Healthcare is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Envision Healthcare has an Earnings ESP of -10.98%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 78 cents per share is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Envision Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies from the health care sector that you may want to consider as these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in the third quarter.Aetna, Inc.

825,HUM,"Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), scheduled to report third-quarter results on Oct 31, is expected to witness a decline in revenues in its Health Care segment due to lower contribution from Commercial health insurance partly offset by premium increase in Government business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $14.4 billion, down 4% year over year.Medical Benefit Ratio, a metric used to measure medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, is expected to increase in the third quarter, led by an unfavorable performance in individual Commercial products.The company projects an increase in the ratio driven primarily by the suspension of the health insurer fee and experience rating pressure in the company’s Group Commercial and Group Medicare Advantage products, partially offset by projected improvement in its Individual Commercial Insured products. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is 84%, up from 82% in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total medical membership, one of the key drivers of revenues is 22.14 million, down 4.2% year over year. The decline is likely to be driven by lower membership in the company’s public exchange compliant Individual and Small Group products.The company’s focus on managing costs will keep a check on its operating expenses.In the first quarter, Aetna resumed its share buyback which was terminated due to its planned merger with Humana. Share repurchases made by the company in the third quarter will help to lift its earnings.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model shows that Aetna has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.68%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $2.12 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09.The positive ESP is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.

826,HUM,"HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31, before the opening bell.The company has an impressive surprise history. It surpassed estimates in two of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3.6%.Q3 ExpectationsWe expect earnings to reflect the prevailing industry-wide softness in volumes. Factors such as payor initiatives to move volumes away from hospitals, rising deductibles and prevalence of high deductible health plans, and increased proportion of hospital care to be paid by consumers are driving away volumes. The same is likely to be seen in the quarter.Patient admissions will, however, be sustained on the back of organic and inorganic growth measures. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total admissions, one of the key revenue drivers, (represents the total number of patients admitted to the company’s hospitals and is a general measure of inpatient volume) is 483,000, which reflects year-over-year growth of 2.8%.Shares bought back by the company in the third quarter will cushion the bottom line. The company has not paid regular dividend since its IPO in 2011. It prefers share buyback over dividend payment for allocating capital and will maintain this policy.Preliminary ResultsRecently, the company announced preliminary financial and operating results for the to-be-reported quarter. It reported revenues of approximately $10.7 billion, up 4.1% year over year and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.8 billion, down 9.2% year over year. Earnings per share of $1.21 per share reflected a decline 25% year over year.  The results bore the impact of recent hurricanes, which caused loss of $140 million in some of the company’s major markets.Same facility admissions in the third quarter increased 0.6%, while same facility equivalent admissions increased 0.3% year over year. Same facility emergency room visits increased 0.3% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for same facility equivalent admissions points to an increase of 0.5%.Here’s what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that HCA Healthcare is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

827,HUM,"Third-quarter earnings have already crossed the halfway mark. As of Oct 18, 52 S&P 500 companies reported results with strong earnings numbers.Per the latest Earnings Trends, third-quarter 2017 results of the 52 S&P 500 members that have reported results, account for 16.7% of the index’s total market capitalization. Total earnings for these companies are up 13.3% year over year on 6.9% rise in revenues, with 73.1% beating earnings per share estimates.As of Oct 18, 5.4% of the total Medical sector, one of the seven sectors in the S&P 500 group, reported third-quarter results. The beat ratio is strong with 66.7% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations.Sector TrendsThe sector has been in the limelight ever since Donald Trump became the President. Trump’s intention to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Act, popularly known as Obamacare, has resulted in an uncertain future for the whole sector. As a result, the medical stocks continue to be in focus.The U.S healthcare industry substantially benefits from the strong membership base supported by medicare expansion under Obamacare. Aggressive inorganic strategies have helped the players achieve fast-paced growth. In addition, new product launches, improving service, expansion into ancillary businesses and expense management strategies are expected to add to the top line.However, medical stocks face threats like the rising level of bad debt, demand for increasing investments in technological innovation, integration cost related to acquisitions and high interest expenses on debt-funded acquisitions. These are likely to put pressure on the bottom line.Stocks to CompareLet’s take a sneak peek into two Medical sector stocks that are set to report their quarterly earnings on Oct 24.We expect the third-quarter earnings for Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) to show a decline in revenues at the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) segment, which is one of the major revenue components. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM revenues stands at $23.226 billion, reflecting a decline of 4.8% from the year-ago quarter.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM product network is pegged at $11,069 million, down 8.9% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM service revenues is $365 million, down 3.2% year over year. Lackluster performance in these segments is likely to mar Express Scripts’ revenues in the third quarter.Per the company’s guidance for the third quarter, its total adjusted claims are expected in the range of $340-$350 million. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total claims stands at $243 million, down 2.1% sequentially.Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter are estimated in the range of $1.88-$1.92, representing growth of 8% to 10% on a year-over-year basis. This excludes any contribution from Anthem and other transitioning clients.Express Scripts announced that its biggest customer, leading health insurer Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), is not likely to extend its pharmacy-benefits management agreement, which is slated for expiration by the end of 2019. Per management, Express Scripts might lose almost 50% of its revenues related to the Anthem contract in the third quarter itself.Express Scripts has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Notably, the Earnings ESP for Express Scripts is +0.13%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Express Scripts Holding Company Price and EPS Surprise Express Scripts Holding Company Price and EPS Surprise | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteWe expect Centene Corporation’s (CNC  -  Free Report) third-quarter earnings to be aided by solid Medicaid expansion.For the past few quarters, Centene has been witnessing consistent growth in its membership that has been driving the overall top line.  The company expects this uptrend to continue in the third quarter as well and impact revenues positively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total membership is currently pegged at 12.1 billion, reflecting 6.1% year-over-year growth.The major contributor to this rising membership is Centene’s continuously growing Medicaid base. Medicaid expansion one of the provision of Affordable Care Act, has benefitted Centene. This was driven by Centene’s intention to continue on exchanges while other health insurers like Humana Inc (HUM  -  Free Report) and many more are exiting it.The third quarter is also likely to witness further expansion of its Medicaid business. In the third quarter, the company successfully reprocured a new statewide Medicaid contract in Georgia and Nevada. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medicaid membership presently stands at 5.8 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 3.6%.Moreover, Centene has been taking several cost saving initiatives that are reducing the level of expenses. The margin is likely to be aided by lower expenses in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total general and administrative expenses ratio is currently pegged at 0.09 compared with 9.23 in the second quarter of 2017.Centene also has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to strengthen the possibility for a beat.

828,HUM,"Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) has recently announced that it has completed the acquisition of Orlando, FL-based Family Physicians Group (“FPG”). Financial terms of the deal remain undisclosed.Humana’s Medicare ExpansionAmid speculations that Humana might be acquired by retail major Walmart, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), the deal is an indication that Humana is not giving up on its strategy of expanding its provider networks.Humana’s Medicare Advantage business has been strongly delivering owing to operating initiatives that have led to favorable prior-period medical claims development and lower current-year utilization, evident from average 5.5% growth of total Retail Medicare membership in the last four years. Earlier, the company acquired MD Care, which increased Humana’s Medicare Advantage membership strength by approximately 15,000 members.Shareholders have also gained confidence in the stock, given its strong Medicare membership base and growth potential. In a year’s time, the stock has surged 34.8%, outperforming the industry’s rise of 33.8%. Why FPG?FPG is known to be one of the largest at-risk providers serving Medicare Advantage and Managed Medicaid HMO patients in Greater Orlando. The company serves more than 22,000 Medicare Advantage patients including nearly 4,000 Humana members. The company’s expertise in treating people of Central Florida, especially seniors with chronic conditions, is expected to further fortify Humana’s commitment to helping its Medicare, Medicaid plus government and commercial members achieve their best health.Humana’s value-based care model revolves around physicians’ utmost efforts to achieve improved health outcomes for patients, lowering medical expenses and transforming health care nationally. The company is aggressively widening its primary care model with intention to establish a national footprint of senior, high-performing, focused primary care physicians.Moreover, FPG’s comprehensive care management model and proactive medical management initiatives successfully improve patient outcomes at a lower cost. The buyout of FPG significantly supports Humana’s strategy to help physicians and clinicians manage members’ health via a holistic approach.Peers’ Moves in the Medicare SpaceThe lucrative nature of Medicare business along with its leading players’ objective to stake a claim in this rapidly growing health insurance market has fueled a series of mergers and acquisitions in the industry.Cigna Corporation's (CI  -  Free Report) acquisition of HealthSpring and Aetna Inc.'s (AET  -  Free Report) buyout of Genworth’s Medigap business are noteworthy in this respect.The recent announcement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on account of raising 2019 Medicare Advantage reimbursement rate by 3.4% is likely to further boost the potential of Medicare space driving more consolidations.Zacks RankHumana carries a Zacks rank #3 (Hold).

829,HUM,"Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 earnings results before the opening bell on Oct 19.Last quarter, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14 cents delivering a positive earnings surprise of 9.9%. Also, Quest Diagnostics outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all trailing four quarters with an average beat of 7.1%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayAfter several quarters of sustained drag in the company’s revenue per requisition performance,last quarter saw a slight rebound. However, it still remains to be seen if this improvement is here to stay or not. The company’s two Professional Lab Services (PLS) engagements — WJ Barnabas Health and HealthONE System of HCA Holdings, Inc. (HCA) — carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of work.Overall, we believe that a low level of employment and slow growth of commercially-insured lives will continuously impact the company’s volume (measured by the number of requisitions) environment till the economy turns around for better.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Quest Diagnostics Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated QuoteThis apart, unit price headwinds were less than 100 bps in the previously reported second quarter. While unit price headwinds hovered in moderate ranges (at approximately 1%) over the last few years, the company continues to expect the same for the rest of 2017 too.Also, over the last two years, Quest Diagnostics has faced several reimbursement issues that affected its revenues. The company is concerned about the CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) proposal related to Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA). We believe, reimbursement pressure will be reflected as an overhang in the company’s performance this soon-to-be-reported quarter too.Notably, the company has not positively taken the latest Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) publication of proposed 2018 Medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory tests under the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (CLFS). However, this leaves no impact on its yet-to-be-reported quarter’s revenue numbers.On a positive note, Quest Diagnostics seems to be determined to repeat its well-meaning efforts from second-quarter 2017 by stimulating the company’s performance via a two-point growth strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence.We are also optimistic about the company’s successful execution of its strategy to grow esoteric testing business and drive profitable growth.Additionally, Quest Diagnostics has recently witnessed significant growth through infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and industry-leading wellness business. We expect these growth drivers to remain active through the third quarter as well, driving the same metrics as in the preceding quarter.We strongly believe all these recent developments to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in the third quarter.The company currently expects full-year 2017 revenues in the range of $7.69-$7.74 billion (annualized growth of 2.6-3.4%). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.7 billion, just above the lower-end of the guided range.In addition, the company’s 2017 adjusted EPS range remains at $5.62-$5.72. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.65 is within this range.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Quest Diagnostics is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Quest Diagnostics has an Earnings ESP of -2.52%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.33 is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Quest Diagnostics has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which decreases the predictive power of ESP. Combined with a negative ESP, Quest Diagnostics’ chances of an earnings beat can not be conclusively predicted.We caution against the stocks with Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks worth considering from the same space as our proven model shows them to comprise the right combination of elements to beat estimates this quarter:  The Cooper Companies, Inc. (COO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.62% and a Zacks Rank #2.

830,HUM,"We expect health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter results on Oct 17, before market opens.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that UnitedHealth has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates.Zacks ESP:  Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.94%.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating on earnings.UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated QuoteWhat is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?We expect the quarter’s results to show broad-based growth across the enterprise.Its segment, UnitedHealth Care, is expected to witness an increase in membership across its employer-sponsored, Medicare, Medicaid and international medical benefit offerings.The company has been performing strongly in its government business which includes Medicare and Medicaid. We expect solid Medicare advantage performance to continue in the third quarter driven by the combination of premium and benefit stability, rising stars rating performance, and improved service and clinical performance, all leading to record retention rates.The company’s Medicaid business is also performing well with continued growth in membership enrollment. The same is expected in the third quarter through new contract awards from states for Managed Medicaid business, as well as for expanded services for additional segments of the Medicaid eligible population.We expect to see increased enrollment in the third quarter driven by increased membership in Medicare Advantage, Commercial and Medicaid plans.Results should also show an increase in revenues from its health services’ segment Optum, driven by higher contribution from sub-segments OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx.Earnings will, however, be partially offset by a reduction in the number of people served through individual products as the company withdrew from almost all individual public exchange markets.The company’s bottom line will be cushioned by cost-control initiatives and capital management by way of share buyback.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies in the same space that you may also consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Humana Inc.

831,HUM,"On Aug 29, Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) hits a 52-week high of $255.91. The improvement is believed to have been driven by strong second-quarter results, guidance raise and the recent completion of accelerated share buyback.Notably, the stock has surged 43% in the last year, almost in line with the industry’s rally of 42% but significantly outperforming the S&P 500 index’s rise of 12.2%.In fact, investors are optimistic on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s strong second-quarter earnings that topped Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.3%. This uptick was owing to solid performance by both the Medicare Advantage business segment and Retail segment.The company’s raised guidance (for the second time this year) is also encouraging. Humana now expects 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $11.50, to be up from the previous guidance of at least $11.10 per share. The latest guidance also reflects 20% increase in earnings compared with 2016. Operating cash flow increased by approximately $200 million, primarily owing to a better financial performance.Interestingly, an upbeat guidance instills confidence in the company’s ability to perform well in a highly regulated and competitive industry.Consequently, the company announced a strong outlook for its Medicare business, one of its most significant growth drivers. It expects approximately 74% of its Medicare members to be in 4-Star or higher plans, for the year 2018, which compares favorably to its previous forecast of 37%.Going forward, Humana’s anticipates to book 2017 pre-tax earnings of approximately $85 million in its Indiividual Commercial segment compared with the previous expectation of a full-year loss of approximately $45 million. The reversal in this segment is expected to be driven by lower-than-anticipated medics cost for the exchange enrollees.  Investors also viewed favorably the timely completion of $1.5 billion of accelerated share buyback plan announced in the first quarter.In fact, another leading health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc.

833,HUM,"Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) will release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, before the market opens.For the past few quarters, Centene has been witnessing consistent growth in its membership that has been driving the overall top line.  The company expects this uptrend  to continue in the third quarter as well and impact revenues positively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total membership is currently pegged at 12.1 billion, reflecting 6.1% year over year growth.The major contributor to this rising membership is Centene’s continuously growing Medicaid base. Medicaid expansion, another provision of Affordable Care Act, has benefitted Centene. This was driven by Centene’s intention to continue on exchanges while other health insurers are exiting it. The third quarter is also likely to witness further expansion of its Medicaid business. In the third quarter, the company successfully reprocured a new statewide Medicaid contract in Georgia and Nevada. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medicaid membership presently stands at 5.8 billion, reflecting a year over year growth of  3.6%.Moreover, Centene has been taking several cost saving initiatives that are reducing the level of expenses. The margin is likely to be aided by lower  expenses in the third quarter.

837,HUM,"It has been more than a month since the last earnings report for Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report).

However, revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.6 billion.Humana’s adjusted consolidated benefit ratio of 83.4% deteriorated 90 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017.Adjusted consolidated operating cost ratio of 10.7% improved 130 bps from the year-ago quarter, also due to the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for 2017.Quarterly Segment ResultsRetail SegmentRevenues from the Retail segment were $11.30 billion, up 3% year over year, primarily owing to higher revenues from the company’s Medicare Advantage business.Benefit ratio of 85.8% deteriorated 50 bps year over year, primarily due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017. The segment’s operating cost ratio of 8.5% improved 130 bps year over year because of the same reason.Adjusted pretax income of $613 million jumped 18% year over year, primarily due to lower benefit and operating cost ratios.Group and Specialty SegmentRevenues from the Group and Specialty segment were $1.83 billion, down 2% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due a decline in average group fully insured and ASO commercial medical membership.Benefit ratio deteriorated 100 bps year over year to 78.4%, due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017. Operating cost ratio improved 110 bps year over year to 21.6%, due to the same reason.Adjusted pretax income of $102 million decreased 19% year over year due to the timing of revenues under the company’s TRICARE contract primarily relating to medical cost trend incentives and amounts for additional services requested under the contract.Healthcare ServicesRevenues of $5.98 decreased 5% year over year, primarily due to the company’s Pharmacy Solutions business as well as the impact of the optimization process associated with its chronic condition management programs.Operating cost ratio remained flat year over year at 95%.Adjusted pretax income for the segment was $281 million, down 3% year over year due to ongoing pressures in the company’s provider services business. This reflects lower Medicare rates year over year in specific geographies, as well as the impact of the optimization process associated with the company’s chronic care management programs.Individual Commercial SegmentIndividual Commercial membership was 0.2 million as of Jun 30, 2017, down 77% over 2016 year-end, primarily due to a decline in number of countries where the company offers on exchange coverage as well as the discontinuance of off exchange products.Benefit ratio of 34.8% rose 106 bps from second quarter of 2016. The year over year improvement primarily resulted from the effect of the $208 million increase in the PDR in the prior-year quarter, planned exits in 2017 in certain markets that carried a higher benefit ratio, and per member premium increase.The segment’s operating cost ratio deteriorated 140 bps from the year ago quarter to 16.2%, primarily due the loss of scale efficiency from market exits in 2017.The company witnessed a pretax income of $118 million, which compared favorably with a pretax loss of $225 million in the prior year quarter. This was owing to the exit from certain markets in 2017 and per member premium increases.Financial UpdateAs of Jun 30, 2017, the company had cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities of $18.92 billion, down 1% sequentially.As of Jun 30, 2017, cash and short term investments held by the parent company was $2.82 billion, up 65% from Mar 31, 2017.Debt to total capitalization as of Jun 30, 2017 was 31.3%, down 260 bps from Mar 31, 2017.Cash flows used in operations totaled $83 million compared with $296 million in the prior-year quarter. The improvement was primarily driven by higher earnings year over year and the timing of working capital changes, partially offset by the portion of taxes paid in the quarter related to the merger termination fee.Share Repurchase and Dividend UpdateThe company subsequently entered into an agreement with a third-party financial institution to bring into effect a $1.50 billion ASR program under the authorization.Given the outstanding ASR, the company did not execute any share repurchases in the second quarter.The company paid cash dividends to its stockholders of $57 million in the second quarter.Guidance RaisedHumana increased its 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to $11.50 from the previous guidance of at least $11.10. The increase was primarily driven by the strong results in the Retail segment, largely attributable to the company’s individual Medicare Advantage business.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision lower for the current quarter.Humana Inc. Price and Consensus  Humana Inc. Price and Consensus | Humana Inc.

842,HUM,"When value or growth investing fails to fetch sustained profits, one should explore another time-tested winning strategy that simply bets on the frontrunner stocks. Translated, one of the most successful strategies today is to get in on momentum stocks at the right time.At the core, momentum investing is buying high, selling higher. It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction than move against the drift. Thus, this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast-moving train, without fretting about valuations or growth prospects. But why does the momentum strategy work?There is a simple reason behind this. It works because we are humans!There’s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works. For instance, there are investors who are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hopeful of a rebound in the prices. On the other hand, a few investors sell their winners way too early.Furthermore, investors initially tend to under-react to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they tend to go with the flow and overreact, causing dramatic price reactions.These behavioral problems extend trends, and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players. So basically, it’s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future.Momentum investing is thus based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs, i.e. before prices become rational again.Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period of time and across markets. So obviously, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play.Here, we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers and make handsome gains. Our screen will help you benefit from both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price, which would reflect some profit-taking in the stock.Screening ParametersPercentage Change Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This item selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get stocks that have appreciated the maximum over the past one year.Percentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10: From the above 50 stocks, we then choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a short one-week period.Zacks Rank #1: No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Momentum Style Score of B or better: A top Momentum Style Score knocks out a lot of the screening process as it takes into account several factors including volume change and performance relative to its peers. It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Stocks with a Momentum Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) handily outperform other stocks.Current Price greater than 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.Market Capitalization = Top #3000: We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000 in terms of market value to ensure strong liquidity.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that these stocks are easily tradable.Here are four of the seven stocks that made it through this screen:Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report), which operates as a health and well-being company in the United States, has gained 42.5% over the past one year.

843,HUM,"Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and its units have recently received Star Ratings from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) for its Medicare Advantage (MA) health plans.Per CMS, in 2018, more than 60% of Anthem’s Medicare Advantage members will be enrolled in MA plans that have achieved four stars or more, with five stars being the highest limit.The Know-How of Star RatingsStar Ratings are calculated every year on a scale of one to five stars (five being the highest limit), and are subject to change. CMS rates MA and Medicare prescription drug plans (PDP) on the basis of how well they provide medication coverage along with a number of factors like the quality of customer service being provided, count and frequency of member complaints, members’ experience with drug plans and the level of safety associated with the drugs.While assigning the ratings, CMS considers two parameters of the MA and PDPs namely, quality and performance. The MA plans are rated on the basis of their ability to take care of the members’ overall health, help them manage chronic conditions, ensure positive experiences with health plan, attain member satisfaction and offer effective customer service.Rationale Behind the RatingsThese Star Ratings reflect Anthem’s multi-year focus on the improvement of the quality of its Medicare offerings. It further intends to improve the performance of its health plans moving into 2019. Only 22% members were enrolled in four-star or better plans in 2016 Star Ratings.Over the last four years, Anthem remained committed to upgrade the performance and quality of its Medicare platform. It has been diligently engaged in providing the MA members greater access to high-quality health care at an affordable cost. The company looks forward to continuously customize its Medicare Advantage product portfolio with further innovation.Anthem and its affiliated health plans have made significant investments for expanding MA plans product portfolio and services areas. They also worked on local health plan staffing along with strengthening the level of engagement between provider and member.  On the back of these efforts, Anthem expects its Medicare business to grow further in 2018.Share Price PerformanceAnthem’s continues focus on creating customer delight has helped the stock retain shareholders’ confidence.

844,HUM,"Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report) has appointed Joseph M. Zubretsky as its new president and chief executive officer (CEO), effective Nov 6, 2017.Zubretsky has to his credit a career spanning 35 years in the insurance and financial services industry. Most recently, he served as president and CEO of The Hanover Insurance Group and was a member of its board.Until recently, Molina Healthcare was run by the two sons of its founders — J. Mario Molina and John Molina. Both were, however, ousted following the company’s poor performance.The appointment of the new CEO is one of the steps taken in the massive restructuring exercise undertaken by management to take the company back to profitability.In the second quarter, the company’s 2017 earnings guidance was withdrawn due to uncertainty regarding cost sharing reductions, cost trend in Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, and Puerto Rico, health plans and variability around timing of benefits and costs related to the restructuring plan.Molina Healthcare’s share price has returned 9.1% since the removal of the Molina brothers compared with the growth of 11.5% by the industry it belongs to.Other restructuring and profitability improvement steps include reduction in corporate and health plans workforce by 10%, termination of public exchange participation in Utah and Wisconsin with additional states in review, and restructuring of Direct delivery operations.These measures are aimed at generating $300-$400 million in savings upon completion of restructuring in late 2018. The company expects nearly $200 million in savings related to staff reductions to fully contribute to 2018 earnings. The company expects an additional $130-$150 million restructuring cost in the second half of 2017.  Zubretsky, with his valuable experience is deemed as the perfect fit to lead the company successfully during this transformative period. He boasts a track of strong leadership across multiple businesses, both inside and outside managed care. He also successfully restructured other organizations earlier.The transformation of the entire enterprise into a leaner, more streamlined organization, will enhance decision-making, improve the company’s operating performance, and aid its margins. Though the seeds of reformation have been planted, these will take time to bear fruit.Molina Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).  Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) and Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report). While Humana and Centene sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) each, Anthem carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

845,HUM,"Investors, who generally have a high-risk appetite, focus on momentum stocks to eke out strong gains. In this context, Richard Driehaus’ investing strategy, which is based on the “buy high and sell higher"" principle. Driehaus earned a place in Barron’s All-Century Team following the success of the investing strategy.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII’s portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five- and 10-year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% gains registered by the S&P 500. Thus investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy to boost their portfolio returns.A Detailed Look into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In line with this insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus’ philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price.

846,HUM,"WellCare Health Plans, Inc.’s (WCG  -  Free Report) growth strategies continue to help it retain its leading position in the industry. It has been strengthening its revenue base consistently over the last 10 years. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) implemented by the former U.S. President Barrack Obama also contributed significantly to the company’s top-line growth. Nevertheless, a lot many hassles around “Repealing and Replacing” the ACA under the Trump administration might lead to volatility in Medicaid programs enrolment.However, despite the regulatory uncertainty, WellCare Health remains an attractive pick for investors. Let’s delve deeper to find out why.WellCare Health has been witnessing consistent revenue growth supported by strategic acquisitions, partnerships and alliances since 2011. These initiatives not only bolstered the company’s presence in existing markets but also expanded its operations geographically. In the first half of 2017, revenues of $8.2 billion increased 15.6% year over year due to strong organic growth across all its three lines of business and the company's acquisition of Care1st Arizona.The company’s substantial cash inflow has helped it increase shareholders’ value through several capital deployment initiatives. In the first half of 2017, net cash from operating activities was $335 million versus net cash used for operating activities of $60 million in the prior-year quarter. The improvement was primarily driven by the advanced timing of Medicare-related receipts.  This high level of financial liquidity is expected to support the company's inorganic growth initiatives and further drive top-line growth.The company delivered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 47.37%. In the second quarter, its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year on higher revenues. Pursuant to the earnings beat, the company also raised its earnings and revenue guidance for 2017 that boosted shareholder optimism in the stock. Over past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 has also been revised upward significantly.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the same space can consider stocks like Humana Inc (HUM  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report) and Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report).Humana, a leading managed care company, topped estimates in all of the last four quarters with an average beat of 6.63%.Aetna surpassed expectations in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 18.97%Anthem delivered positive surprises in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 8.58%.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

847,HUM,"Aetna, Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) has completed a public offering of $1 billion of 3.875% senior notes due to mature on Aug 15, 2047. The company intends to use $987.6 million in net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes and to repay a portion of its 1.5% senior notes and floating-rate senior notes, both due in 2017.Prior to the completion of this issuance, these notes received rating action from A.M. Best. The rating giant assigned a Long-Term Issue Credit Rating of “bbb” to these senior unsecured notes.Aetna’s financial solvency reflected substantial improvement after the early redemption of $10.2 billion of senior notes in February 2017, which were issued in 2016 to finance the then pending buyout of Humana, Inc (HUM  -  Free Report). However, following the termination of the buyout, Aetna redeemed a significant portion of that debt. As a result, the company’s financial leverage came down below 40% as of Jun 30, 2017 compared with 50% at the end of 2016.Per A.M Best, the debt issuance is likely to cause a marginal increase to Aetna’s debt-to-capital ratio until the forthcoming maturities are paid back in 2017. Nevertheless, the rating giant also believes the ratio will eventually go below 40%.Aetna witnessed a decline in its shareholders’ equity on Jun 30, 2017 from year-end 2016. The fall was due to its accelerated share repurchase and dividend hike. The company’s disciplined capital management is viewed favorably by investors. In last six months, the company’s shares have gained 25%, outpacing the industry’s rally of 21%.However, Aetna’s financial results were adversely impacted by the payment of the $1 billion merger termination fee to Humana in early 2017. Despite this, we remain optimistic about Aetna’s financial excellence backed by its group commercial and government business that posted better-than-expected results in the second quarter of 2017, supported largely by premium growth and modest cost trend.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderAetna presently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Investors may also consider some other stocks in the same space like Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Amedisys Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report). Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2.Anthem, one of the largest Health Maintenance Organization of the U.S, delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 8.58%.Amedisys, an outpatient and Home Healthcare Organization of the U.S, delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 12.16%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?                                    Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

848,HUM,"Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC  -  Free Report) incurred second-quarter 2017 adjusted net loss from continuing operations attributable to its shareholders of 17 cents per diluted share that met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure compared unfavorably with earnings of 38 cents in the year-ago quarter due to lower revenue generation.This underperformance primarily stemmed from $55 million decline in California Provider Fee revenues and a $15 million fall in electronic health record incentives.Operational UpdateSecond-quarter net operating revenues came in at $4.8 billion, down 1.4% from the prior-year quarter. Revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Tenet Healthcare’s same-hospital exchange admissions were 5,488 in the second quarter, down 2.2% year over year.Same-hospital exchange outpatient visits were 58,873 in the quarter, up 10.1% from the year-ago quarter.Tenet Healthcare’s provision for doubtful accounts was $371 million, representing a ratio of 7.2% of revenues before bad debt compared with $352 million in the prior-year quarter, or 6.7% of revenues before bad debt. The increase in the bad debt ratio was primarily attributable to a $26 million increase in uninsured revenues.Total operating expenses of $4.5 billion decreased 2.2% year over year due to a substantial decline in litigation and investigation costs.Quarterly Segment Details:Hospital & OtherNet operating revenues in the Hospital Operations and Other segment decreased 0.1% from the last-year quarter to $4.1 billion. This was primarily due to a decline in adjusted admissions and the company not being able to record revenues under the California Provider Fee Program in the second quarter.On a same-hospital basis, patient revenues were $4.036 billion, up 0.4% from second-quarter of 2016.Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $346 million, down 19% year over year. This stemmed from $55 million decline in revenues from the California Provider Fee program and a $15 million fall in electronic health record incentives.Ambulatory Segment:The Ambulatory segment generated net operating revenues of $472 million, up 6.8% year over year.In addition, the segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $164 million, up 18% year over year.Conifer Segment:Conifer’s revenues increased 3.6% from the prior-year quarter to $400 million on the back of 11.5% higher revenues generated from third-party customers.The segment reported $60 million of adjusted EBITDA in the reported quarter, down 4.8% year over year.Tenet Healthcare Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Tenet Healthcare Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Tenet Healthcare Corporation QuoteFinancial PositionAs of Jun 30, 2017, Tenet Healthcare had cash and cash equivalents of $475 million, down 34% from year-end 2016.The company exited the second quarter with $15.012 billion of long-term debt, down 0.3% from year-end 2016.As of Jun 30, 2017, shareholders’ equity was $373 million, down 11% from Dec 31, 2016.Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended Jun 30, 2017 was $401 million, representing a 31% decline from the first half of 2016.2017 Outlook LoweredTenet Healthcare projects revenues in the range of $19.1 billion to $19.4 billion, down from the previously guided range of $19.7–$20.1 billion.Adjusted EBITDA is expected between $2.450 billion and $2.550 billion, down from the previous projection of $2.525–$2.625 billion. Adjusted earnings per diluted share is projected in the range of 69–99 cents, lower from the earlier projection of $1.05–$1.30.Tenet Healthcare expects adjusted free cash flow of $525–$725 million, down from the prior projection of $600–$800 million.

849,HUM,"We expect American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter results on Apr 19, before market opens.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that American Express has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates.Zacks ESP:  Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +2.04%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.50 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.47. The positive ESP is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: American Express carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating on earnings.Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.  What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?We expect American Express’ second-quarter results to showcase the benefits of its cost reduction efforts over the last couple of years.Continued return of significant capital to shareholders through its dividend and share buyback programs will aid bottom lineThe company’s Global Commercial Services segment is expected to give a muted performance as travel and entertainment spending by large corporations remains at low levels.We expect to see higher net card fees driven by continued strength in its premium U.S. portfolios including Platinum, Gold and Delta, as well as growth in key international markets like Japan and Australia.Second-quarter results will likely reflect an increase in loan lending. Also, focus on existing card members and increased use of digital channels is expected to drive new card issuance.Nevertheless, card spending volumes at another of the company’s segments — Global Network and Merchant Services — is expected to be under pressure due to the changing regulatory environment specifically in the European Union, Australia and China.We also expect to see higher reward expense, which will weigh on margins, as the company has made enhancements to its U.S. platinum products to woo and retain its customers.American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise | American Express Company QuoteOther Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may also consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Humana Inc.

850,HUM,"UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) has witnessed a rating action from Moody's Investors Service. Moody's affirmed the senior debt rating of the UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company (UHIC) unit at ‘A3’ and the insurance financial strength (IFS) rating at 'A1.’Moody’s also upgraded the outlook on UnitedHealth and UHIC to stable from negative.Looking back, Moody’s had put the company’s rating on negative watch following its acquisition of pharmacy benefit manager Catamaran in 2015. This raised the company’s leverage ratio as the deal was financed by debt.The rating action takes into account the company’s leadership position in the industry, its diversified business product profile, its profitable health benefits and health service segments. Consistent cash generation by UnitedHealth has enabled it to lower its debt levels.An offsetting factor is the company’s use of debt for acquisitions, which makes it more leveraged. Also, high goodwill and lower risk based capital ratio (as at the end of 2016) is another blip.Volatility in medical cost and regulatory uncertainties are the other headwinds facing the company.Nevertheless, the rating agency is of the opinion that the company will continue to post strong earnings driven by stable medical utilization trends, disciplined medical management, and efforts toward reducing debt levels to 40% from 44% as of Mar 31, 2017.In the last one year, the stock has returned 32%, a little lower than the Zacks categorized Medical - HMOs industry’s gain of 35%. However, the underperformance is not a matter of concern and we expect shares to gain traction soon, given the company’s strong fundamentals.Early during the year, two major players in the same industry — Humana Inc.

851,HUM,"UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 18, before the opening bell.Last quarter, UnitedHealth surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.72%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 FlashbackWe expect the quarter’s results to show broad-based growth across the enterprise.Its segment, UnitedHealth Care, is expected to witness an increase in membership across its employer-sponsored, Medicare, Medicaid and international medical benefit offerings. This will be partially offset by a reduction in the number of people served through individual products as the company withdrew from almost all ACA Individual markets.Results should also show an increase in revenues from its health services segment Optum, driven by higher contribution from subsegments OptumHealth and OptumInsight and OptumRx.The company’s bottom line will be cushioned by cost-control initiatives and capital management by way of share buyback.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that UnitedHealth is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: UnitedHealth has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $2.38 per share is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which increases the predictive power of ESP.

The improvement was driven by customer growth and specialty contributions in the company’sCommercial employer group. However, the upside was partially offset by reductions in Government customers.Adjusted operating earnings were $591 million, up 21.6% year over year on strong medical and specialty results, and continued effective medical cost.Global Supplemental Benefits: Premiums and fees from this segment climbed 14% year over year to $914 million on the back of continued business growth.Adjusted operating income increased 26.5% year over year to $105 million, reflecting business growth and strong operating expense management.Global Disability and Life: Premiums and fees also increased 1% year over year to $1.02 billion, primarily driven by consistent business growth across disability and life products.The segment reported adjusted operating income of $83 million against a loss of $12 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting continued stable life results and further improvement in disability performance.Financial PositionCash and marketable investments were $2.2 billion at Jun 30, 2017 and $2.8 billion at year-end 2016.Cigna’s long-term debt of $4.6 billion as of Jun 30, 2017 declined from $4.8 billion as of Dec 31, 2016.Year to date, the company has repurchased 7.7 million shares of common stock for approximately $1.25 billion.Cigna Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Cigna Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Cigna Corporation Quote2017 GuidanceCigna pulled up its 2017 earnings guidance after strong results.

The company is poised for long-term growth on the back of its robust Global Supplemental business, growing government business and increasing membership. A strong capital position and resumption of share buyback are the other positives. The company has also been successful in maintaining its medical cost ratio at low levels.Zacks Rank and Performance of Other InsurersCurrently, Cigna carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Aetna’s bottom line displayed improvement due to higher net income as well as lower transaction and integration-related costs.Operational UpdateTotal revenue of $15.5 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.30 billion by approximately 1.3%. Revenues, however, declined 2.5% year over year due to lower premiums in Aetna's Health Care segment.Adjusted expense ratioimproved 60 basis points (bps) to 16.5% from the prior-year quarter.

The downside primarily stemmed from lower membership in Aetna's ACA compliant individual and small group products and temporary suspension of the HIF in 2017. This was somewhat offset by higher premium yields in the company’s Commercial and Government businesses and membership growth in its Medicare products.Pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.8 billion, up 38.5% year over year primarily due to continued strong performance across its core Health Care businesses. The increase also reflects Aetna's updated estimates of risk adjustment payables for the prior year for individual and small group ACA compliant products.Group InsuranceTotal revenue of $642 million declined 0.8% from the prior-year quarter.

856,HUM,"We expect Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) to surpass expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 18, before the market opens. Last quarter, Abbott delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.3%.Abbott’s strong and impressive earnings track record reflects its estimate beats in each of the past four quarters, delivering an average of 4.6%. Also, the company’s shares have surged 34.6% so far this year. This compares favorably with the industry’s 11.6% registered rally during the same period.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model conclusively shows that Abbott is likely to beat on earnings this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for a likely positive surprise.Zacks ESP: Abbott has an Earnings ESP of +0.24%, indicative of being confident about an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Abbott currently carries a bullish Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP with a higher chance of beating estimates.Conversely, all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) are cautioned against going into an earnings announcement.What Is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?Abbott has been on a healthy growth trajectory in Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD) business, delivering encouraging operational sales growth in the trailing few quarters. Major part of this growth was stimulated by a series of strategic actions, including Abbott’s sale of developed market businesses along with acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia. Abbott Laboratories Price and Consensus  Abbott Laboratories Price and Consensus | Abbott Laboratories Quote The company also continues to expect strong growth in EPD in the upcoming quarters, particularly in China, Russia and several markets in Latin America including Brazil on the back of Abbott’s strong position lies and competitive edge in these geographies. Also, there should be chances of a certain revamp in EPD sales in India in the third quarter, following the business loss that Abbott had incurred due to implementation of a Goods and Services tax (GST) in this country in the second quarter.There haves been a slew of developments within the medical device space as well. The market is upbeat about Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System’s recent reimbursement approval in the United Kingdom. Plus, the company has recently announced receipt of Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System.With these positives in place, Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre system stands partially or fully covered in 17 countries, including France, Germany and Japan. We expect this uptrend to further stimulate growth in the Diabetes Care sales segment within Medical group that improved 18.7% in second-quarter 2017 on continued consumer acceptance of FreeStyle Libre in international arenas.Within Cardiac Arrhythmias and Heart Failure business, the recent FDA approval of Abbott’s Full MagLev HeartMate 3 Left Ventricular Assist System is expected to boost the company’s sales from the third quarter itself.We are also encouraged about the ongoing synergies from the acquisition of St. Jude Medical on Jan 4, earlier in the year. The comprehensive combined portfolio appears quite promising.Notably, Abbott projects annual pre-tax synergies of $500 million by 2020, including revenue expansion opportunities as well as operational and SG&A efficiencies.For the third quarter of 2017, the company forecasts adjusted earnings per share of 64-66 cents. Comparable operational sales growth for the quarter is projected in mid-single digits.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other companies worth considering from the same space as our proven model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this quarter:  QIAGEN N.V. (QGEN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.67% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered this QuarterHumana’s revenue base is likely to receive a boost from the strong performance of Individual Medicare Advantage, the Group Medicare Advantage and Healthcare Services businesses in the second quarter.The standalone Prescription Drug Plans membership is likely to grow, adding significantly to the Medicare business.Nevertheless, Humana is expected to suffer from rising benefit expenses, which will putpressure on margins.Continuing the trend of the past quarters, individual commercial membership is expected to remain a drag due to the rise in premiums along with benefit redesigns in place since the beginning of 2016.Another weak performer, the public exchange business, might continue the trend of underperformance in the second quarter as well.The blocked merger with Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report) that went through numerous regulatory procedures is likely to continue to increase legal expenses, putting pressure on the bottom line in the second quarter as well.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Humana is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

Its other digital initiatives Visa Direct and mVisa are continuing to expand globally.The company will likely report an increase in U.S. payments’ volumes driven by the gain of USAA and Costco clients.The company’s Service Revenue is likely to increase on higher global U.S. debit as well as credit card payment volumes.Also, growth in processed transaction is likely to push up Data Processing fees.The company’s disciplined capital allocation plan by way of share buyback and dividend payments should add to its bottom line.Fiscal third-quarter earnings are also likely to be benefited by a lower adjusted tax rate driven by the reorganization of Visa Europe and other subsidiaries.  Nevertheless, higher operating cost and forex headwinds will be the dampeners.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Visa is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Visa has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 81 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

However, an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Visa Inc.
