3,ROK,"The summit almost certainly is going to happen. Neither party can afford to cancel this late. How best to make it a success?We know the result will not be denuclearization as defined by the U.S. We will not implement the so-called Libya model, collecting North Korea nukes, despite what National Security Adviser John Bolton said.So what is the objective? Said President Donald Trump after announcing that the summit was on: ""It's a process. We're not go in and sign something on June 12 and we never were. We are going to start a process. And I told them today: take your time. We can go fast, we can go slowly.""It makes one wonder: who is this person, and where is the president who threatened to unleash ""fire and fury"" on the Korean peninsula?Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseProcess can be helpful. Still, process is only a means to bring about a substantive result. So what should the latter be?First, contra the president, the two leaders should sign something, even if just a short, but specific promise by the U.S. to end what might be considered ""hostile policy"" toward North Korea in return for Pyongyang's commitment to denuclearize, specifically eliminate the North's nuclear weapons and entire atomic infrastructure.Second, Washington should seek to make permanent the North's freeze on nuclear and missile tests. That commitment would be easy to police and would limit the reach of missiles and inhibit improvement of nuclear weapons.Third, President Trump and Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un should declare that they view the Korean War to be over and agree to negotiations that include the other major combatants, South Korea and China, to forge a peace treaty formally ending hostilities.Fourth, the president should propose a move toward diplomatic relations. That would not be a reward; the objective would be to create a routine communications channel, while creating an outpost for learning more about what long was accurately termed the Hermit Kingdom.Fifth, Washington would explain that expanding an American mission into a full-scale embassy would depend on North Korean officials being willing to engage on a range of political topics, including human rights.Sixth, on landing in Singapore the president should announce an end to the ban on Americans traveling to the North. At the meeting he should offer to initiate a liberal visa policy for North Korean visitors, who would be invited to come to America for sports, cultural, educational, and other purposes. An internal, organic transformation led by North Koreans would be far better than an outside attempt to impose regime change.Seventh, the president should override his ""alliance forever"" advisers and indicate his willingness to withdraw U.S. troops from and close America's ""nuclear umbrella"" over South Korea in return for denuclearization. It is an important objective worth making significant concessions. Moreover, denuclearization would eliminate any need for a U.S. garrison in the South.Eighth, the two leaders should establish the ""process"" that the president mentioned. A set of negotiations should be initiated with denuclearization as the formal objective. But they should be capable of reaching more limited agreements along the way. For instance, an inventory of the DPRK's nuclear assets, backed by inspections, would be an important step toward denuclearization.Washington should simultaneously encourage the Kim government to engage both the ROK and Japan, since their support would add to the success of a shift toward a more peaceful environment. At the same time, the U.S. should discuss the future of the Korean peninsula with China.Nevertheless, the Trump administration should encourage a more cooperative Beijing by indicating that the latter need not fear an American attempt to turn the peninsula into another military outpost in a regional containment system.President Trump deserves credit for taking the risk of meeting Kim Jong-un. The president even was right to step back from demanding immediate denuclearization, since expecting too much could have resulted in a catastrophic summit break-down, returning the two countries to sort of dangerous confrontation which dominated last year.Making the summit a success will involve process, as the president suggested, but also will need to address the right substance as well. The president still might fall short of a Nobel, but he could help defuse one of the world's hot spots. And that would be an accomplishment worth celebrating.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

4,ROK,"President Donald Trump's bromance with Chinese President Xi Jinping has yielded few practical results. To the contrary, U.S.-China relations increasingly seem headed for rough waters.Top of the list is North Korea. After the North's recent angry eruption, or ""different attitude,"" as President Trump put it, he blamed China: ""I think I understand why that happened,"" but ""I can't say that I'm happy about it.""Apparently the president believed that Kim was ready to toss away his nuclear weapons, and who knows what else, until President Xi summoned Kim to Beijing and issued contrary instructions. (The administration's multiple threats of military action are far more likely culprits for Pyongyang's shift.)President Trump is not the only one to assume that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was China's puppet. Joseph Bosco, who served in the Bush Defense Department, charged China with ""blatant sabotaging of the promising dialogue"" between the U.S. and North Korea.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn fact, Pyongyang is resisting administration demands because Kim believes they are not his nation's, or at least his regime's, interest. From its founding the DPRK has resolutely resisted foreign pressure. Long ago even the PRC discovered the limits of its influence in the North.Beijing wants a stable, docile, non-nuclear Korean buffer state. That would enhance China's regional influence, prevent the peninsula from being used as a tool of containment, spark allied requests for Chinese help to ""manage"" the North, and preserve a relationship with both historical and ideological significance. In contrast, a nuclear DPRK ensures Pyongyang's independence, including from the PRC, and generates American complications.Unfortunately for Beijing, its buffer state was always unruly and recently went nuclear. For years the Chinese leadership decided that buffer took precedence over nuclear.Especially since the PRC's influence in the North was substantially more limited some observers assumed. The Beijing-Pyongyang relationship was not unlike America's support for brutally repressive regimes — think Egypt or Saudi Arabia today — which nevertheless were believed to advance other U.S. interests.Chinese intervention in the Korean War preserved founder Kim Il-sung's rule, for which it received few thanks. For years he played Moscow against Beijing.The relationship between the two supposed allies has oscillated, but generally grown increasingly strained. Kim Jong-un accelerated nuclear and missile testing. Moreover, five years ago he executed his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, who was his nation's principle interlocutor with Beijing.Nevertheless, complained Bosco, the PRC enabled the North's ambitions ""by protecting successive Kim regimes from United Nations-imposed and other economic sanctions."" True, because China fears instability and collapse rather like Washington would view a possible Mexican implosion.In control of the entire peninsula, the ROK also would become a more significant international actor, potentially part of a U.S.-orchestrated containment system. In fact, in 1950 Beijing went to war to prevent a united Korea allied with America and hosting U.S. troops on its border. One can imagine Washington's reaction to Canada joining the Warsaw Pact.Thus, preserving the Kim dynasty made sense for the PRC. However, in recent years Chinese attitudes have hardened. After every North Korean test Beijing agreed to tighter restrictions and increasingly enforced them.Six years after Kim ascended to the North Korean throne he had yet to receive an invitation to the PRC. The DPRK was in the equivalent of Xi's doghouse.The Chinese deep freeze probably encouraged Pyongyang to play the America card. Xi watched as Kim met with South Korea's President Moon Jae-in and planned a summit with President Trump. This created a fearsome prospect for Beijing: an autonomous DPRK friendly to America.That possibility likely motivated the two Xi-Kim summits between March and May. It was imperative for Beijing to cater to Kim.China almost certainly was the supplicant, offering the DPRK what the latter long desired. Beijing still wanted North Korea to negotiate, but not from a position of weakness ready to toss the PRC under the proverbial bus.Instead of fulminating about Sino perfidy, Washington should engage the PRC over its perceived interests. For instance, a U.S. promise to withdraw troops and a South Korean pledge of military neutrality could moderate Chinese concerns over a westward North Korean move and even South Korea-dominated reunification.Washington should keep its eye on the prize at the upcoming summit: eliminating North Korean nuclear weapons. Doing so is still a long-shot. But President Trump should be prepared to pay the necessary price for the PRC's aid.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

17,ROK,"John Paul DeJoria was the most improbable kid to become a billionaire.His father abandoned the family when he was 2 and they barely had enough to eat, living in poor neighborhoods near downtown Los Angeles. He and his older brother had to stay in a foster home during the week while their mother worked. They bought scrap wood to build flower boxes that they sold to waitresses for 50 cents. The struggle gave him the determination to succeed against all odds.In a recent documentary, ""Good Fortune: The John Paul DeJoria Story,"" he talked about the time he was caught passing notes to Michelle Gilliam in a high school business class. Tired of their goofing off, the teacher announced that the two ""would never amount to anything.""Michelle Gilliam became one quarter of the music group The Mamas and the Papas. DeJoria owns John Paul Mitchell Systems, the hair care products giant, and Patron Spirits, which has 82% of the world market for ultrapremium tequila. Worth an estimated $5 billion, according to Bloomberg, DeJoria spends more than half his time helping and elevating those in need.""The principal message of the movie is that the rags-to-riches stories still work, no matter what the challenges are, and they work better if you can help other people along the way,"" DeJoria told IBD. ""I hope entire families will watch this on iTunes or Amazon because people need to believe in themselves and many don't anymore. I'm giving this to every homeless center and high school I can.""DeJoria, 73, recounted in ""Getting There: A Book of Mentors"" by Gillian Zoe Segal, that his family was once down to 25 cents, but mom gave her boys a dime to put in the Salvation Army's holiday pot, exhorting them to remember that there will always be someone less fortunate they can help.DeJoria sold Christmas cards door-to-door and got a paper route. When he graduated from L.A.'s John Marshall High School he didn't have good enough grades to get a college scholarship, he says, so he joined the Navy for two years.Returning, he married and had a son, but his wife left with their only good car. Within 24 hours, he found out that she hadn't been paying the rent and DeJoria and his son were evicted. Living out of his car, he began picking up soda bottles to recycle for two to five cents each. A friend in a biker gang invited him to live in one of his rooms, and while staying there DeJoria developed his lifelong love of motorcycles, which includes staging ride events to raise money for charities and to celebrate military veterans.DeJoria says he'd tried a lot of different jobs, from janitor to tow truck driver, but the one that he learned the most from was selling encyclopedias door-to-door. Walking from morning to late night, he didn't get his first sale for a week and it was no wonder that most who tried this dropped out after a few days.He stayed at it for 3-1/2 years.""In sales, you need to be as enthusiastic when you talk with potential customer No. 100 as you were with the first one,"" DeJoria said.At 26, he landed a job as circulation manager at Time (TIME), but DeJoria says that when the boss told him he'd have to wait nine years to become a vice president because he didn't have a degree, he left. A friend tipped him to the potential in the booming beauty industry, and DeJoria got hired as a salesman at Redken. Within 18 months, he was national manager for two divisions, but he says that because he wouldn't socialize with executives and complained about their testing products on animals, he was fired.DeJoria trained another firm's sales force, but again didn't fit in with the suits and was canned. As vice president of sales for a third firm, he says that he tripled its revenue in a year, but its CEO decided that he could have someone else get the same results for less pay.In 1980, DeJoria met innovative hairdresser Paul Mitchell, who was having trouble launching a product line to salons, so DeJoria lined up an investor for $500,000, he recalls. The day the money was to arrive, DeJoria gave his wife all his cash and moved out, only to have the investor back out. DeJoria asked his mother for $350, without telling her that he was living out of his car again, and with Mitchell's $350, they ordered their first four John Paul Mitchell Systems products — with black-and-white bottles because they couldn't afford color.DeJoria and his son were eating at restaurants with 99-cent specials until an actress whom he knew offered to let them stay in her home. Meanwhile, he was able to place the hair-care products by offering a money-back satisfaction guarantee.DeJoria and Mitchell barely paid the bills for the next two years, but in the third their company's sales took off.Women would normally go to their hairdressers once a week and not wash their hair in between visits to retain the style. DeJoria and Mitchell's company revolutionized hair care by offering salons innovative products that enabled customers to restyle their hair at home. They earned hairdressers' devotion by pledging that they would make their line exclusively available in salons, no matter how successful it became. John Paul Mitchell Systems runs over 100 schools to train hairdressers in the best ways to use the products.""Only a hairdresser knows what product will work best to create your hairstyle,"" explained DeJoria.Then in 1989, Mitchell died of cancer at 53 and some in the industry doubted that the company would last. But DeJoria took up the role of spokesman and it continued to grow, with it now bringing in $1 billion a year at the salon retail level from 103 countries.DeJoria's personal life has also improved, with his marriage to Eloise Broady of Austin in 1993, and DeJoria says they are close to the six children from their combined marriages.DeJoria's Patron Spirits sells more than 30 million bottles of ultrapremium tequila a year. He has branched out into other industries, such as Marquis Yachts in Pulaski, Wis., which builds luxury and sports vessels. Another is the ROK smartphone.One of his smallest but most high-profile investments came about when he appeared as a guest investor on ABC's hit reality show ""Shark Tank"" in 2013. The other Sharks were skeptical about the profitability of Tree T-Pee, which makes water conservation products. DeJoria saw a chance to keep the price low enough to help tree farmers and still make money. Inventor Johnny Georges said in the documentary that he's learned more about business working with him than from everyone else put together.""Even though J.P. is so busy and has so many businesses, it constantly amazes me that he always makes everyone in the room feel special and valued,"" said Jason Yates, VP of sales and marketing for John Paul Mitchell Systems.""He's also a man of his word, so loyal to his staff, distributors, and customers that once he makes a commitment, he never wavers. People all around him trust him immensely, which strengthens his leadership even further.""But DeJoria says that his real passion is philanthropy. He currently supports over 100 nonprofits, including the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, which tries to stop illegal whaling, and A Walk on Water, which has top surfers take special-needs children surfing to give them ""the true stoke"" of the sport ""and a sense of accomplishment."" Another favorite is SafePlace in Austin, Texas, where he and Eloise provide ongoing support for Eloise House, a clinic for survivors of sexual assault.Co-founder of hairstyling products maker John Paul Mitchell Systems and owner of ultrapremium tequila leader Patron Spirits.Overcame: Childhood poverty and later homelessness.Lesson: Hard work, persistence, enthusiasm, and a smile can overcome any disadvantage.""You don't want to be in the business of selling.

23,ROK,"After insisting that China should ""solve"" the North Korea problem, President Donald Trump appears to have given up. ""While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried,"" he tweeted. Now the issue apparently is back in President Trump's not-so-capable hands.X Unfortunately, the administration really didn't try. Beijing never was going to act just because President Trump wanted it to.Expecting the People's Republic of China to destroy its ally while the U.S. was busy elsewhere in the region seeking to contain Chinese military power, and to do so without receiving anything in return, never was realistic. Unspecified trade concessions simply weren't enough to make a deal.Alas, the administration doesn't have any other good options. Airstrikes might not reach all the facilities and probably would ignite a war, with devastating consequences to everyone involved, most dramatically South Korea.Enhanced sanctions are more likely, including secondary sanctions against Chinese companies and banks. This would risk creating a confrontation with Beijing.Moreover, by shifting the issue from North Korea to the PRC the Trump administration might actually increase Chinese support for the North. Witness the popular rage against South Korea over the THAAD deployment.Although tougher sanctions would impose economic hardship, there is no reason to assume that alone would bring Pyongyang to heel. When I visited the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in June, officials insisted they would stand firm against America's ""hostile policy"" no matter what. While they could be expected to say that, the DPRK did not change policy even in the midst of a horrific famine a couple of decades ago.And so far the PRC appears to value stability above all. If the Kim Jong-un regime appeared in danger of breaking, Beijing might buttress the North rather than risk a collapse, and the violent chaos which could follow.None of this is in the PRC's interest. Instead of acting as bystander if both regional stability and U.S. relations unravel, Beijing should push Washington to engage in serious negotiation with all parties.America's priority should be halting the DPRK's advancing missile and nuclear programs. Thus, Washington should revive the North's proposal for a freeze on its activities in return for an end to annual military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea. The latter agitates North Korean officials, who call them a cover for a possible attack.When I raised this possibility in Pyongyang they dismissed it, saying that the U.S. had rejected their offer. Coming from China and America together, and backed by the threat of joint sanctions, it would be more persuasive.With some breathing space, Washington could work with the Republic of Korea and Japan to develop a big offer in return for denuclearization, and with Beijing to win the latter's endorsement. The package would have to emphasize security — the DPRK's rulers watched the war in Libya and aren't impressed with verbal assurances like those offered by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.China should offer its support, as well as whatever assistance and assurances would encourage Pyongyang's acceptance. The objective is to denuclearize the peninsula peacefully through negotiation.In return, the PRC would agree to back the effort with the threat of enforcing its own and U.S. sanctions, so long as its other interests were respected. That would include allied assistance for China if the result was a violent DPRK collapse.Moreover, the U.S. should offer assurances that reunification would not put Beijing at a geopolitical disadvantage: In particular, all American military forces should go home in the event of unification. Seoul should consider a declaration of military neutrality for a unified peninsula.Even this approach has critics. Some aver the importance of regular maneuvers for combat effectiveness, but the ROK should be taking ever more responsibility for its own defense. Others fear the agreement would not be enforceable, but that would be an issue for any negotiated settlement.Finally, such an agreement would leave human rights at risk. However, a North Korea holding tightly to its nuclear weapons is unlikely to relax political controls.President Trump raised the potential of a China-U.S. deal over North Korea. Beijing shouldn't let him drop the issue without trying to reach an agreement. The situation in the North is likely to worsen, while the opportunities to solve it peacefully are likely to shrink. Action is needed now.

24,ROK,"SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Unlike America's presidential election, South Korea's contest yielded no surprises. Left-leaning Moon Jae-in topped a multimember field to take over from disgraced Park Geun-hye, who was impeached and removed from office on corruption charges.The contest was a rushed affair, held several months earlier than originally scheduled. Moon was the losing candidate five years ago and had served as chief of staff to the last liberal president.The ruling party split over Park's ouster and had little time to recover. Moon was briefly threatened by a more centrist opponent who backed him in the last election, but then faded in the stretch after a bad debate performance. Moon won with 41% of the vote, not exactly a mandate, but nevertheless with a sizable margin over the next finisher.Although Moon will face opposition in pushing his leftish economic nostrums, his foreign policy views will likely more controversy at home and abroad. Moon formally affirmed his commitment to the alliance in a postelection phone call with Donald Trump, but the former may be less enamored of his nation's long relationship with Washington than he suggested.Moon rose to prominence as a left-wing lawyer and human rights activist. He opposed the long-running military dictatorship, which only gave way in 1987 in response to mass demonstrations by Koreans demanding elections.He helped elect Roh Moo-hyun in 2002, a fellow activist attorney who won a narrow victory in the midst of surging anti-American sentiment. Moon lost to Park five years ago, but as head of the principal opposition party was well-positioned when Park's presidency collapsed.Moon's views are no secret, though like any good politician he downplayed his more controversial views during the brief campaign. He started as an opponent of the THAAD anti-missile system, which has been deployed in the Republic of Korea despite China's angry opposition.He urged revival of the so-called Sunshine policy, which sought to win North Korea's friendship with aid and commerce. (His proposal has been nicknamed Moonshine.) He promoted the idea of an ""economic community"" with the North, urged talks with North Korea's Kim Jong-un, endorsed revival of the Six-Party talks (which include Japan, Russia, and China), and expressed his desire to take his first foreign trip to Pyongyang.As the polls tightened he carefully qualified his positions, adding conditions for any approach to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Yet many suspect such promises were merely convenient election add-ons. Indeed, his newly appointed chief of staff, 39-year-old Im Jong-Seok, once was jailed for promoting contacts with the North and led a student group which occupied the U.S. ambassador's office.There's nothing wrong with South Koreans criticizing both America and the U.S.-South Korea alliance. In fact, the South is longer overdue in taking over responsibility for its own defense. Today South Korea enjoys a roughly 40-1 economic advantage and 2-1 population edge. The South could devote as much money as necessary to its military.However, Moon's attitude toward the North suggests more than a tinge of naivete. Engagement makes good sense, but any contacts should be without illusion. After all, Pyongyang has continued its missile tests despite Moon's victory.Moreover, the new government in Seoul is likely to run into sharp conflict with President Donald Trump's administration. In broad terms, Washington is committed to applying maximum pressure on the North, through military threats and enhanced economic sanctions.The administration plans to condition talks with North Korea on prior agreement to America's demands: dismantling the North's nuclear and missile programs. The U.S. expects China to cut aid and trade.A new round of ROK investment and aid would undercut the U.S. objective of ""maximum pressure"" on the North. Moreover, Washington could not easily demand that China sever its commercial connections with the North.If President Moon flies to Pyongyang to negotiate a nuclear freeze, Washington's insistence on dismantlement before talks begin would be stillborn. The more America threatens war, the more uncomfortable and even antagonistic South Koreans likely will become.The two presidents spoke by phone shortly after Moon took office and agreed to a summit next month. But even friendly discussions won't hide the fact that the two countries' interests differ in substantial ways.U.S.-South Korean ties have varied over time. However, the Trump-Moon match may present a special challenge. South Koreans are likely to quickly learn whether Donald Trump or Kim Jong-un is the more unpredictable leader.

26,ROK,"North Korea is suffering from another natural disaster, which seems to have been an almost annual event in the country's 68-year history. Floods have devastated parts of the North, displacing some 70,000 residents. The United Nations is seeking nearly $30 million to aid Pyongyang.Alas, such tragedy is nothing new for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Last year the DPRK claimed ""the worst drought in 100 years."" The latter might have been true, but Pyongyang oft has exaggerated its needs to win more foreign aid.Still, North Koreans have paid a high price for their government's sins: Between 1995 and 1997, several hundred thousand — and conceivably as many as two million — people died from famine. Alas, their government was more responsible than nature for that horror.Almost every ""natural"" crisis in North Korea is exacerbated by the ruling regime's totalitarian economic and political policies. Collectivism makes overall prosperity nearly impossible and sharply restricts food output. At least the Kim regime's increasing acceptance of limited markets in both agricultural production and distribution makes a disaster like that of two decades ago less likely.Equally harmful is the diversion of scarce resources into Pyongyang's oversize military and active missile and nuclear programs. Additional resources go to enrich the Kims and their loyal retainers and courtiers. The DPRK could afford to purchase more food for its people if they were the regime's first priority.As similar, if not quite so severe, problems recur in the North, South Koreans today are debating aid for the DPRK. For a decade Seoul implemented the ""Sunshine Policy,"" which essentially attempted to purchase Pyongyang's friendship.Between 1995 and 2005 the South gave North Korea nearly $1.2 billion in food and fertilizer alone. Aid peaked at $400 million in 2007. President Lee Myung-bak finally cut off most support after North Korea sank a submarine and bombarded an island in 2010.The U.S. provided a similar amount of aid between 1995 and 2005 in food, medicine and energy. Like the South, Washington also ended the transfers out of frustration in dealing with the DPRK.Unsurprisingly, South Koreans are skeptical of new aid proposals. Polls show that a majority of the ROK population opposes flood assistance. People believe Seoul should tighten sanctions against the North rather than ease the economic burden on the Kim Jong Un regime.Although refusing to help seems harsh, the Kim dynasty's behavior leaves little choice. The Republic of Korea ""is worried that the North may use the aid from the South to develop its nuclear and missile programs further,"" explained Choi young-il of Kyunghee University.In the past Pyongyang diverted aid to favored factions and sold donated food on the domestic black market as well as in China. Even with better accountability, assistance would strengthen the regime. Relieving the DPRK of responsibility for feeding its people would leave more resources available for military purposes.Of course, such assistance is unlikely to make or break the Kim regime, especially given substantial Chinese backing for Pyongyang. Both the PRC and North appear prepared to do whatever is necessary to preserve the DPRK.In that case, why provide another opportunity for North Korea to manipulate gullible but well-intentioned neighbors? And if Beijing seems determined to keep the North afloat, let the Chinese pay the entire bill for the Kim dynasty's survival.However, government-to-government aid is not the only option. The South Korean NGO Council, made up of 59 private groups, announced plans to step in. The Korea Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation intends to send children's clothes, which, the group argued, could not be diverted to other uses by the North.Even private assistance can help sustain the regime in Pyongyang, but such aid does not help legitimize Kim's rule. Moreover, some organizations, such as the Eugene Bell Foundation, which operates in both the U.S. and ROK, have managed to benefit ill North Koreans rather than influential apparatchiks.Refusing official government assistance does not require attempting to isolate the DPRK. The North's system shows no signs of disintegration, despite high-level defections and executions, and may survive for years more. With the regime obviously committed to developing intercontinental missiles and nuclear weapons, the U.S. can ill afford to continue ignoring Pyongyang, aid or no aid.But governments should refuse to treat the North's self-inflicted wounds, including its many ""natural"" disasters. Responsibility should be placed squarely on the Kim regime and its Chinese patron. The West should avoid helping to sustain this most malignant system.
"
27,ROK,"The Obama administration is debating a declaration of no first use of nuclear weapons. Some Asia specialists fear the resulting impact on North Korea. But dealing with Pyongyang is a reason for Washington to encourage its ally South Korea to go nuclear.Washington has possessed nuclear weapons for more than 70 years. No one doubts that the U.S. would use nukes in its own defense.However, since then Washington has extended a so-called ""nuclear umbrella"" over many of its non-nuclear allies. For instance, the U.S. long has threatened to use nuclear weapons in its NATO allies' defense, though the precise circumstances under which the U.S. would act were not clear. The U.S. also holds, probably, a nuclear umbrella over at least some of its Mideast allies.Northeast Asia is the region where nuclear threats seem greatest. Japan and South Korea are thought to be snuggled beneath America's nuclear umbrella, which has discouraged both from acquiring their own weapons. Other possible claimants include Taiwan and Australia, though, again, no one quite knows what Washington would do when.The ""umbrella"" obviously is defensive, that is, to protect American allies against the first use of nukes. However, Washington also could -- and, it appears, would, if necessary, whatever that might mean -- use nuclear weapons first to stop a conventional attack. While Russia and China might not be particularly friendly with America these days, they aren't likely to attack the Republic of Korea or Japan. More plausible is a North Korean invasion of the ROK.Extended nuclear deterrence always has been risky for the U.S. It means being willing to fight a nuclear war on behalf of others, that is, Americans would risk Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles to, say, defend Berlin and Tokyo.At least bilateral deterrence among great powers tends to be reasonably stable. Dealing with North Korea is potentially more dangerous. Kim Jong Un's judgment and stability are problematic. He might start a war inadvertently.Yet the DPRK eventually may gain the ability to strike the U.S. by developing long-range missiles as well as nuclear weapons. The North isn't likely to attack first, but it still could lay waste to a major U.S. city.Which would be a bad deal indeed. Yet advocates of extended deterrence are criticizing proposals for an American pledge of no first use of nuclear weapons. Writing for NK News, analyst Robert E. McCoy argued: ""It is imperative that Kim Jong Un is made to understand that he faces the destructive power of our entire weapons arsenal at all times when it comes to threatening the U.S. or its allies.""Yet that is precisely the problem. It is one thing for Washington to use nuclear weapons, including pre-emptively, to protect America. It is quite different to do so for allies.Alliances are a means, not an end  -- that is, a mechanism to help defend the U.S. A North Korean attack on South Korea would be awful, a humanitarian tragedy. But American security would not be directly threatened. Certainly there is no threat warranting the risk of nuclear retaliation on the U.S.Of course, those being defended have configured their security policy and force structure in response. But future policy should not be held captive to the past.Washington's chief responsibility should be America's security. Backers of the status quo act like there is no alternative to leaving South Korea (and Japan, which faces a real, though less direct, threat from the DPRK) vulnerable to attack.However, Seoul is well able to deter and defeat the North. The ROK possesses around 40 times the GDP and twice the population of North Korea, as well as a vast technological lead and an extensive international support network. Japan, which long possessed the world's second-largest economy, also could do far more.The South is capable of developing nuclear weapons. Indeed, polls show public support for such an option today. Opposition to nuclear weapons is stronger in Japan, but an ROK weapon would put enormous pressure on Tokyo to conform.Obviously, there are plenty of good reasons to oppose proliferation, even among friends. However, the current system is entangling Washington in the middle of other nations' potential conflicts. The result is to make America less secure.Dealing with nuclear weapons is never easy. Washington's best alternative may be to withdraw from Northeast Asia's nuclear imbroglio. Then America's allies could engage in containment and deterrence, just as America did for them for so many years.

28,ROK,"For China's ""robolution"" to succeed, companies such as Apple iPhone supplier Foxconn Technology must make it happen. Both China and the Taiwan-headquartered Foxconn face big challenges in replacing human workers with robots.
"
29,ROK,"Why automate? As Apple (AAPL) makes effort to use more contract manufacturers, Foxconn needs robots to improve productivity and address concerns over harsh working conditions for its human employees.
"
30,ROK,"China, meanwhile, is losing its cheap manufacturing edge as the country's factory salaries rise. China's President Xi Jinping last year called for ""an industrial robot revolution.""
"
31,ROK,"""Foxconn is facing pressure from rising wages in the electronics sector,"" said Jan Zhang, a Beijing-based automation analyst at IHS. ""Many Chinese manufacturers need to increase productivity to stay competitive.""
"
32,ROK,"Foxconn Gears Up Slowly
"
33,ROK,"Foxconn, which makes its own robots, has scaled back ambitious plans. It has yet to automate Apple iPhone assembly lines. It has some 50,000 installed robots, well shy of its earlier-stated 1 million goal.
"
34,ROK,"Foxconn aims to use industrial robots for 30% of the work at its Chinese factories for all customers by 2020.
"
35,ROK,"By 2025, meanwhile, China's government aims to move beyond labor-intensive work into high-end manufacturing. In automobiles, electronics and other sectors, robotics technology will be key to meet that goal.
"
36,ROK,"Southern province Guangdong, home of the Pearl River Delta manufacturing hub, says that it'll spend $152 billion to develop a home-grown robotics industry.
"
37,ROK,"China's automakers, the biggest robotics customers, buy robots mostly from foreign suppliers — ABB (ABB), Fanuc, Yaskawa Electric and Kuka — although one domestic company, Siasun Robot & Automation, has also made significant inroads.
"
38,ROK,"The Big Four hold about 60% of China's robotics market, says Zhang. It'll take time for China to develop its own robotics technology, she adds.
"
39,ROK,"""If you think about the mobile phone market, 10 years ago there was no local Chinese brand. It was all Nokia, Sony (SNE); there was no Apple at that time,"" Zhang said. ""Now you have companies like Xiaomi.""
"
40,ROK,"""Industrial robots could be more difficult, because there are sophisticated requirements — software, key components — that need to be put together.""
"
41,ROK,"Long Robot March Looms
"
42,ROK,"China says that it can develop its own domestic robotics industry, just as it made advances in semiconductors, telecommunications and other sectors. However, a big technology gap exists.
"
43,ROK,"China's domestic robot makers buy most of the components they use, such as servo motors, from foreign companies, pressuring profit margins.
"
44,ROK,"""There is still a long way to go for Chinese players to be truly competitive,"" said Alberto Moel, a Bernstein Research analyst, in a December report on China's robotics industry.
"
45,ROK,"""They lack the core technologies to manufacture key components of industrial robots and advanced automation systems. Currently, the markets they dominate are relatively low-end markets, such as linear robots, where they are gaining market share, mostly through aggressive pricing.
"
46,ROK,"""Although domestic players are actively seeking out M&A opportunities to gain technological capabilities, it will definitely take years for them to ... develop competitive products.""
"
47,ROK,"Local robot makers have the most market share in the chemical, metals and food and beverage industries, he said.
"
48,ROK,"China overtook Japan as the biggest buyer of robots in 2013. In 2014, China purchased 57,000 industrial robots, up 56% from a year earlier, one-fourth of the global total, says the International Federation of Robotics.
"
49,ROK,"Even so, China's robot-to-worker ratio is still far below the world average. China's robot density — installed robots per 10,000 employees — was 36 in 2014, in contrast to South Korea's 478, Japan's 314 and Germany's 292, says a Citigroup report. The U.S. has a robot penetration of 164.
"
50,ROK,"The Boston Consulting Group forecasts that by 2025, robots will perform 25% of manufacturing tasks, up from 10% currently. In some sectors — such as  computers and electronics, machinery and transportation equipment — the share could rise to 45%, BCG says.
"
51,ROK,"Analysts say that the payback time for investing in automation is getting shorter as wages rise.
"
52,ROK,"Robots Work As Wages Rise
"
53,ROK,"China's manufacturing wages are now higher than those of many other Asian countries, such as Vietnam, says a Boston Consulting Group study. China's manufacturing wages have climbed to $14.60 an hour and have been rising over 10% annually in coastal areas, though its working-age population has now peaked.
"
54,ROK,"Bank of America, in a November report, said that the global industrial robot market will grow from $10.7 billion in 2014 to $13.4 billion in 2018.
"
55,ROK,"Factory robots start at around $25,000 and run up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. China's local robot makers have been undercutting the prices of foreign suppliers to gain share. Chinese-made robots may lack the precision or reliability of foreign models but could cost half as much.
"
56,ROK,"Most industrial robots today do heavy lifting, welding and drilling, and apply coatings such as glue or paint. Advanced robots may perform pressing, printing, polishing and packaging.
"
57,ROK,"Assembly tasks are still challenging, because robots lack the manual dexterity of humans. Foxconn's robots reportedly fell short in the precision needed to grasp and place tiny iPhone components.
"
58,ROK,"Bank of America says that robots with built-in software and artificial intelligence will perform more complex tasks previously done by humans. Robots will collect data, analyze it and make inferences and decisions.
"
59,ROK,"China's robotics companies have upped spending on research and development, so they can make their own core components. But many lack the software programming tools to deploy robots in production lines, says Bernstein's Moel.
"
60,ROK,"In semiconductors and other sectors, China moved up the technology curve partly by forming joint ventures with foreign companies. In robotics there have been few JVs.
"
61,ROK,"Home appliance maker Midea has partnered with Japan's Yaskawa, and Shanghai Electric Hydraulic has a venture with Japan's Nabtesco, says IHS analyst Zhang.
"
62,ROK,"Zurich-based ABB has expanded its local presence in China to manufacturing there. China is also an important market for Germany's Siemens (SIEGY) and Rockwell Automation (ROK). Intel (INTC) has stepped up its investments, recently funding startups Shenzhen PraFly Technology and Ninebot. Xiaomi is another investor in Ninebot, which acquired Segway earlier this year.
"
63,ROK,"China Spurs Robotics Firms
"
64,ROK,"Moel says that Siasun is among Chinese robot makers hunting for acquisitions, but so far it hasn't bought smaller Japanese or European companies.
"
65,ROK,"Government support has spawned more than 200 Chinese robotics companies, with many tethered to state contracts. Moel says that the average operating profit of Chinese robot makers is a slim 8%. There could be a shakeout if China's economy keeps slowing, analysts say.
"
66,ROK,"Citigroup forecasts that China's domestic robotics companies will hold 33% of the market by 2018, up from 28% in 2014.
"
67,ROK,"Zhang says China's up-and-coming robot makers include Siasun, Shenzhen Inovance Technology, Effort Intelligent Equipment, GSK, Estun Robotics, Shanghai STEP Electric and systems integrator Bozhong Precision Industry Technology. Bernstein's Moel says that two local players to watch are HollySys (HOLI) and Delta Electronics.
"
68,ROK,"China's economy flourished as more and more rural farmers were put to work in factories. But producing sneakers, plastic toys and T-shirts will not maintain China's economic growth in the mid-single digits, says Moel. Automation could help China compete in aerospace, medical equipment and other industries.
"
69,ROK,"A Methodical March
"
70,ROK,"Today, Chinese firms are far from producing world-class robots. If China stays reliant on foreign-supplied robotics, its manufacturing competitiveness could suffer. Foreign suppliers' intellectual property concerns could pose a hurdle to China getting the latest and greatest outside technology.
"
71,ROK,"For now, Chinese customers prefer to buy from experienced robotics providers abroad because of their reliability, says Bernstein Research.
"
72,ROK,"Hal Sirkin, a Boston Consulting Group managing director, believes that China will catch up in robotics as it caught up in household appliances, Internet software and consumer electronics. But Sirkin does not expect China to become a force in robot exports any time soon.
"
73,ROK,"""They're going after high-end manufacturing,"" Sirkin said in an interview. ""Robotics is very sophisticated. They'll move methodically, walking their way up as they have every time.

76,ROK,"Aspen Technology's main target customers might be in the slow lane, but the enterprise software company is in high gear. Aspen's stock has trended higher most of this year despite dips in oil prices, even as it works through a major business transition.
"
77,ROK,"Investors have responded to its moves. Aspen Technology (AZPN) stock is up nearly 25% this year after falling 16% in 2014.
"
78,ROK,"Falling oil prices should, in theory, hurt Aspen, since its business management software targets oil, gas, energy and chemical companies. The software is designed to help these companies better manage their plants and supply chains.
"
79,ROK,"But Aspen has a knack for beating quarterly estimates, even in uncertain times for oil prices. For its fiscal Q3 ended March 31, Aspen's EPS minus items of 37 cents, up 32% from the year-earlier quarter, beat Wall Street expectations by 6 cents. Revenue of $111.3 million, up 7.4%, beat by $3 million.
"
80,ROK,"The better-than-expected results bewildered some analysts and investors, says Mark Schappel, an analyst for The Benchmark Co.
"
81,ROK,"""People think that because crude prices are falling, oil and gas companies will have less money and therefore are going to cut back on their capex, which is going to impact Aspen's business,"" Schappel told IBD.
"
82,ROK,"But Schappel, who is also a chemical engineer, says Aspen's software is even more important at such times, since it helps refineries find the most cost-efficient ways to turn crude oil into gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel and more.
"
83,ROK,"""Their software is becoming more and more important to refineries and chemical plants because those guys run on very tight margins,"" he said. ""They are trying to squeeze every penny they can out of these plants, and Aspen's software helps them do that.""
"
84,ROK,"Most of Aspen's oil and gas customers are refineries, or so-called downstream operations, as opposed to explorations companies, the upstream operations that often have more limited capex spending.
"
85,ROK,"The company is aided by that breakdown, says Monika Garg, an analyst for Pacific Crest Securities.
"
86,ROK,"""The exposure of Aspen Tech to upstream is only 12% of revenue, whereas their exposure for downstream is almost 28% — and those 28% of companies are making tons of money,"" Garg told IBD. ""That is why the stock has done very well.""
"
87,ROK,"Aspen also benefits by its broad range of revenue sources. Garg says the company's revenue breakdown is roughly 38% from energy companies, 31% engineering and construction and 26% chemicals. The other 5% comes from customers in a number of fields, including pharmaceuticals, consumer packaged goods, and mining.
"
88,ROK,"The company says its total addressable market is $10.9 billion and that it already is in control of $2 billion of that, Richard Davis, an analyst for Canaccord Genuity, said in a May 4 research report following the company's annual investor day. Aspen said rivals combined also control about $2 billion, with the rest up for grabs, Davis wrote.
"
89,ROK,"""Considering these projections against the total 2014 presentation, Aspen has increased its market opportunity by more than $800 million in the last year,"" Davis said.
"
90,ROK,"Aspen's closest rivals in the process simulation and modeling software market for refining oil and other chemicals are Honeywell International (HON), Rockwell Automation (ROK) and Invensys, acquired last year by energy management firm Schneider Electric for $5.2 billion.
"
91,ROK,"All three rivals, though, focus more on other aspects of plant operations, leaving the process simulation and modeling software market open to Aspen, Schappel says.
"
92,ROK,"""Aspen's product is becoming much better than the other products, the gap is widening and that is why you see them taking market share,"" Schappel said.
"
93,ROK,"He says Aspen's lead includes the supply chain software market for oil, gas and chemical industries where it competes with SAP (SAP), and where it's ""taking incremental share from SAP,"" according to Schappel.
"
94,ROK,"In October, Aspen's outlook for the December quarter missed expectations. On that report, Aspen stock fell as much as 22% the next day to a 22-month low of 31.57.
"
95,ROK,"But the weak outlook was a function of the company's five-year move from a license software model, where it collects a large fee upfront, to a subscription model where customers pay a smaller fee per month for software as needed, says Richard Williams, an analyst for Summit Research.
"
96,ROK,"""It takes a long time to go from an upfront software recognition to a subscription model,"" Williams told IBD. ""The process creates a distortion where it makes your revenue look lower than it really is for awhile.""

158,ROK,"The process of refining oil, natural gas, petrochemicals and other fuels is a complex one that involves dozens of steps and variables, and can lead to disaster if you don't do it the right way.
"
159,ROK,"To streamline the process and reduce the risk of error, refineries depend on software programs that let them do everything from simulating the refining process to designing the facility itself.
"
160,ROK,"One company that provides this kind of software, Aspen Technology (AZPN), has seen a big turnaround in its financial fortunes thanks to efforts to streamline its own process of doing business.
"
161,ROK,"Aspen makes business management software for oil, gas, energy and chemical companies. Its Aspen One suite is used in engineering, manufacturing and supply chain processes. The software lets clients model and design facilities, monitor and optimize performances, estimate costs and analyze data.
"
162,ROK,"Pivoting For Pricing
"
163,ROK,"Refineries can also use the technology to determine what kinds of fuels they should produce to take advantage of price trends.
"
164,ROK,"""If aviation fuel is selling high, you might try to produce more jet fuel than octane fuel,"" said Mark Schappel, an analyst at Benchmark. ""Their software can tell you that you should get this much octane out, this much kerosene out, this much petroleum jelly out. It allows you to simulate what happens in a plant offline. You can do it on the computer first, which helps minimize mistakes.""
"
165,ROK,"Because Aspen's technology is so specialized, much of its competition comes from smaller, privately held software firms.
"
166,ROK,"Aspen also vies with much larger automated control companies such as Honeywell International (HON), Rockwell Automation (ROK) and Invensys, though Schappel says the software at these companies ""is not considered best in class.""
"
167,ROK,"Aspen's technology is considered among the best in the business, analysts say. But that hasn't always been enough to offset problems in other areas of the business.
"
168,ROK,"In 2008, Aspen shifted from an upfront license model to a subscription model as a way of smoothing out its revenue stream and giving it more visibility on future business.
"
169,ROK,"While that change was being implemented, however, the company struggled on the bottom line. It lost money for three straight years, from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2012.
"
170,ROK,"The earnings picture has been much brighter in recent quarters. Aspen returned to profitability in fiscal 2013, which ended in June. It has now produced five straight quarters of black ink.
"
171,ROK,"""For several years, restructuring occupied the company,"" Schappel said. ""With that mostly out of the way, they can now act like a real software company and focus on R&D. They are also talking to the sales force instead of sitting in front of attorneys or accountants.""
"
172,ROK,"The renewed focus was evident during the company's fiscal first quarter of 2014, which ended in September. Q1 earnings more than doubled from a year earlier to 19 cents a share, topping consensus estimates for 15 cents. The bottom line got a big boost from a much better-than-expected operating margin.
"
173,ROK,"Revenue for the quarter gained 23% to $87.6 million, topping views for $85 million. It was the 12th straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth.

"
175,ROK,"Aspen's total license contract value, or TLCV, climbed 13.2% year-over-year during the quarter. That was slightly ahead of the 12.5% estimate issued by JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty.

"
178,ROK,"Analysts expect Aspen to grow full-year earnings 53% this fiscal year and 26% in fiscal 2015. The company's stock price set a nearly 13-year high of 39.02 on Oct. 30.
"
179,ROK,"Aspen's revenue is fairly evenly split among the U.S., Europe and the rest of the world. Like any company whose fortunes are tied to the oil/gas industry, Aspen must deal with the ups and downs of commodity prices. The prices of both crude oil and natural gas have fallen in recent months from multiyear highs earlier in the year.
"
180,ROK,"In a conference call with analysts following Aspen's first-quarter results, CEO Antonio Pietri said the global macro environment ""remains volatile,"" but added that Aspen has ""not seen a material change"" in customer buying behavior in recent months.
"
181,ROK,"""We continue to benefit from the combination of our market-leading position, long-term contracts that are typically five to six years in length and the mission-critical nature of our applications,"" Pietri said.
