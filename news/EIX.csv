1,EIX,"Russian hackers are attacking critical U.S. infrastructure, including the energy grid, nuclear power plants, and airports, according to U.S. government officials.XWater processing plants are among the other targets being repeatedly tested by rolling attacks. Last year, more than a dozen power plants in seven states were breached due to Russia's ongoing campaign of cyberattacks.Energy Secretary Rick Perry told the House Appropriations Subcommittee Thursday cyberattacks are ""literally happening hundreds of thousands of times a day. ... The warfare that goes on in the cyberspace is real, it's serious, and we must lead the world.""Such attacks were cited as being one of the reasons the Trump administration imposed sanctions on a series of Russian organizations and individuals Thursday.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseUtility giant Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG) was up 2.1% on the stock market today. Duke Energy (DUK) rose 1.1%, Sempra Energy (SRE) 0.7%, Edison International (EIX) 1.8% and Southern Co. (SO) 0.6%.An alert issued by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI Thursday laid out in more detail what the Russians have been targeting, and how they are going about it.""Since at least March 2016, Russian government cyber actors ... targeted government entities and multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation, and critical manufacturing sectors,"" the alert said.The techniques being employed include sending spear-phishing emails from compromised legitimate accounts, host-based exploitation and the targeting of industrial control system infrastructure.Russian operatives are also using the hacks for credentials gathering and open-source and network reconnaissance.While the alert did not disclose how successful the attacks were, it said hackers ""targeted small commercial facilities' networks where they staged malware, conducted spear phishing, and gained remote access into energy sector networks."" They also tried to hide their activities by creating new accounts on the staging targets to perform cleanup operations.While information theft was one of the goals, a key prize would have been gaining control of systems used by infrastructure. They could then launch attacks that could leave millions without water and power.An even more worrying prospect would be hackers gaining control of a nuclear power plant. A sudden shutdown can trigger safety systems designed to disperse excess heat and prevent a meltdown, though safety systems themselves may be vulnerable to attack. However, the operating systems used at such plants are usually decades-old legacy controls that cannot be exploited by hackers.The Department of Homeland Security previously said cyberattacks on critical infrastructure are ""one of the most serious national security challenges we must confront.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:As Trump Sanctions Putin's Russia, Will Dems Revert To Their Fallback Position — Appeasement?

""This means that if a utility's equipment is found to have been a substantial cause of the damage in an event such as a wildfire — even if the utility has followed established inspection and safety rules — the utility may still be liable for property damages and attorneys' fees associated with that event.""PG&E faces lawsuits tied to the wildfires in California's wine country and has lowered its earnings guidance for the year over the disaster. The stock has a $2.12 annual dividend payout.PG&E shares tanked 13% to 44.50 on the stock market today. Edison International, which has a $2.42 annual dividend, was down 7.3% to 63.32.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The October fires in Northern California caused more than $9.4 billion in residential and commercial claims, California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said earlier this month.

But the stock action echoed PG&E's (PCG) plunge two months ago amid wildfires in Northern California.Downed PG&E power lines may have sparked those fires, and state officials are investigating the cause. The utility, however, has argued the blaze may have been caused by third-party equipment.Edison stock plunged 12.8% to 70 on the stock market today, hitting a 52-week low intraday. PG&E rose 0.15% but saw a nearly 30% collapse in mid-October.IBD'S TAKE: Research has shown as much as 50% of a winning stock's performance owes to the strength of its industry group and sector at the time of its breakout.

"
36,EIX,"Tesla Motors (TSLA) has inked a couple key new deals for its batteries to be used in big power projects, after debuting its Tesla Energy business unit in April and showing off Tesla Powerwall batteries for the home. That sent Tesla stock to a 2015 high.Ireland-based wind energy and energy-storage company Gaelectric Group said Thursday that it will deploy Tesla Energy's first battery power utility-scale project there next year — a one-megawatt demonstration project — while the companies collaborate to develop a pipeline of battery projects to build new transmission system services that are needed to help integrate renewables such as solar power and wind power with the electric grid.Storing the energy produced by renewables such as solar and wind can help those sources deliver power to the electric grid in a smoother pattern, so it's not just when the sun is shining and when the wind is blowing. And that can be crucial to the power grid's efficient planning and operation as renewable sources become bigger suppliers.""We are delighted to be associated with Tesla in introducing its battery systems to Ireland,"" Gaelectric CEO Brendan McGrath said in the announcement. ""As a renewable energy group with a pipeline of 500 MW of wind power in Ireland and energy storage projects in Ireland and Europe, Gaelectric has an obvious incentive to drive the adoption of technologies that facilitate the economic dispatch of wind and other renewable sources.""Gaelectric said that it and Tesla are focused on ""exploring the development and demonstration of innovative business models for energy storage within transmission systems"" and that Ireland ""has many compelling features"" for the commercialization of the Tesla Energy product range, ""given its scale and ambitious renewable energy targets and favourable regulatory framework.""Gaelectric said that investigation of other European markets will be part of the collaboration.On Wednesday, Georgia-based public utility Southern Co. (SO), which serves more than 4.5 million customers in the U.S. Southeast, announced at its annual stockholders meeting that it has reached an agreement with Tesla to test commercial-scale battery storage.Southern has also been testing Tesla vehicles for use in its operations, along with EVs from GM (GM), Ford (F) and Nissan (NSANY).In the utility arena, Tesla already has a pact with Edison International (EIX) units Southern California Edison and SoCore Energy, implementing energy storage projects that feature Tesla Powerpacks. It also has agreements with Advanced Microgrid Solutions, OnCor and AES (AES).And Tesla had previously named ""highlighted Powerwall distribution partners"" including Treehouse — billed as a ""sustainable home improvement store"" — inverter makers Fronius and SolarEdge (SEDG), and Vermont public utility Green Mountain Power.The lithium-ion batteries that Tesla uses, and will eventually make in its Nevada gigafactory as it works on emerging battery technologies, are not the only way to store energy at utility scale — thermal storage techniques use anything from water to sand.And there are other technologies. Gaelectric got into storage in 2006, formally setting up its Gaelectric Energy Storage business unit then. Among its projects is a 330-MW compressed-air energy storage tech project in Northern Ireland. The company notes that it has ""established positions"" in onshore and wind generation in Ireland and the U.S.Tesla stock rose 1.6% to 251.45 on Thursday, hitting its best intraday level since Nov. 18. Shares are up 13% so far this year.But after two straight non-GAAP losses, Tesla does not currently get a high Composite Rating from IBD, after a stellar stock run-up in 2013 and strong gains in 2014.Follow Donna Howell on Twitter: @IBD_DHowell.RELATED: What Is Tesla Energy And Can It Profit For Elon Musk?

"
40,EIX,"That's because its continued success depends on a cascade of government subsidies, including a 30% federal investment credit that expires at the end of 2016.
"
41,EIX,"Guess what? Taxpayers are paying for it — and through the metaphorical roof.
"
42,EIX,"Thanks to the slew of solar industry subsidies, homeowners can effectively contract with solar leasing firms that will install those panels for free. But they often get gouged later, as do taxpayers in one of the great corporate welfare scams of modern times.
"
43,EIX,"Shady Solar Leasing Firms?
"
44,EIX,"Congress is investigating if the industry is ensnaring homeowners in green energy ""teaser"" loans.
"
45,EIX,"Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., and a member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, plus 11 House colleagues fired off a letter last month to the Federal Trade Commission asking if the booming solar leasing market — a ""new industry with a limited track record and little regulatory oversight — poses a ""considerable risk"" to homeowners.
"
46,EIX,"Some leasing companies ""sold large numbers of subprime mortgages to unsuspecting homeowners in the runup to the subprime mortgage crisis,"" the investigators have found.
"
47,EIX,"California and Louisiana homeowners have filed class-action lawsuits vs. solar leasing companies alleging fraudulent marketing campaigns that don't warn customers of true costs and risks.

"
49,EIX,"Net Metering Hits Utilities
"
50,EIX,"Under this ""net metering"" scheme, utilities have to give a credit off their utility bills to solar homes, and this is subtracted from the cost of the electricity they do use from the electric grid system.
"
51,EIX,"According to E&E News, a leading energy policy newsletter: ""43 states, the District of Columbia and four U.S. territories have net metering policies in place, with differing capacity limits. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, all public utilities are required to offer net metering to customers upon request.""
"
52,EIX,"None of these ""renewable energy"" subsidies to harvest the sun's rays will have more than a tiny impact on greenhouse gas emissions. But when green homeowners can pass the costs on to their neighbors, then schemes like this can look attractive.
"
53,EIX,"The solar subsidy comes on top of federal and state government- financed low-cost loans to solar companies such as Solyndra — many of which have gone bust, an analysis by the Institute for Energy Research shows.
"
54,EIX,"Then there are ""renewable energy standards"" in about half the states that require utilities to buy a set percentage of their electric power from wind and solar energy. This hikes utility bills by forcing the power plants to buy power from higher-cost sources vs. more-affordable coal and natural gas.
"
55,EIX,"The solar installation subsidy leader is SolarCity (SCTY). Its advertisements romance customers with slogans like: ""Go Solar, Install is Free"" and ""We ... cover maintenance, repairs and insurance at no added cost...""
"
56,EIX,"Homeowners buy the solar power system at an ultralow long-term interest rate while immediately receiving the prized 30% tax credit. Or they install the equipment with a long-term, no-money-down lease option.
"
57,EIX,"SolarCity offers customers loans with financing with major banks including Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C).
"
58,EIX,"According to SolarCity's 2014 annual report, 93% of new customers enter into the second option. In a typical lease, SolarCity owns the equipment and pockets the tax credits. The homeowner pays SolarCity monthly for the energy individually consumed from the panels. The electric utility credits net metering proceeds to the homeowner.
"
59,EIX,"These solar panels are installed regardless of whether the savings from the electric power generated covers the cost of materials, installation and upkeep. Often, they don't come close.
"
60,EIX,"For example, these handouts for small-scale home systems are so generous solar is frequently installed in areas with intermittent sunlight. None other than Google (GOOGL) — which touts its green initiatives — recognized this problem with on-site energy production, rejecting such proposals as ""not feasible.""
"
61,EIX,"In Google's own words, ""At best the difference is one of appearance (Google would ""look greener""), and at worst it reduces the impact of our investment because a project built in a less favorable location would generate less energy over its life.""
"
62,EIX,"Google's conclusion: What's the point?
"
63,EIX,"Rooftop solar's largest subsidy is net metering, because it forces the local power company to purchase any excess energy generated by these home systems, regardless whether demand exists for the energy.
"
64,EIX,"A sunny day with below-normal energy demand may lead to a surplus of electric power. The homeowners can sell this unneeded solar power at a tidy profit to an unwilling buyer at full retail cost — a level often four times the wholesale rate.
"
65,EIX,"Solar panel users are guaranteed access to the electric grid when they need it — on stormy or cloudy days, for example. But they fail to pay their fair share for construction and upkeep of the grid, making them free riders.
"
66,EIX,"With power generation plants, fixed costs can make up 20% to 50% of electricity's retail price.
"
67,EIX,"So solar users don't have to pay for the fixed cost of the grid system, but get to charge for its cost imbedded in the retail price of electricity when they sell to the grid.
"
68,EIX,"Each solar panel home enjoys a $1,000 subsidy paid for by their neighbors and other grid users, according to Greg Bernosky of the Arizona Public Service Co.
"
69,EIX,"A few years ago, the Institute for Energy Research found solar energy receives more than $700 in total subsidies per megawatt-hour produced. The per-megawatt subsidies to oil and gas — which President Obama rails against — were less than one-one hundredth as large.
"
70,EIX,"It's highly doubtful the solar industry could survive without these corporate welfare handouts. SolarCity admitted as much in its annual report:
"
71,EIX,"""Our business currently depends on the availability of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives. The expiration, elimination or reduction of these rebates, credits and incentives would adversely impact our business.""
"
72,EIX,"Rep. Gosar isn't worried just about the taxpayers, but the families that have been lured by ""deceptive marketing strategies"" into sucker deals. His investigation has found that ""homeowners who signed these zero-money-down leases are struggling to sell their homes"" and may not have been ""fully aware of the terms of their 20- (to)30-year leases.""
"
73,EIX,"In some cases these pay-me-later long-term leases exceed the life of the roof or the homeowner's intention to live in the home.
"
74,EIX,"The class actions in Louisiana and California allege solar panel companies overstated potential savings. The California lawsuit vs. SunRun complains that its website claimed ""nationwide, electricity rates have been increasing 6% per year over the last thirty years ... and there's no evidence that this trend will reverse anytime soon.""
"
75,EIX,"These claims stand in stark contrast to U.S. Energy Information Administration data showing that residential electricity prices have leveled off in recent years.
"
76,EIX,"SolarCity claims ""you can watch your savings grow over time"" by locking in ""low, predictable"" solar energy rates. Yet, the fine print indicates solar power costs on home systems will increase by up to 2.9% annually for 20 to 30 years. Hardly a bargain if long-term electricity trends have reversed due to the natural gas boom.
"
77,EIX,"SolarCity has not responded to our request for comment.
"
78,EIX,"Meanwhile, the handouts keep coming as the Obama administration continues to tout renewable energy as the power source of the future. The solar industry boasts it plans on issuing one million new long-term leases by 2018. All of this at a time when solar's economics have been crushed by the 50% fall in oil and gas prices since last summer.

"
85,EIX,"But the prospect of higher interest rates could erode some of the advantages that utility stocks have enjoyed. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield shot up to as high as 2.63% in mid-September from a low of 2.33% in late August amid expectations that the Federal Reserve will start raising borrowing costs in the middle of next year. The yield currently stands at around 2.44%.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield shot up to as high as 2.63% in mid-September from a low of 2.33% in late August amid expectations that the Federal Reserve will start raising borrowing costs in the middle of next year. The yield currently stands at around 2.44%.Higher yields would make utilities' dividend yields — currently about 4% — less attractive in comparison to Treasuries.""For the last five years, all you had to do was buy a basket"" of utility stocks, said Mario Gabelli, CEO of GAMCO Investors. ""For the next five years, you want to be more selective.""The utilities sector stood at No. 12 out of the 33 sectors tracked by IBD as of Friday.

108,EIX,"Solar panel maker SunPower (SPWR) is preparing to post its Q2 earnings after the market close Thursday, days after announcing that it began building a new solar plant in California and had obtained $44.5 million in additional financing for its residential solar lease program.This week's moves didn't move SunPower stock much, but shares are up more than 40% since mid-April. SunPower stock was flat in midday trading in the stock market today, near 38.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are looking for Q2 earnings per share minus items of 26 cents, down 46% from the year-earlier quarter, on revenue of $623.5 million, up 8.2%.In Q1, SunPower's EPS ex items handily beat the consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, as did revenue.Josh Baribeau, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity, said in a research report that SunPower has the strongest pipelines, project experience and technology among its peers.""We like SunPower's geographic diversity and its exposure to residential, commercial and utility-scale projects, helping to hedge against political risk and changing economics and increased competition in one or more arenas,"" Baribeau said. ""Unfortunately, we do not see the same levels of growth as some of its peers, and SunPower is already trading at a premium multiple when considering a somewhat more muted growth profile.""SunPower's prospects got a boost Friday when the U.S. Commerce Department said it would impose preliminary anti-dumping tariffs ranging from 26% to 165% on Chinese and Taiwanese solar panel imports. The tariffs are in addition to anti-dumping tariffs imposed in early June.""In our view, higher U.S. module prices (resulting from the tariffs) may provide a short-term benefit for companies such as First Solar (FSLR) and SunPower, but they are negative for installers like Real Goods Solar (RGSE), and ultimately impede progress toward grid price parity,"" Robert Stone, an analyst with Cowen & Co., said in a research report.On Tuesday, SunPower announced it was starting construction on the 135-megawatt Quinto Solar Project in Merced County, Calif. The system will generate power for Southern California Edison 's (EIX) customers, under a long-term power purchase agreement.Including Quinto, SunPower has more than 500 MWs of residential, commercial and utility solar assets under contract around the world that the company says it might choose to own for a period of time before selling, or continue to own post-construction during the operational phase of the project.On Monday, SunPower announced it had inked an agreement in which Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure will provide up to $44.5 million in debt to help finance SunPower's residential solar lease program. In April, Hannon Armstrong and SunPower announced $42 million in debt financing.In April, SunPower inked a deal with Google (GOOGL) to provide financing to support about $250 million of residential solar lease projects. SunPower will commit up to $150 million and Google will provide up to $100 million.RELATED:Outlook For Alternative Energy Sector Said Bright.
"
109,EIX,"Whatever Tesla Motors (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk reveals in the coming week about building an electric-car battery factory, it's sure to fuel speculation about where Tesla can go with it, and one other thing: round-the-clock solar power.
"
110,EIX,"Synergies between Tesla and cousin company SolarCity (SCTY) don't end with Musk.
"
111,EIX,"Tesla already has started making some battery packs for SolarCity. More insights on synergies might come out when SolarCity reports its Q4 earnings after the close Monday. And more clues could emerge from the ""Tesla Gigafactory"" conference call that Musk plans in the coming week.
"
112,EIX,"Besides being CEO of Tesla, Musk is chairman and a major shareholder at SolarCity, where his cousin is CEO. Musk also helms privately held commercial space flight company SpaceX.
"
113,EIX,"Luxury electric-car maker Tesla needs more batteries than it can get in order to eventually build an electric car at prices that would compete with the mainstream BMW 3 Series and Audi A4, by Volkswagen (VLKAY).
"
114,EIX,"Baird & Co. analyst Ben Kallo bottom-lined it this way in a research note Tuesday: ""The launch of low-cost Gen III vehicles relies on the ability to reduce battery costs. If TSLA is unable to significantly reduce battery costs through economies of scale or technological advances, it may prove challenging to produce vehicles at the $35,000 price point without reductions in performance.""
"
115,EIX,"Tesla agrees. Musk closed his Q4 shareholder letter on Wednesday with a tease about the planned battery factory and its ramifications for home-and-business solar installer SolarCity.
"
116,EIX,"""Very shortly, we will be ready to share more information about the Tesla Gigafactory,"" he said. ""This will allow us to achieve a major reduction in the cost of our battery packs and accelerate the pace of battery innovation. Working in partnership with our suppliers, we plan to integrate precursor material, cell, module and pack production into one facility.
"
117,EIX,"""With this facility, we feel highly confident of being able to create a compelling and affordable electric car in approximately three years,"" he continued. ""This will also allow us to address the solar power industry's need for a massive volume of stationary battery packs.""
"
118,EIX,"Storing Solar Energy
"
119,EIX,"Solar panels on home or business rooftops deliver energy while the sun is shining, but adding what's essentially a big battery can allow the excess to be stored for use during cloudy days or at night — and can also smooth solar's spiky delivery back to the electric grid. Making the battery packs affordable and small enough has proved to be a challenge.
"
120,EIX,"Utility-scale power systems don't use conventional batteries but have started to store energy using molten sand and other approaches.
"
121,EIX,"Regarding Tesla's battery factory plans and SolarCity, Kallo told IBD: ""I do think they're building out capacity with that in mind — Elon is chairman of and has sizable interest in SolarCity, so I think that will play an important part in offtake of the battery factory.""
"
122,EIX,"He says SolarCity will ultimately benefit, ""but Tesla will benefit the most.""
"
123,EIX,"""They have the technology and IP (intellectual property) around the battery chemistry,"" Kallo said. But ""we're still a couple years from it making a big difference.""
"
124,EIX,"Analysts expect Tesla's current lithium ion battery partner Panasonic will play a role in the factory. And after word about Tesla talks with Apple (AAPL) surfaced recently, analyst Kallo told IBD that Apple could conceivably be an additional user of batteries made at the plant.
"
125,EIX,"While the Tesla Gigafactory would chiefly serve Tesla, Musk clearly also is focused on supplying SolarCity.
"
126,EIX,"That company's CEO, Lyndon Rive, told IBD in September that ""a couple hundred"" Tesla-aided solar systems were being deployed — mostly in California — with what is called the DemandLogic power storage system. In December the plan went formal, as SolarCity introduced an energy storage plan for business customers.
"
127,EIX,"Besides storing energy, on a nothing-down service plan that aims to trim power bills, SolarCity touts the DemandLogic system, with Tesla battery technology, as a way to ""power IT functions, security systems, cash registers and other critical business systems during power outages."" The systems were first being made available in parts of California served by Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG) and Edison International's (EIX) Southern California Edison.
"
128,EIX,"SolarCity, to be sure, isn't the only provider of distributed solar energy systems to get into storage. Rivals also are exploring how different battery technologies can be of use. SunPower (SPWR) CEO Tom Werner told IBD in an interview last month that energy storage ""is one of the most important components of our strategy going forward.""
"
129,EIX,"Tesla, SolarCity and SunPower are among only 15 companies with market cap of at least $1 billion that saw their stocks rise more than 300% in 2013.
"
130,EIX,"French energy company Total is solar panel maker SunPower's majority shareholder and has investments in energy storage approaches. SunPower has three storage pilot projects under way in California, Australia and Germany.
"
131,EIX,"""It's good to have options,"" Werner said. ""We will be selling storage this year, tied to our 'energy services' offering.
"
132,EIX,"Controlling Your Own Cost
"
133,EIX,"""Think of combining a (solar energy system) lease with storage with one more element, energy management, and you can say to a consumer, 'You're close to controlling your own energy cost.' The short version is you can start to take control of your energy bill. You can take energy from the peak of day and use it at some other time,"" such as for maybe a four-hour stretch, not infinitely.
"
134,EIX,"Other solar firms are tinkering with storage for rooftop systems, too.
"
135,EIX,"Most are smaller outfits, and two are Sunverge Energy and Greensmith Energy Management Systems, says Haresh Kamath, program manager for energy storage at the Electric Power Research Institute. Though, he says, ""those guys — SolarCity and Tesla — account for the vast majority of applications for the (California) Self-Generation Incentive Program, which is how a lot of these systems are paid for.""
"
136,EIX,"The program cites an incentive level of $1.62 per watt for advanced energy storage projects.
"
137,EIX,"Kamath says that with economies of scale and advances along the learning curve, the pre-incentive cost of solar energy storage systems has come down.
"
138,EIX,"It varies a lot, but the cost to an installer (not a cost the end customer would see) has been cited as low as $2 a watt for a two-hour battery — so about $10,000 for a 5-kilowatt residential or small-business set-up.
"
139,EIX,"""It used to be something like $4 a watt, and in some cases $8 a watt in 2010 and 2011,"" Kamath said. ""We expect it to fall by another factor of two in the next two years ... people are learning how to make these things more inexpensively.""
"
140,EIX,"Solar Acceleration Center
"
141,EIX,"Xcel Energy (XEL) and the Electric Power Research Institute have teamed to research battery-based energy storage projects at the Solar Technology Acceleration Center in Aurora, Colo.
"
142,EIX,"The projects aim to gauge the value of the approach. One outfits a model solar neighborhood with a 25-kw/50-kilowatt-hour sodium nickel chloride system made by Fiamm SoNick. The other project for larger applications evaluates a 1.5-megawatt/1.0-megawatt-hour advanced lead-acid system made by Xtreme Power.
"
143,EIX,"While Tesla explores ways to make the most of its battery expertise and plans, Musk told analysts on Wednesday that the Gigafactory ""is really there to support the volume of the third-generation car"" that Tesla plans.
"
144,EIX,"But ""applications abound"" for Tesla-produced battery technology, Dougherty & Co. analyst Andrea James said in a research note Feb. 14. Those applications include ""use in grid storage, military operations, and unmanned aerial vehicles,"" she said. ""As the biggest buyer and producer of cylindrical lithium ion battery cells, which are chemically optimized for automotive use, Tesla also gets the first shot at new technology.""
"
145,EIX,"The company also gets a chance to lower costs.
"
146,EIX,"""There should be a cost benefit for Tesla to produce its own batteries,"" James wrote. ""It is unclear to us just how much, but we estimate it could be as high as 8 cents per watt-hour, which would lower Tesla's cost per kilowatt-hour on its battery pack to about $180.""
"
147,EIX,"Tesla's agreement with Panasonic lets it take delivery of at least 1.8 billion lithium-ion cells over four years, James points out, which would allow Tesla to produce a minimum of 64,000 vehicles a year at 7,000 cells per vehicle.
"
148,EIX,"Tesla says it expects to deliver over 35,000 vehicles this year, up from 22,477 in 2013.Whatever Tesla Motors (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk reveals in the coming week about building an electric-car battery factory, it's sure to fuel speculation about where Tesla can go with it, and one other thing: round-the-clock solar power.Synergies between Tesla and cousin company SolarCity (SCTY) don't end with Musk.Tesla already has started making some battery packs for SolarCity.

Also higher purchasing power and fuel expenses (18.1%), operation and maintenance expenses (11.8%) as well as property and other taxes (7%) led to increased operating expenses.Operating income was $330 million in the reported quarter, down 30% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $471 million.Interest expenses were $170 million in the quarter, higher than $152 million in the prior-year quarter.Segment ResultsSouthern California Edison’s (SCE) first-quarter core earnings were 88 cents per share compared with $1.07 a year ago.

172,EIX,"Edison International (EIX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings results on May 1, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 18.28%. Moreover, it has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 12.35%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderIn December 2017, South California Edison (SCE), a subsidiary of Edison International, secured wildfire insurance worth $300 million for 2018 and requested the California Public Utility Commission (“CPUC”) to approve recovery of the associated premium worth approximately $121 million. Per the company, this insurance cost might drag its 2018 earnings per share by 29 cents, until the CPUC addresses this request. Moreover, Edison International expects to incur additional insurance costs during the current year, in excess of what the company had requested in its general rate case (GRC).Consequently, these additional costs are expected to partially weigh on Edison International’s earnings in the quarter to be reported. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings reflects an 18.2% decline year over year.On the flip side, moderate or worse drought conditions extended across southern California at the onset of the first quarter while the state as a whole witnessed a dry winter with temperatures dropping below normal levels. This, in turn, is anticipated to increase household consumption of electricity and thereby boost Edison International’s first-quarter revenues.However, considering the impact of the latest tax reform, which reduced the corporate tax rate substantially, the company has lately updated its GRC that requested a 2018 revenue requirement of $5.5 billion. This reflects a $106 million decrease from the 2017 revenue requirement.Therefore, the positive impact of high electricity demand on the company’s top line might get neutralized by the aforementioned revenue requirement reductions. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Edison International’s first-quarter revenues of $2.46 billion represents a drop of 0.2%.Edison International Price and EPS Surprise Edison International Price and EPS Surprise | Edison International QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Edison International is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

173,EIX,"Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report) will release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 23, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.31%. Moreover, Entergy Corp. outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 85.43%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayMost of the company's service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal winters during the quarter under review. This has lowered demand for electricity in these regions, which in turn, is expected to weigh on the company’s fourth-quarter sales.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Entergy Corp.’s fourth-quarter sales of $2.33 billion marks a year-over-year decline of 12.2%.In October 2017, the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved the recovery of nuclear dry fuel storage costs incurred by Entergy Corp. earlier. The move is expected to boost the company’s fourth-quarter earnings. Our consensus estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of 42 cents per share reflects an annual growth of 35.5%.Moreover, during the fourth quarter, Entergy Corp. raised its quarterly dividend by 2.3% to 89 cents per share. This indicates improved cash inflow from operating activities for the company which we believe will drive its fourth-quarter results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Entergy Corp. is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

174,EIX,"Telephone and Data Systems (TDS  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 23, before the opening bell.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.29 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 0.9%. The consensus estimate for the bottom line is pegged at a loss of 2 cents per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 60%.The company has a mixed earnings surprise history. Earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last two quarters and surpassed the same in one of the previous four quarters. The company’s bottom line met the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the remaining quarter, delivering an average beat of 779.1%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence Q4 EarningsTelephone & Data Systems continues to compete with the likes of CenturyLink (CTL  -  Free Report) and Frontier Communications to name a few. Additionally, the company’s wireless division – United States Cellular (USM  -  Free Report) – continues to operate in an intensely competitive wireless market and remains significantly challenged by the offering of service plans from lower-cost mobile operators. We further believe that high costs associated with network integration and construction of new cell sites, aggressive equipment pricing, increasing capacity in existing cell sites, wireless technology upgrades and spectrum licensing will put considerable pressure on the company’s finances.However, Telephone and Data Systems’ efforts to reward its shareholders with a fourth-quarter 2017 dividend of 15.5 cents per Common Share and Series A Common Share are impressive. The dividend was paid on Dec 28, 2017, to shareholders of record as of Dec 15, 2017. The move indicates the company’s commitment to create value for shareholders and underlines its confidence in business growth.Telephone and Data Systems is looking for lucrative opportunities to bring more fiber in order to better address services. By leveraging on fiber, the telco is trying to respond to customers' growing TV and broadband service demand. The company continues to expand its business in the managed hosting and cloud service market. Launch of Shared Data plans at nominal prices is likely to help the company gain consumers. The company's IPTV is also doing considerably well. It continues to experience strong smartphone demand at its wireless wing, U.S. Cellular.Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Telephone and Data Systems is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Telephone and Data Systems has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

175,EIX,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 23, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the utility’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.38%. However, Public Service Enterprise outperformed the same in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 4.94%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Public Service Enterprise is likely to beat earnings this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Public Service Enterprise has both these attributes, as mentioned below:Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.92%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Public Service Enterprise carries a Zacks Rank #3.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayIn June 2017, Public Service Enterprise submitted the planned update to its Energy Strong cost recovery petition, to include Energy Strong investments in service as of May 31, 2017. This filing requested estimated annual increases in electric and gas revenues of $16 million and $2 million, respectively. Last August, the BPU approved these raised rates effective Sep 1, 2017.Moreover, in June 2017, the company made its annual Basic Gas Supply Services (BGSS) filing with the Board of Public Utility (BPU) requesting an increase in the BGSS rate from approximately 34 cents to 37 cents per therm, effective Oct 1, 2017. Therefore, we may expect these to duly get reflected in the company’s fourth-quarter results in the form of improved sales as well as earnings growth.In line with this, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 56 cents per share reflects year-over-year growth of 3.7%. Meanwhile, the same for revenues is pegged at $2.36 billion, depicting an increase of 12.8%.On the flip side, the unemployment rate in Public Service Enterprise’s service territories is worse than the national average. A deteriorating economy is likely to lower the utility demand in the state, which in turn may weigh on the company’s quarterly performance.Nevertheless, earlier-than-expected snowfall in December 2017 in New Jersey drove demand for electricity substantially in the city. This in turn is expected to drive Public Service Enterprise’s yet-to-be-reported results.Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated Quote Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few other utility stocks which have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Edison International (EIX  -  Free Report) will report fourth-quarter results on Feb 22.

176,EIX,"Electric utility firm Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report) is set to release its fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Wednesday, Feb 21. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a profit of 46 cents on revenues of $5,410 million.In the preceding three-month period, the Atlanta, GA-based service provider reported stronger-than-expected earnings due to robust performance of its wholesale unit and lower costs.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the utility is on a solid footing, having gone past the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four reports. This is depicted in the graph below:Southern Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise Southern Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Southern Company (The) QuoteInvestors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Southern Company surpasses earnings estimate this time too. Let’s delve deeper and find out the factors impacting the results.Factors to Consider This QuarterA leading utility holding entity in the U.S., Southern Company dominates the power business across the Southeast. With a strong rate base growth and constructive regulation, we expect the firm to generate steady earnings.Also, with operations in a stable and growing industry, Southern Company has a steady stream of cash flow. The utility’s history of consistent dividend payments indicates its confidence in itself.We further believe that the AGL Resources acquisition will be accretive to Southern Company earnings.However, with customer growth tepid and likely to remain so for some time, sales might be affected. This together with a large base, might make it difficult for Southern Company to manage rates. Higher operating and maintenance expenses is another concern.The utility is also bearing the brunt of continued delays and cost overruns over two of its large construction projects — Vogtle and Kemper — which are again expected to weigh on Southern Company's fortunes.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Southern Company will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, for this company stands at +0.36%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.Zacks Rank: However, Southern Company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), when combined with a positive ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.As it is, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Southern Company, here are some utilities you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.65% and a Zacks Rank #2. The firm is expected to release earnings on Feb 22.

177,EIX,"Ameren Corporation (AEE  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 16, before the market opens.Last quarter, the utility reported a negative earnings surprise of 5.34%. Moreover, it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, with an average miss of 1.05%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayPer Ameren’s third-quarter earnings call, fourth-quarter 2017 earnings are expected to be impacted by expenses associated with the fourth quarter Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage.However, the company’s earnings are likely to increase on the back of strong rate-based growth and disciplined financial management. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ameren’s fourth-quarter earnings of 33 cents per share reflects an annual growth of 153.9%.Moreover, we expect the company’s yet-to-be reported quarter’s result to duly reflect the increase in revenue recognition, resulting from the Future Energy Jobs Act.  Also the company expects to incur low interest expenses driven by the refinancing of debt in 2017, which is likely to get reflected in the upcoming results, partially.Further, the company’s service territories witnessed almost normal temperatures during the fourth quarter. So we may expect weather condition to have a positive influence on the company’s revenues. Ameren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Ameren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Ameren Corporation Quote Earnings WhispersOur proven model doesn’t conclude that Ameren is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to be able to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: Ameren has an Earnings ESP of -3.03%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Ameren has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficultWe caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few operators in the electric utility space that you may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Edison International (EIX  -  Free Report) will report next quarterly results on Feb 22.

179,EIX,"Edison International’s (EIX  -  Free Report) unit, Southern California Edison (“SCE”), appealed to the California Public Utilities Commission (""CPUC"") for the expansion of Charge Ready 2. It is a program that will expand the installation of electric vehicle (“EV”) charging infrastructure in California. This $760-million, four-year program will allow the company to install 48,000 charging ports.Recently, SCE installed the 1000th EV charging point to increase the availability of in transportation. The Transportation sector is one of the largest source of air pollution in California, contributing nearly 45% of the greenhouse gas emission. Higher usage of EVs will lower carbon emission and for that reason deployment of electric refueling ports has become a necessity.More Electric Charging PortsThe success of the pilot program has prompted Edison to further expand its Charge Ready program through introduction of new charging ports across California. Post the approval of the program’s second phase, SCE will launch a marketing and customer education campaign to increase EV awareness.Per an estimate, nearly 7 million electric cars are required to be introduced in California by 2030 to put a check on emission levels. The new electric ports will be an integral part of the entire EV system.Apart from Charge Ready, SCE is also launching a number of other approved programs that support charging for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, transit buses, port equipment, other industrial vehicles as well as public and home-based cars.Price PerformanceIn the past year, Edison’s shares have lost 19.8% compared with the industry’s decline of 3.3%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksEdison International currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the same industry are Ameren Corporation (AEE  -  Free Report), Avangrid, Inc (AGR  -  Free Report) and Otter Tail Corporation (OTTR  -  Free Report).

181,EIX,"Year 2018 so far has been marked by increased government borrowing costs. This is especially true as growing inflationary pressure is building up the case for aggressive rate hikes, pushing yields higher. According to CME, there is 51% chance of four interest rates hike this year.The 10-year Treasury yields, which are a key driver of global borrowing costs, jumped to a 7-year high of 3.12%. The latest spike came on the heels of higher oil price, which is back to $80 per barrel level, and upbeat April retail sales. Worries about growing supply of government debt are also causing the spike in yields (read: ETF Strategies to Play the 7-Year High Benchmark Yield).Pros and ConsA rising rate environment is highly beneficial for cyclical sectors like financial, technology, industrials and consumer discretionary. Banks are at the most advantageous position as they seek to borrow money at short-term rates and lend at long-term rates. If interest rates rise, banks would be able to earn more on lending and pay less on deposits. This would expand net margins and bolster banks’ profits. Also, insurance companies are able to earn higher returns on their investment portfolio of longer-duration bonds.Higher interest rates usually indicate a healthy economy, which in turn leads to greater consumer power. An improving economy coupled with higher consumer confidence is making the consumer discretionary sector tempting to investors amid higher yields. The technology sector should benefit as rising interest rates usually correlate with an economy that is gaining strength and is expected to grow at a faster pace, leading to increased IT spending (read: 5 Niche Tech ETFs Hitting All-Time Highs).Although higher rates would attract more capital to the country, boosting the U.S. dollar against the basket of other currencies, it would have a huge impact on commodity-linked investments, implying that a rising rate environment will hurt a number of segments. In particular, high dividend paying sectors such as utilities and real estate would be the worst hit, given their higher sensitivity to rising interest rates. Additionally, securities in capital-intensive sectors like telecom would also be impacted by higher rates.Further, higher rates would also result in tighter lending conditions and curtail consumer spending on a wide range of products like cars and houses. This will in turn dent profitability across various segments. Further, businesses will also face higher loan rates over time.Given this, we have highlighted ETFs & stocks from the sectors that will benefit from higher rates and the ones that will be badly impacted.Sectors to WinFinancialsThe ultra-popular Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report), with AUM of $32.9 billion and average daily volume of 61.6 million shares, offers broad exposure to the sector with banks making up for 44.9% of the portfolio.

182,EIX,"Telecom service provider Cincinnati Bell (CBB  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 15, before the market opens.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $466.53 million, reflecting year-over-year improvement of 63.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at break-even earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, the company has a mixed earnings surprise history. Earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters and surpassed the same in the remaining two quarters, with an average beat of 61.46%Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence Q4 EarningsWe appreciate Cincinnati Bell’s efforts to transform itself from a legacy copper-based telecommunications company to an IT company with contemporary fiber assets, offering flexible data, video, voice and IP solutions to both consumer and business customers.In the Entertainment and Communications business, the company’s investments in Fioptics products helped it to witness revenue growth and subscriber addition in third-quarter 2017. In this regard, the introduction of MyTV through its Fioptics high-speed Internet service bodes well. Additionally, increased investments in strategic products, the creation of a new business division for small and mid-sized businesses as well as the development of its IT Services and Hardware division have raked in more profits. We expect to see a similar uptrend in the Fioptics Internet and video segment in the to-be-reported quarter.Its eero’s WiFi products should expand FTTH customer base. We appreciate the company’s decision to expand its call center base by hiring more workers. Buyout of OnX Enterprise Solutions will expand Cincinnati Bell’s network and enterprise IT services.However, in the past three months, the company’s shares have declined 20.4% compared with the industry’s decline of 0.9%. Cincinnati Bell continues to experience erosion in high-margin local access lines. Expansion and maintenance of its networks require significant capital expenditures. Intense competition in the company’s operational region can be a drag on the company’s pricing power, thereby putting pressure on its margins.Estimated Subscriber StatisticsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cincinnati Bell’s residential voice lines is 0.184 million for fourth-quarter 2017. The figure shows a decline from 0.188 million and 0.201 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Business voice lines estimates of 0.324 million are in line with the company’s reported figures in the previous quarter.Local access lines estimates of 0.507 million are lower than 0.512 million and 0.524 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Long-distance lines estimates of 0.262 million are pegged lower than 0.299 million and 0.317 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.DSL internet subscribers are estimated to be 0.080 million, lower than 0.087 million and 0.106 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Fioptics internet customers estimates of 0.229 million are above 0.221 million and 0.198 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Fioptics video subscribers estimates of 0.146 million are higher than 0.144 million and 0.138 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively. The company’s Fioptics related businesses show a positive trend.Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cincinnati Bell is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Cincinnati Bell has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

However, the Federal Reserve raised the rates twice this year — in March and June. This is likely to dent the stocks. In addition, the hurricanes also had an adverse impact on the utilities operating in Texas and Florida.With the rising interest rates, the stable, regular dividend-payer utilities will face strong competition from bonds as these provide higher returns.

186,EIX,"CenterPoint Energy Corp (CNP  -  Free Report) will release fourth-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Feb 22.Last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 4.88%. However, CenterPoint Energy outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 6.42%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCenterPoint Energy witnessed increased customer count during third-quarter 2017, primarily driven by the acquisition of Atmos Energy Marketing (AEM). The AEM acquisition has been accretive to the company’s results as of Sep 30, 2017, which in turn bolstered its Energy Services segment’s growth. We expect the company’s fourth-quarter results to also benefit from the same.Per management, customer growth, rate relief, energy services and midstream segments are likely to drive CenterPoint Energy’s fourth-quarter performance.Major regions of CenterPoint Energy’s service territory witnessed warmer-than-normal winter during the fourth quarter. This led to lower expenditure for consumers which are likely to dent the company’s sales in the to-be-reported quarter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents for fourth-quarter earnings marks a 15.4% increase year over year, while revenue estimate of $2.15 billion hints at an improvement of almost 3.4%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that CenterPoint Energy is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

188,EIX,"First Solar Inc. (FSLR  -  Free Report) announced that it is partnering with Arizona Public Service (“APS”), subsidiary of Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (PNW  -  Free Report), to develop a 50-megawatt (MW) solar-fueled battery project in Arizona. First Solar will also build and operate a 65-MW solar field to charge the battery.Arizona Public Service has signed a 15-year power-purchase agreement with First Solar. This agreement will enable APS to supply energy stored in the battery. The battery will store power when the sun is high and help APS to deliver it to customers between 3 and 8 p.m. when the sun is on its way down, but energy use is peaking.Rising Renewable Usage Per a U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report, renewable sources accounted for nearly 50% of the 25 gigawatts (GW) of new utility-scale electric generating capacity to have been added to the power grid during 2017.EIA expects solar projects in the United States to grow by 127 GW and utility-scale storage capacity to improve by 34 GW within 2020 to 2050 time period.The rising renewable projects will pave the way for battery projects, as it helps to stabilize and store the excess power produced from the projects to be used, when demand peaks.Battery Storage in the United StatesBattery Storage projects are gradually being installed across the United States.  Per the EIA release, more than 700 megawatt (MW) of battery storage projects were installed in the United States.The projects not only help in the storage of renewable power but also improve the grid reliability and efficiency. We expect more battery projects to come up, as it helps to neutralize the variability of electricity generation from the utility-scale solar projects. A decline in the cost of storage projects will also promote growth in battery storage projects.Southern California Edison, a subsidiary of Edison International (EIX  -  Free Report), is also involved in various projects that promote the usage of battery storage systems.Price MovementIn the last six months, First Solar has returned 27.9% compared with industry’s rally of 3.4%.  Zacks RankFirst Solar carries a Zacks Rank#2 (Buy). Another top-ranked stock in the same industry, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is Sunrun Inc. (SUN  -  Free Report). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Sunrun reported positive earnings in the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 75.67%. Its 2017 and 2018 Zacks Consensus Estimate moved up 48.4% and 50%, respectively, over the last 60 days.Our ViewThe primary drawback of the solar projects is their inability to produce electricity when the sun is down. However, the ongoing improvement in advanced battery technology will address this issue by storing power and help utilities serve customers with clean electricity, even when the sun is down.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

194,EIX,"Edison International’s (EIX  -  Free Report) unit Southern California Edison (“SCE”) has received approval from the California Public Utilities Commission to begin four electric transportation pilot projects that will help increase usage of electric in transportation. The primary objective of these transportation pilots is to lower emission levels and meet California’s 2030 greenhouse gas and air pollution reduction goals.California aims to lower its 2030 greenhouse gas emissions by 40% below 1990 levels. SCE, through its transportation pilot projects, will expand the usage of electricity in cars, buses, medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and industrial vehicles and equipment.Emission Reduction BenefitsSouthern California is the gateway for nearly 40% of the goods entering the United States, which move through the region’s ports and  highways. It is evident that the goods movement through the heavy vehicles is major source of emission in this region.The pilot projects primarily aim to promote development of more electric charging points that will assist in charging the electric vehicles and work on electrification of the equipment used in ports. The projects are part of the $550 million investment program, which the commission is yet to approve.Reduction of pollution from the transportation space, which is the major contributor to emission levels in California will help to achieve the pollution reduction goals. Also, several utility scale renewable energy projects are coming up in the state, which will help in achieving the target.Road Ahead SCE serves nearly 15 million people in its 50,000 square miles of service area. To efficiently serve the growing population of California, the company aims to invest $14.7 billion in next few years to strengthen and expand its existing electricity infrastructure.Also, energy efficiency programs of SCE have helped customers save enough energy to power 1.2 million homes for a year.SCE’s massive asset base and expertise will allow it to develop the transportation electrification market in California and these pilot projects are means to achieve the same.Price MovementEdison International’s shares have lost 13.6% in a year against the industry’s gain of 2.8%. Zacks Rank & Key PicksEdison International currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

199,EIX,"The Q2 earnings season is gradually unfolding. As of Jul 25, 128 S&P 500 members came up with earnings results. Total earnings for these companies are up 7.0% from the same period last year on 4.2% higher revenues. 77.3% of the companies beat EPS estimates while 70.3% topped revenue estimates.It is going to be another busy week with nearly 800 companies – including 183 S&P 500 members – expected to come up with earnings results. Combining results of the reported index members (97 members till Jul 21) with the remaining 403 members of S&P 500, earnings are estimated to improve 8.6% on 4.7% higher revenues.Let us now focus on the utility sector, which is characterized by its defensive nature and domestic orientation. Earnings are expected to drop 2.9% this season.The utility sector is capital-intensive. These companies need huge capital to set up generation facilities, and transmission and distribution infrastructure. They also require considerable funds to maintain and upgrade the existing systems in order to meet emission-control standards. Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve has raised the rates twice in 2017 – in March and June. This will definitely hurt the utilities. The Fed has maintained its forecast for one more rate hike in 2017.With the rising interest rates, the stable, regular dividend payer utilities will face strong competition from bonds as these provide higher returns, which will make them a more attractive option for the investors.The U.S. coal-based utilities got a respite with President Trump’s decision to repeal the Climate Power Plan. Moreover, Trump has walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement.    Five out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline this season.
