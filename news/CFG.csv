20,CFG,"Bank stocks, among the biggest winners since Donald Trump's election, were among the biggest losers as the president's political woes intensified. Citigroup (C) fell back below a buy point, while Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS) and several other big financials undercut key support levels. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), both members of the Dow Jones industrial average, tumbled below the low of their current consolidations.Stocks sold off Wednesday on news reports that Trump pressured then-FBI Director James Comey to drop his investigation of Mike Flynn, who was briefly the president's national security advisor. Trump abruptly fired Comey last week.While social media is rampant with chatter of impeachment, markets are worried about more realistic scenarios. Trump's agenda for tax cuts and other pro-growth ideas already seem stalled. As a result, the odds of Federal Reserve rate hikes are falling. Treasury yields are sinking, with the yield curve flattening out once again. Bank executives and shareholders have been counting on stronger economic growth to boost lending — and widen the spread between its borrowing costs and lending rates.The Trump administration could still go forward with regulatory relief for banks. But even that could be delayed or scaled back as the president and top officials are occupied putting out political fires of his own making.Citigroup last week cleared an aggressive buy point at 60.89. On Tuesday, shares ran up to just below a convention buy point of 62.63. But Citigroup tumbled 4% to 59.98 on the stock market today, back below the alternative entry though finding some support at its 50-day moving average.Bank of America, which had just gotten above its 50-day line, fell 5.9%.

Both fell intraday below the low end of their base patterns.Wells Fargo (WFC), which can't shake the fake accounts scandal, lost 1.9%, closing just below its 200-day line.RELATED:Trump Will Bust Up Bank Regulation, Not The BanksThese Words Could Doom Trump's Tax Cuts

Penney (JCP) reached a record low, down more than 10%, as revenues and same-store sales fell more than forecast early Friday.Action within the IBD 50 was mixed as leading growth stocks as weakness among financials offset strength in technology names. On the upside, Momo (MOMO) notched a new high, up 4.3%, while fiber-optic stock Lumentum Holdings (LITE) moved up 1.9%.On the downside, chip name Ichor (ICHR) dropped nearly 4% but bounced off intraday lows after reporting earnings that fell short of the Street's estimates, while regional bank Citizens Financial (CFG) and private mortgage insurer Essent Group (ESNT) fell 1.7% and 1.4%, respectively.Ichor is currently trading above its 50-day moving average, a sign of strength.RELATED:Apple Hits Record High On Bullish Wall Street ReportsThese 5 Red Flags On GE Send Stock To 15-Month LowNordstrom Comp Sales Miss But Off-Price Brand Nordstrom Rack SurgesGraphics Chip Maker Nvidia Gets Fresh Price-Target Hikes

The S&P 500 was nearly flat. Volume in the stock market today was running higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq.Blue chips were mostly up, but the gains were contained. Goldman Sachs (GS) led the upside in the Dow Jones industrial average, rising 0.7%. Caterpillar (CAT) took the hardest hit in the Dow, off 01.8%.Walt Disney (DIS) narrowed its early loss to 0.4%.

But Citizens Financial Group (CFG) advanced 1.3% in fast trade.Meanwhile, the House planned a vote Thursday on an amended health care bill. An attempt to schedule a vote in March fell through.

24,CFG,"U.S. stock indexes followed France's CAC-40 to bold gains Monday morning.The Nasdaq jumped 1.2%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1% each. Small caps trailed as the Russell 2000 slipped 0.3%. Volume was unclear in the early going.The Nasdaq has been encountering resistance at 5911-5936 since early March. A break through that area would probably signal a removal of pressure. The U.S. stock market has worn the under-pressure label for 23 sessions. If it stays under pressure today, that would mark the most days under pressure in more than nine years.If France lifts the U.S. market out of its doldrums, that would be a bit of a surprise. France seldom plays a financial role beyond its borders. But the CAC-40 gained more than 4% on first-round elections results that suggested that moderation would win out. The U.S. stock market apparently decided that France was now one less worry on the international plate.Thirteen industry groups led the way in the U.S. market. The big movers included banks, airlines, specialty steel and shippers. On the downside, gold miners dropped the most. Of IBD's 197 industry groups, only a half dozen or so were in the red. The broad gains were a good sign for the U.S. market.Morgan Stanley (MS) gapped up 4%. Money centers enjoyed their best day since early February. More than a dozen of the stocks gapped up.Blue chips were up almost without exception. In the Dow Jones industrial average, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) jumped 3%, while Caterpillar (CAT) gained 2%.In the IBD 50, a list of the top stocks by fundamentals and technicals, the top percentage gainers were Texas Capital Bancshares (TCBI) and Citizens Financial Group (CFG), both up almost 5%.RELATED:Boeing Near A Buy Point

Dow component Home Depot (HD) cleared resistance around 150 and is rising from support at the 50-day moving average. Home improvement rival Lowe's (LOW) topped an 84.10 entry, but the stock dipped below it and volume was light.The small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 1.4%. Although U.S. stocks gains were solid, they didn't match the fervor of European indexes. The London FTSE 100 rallied 2.1%, the German DAX 3.4% and the Paris CAC 40 4.1% as investors applauded the French election results, which left a pro-EU candidate in good shape to win the presidency. The iShares MSCI Eurozone (EZY) ETF jumped 4.7% to the highest level since August 2015.On the main exchanges, volume was tracking higher on the Nasdaq and lower on the NYSE.  Winners led losers by 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq and better than 13-to-5 on the NYSE.Banking, travel and some cyclical industry groups led the market. Regional banks, whose shine had been fading for weeks, were among the better-performing stocks in today's market. Western Alliance (WAL), Zions Bancorp (ZION) and Citizens Financial Group (CFG) were up in heavy trading and back to the 50-day line or getting closer to it as they rebound.But it was the technology sector that stood out in terms of chart action, as several names broke out past buy points.Dell Technologies (DVMT) leapt past the 65.88 buy point in more than double its usual volume as shares rose 2.5% to 66.02. The computer hardware company is a member of Leaderboard.IPG Photonics (IPGP) moved above the 124.37 buy point of a flat base. Shares jumped 3.5% to 124.78. Volume was merely average, which invites suspicions about the otherwise bullish move. Earnings for the maker of specialized lasers are due May 2 before the open.A pair of IBD 50 stocks also broke out.Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) rose past the 52.32 buy point of a cup-with-handle base in heavy trading. Shares soared 4% to 53.78. The maker of semiconductor technologies for optical, wireless and satellite networks tried to breakout out initially last week, but got turned back. Earnings are due Tuesday after the close.Synopsys (SNPS) broke out past the 73.18 buy point of a flat base. Shares rose 1% to 73.63. But volume was about half the usual pace, which made the breakout suspect. The stock has been rising from support at the 50-day moving average.RELATED:Breakout Watch: Top Financial Stock Jumps Back Into Buy Zone

The Dow Jones industrial average erased a small loss and was up less than 0.1%.The Nasdaq holds an easy lead for the week among the big benchmarks, trading up 1.9% through Thursday, boosted by Alphabet's (GOOGL) 2.4% gain and Amazon.com's (AMZN) 2% advance during that time.

Schlumberger (SLB) gapped down to a loss of nearly 3% after reporting results, while Steve Madden (SHOO) rose nearly 3%.In the Dow industrials, Visa (V) rose 1% to a new high.  Visa reported stronger-than-expected second-quarter results late Thursday and steered full-year revenue guidance toward the high end of its previously stated range.General Electric (GE)  fell 0.3% after delivering larger-than-expected second-quarter earnings and a smaller-than-forecast revenue decline. The stock has been consolidating, trading below resistance at its 40-week moving average since January, as it works on a flat base.IBD 50 stock Citizen's Financial Group (CFG) was flat. A 49% earnings gain and a 14% rise in revenue reported late Thursday topped analyst targets. Shares are working to climb off the bottom of a seven-week-old consolidation.Online security services provider Proofpoint (PFPT) bolted 10% higher, although its 233% surge in first-quarter earnings reported after Thursday's close fell short of analysts expectations. A 43% revenue gain cleared targets, and full-year earnings and revenue guidance were all above consensus views.Skechers (SKX) fell 0.4%. Brokerage B. Riley upgraded the stock to buy from neutral after a first-quarter beat late Thursday, but management guided second-quarter earnings below the consensus estimate. The stock has been recovering since October, and pulled back to test support at its 40-week line for the past three weeks.S&P 500 stock Honeywell (HON) added nearly 3% as a 10% rise in earnings and flat revenue were better than projected by analysts.

27,CFG,"XThe stock market remained in rally mode on Thursday with the Nasdaq leading the way, rising 0.7% vs. the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average's gains of more than 0.6%. Volume rose modestly on the NYSE, but edged lower on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Wednesday. Among the Dow industrials, American Express (AXP) boosted the blue-chip index with a near 5% jump after reporting its Q1 earnings late Wednesday. The credit card company cleared both earnings and sales estimates, causing shares to surge back above the 50-day line. The two energy components in the Dow Jones industrials, Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), followed up with 1% advances apiece as crude oil prices rebounded 0.1% after Wednesday's 3% fall.Among other companies reporting earnings, D.R. Horton (DHI) traded down over 2.3% despite beating fiscal Q2 estimates and raising its full-year revenue guidance early Thursday. D.R. Horton broke out of a cup with handle with a 34.16 entry on Monday, but is now trading below that point. Other homebuilders followed suit. Pulte Group (PHM) reversed from highs to move down 1.7%, while Toll Brothers (TOL) dropped almost 1%.Qualcomm (QCOM) fell 0.6% after reporting its Q2 fiscal results late Wednesday. The wireless chip maker reported better-than-expected sales and earnings, but guided analysts lower for the current quarter. The bearish guidance caused a number of price-target cuts from analysts. Shares are down 20% year-to-date. Starbucks (SBUX) jumped out of a flat base with a 59.64 entry in the stock market today.

29,CFG,"A tail wind has kicked up this calendar year behind $7.5 billion American Century Growth Fund (TWCGX). That's nice news for investors holding the fund in retirement accounts and other portfolios. The fund's 9.93% gain this year going into Thursday topped 73% of the fund's large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. That's a step up from the 67% of peers the fund outperformed over the trailing 12 months with a 16.40% return.Managers Gregory Woodhams and Justin Brown pick stocks individually and not based on sectors, but their sector weights show where they expect to find leaders. Technology was their top sector as of Jan. 31, with a 34% weighting. Consumer discretionary was next with 20%.Tech titans Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) — the fund's first, third and fifth largest holdings — illustrate that appetite. Alphabet is up 7% so far this year. Apple is up 24%. Microsoft is up 5%. Together they account for about 14% of the fund's assets.Several top new buys as of Dec. 31 also belonged to the tech sector. Among those was chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO), which is up 25% so far this year. The stock has a highest-possible Comp Rating of 99.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom is ranked No. 1 in the No. 37-rated Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. It has four quarters in a row of accelerating earnings per share growth. See how its additional easy-to-understanding fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' at IBD's Stock Checkup.Another top new buy was Activision Blizzard (ATVI), which is up 39% this year. The video game stock is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Computer Software-Gaming group, thanks in part to traits like its very strong 97 Comp Rating. In addition, the stock is on the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals.Tuesday was the stock's ex-dividend date, meaning that you had to own shares before that to be eligible for its dividend. Its dividend yield Monday was 0.6%.A negative: EPS growth has decelerated for two quarters, from 315% to 152% and 11%. Analysts see EPS falling 9% in the current quarter and 11% this year, and then rising 21% in 2018, in line with its three-year growth rate.Financials were just the fund's sixth-largest sector, with a modest 4% weighting. One of those was Citizens Financial (CFG), a top new buy whose EPS growth has accelerated for three quarters in a row.Still, the stock is down 3% this year after tumbling 13% off its March 1 high. That pullback along with the broad market reflects investors' concerns that Congress' failure to revise or kill ObamaCare is a sign that additional Trump initiatives, such as corporate and individual tax cuts and lighter regulatory burdens for banks, may not be as likely as investors had hoped.Shares of Citrix Systems (CTXS), yet another newcomer to the portfolio, surged March 13 on rumors of a company sale. The company's business software creates work spaces that provide access to desktops, apps, data and communications on any device, over networks and in the cloud.As IBD recently reported, Citrix has been pressured by activist investor Elliott Management to make changes. On Feb. 1, Citrix completed its spinoff of its GoToMeeting business, which then merged with LogMeIn (LOGM). GoToMeeting is a conferencing application that allows remote access to personal computers.Citrix shares are up 20% this year. The cloud computing company's most recent EPS report was for Q4, in January. It earned $1.61 a share on sales of $908 million. That topped consensus for EPS of $1.50 and revenue of $900.8 million. But the $1.61 was a decline of 3%.The company forecast 2017 EPS of $4.60-$4.65 and revenue of $2.81 billion to $2.84 billion. Both are well below consensus for $5.60 EPS and sales of $3.55 billion, but Citrix's guidance excludes GoToMeeting.VMware (VMW) is another new buy for the fund. The server virtualization leader is up 17% this year. EPS grew 0%, 4%, 12% and 13% the past four quarters.VMware paid $1.3 billion to buy Niciria, a software-defined networking company, three years ago. VMware said recently it expects $1 billion in sales of NSX, made possible by that acquisition. NSX lets companies update networks through software changes rather than the more costly path of replacing routers and switching hardware.NSX is a challenge to Cisco Systems' (CSCO) flagship networking software product, called Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI).In the consumer discretionary sector, bellwether Amazon (AMZN) and auto-parts chain O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) were the fund's second- and seventh-largest holdings as of Jan. 31.Amazon has been trending mostly sideways since mid-February, hanging on to a 17% gain so far this year.O'Reilly is down 1% this year. RELATED:IBD's Best Mutual Funds 2017 Awards: New Crop Of WinnersFacebook, Alphabet Among Hot Tech Stocks American Century Growth Mutual Fund Likes

32,CFG,"The rally in regional banks has moderated, but two ETFs that track the industry are using that pause to refresh their charts.The charts of SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) and iShares U.S. Regional Banks (IAT) look like twins, the way they've behaved so similarly. Both have pulled back from highs reached at the start of March and are testing the 50-day moving average.With a bit more of a bounce, both exchange traded funds will be in buy areas. At the moment, the support at the 50-day line is not convincing enough. Watch for shares of both to climb at least one more point, and preferably in above-average volume.No chart reader would dispute that both ETFs were in need of a break. They shot up starting in mid-November on a combination of rising interest rates and President Trump's election. Trump and Republicans are trying to ease banking regulations, and higher rates are widening interest margins for banks.While SPDR Regional Banking has 100 stocks, iShares Regional Banks has about half as many.Still, the two portfolios are similar in terms of the largest holdings. PNC Financial Services (PNC), SunTrust Bank (STI), M&T Bank (MTB), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), KeyCorp (KEY), Regions Financial (RF), Citizens Financial (CFG) and BB&T (BBT) are top-10 holdings in both funds.The two differ in that iShares Regional Banks has a big stake in U.S. Bancorp (USB) (more than 16% of the portfolio) while the superregional bank doesn't even make the SPDR Regional Banking portfolio.The holdings of SPDR Regional Banking are more spread out, with no single stock accounting for more than 4% of the total weighting.With the Federal Reserve expected to increase interest rates by a quarter-point two more times this year, the fundamental backdrop for regional banks is generally favorable. Higher rates tend to widen the margin between interest earned on loans vs. interest paid on deposits.LPL Financial, for example, had this to say: ""Steepening yield curve, deregulation, expanded credit access, strong fourth quarter 2016 earnings, and positive revisions are all supportive.""But Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research, saw an economic warning sign in the banking sector. ""In the U.S., bank loan growth has slowed significantly since Q4 and the Atlanta Fed's GDP nowcast is only indicating 1.2% U.S. growth for the current quarter, compared to over 2.5% as recently as early February."" The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

33,CFG,"Riding just one growth stock to big gains is always a challenge. But Will Danoff does it so often that Fidelity Contrafund has become a $107 billion behemoth that's returned an average annual 12.94% during his more than 27 years at the  helm.That puts Danoff's performance in the top 4.8% of U.S. diversified stock funds that have been around that long, according to Morningstar Inc. His mastery of the stock market (the S&P 500 trails Contrafund with an average annual 10.17%) has attracted a mountain of investor assets, making Contra Fidelity's largest actively managed fund and the third-largest actively run industrywide.And Danoff and Contra are at it again this year, proving once again that a big fund can outmaneuver more-nimble smaller funds. The fund's 9.61% gain through March 3 topped the S&P 500 as well as his peer's average.In a recent conversation with IBD, Danoff, 56, talked about the science of investing, lessons to be learned from the New England Patriots Super Bowl champs and investment opportunities he sees in the Trump era.  And, oh yeah, Danoff went over what he likes about several of his recent top holdings, including Broadcom (AVGO), Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN).IBD: You're a Boston guy, Will. What did you think about the Super Bowl?Danoff: For me, sports is a lot like business. You know, how to build a team. How to find all-stars, who can put the ball in the end zone. There was a lot of psychology at work in that game. And it showed the importance of preparation.What the Patriots taught us is to keep looking forward. They don't dwell on their mistakes. And they made a fair number of mistakes in that game. (They were trailing 28-3 in the final minutes of the third quarter.) The lesson for investors is, they stayed focused on their goals.IBD: How is a game like investing in stocks?Danoff: The stock market is a very emotional beast. You get knocked over. But the important thing is to stand back up. Over and over, you try to do better. And the opportunities come. You just have to prepare for them.IBD: Will, for people who may not be familiar with the fund and are confused by its name — does it invest in weird stocks?Danoff: No, Contrafund is a capital appreciation fund with a growth bias. I think over time stock prices follow earnings per share. If a company can double its earnings over the next five years, most likely the stock will double its share price, plus or minus a little.IBD: Summarize what you look for in stocks.Danoff: I'm looking for companies that are well-positioned in their industry, run by experienced management teams who are enthusiastic about what they do, are honorable people who accept that industry as cyclical, so they make prudent capital allocation decisions.I've also found that investing with management that has a large ownership stake and therefore are on the same side of the table as shareholders is a good thing to do.IBD: How has experience made you fine-tune your investment approach?Danoff: I've seen over and over, you have to be careful. I have over time become more disciplined and sensitive to what I'm paying for earnings growth.There's no reward for degree of difficulty in investing. You don't have to be the first investor to find a good story. You can be cautious. If a stock has already doubled or tripled, it doesn't mean you've missed it. If it's going to double or triple again, it's probably still a buy. It's like sports matches. Who cares what happened on the last point scored? You're playing this point now.IBD: Let's talk stocks. In each case, I'm asking about your thesis as of your latest disclosure. HealthEquity (HQY) (which is up 7% so far this year) runs platforms where consumers can access tax-advantaged health care savings and check treatment options. You opened your stake in November and boosted it in December. Why the interest?Danoff: Influenced by (IBD founder) Bill O'Neil and others, I've been intrigued by opportunities in new companies to the market. Fidelity created a new global fund (Fidelity Insights Class) for Canadian investors, launched in the past few weeks, that let's me cast a wider net for small- and midcap companies.IBD: So you learned about HealthEquity while doing research for the Canadian fund?Danoff: Right. I asked analysts on that fund to bring small and midcap ideas because the new fund allows me to take smaller positions. HealthEquity is a provider of health savings accounts (HSAs), which is a growing sector in human resources. Companies that are growing 40% a year are attractive. The whole health care system is moving toward more consumer participation, which can help control health care costs. People went to a doctor, only paid a $5 or $10 copay, so they didn't hesitate to ask about every little ache. That's financially unsustainable. HSAs are part of the solution.IBD: Your long-term outperformance is notable, but 2016 was an off year. What are you expecting for this year?Danoff: Active management had a horrible year last year. But with the new administration and a cyclical orientation in the global economy and especially the U.S. economy, I think active management is going to do very well in the foreseeable future.Fundamentals will matter a lot more. The kind of research we do at Fidelity is going to matter a lot more. REITs, utilities, consumer staples are low growth and now relatively highly valued. Interest rates going up are going to create an OK tail wind for active fund managers.IBD: So you expect 2017 to be better for Contrafund?Danoff: Low interest rates, political uncertainty and decelerating growth in emerging markets propelled big, 'safe' groups to unsustainably high valuations (in 2016). These included integrated oil companies, telecommunications companies, utilities, REITs (real estate investment trusts) and consumer staples. These groups, which represented about a quarter of the S&P 500 the past year, could fall if interest rates continue to climb.The election of Donald Trump was a significant regime change and the new administration is expected to pursue pro-growth policies. I believe rates will rise this year, and that stock selection and earnings growth will play a much bigger role in stock performance in 2017.I believe that stocks follow earnings over time, so better companies that can grow earnings faster will do better than the rest of the market. I am confident that, with the help of Fidelity's global research team, I can find what I consider the best investments for the fund.IBD: What's your biggest take-away from the elections?Danoff: The election of Trump has changed the direction of fiscal policy. He'll pursue a more deregulatory agenda. He'll emphasize U.S. manufacturing. So I'm going to take a more pro-cyclical tilt, which will mean finding some growth cyclicals. Interest rates will continue to back up. What group will benefit from that? I'll be adding to my already heavy bet on financials.IBD: You've got 13 stocks that are on the IBD 50 list, which are leading growth stocks showing strong relative price strength and top-notch fundamentals.Danoff: It's just a coincidence. But let's face it. I'm paid to beat the market. I have to have stocks that are beating the market.IBD: Broadcom's earnings per share growth has accelerated. What's your thesis? (Shares are up 24% this year.)Danoff: Their management has done an excellent job acquiring smaller semiconductor companies and cutting costs, emphasizing the higher-margin, more differentiated products in the acquisitions. They generate a lot of free cash flow, which enables them to make more acquisitions.CEO Tan Hock has done an excellent job focusing on R&D. A stronger economy should be good for semiconductors. (Analysts') earnings estimates are increasing.IBD: Netflix's EPS growth has accelerated for three straight quarters after six quarters of declines. What's your view? (Shares are up 12% this year.)Danoff: CEO Reed Hastings from the beginning had a vision of how consumers don't want linear TV, they want shows when they want them. And he's done a great job of acquiring other people's content and now creating his own exclusive content. He's offering outstanding quality TV at a very reasonable price and in an easy-to-use format. That formula still has legs.IBD: How so?Danoff: He's finding that people in Brazil and Germany want to watch the same types of programs as people do in the U.S. So as he grows members overseas, he can leverage content costs. His pole position in internet TV and the franchise he's built justify Netflix's high valuation.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Leisure-Movies & Related industry group. Check-out the stock's growth metrics in the easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data roundup at IBD's Stock Checkup.IBD: Amazon's quarterly EPS deceleration has been sharp. Are you concerned? (Shares are up 13% this year.)Danoff: I think the earnings slowdown is partly optics. To me, the innovation with Alexa (Amazon's interactive personal assistant) has been powerful. Amazon Web Services grew only 47% last quarter, but that's a $14 billion (annual) run rate. That's nicely profitable.Prime is a great service. It's gaining a lot of market share.Amazon has issues, but they're on them and I like how management has navigated and continued to grow. For a company to be innovating at $130 billion of revenue is really special. I wouldn't want to bet against them. How many $380-billion-market-cap companies grow 20% a year? And generate a lot of free cash flow? Yes, the stock bounces around. Given the high price-earnings ratio (around 170), maybe the stock will be volatile.IBD: You opened your current stake in Nvidia (NVDA) last March. You increased your stake nine-fold in July. What do you like there? (Shares are down 10% so far this year.)Danoff: They're the leader in GPU and graphics chips, which historically have been used in gaming, PC gaming, which has continued to grow. But in the last couple of years, companies that operate servers realized that strings of GPUs (graphics processing units) can power their computer needs more efficiently than regular CPUs, so now Nvidia's GPUs are being used in high performance data centers like Amazon Web Services' and the big social clouds like Facebook's and Microsoft's Azure (which is an enterprise-grade cloud computing program). So Nvidia has additional growth there.A third area of growth is in machine learning and in applications like IBM Watson and driverless cars, where computers need to process a tremendous amount of data quickly.The data-center and autonomous driving markets are growing fast. Nvidia is in the pole position. Their revenues are accelerating, their margins improving.IBD: Your current stake in Citizens Financial (CFG) began in December. Why did you start buying? (Shares are up 8% this year.)Danoff: Citizens is a much smaller position bought as part of a basket of banks. I can take my time seeing which I want to keep.IBD: You began your Applied Materials (AMAT) stake in May and increased your stake in June, July, November and December. What has your thesis been? (Shares are up 14% this year.)Danoff: Semiconductor stocks' performance is tied to an improving economy. And as semiconductor companies do well, they buy more of the semiconductor cap equipment that Applied Materials has.Applied is a leader in OLED technology — organic light emitting diode technology. In the past six months, we've seen orders in that subsector explode. Some people say OLED will only be used in premium smartphones. My bet is that the price will fall enough to expand OLED penetration to the midtier.IBD: What prompted you to trim your LogMeIn (LOGM) stake in November and December? (Shares are up 1% this year.)Danoff: They did a nice deal with Citrix (CTXS). Their videoconference business merged with Citrix in a tax efficient way. It will slow their growth, but it gives them a strong competitive position.It shows the importance of management thinking like owners. You can't predict the future, but you can say you trust management that you've been watching for three or four years. It's like hiring a veteran in football. You know he'll make tackles, won't drop passes. You try to fill your roster with folks you have confidence in.With LogMeIn management did a good deal and the story got better.IBD: You've been running Contrafund a long time. How do you avoid going stale?Danoff: One of the strengths of Fidelity is that we have a small army of young analysts, who haven't been beaten up by time. I like our mix of experience as well as young and enthusiastic analysts. You need youth to be current with what's happening in technology.RELATED:How Fidelity Contrafund Manager Will Danoff Played The DownturnWill Danoff Plus John Roth Equal Top-Performing Fidelity New Insights Fund

The hot reading came on the heels of several statements from Fed officials Tuesday that were more hawkish than dovish in tone.

The percentage of bulls came in at 63.1%, up from 61.2% in the prior week and the highest level since 1987. The survey is used as a contrarian indicator because excessive bullishness has been seen at or near market tops in the past.RELATED:Infrastructure Stocks Rise On Trump's $1 Trillion 'National Rebuilding' PlanCisco Partly To Blame For Palo Alto Networks' Pain?

The market will reopen Friday for a shortened session, which will end three hours earlier than usual.Blue chips were mostly up with Caterpillar (CAT) leading the 30-stock Dow. Shares of CAT gapped up 2.7%, perhaps helped a bit by strong earnings from Deere & Co. (DE). Caterpillar's stock has been on the comeback trail since bottoming in January. The stock is up about 40% year to date and up about 11% during the so-called Trump rally, which began after the Election Day close.Caterpillar's fundamentals haven't improved much. The EPS Rating is 20, which means eight of every 10 stocks in IBD's database are growing earnings faster than Caterpillar. On Friday, CAT said global retail sales fell 12% in the August-October period. The only bright spot was that the pace of the decline is slowing.IBD'S TAKE: Three rules to follow when you're unsure about a stock.In the IBD 50, a list that includes stocks with the best fundamentals and technicals, chip designer MaxLinear (MXL) fell 2% in heavy volume. MaxLinear's breakouts in March, May and July led to gains of only 7% to 9%.A breakout Nov. 9 gained as much as 6% but then reversed to nudge the stock back into the 5% buy zone. That's where things stand now.MaxLinear could become a test. Will the stock market provide enough thrust to help MaxLinear? Do the rollovers after meager gains reflect on market or reflect on MaxLinear?In IBD's Big Cap 20, banks and financials continue to show strength. The nine financials in the Big Cap 20 were up Wednesday without exception. Citizens Financial Group (CFG), advanced 1%.Economic news was on the heavy side Wednesday. Durable goods orders, the PMI manufacturing index and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge were all stronger than expected.But first-time jobless claims, the Federal Housing Finance Agency's price index, and the Commerce Department's report on new home sales were worse than expected.The data on housing, though, barely made the housing stocks blink. IBD's homebuilding industry group slipped 0.1% after rising in 13 of the previous 14 sessions. During that run, the group has gained more than 7%.The Federal Reserve's minutes from the early November meeting signaled policymakers were ready to hike interest rates soon.RELATED:Deere Stock Soars On Strong Fiscal Q4 ResultsCan PennyMac Get Its House In Order?

53,CFG,"U.S. stock indexes advanced nicely Tuesday, but volume stepped down markedly.The Nasdaq rose 1.1%, while the S&P 500 added 0.7%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average crawled 0.3% higher. Small caps, which have been leading the market of late, tacked on 0.3% in the S&P 600. Volume in the stock market today declined roughly 15% on the NYSE and 10% on the Nasdaq from the previous session's pace, according to preliminary figures.Follow-up action has been rather weak among the major indexes, but small caps and select sectors have done very well. Bulls would like to see some days of big gains in rising volume.Banks have been the star sector recently. On Monday, 153 banks scored new highs while the two major indexes accounted for 751 new highs. Nine bank stocks now make up about half of the Big Cap 20, which is a list of the best big caps by fundamentals and technicals. On Tuesday, bank winners led losers in the Big Cap 20.Big Cap 20 members Morgan Stanley (MS), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), KeyCorp (KEY) and Regions Financial (RF) each rose more than 1%, according to preliminary data. Goldman Sachs (GS), Citizens Financial Bank (CFG) and SunTrust Banks (STI) scored smaller gains. M & T Bank (MTB) lost ground.The construction aggregates and cement stocks also have been leaders. But Tuesday, they were taking a timeout. Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), Vulcan Materials (VMC) and Eagle Materials (EXP) recorded losses but without damaging the overall bullishness of their chart patterns.Meanwhile, economic news was mostly positive.Retail sales for October were stronger than expected, and September results were revised upward. The Street expected a 0.6% pop in October, but the percentage came in at 0.8% — above the highest estimate in the range. The September figure initially was reported at 0.6% but was revised to 1%.Most stocks in the retail sector are currently laggards. Of the 18 groups in the retail sector, roughly two-thirds are in the bottom half among 197 industry groups. The one highly rated group is department stores, which is No. 8.Manufacturing also topped expectations. The Empire State manufacturing gauge for November rose 1.5, also above the highest estimate in the range, according to Econoday. The Street expected a reading of minus 2.3. November marked the first positive reading since July.Business inventories for September inched up 0.1%, falling shy of views for 0.2%.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, oil stocks and gold miners were the day's biggest gainers.

59,CFG,"U.S. stocks advanced moderately in late morning trade Monday as volume picked up.The Nasdaq added 0.3%, the S&P 500 rose 0.5%, and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was ahead by 0.6%. Volume was running higher in the stock market today, although early volume figures can often change.EpiPen maker Mylan (MYL) initially rose about 3%, but reversed to trade modestly lower. The Netherlands-based company has attracted bad publicity because of price increases that have boosted a two-pack of the EpiPen device to a $600 list price. On Monday, the company announced that it would offer a generic version of its allergic-treatment product at half the current price.The flap has brought negative publicity to Mylan and more awareness of EpiPen's cheaper rivals. AdrenaClick, for example, offers a less expensive product, and some doctors have pointed out that a syringe and bottle of the non-patent epinephrine can be bought for about $10. EpiPen's patents are related to its delivery device.Meanwhile, blue chip stocks were mostly higher. On the Dow, financial stocks JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) rose about 1%.Talk of an interest rate hike has been lifting bank stocks.

60,CFG,"Matt Murphy, a managing director at venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, sees something happening in Silicon Valley that he hasn't seen in a very long time.""There are more amazing private companies now than I can remember in my 17-year career in venture capital,"" said Murphy. ""There are more potential IPOs today than I can remember since 1999.""This ain't no 1999, for good and bad. The dot-com bubble sparked a near-record 486 initial public offerings in 1999. Early this year, IPO offerings hit a seven-year low. The lessons of the dot-com bust and Great Recession remain fresh, and the weak global economy has fueled caution.But the window has cracked open to show some of Murphy's buoyant view. Several stocks have made strong debuts, and several analysts say the enthusiastic welcome should lure more companies off the fence and into the public market in the second half.Eyes opened when cloud software provider Twilio (TWLO) popped 92% on its first day of trading June 23. The stock priced at 15, finished day one near 29 and was up 0.9% Monday at 41.85. The IPO raised $150 million.""Twilio broke the logjam,"" said Murphy.Acacia Communications (ACIA) (up 35% on its first trading day), Japan-based Line (LN) (up 27%) and software company Talend (TLND) (up 42%) are the other IPO highlights of a soft year.Two IPOs this past week got early bounces. At Home Group (HOME) priced at 15 and opened Thursday at 16.26. It raised $130 million. First Hawaiian Bank (FHB) priced at 23 and opened at 24.20. It raised $485 million. First Hawaiian is the largest U.S. bank IPO since Citizens Financial Group (CFG) in September 2014. At Home, a home decor retailer with 115 large-format stores, is the first retail chain IPO since Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) in July 2015.IBD'S TAKE: Acacia Communications, Twilio and U.S. Foods report quarterly earnings for the first time as public companies this week. For earnings estimates on these and other top-rated companies, check out IBD's weekly Investing Action Plan.Spotify, the online music service, is perhaps the biggest name that could be next up to the plate.An IPO, when a company sells its shares to the public for the first time, is a rite of passage for startups and an economic engine. Yet some of the biggest startups, like ride-hailing firm Uber, are happy to put off making IPOs. Uber has raised so much cash it doesn't need an IPO infusion and can avoid the scrutiny that comes with being publicly traded, while waiting for stronger economic conditions.But IPOs often provide the funding fuel that young companies use to grow into multibillion-dollar businesses that innovate and create jobs. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) were once tiny outfits that ballooned after their successful IPOs.IPOs also bring big gains to VC firms and other early investors, allowing them to invest in the next star companies.But since the dot-com bust, more companies taking the plunge must show strong sales growth. They also need to show either earnings or a quick road to earnings.Even when those requirements are met, uncertainties in the global economy can weigh on the new-issue market, cooling investors' appetite for riskier investments. Brexit and potential interest rate hikes are just two of the factors fueling doubts this year.The 56 IPOs on U.S. stock exchanges in 2016 are 56% fewer than in the year-earlier period, and the $9.6 billion raised is down 57%, says Renaissance Capital, which manages two IPO-focused exchange traded funds.Q1 marked the slowest quarter for IPOs in seven years. A mere eight, all in the health care field, raised just $700,000 combined.Q2 brought 33 IPOs, raising $5.5 billion. That's still far below average, but it sparked hopes for an IPO rebound. This year's average return for IPOs is about 17% above the IPO price. This is a big turnaround from the IPO class of 2015, which is down 11%, says Renaissance.""That 17% return is very strong, and it's even higher if you take out small IPOs,"" said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance and manager of its IPO-focused ETFs. ""When the IPO market shuts down for long droughts, the market revives when we see a strong rate of return.""Twilio helped, as the first ""unicorn"" to make an IPO this year. Unicorn is the nickname for privately held companies valued above $1 billion. Twilio now has a market valuation of $3.4 billion.Venture capitalists count more than 150 unicorns in the U.S.There have been a few other biggies.Acacia came public on May 13 at 23 and has rallied sharply since, rising nearly 2% Monday to 65.24. Acacia makes high-speed fiber-optic communications gear.Line priced at 32.75 on July 14 and its shares edged up 0.6% Monday to 39.88. The mobile messaging service raised $1.1 billion, making it the largest tech IPO since Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) roared onto the scene in September 2014, raising $25 billion in history's biggest IPO ever.The IPO market is always on a short leash. Even after a company files for an IPO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the offering doesn't really start to take shape until execs begin a road show to make their formal pitches to institutional investors.How big is the current pipeline of potential IPOs? At first glance, the numbers underwhelm.Just five companies are on a road show now, four biotechs and a provider of wireless networking technology.Four IPOs are scheduled to begin the week of Aug. 8, led by Medpace Holdings. It looks to raise $151 million by offering 7 million shares at a price range of 20 to 23. Medpace provides clinical development services to the biotech field. Displaying characteristics of a good IPO, Medpace is profitable, with revenue growing at a double-digit clip. In the first half of this year, Medpace reports revenue of $205.5 million, up 20%, and net income of $8.4 million. It's scheduled to begin trading Thursday under the ticker MEDP.But the IPO market typically slumbers in August.There are 101 companies in public registration for an IPO, down from 118 at the start of the year.But the decline in registrations doesn't change VC Murphy's outlook.""We think the second half will have significantly more IPOs than the first half, and expect substantially more IPOs in the next 12 months compared with the previous year,"" he said.Murphy says the number of Silicon Valley startups with annual revenue of $50 million to $100 million could be near an all-time high, providing a fertile field of potential IPOs.But whether the successful offerings of Twilio, Acacia, Line and Talend will spark more IPOs is impossible to say. Big-name unicorns Uber, Snapchat, Airbnb and Pinterest are making no IPO noises yet.Renaissance Capital's Smith expects a pickup this year. But she doesn't see 2016 matching the 170 IPOs and $30 billion raised in 2015, which itself was down from the two preceding big IPO years.IPO optimism can fade fast if the economy slumps.""The enemy of a healthy IPO market is uncertainty and volatility,"" said Garvis Toler, global head of capital markets at the New York Stock Exchange. ""We've had some high volatility in the past year, but that's moderated back down to normal levels.""The IPO window is ready to open, ""it's just a matter of when,"" he said. ""People need to perceive that it's a hospitable environment.""Some firms indeed have perceived the climate is right.Two consumer IPOs each raised more than $1 billion in Q2. MGM Growth Properties (MGP), a real estate investment trust spun out of MGM Resorts (MGM), raised $1.05 billion. It priced at 21 in April and was up 1.5% Monday at 26.92.The other was food distributor U.S. Foods (USFD), which raised $1.02 billion. It priced at 23 in late May but is edging closer to that level, trading Monday at 23.62.The first high-profile unicorn that might come public this year is music service Spotify, which has a market valuation of about $8 billion.Another possible brand-name IPO is Jose Cuervo, the world's largest tequila producer, with an estimated market value of $3 billion.Univision Holdings, the largest Spanish-language broadcaster in the U.S., is another possible IPO this year, observers say. It could raise as much as $1 billion. The company was taken private in 2007 in a $12.3 billion leveraged buyout by a group of investors led by Saban Capital Group.Univision postponed plans to make its IPO last year while it waited for more attractive market conditions. That's also true of grocery store chain Albertsons and retailer Neiman Marcus.They might be waiting awhile, says Greg Brogger, CEO of Sharespost. He doesn't expect a big IPO rebound this year. Sharespost connects buyers and sellers of shares in privately held companies and manages the Sharespost 100 Fund, a mutual fund that invests in late-stage, VC-backed companies.""I don't hear anyone thinking there will be a stampede, even if an IPO window opens,"" Brogger said. He says companies will continue to stay private as long as they can, in part to avoid the scrutiny that comes with being public.""The public market is not always a friendly place to be,"" he said. ""The strong private companies will stay private because they can"" as long as they are able to get funding.""I think a shift has happened,"" Brogger said. ""Companies want to stay private longer and get larger, with more predictable earnings, before coming public.""

61,CFG,"Only a few stocks remain on IBD's IPO Leaders screen, a reflection of the difficulties new issues are having in the market correction.Indexes and exchange traded funds (ETFs) tracking new issues aren't doing much better. In fact, investors would be better off picking some of the individual stocks in the screen than using funds.The IBD New Issue index is about 20% off its prior high. This week it touched the lowest level since October 2014. The index, which tracks stocks that went public in the past 15 years, has not fared much better than a couple of ETFs that follow the IPO market.First Trust U.S. IPO Index Fund (FPX) is 23% off its peak, and earlier this week it sank to its lowest level since November 2013, if you exclude the Aug. 24 mini-crash. Renaissance IPO (IPO) is 35% off its high and at all-time lows, excluding Aug. 24.Although both ETFs are flagging, the difference in their top components has affected performance.Renaissance IPO's largest holdings include stocks that have sold off sharply, such as Synchrony Financial (SYF) (nearly 11% of the fund), Alibaba (BABA) (9.8%), Citizens Financial Group (CFG) (8%) and JD.com (JD) (about 5%).  All those stocks are at least 30% below their 52-week highs.First Trust U.S. IPO's top holdings, such as Facebook (FB) (11% of the fund) and Kraft Heinz (KHC) (6.2%), are within 14% of their prior highs. AbbVie (ABBV), another top holding at 9.5%, has swooned 26% and hurt the fund relatively more.Renaissance IPO's top components had their IPOs since 2014. First Trust U.S. IPO has companies that went public farther back. General Motors (GM), certainly no new kid on the block, is on the First Trust portfolio. It started trading again after its reorganization in 2010.Within the IPO Leaders screen, Physicians Realty Trust (DOC) has faltered since it cleared the 17.23 buy point of a cup with handle last month, but shares are just 7% off the prior high.Store Capital (STOR) is near a new high, extended from a breakout past 23.23. Rexford Industrial Realty (REXR) has been trying to break out to new highs. All three stocks are real estate investment trusts, which have fared better as defensive investments.

62,CFG,"Down is never out for hardy chiefs. How they step up: Find bright sides. When something goes wrong at Inland Real Estate Group, it gets talked about — progressively. The firm holds post-mortem meetings to dissect failures.""You don't run from issues. You have to be ready to learn from new developments,"" said CEO Dan Goodwin.Figuring out what went awry helps the team spot creative approaches to market problems.""Your defeat really becomes an opportunity,"" he told IBD. Adjust steering. Real estate doesn't lend itself to quick fixes. ""It's more like a steamship or a cruise liner. It takes a while to turn it around,"" Goodwin said.He credits the firm's diversification — from apartment and commercial retail development to financial products and real estate investment trusts — with keeping Inland buoyant.""We look at new opportunities that come with each stage of the cycle,"" he said. Stay centered. Success builds confidence.""Our company's employees believe we will do well because we've been through different cycles,"" Goodwin said. ""When we see a problem, we know we're going to turn the situation around."" Take action. Bruce Van Saun took the CEO chair at Citizens Financial Group (CFG) in 2013 with a clear directive: Guide the bank through a spinoff from parent company Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS).His strategy?""Act with haste,"" Van Saun said. ""Start to deliver results.""After putting initiatives in place to prepare the bank for its initial public offering, Citizens reduced RBS' controlling interest below 50%.""You not only form a plan; you have to execute well against that plan,"" Van Saun said. ""You start playing offense again."" All hands on deck. To improve operations, Van Saun sought employee input via Project TOP — short for Tapping Our Potential.The program solicited ideas from the firm's 17,700 employees. Of 5,000 responses, 1,200 were accepted for further consideration. The process delivered ground-level insight while building employee buy-in. ""They felt they could have input,"" Van Saun said. Key in. Organizational sea changes can disorient workers. Van Saun recommends prioritizing top concerns: ""Be clear about what really matters. There's no possibility that you can overcommunicate. You need to be visible."" Aspire higher. As organizations weather storms, workers wonder: Now what? Forward-thinking leaders keep an eye on the horizon.""You also need to be ambitious,"" Van Saun said. Pinpoint opportunity. Jason Hart's first priority as CEO of Identiv (INVE) was to help the security technology firm navigate its own waters. When Hart started in 2013, the firm had 37 legal entities and numerous products.""What I really liked about Identiv was the level of creativity,"" he said. ""We needed to channel and focus that creativity."" Concentrate effort.  After a restructuring that trimmed 460 employees to fewer than 300, Hart steered the firm toward security technology products for the Internet of Things.""Everything is connected,"" Hart said. ""Our spin on it is the Internet of secure things,"" he said. Raise a sail. Landing a partnership with marquee client Cisco Systems (CSCO) spoke volumes about the potential of Identiv's approach. ""Our external customers began to look at us with confidence,"" Hart said.

The decision followed pressure applied by hedge fund Jana Partners, which in April announced a more than $2 billion position in Qualcomm.

Michael Corbat, the CEO of Citigroup (C), should be breathing easier, since the New York-based lender passed this year's tests after failing two out of the last three years.

In other words: more payouts for shareholders.The U.S. units of Spain's Banco Santander (SAN) and Germany's Deutsche Bank (DB) failed round 2 of the Fed's stress tests, while the Fed ordered Bank of America  (BAC) to resubmit its capital plan by the end of the third quarter.It's the second straight year Santander failed the test. And the Fed cited ""numerous and significant deficiencies"" in Deutsche Bank's capital planning.Meanwhile, Wells Fargo (WFC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) boosted their dividends and Morgan approved a new buyback plan, joining other banks that received the Fed's OK of their capital plans.Shares of BofA fell 1% late, while Morgan Stanley rose 2% and Wells Fargo edged up 0.1%.The second round of the exams — the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) — is more stringent than round one, the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests (DFAST), because it examines banks' abilities to pay dividends, buy back shares and still serve borrowers during times of severe economic distress.This year, the Fed examined 31 banks, each with assets exceeding $50 billion. All 31 banks passed DFAST last week, which means they met the Fed's minimum capital requirements.

"
120,CFG,"What should investors expect as the stock market enters the final stretch of the year? We asked asset managers to share their outlook and single best ETF idea for the final four months of 2013.
"
121,CFG," Michael Gayed, chief investment strategist of Pension Partners in New York with $260 million in assets under management: SPDR Gold Shares (GLD).
"
122,CFG,"Gold will likely continue its outperformance alongside other precious metals in the fourth quarter for two reasons. First, gold tends to perform well in negative real-rate environments, whereby inflation is higher than nominal interest rates.
"
123,CFG,"Given the behavior of housing stocks and weaker recent housing data, it may become increasingly clear the economy cannot absorb spiking interest rates, which have put us in a positive real-rate environment. That means the Federal Reserve will have to keep stimulus longer than expected, which is gold-friendly, to calm fears over near-term economic head winds resulting from spiking interest rates.
"
124,CFG,"The second major catalyst is India's rupee, which has collapsed since May. Recent actions by the Reserve Bank of India to reverse the decline may help spur demand further in that country because an appreciating currency would make rupee-denominated gold prices cheaper to import. This would increase overall demand for the yellow metal as the RBI fights to save the rupee on behalf of one of the world's largest gold consumers.
"
125,CFG," Bill Krivicich, chief investment officer at Gary Goldberg Financial Services in Suffern, N.Y., with $670 million in assets: SPDR International Consumer Discretionary (IPD).
"
126,CFG,"In Q4, global growth will likely surprise on the upside, and with it high-end consumer spending will rise.
"
127,CFG,"U.S. discretionary consumer spending continues to exceed forecasts. And I expect high-end purchases to pick up around the globe and in Europe as it comes out of recession. The holdings in IPD offer an attractive yield of about 1.75%, a strong earnings growth rate of 18.35% over the past five years and a relatively low price-earnings ratio of 13.5, covering all three of our investment screens.
"
128,CFG,"Top holdings include Daimler (DDAIF), Toyota Motor (TM), and the ultra-high-end retailer LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton  (LVMUY). As the world's larger economies continue to recover and high-end consumers open their wallets just a little bit more than they did last year, consumer discretionary companies are likely to benefit.
"
129,CFG,"The dollar rally is likely to take a pause for several months. Anxiety over rising interest rates and the potential for inflation will likely keep the greenback in a tight trading range, reducing head winds for domestic and international exporters, further boosting earnings of international companies.
"
130,CFG," Mark Eshman, chairman ClearRock Capital, in Sun Valley, Idaho, with $400 million in assets: Vanguard Information Technology (VGT). Technology companies in this index also have amassed billions of dollars in cash. Much of it is earning virtually nothing as interest rates have been exceptionally low. As rates continue to rise, interest income will become a bigger contributor to corporate profits.
"
131,CFG,"Many of yesterday's startups are ready to go public. Companies such as Twitter are widely rumored to be readying for an initial public offering. Companies and bankers alike have learned from Facebook's disastrous IPO and will be ready this go-round. IPO valuations will shine a light on the rest of the tech sector, illuminating its value vs. the broader market.
"
132,CFG,"As the economy continues to strengthen and companies start to unleash their vast cash hoards, they will spend more on capital goods. At the core of this is hardware and software.
"
133,CFG," Rich Winer, president of Winer Wealth Management in Woodland Hills, Calif., with $20 million in assets: First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund (FDN).
"
134,CFG,"FDN invests in a basket of stock market leaders: Google (GOOG), Amazon.com (AMZN), eBay (EBAY), Priceline (PCLN), Facebook (FB), Salesforce.com (CRM), Yahoo (YHOO), LinkedIn (LNKD), Netflix (NFLX) and Juniper Networks (JNPR).
"
135,CFG,"Like it or not, we are dependent on the Internet in nearly every area of our lives, and will only become more dependent. The Internet is the present and the future, and that's where you want to be invested. Nearly all of the stocks in FDN have excellent earnings and growth potential.
"
136,CFG,"However, stocks in the Internet sector can be extremely volatile. While they have the potential to generate high returns, they can also see large losses quickly when their earnings miss Wall Street's expectations or one gets downgraded by a major firm. Having owned Google when it failed to meet Wall Street's views and got slaughtered, I understand as well as anyone the advantage of owning a diversified basket of stocks through an index fund or ETF.
"
137,CFG," Matthew Forester, chief investment officer at CFG Asset Management in Newtown Square, Pa., with $277 million in assets: iShares Floating-Rate Note Fund (FLOT).
"
138,CFG,"With the Fed considering less bond purchasing, raising cash would be a better short-term move than buying bonds.
"
139,CFG,"FLOT will earn you 58 basis points in average yield-to-maturity and with annual management fees of 20 basis points. This rate beats most money market funds and short-term certificate of deposit rates. The bonds inside the fund have an average maturity of only 1.73 years. Floating-rate bonds (floaters) reset their coupons as interest rates rise. If bond rates were to continue their recent trajectory upward, floater coupons would actually increase.
"
140,CFG,"If markets behave as they did during the summer period after the first announcement of potential Fed tapering of bond purchases, then cash and cashlike options will prove tempting. During that period, almost all risk assets went down. Low-yielding but safe alternatives to cash like FLOT may give investors a slightly better way to hunker down for a temporary bout of market fluctuations.What should investors expect as the stock market enters the final stretch of the year?

As rates continue to rise, interest income will become a bigger contributor to corporate profits.Many of yesterday's startups are ready to go public. Companies such as Twitter are widely rumored to be readying for an initial public offering. Companies and bankers alike have learned from Facebook's disastrous IPO and will be ready this go-round. IPO valuations will shine a light on the rest of the tech sector, illuminating its value vs. the broader market.As the economy continues to strengthen and companies start to unleash their vast cash hoards, they will spend more on capital goods. At the core of this is hardware and software. Rich Winer, president of Winer Wealth Management in Woodland Hills, Calif., with $20 million in assets: First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund (FDN).FDN invests in a basket of stock market leaders: Google (GOOG), Amazon.com (AMZN), eBay (EBAY), Priceline (PCLN), Facebook (FB), Salesforce.com (CRM), Yahoo (YHOO), LinkedIn (LNKD), Netflix (NFLX) and Juniper Networks (JNPR).Like it or not, we are dependent on the Internet in nearly every area of our lives, and will only become more dependent. The Internet is the present and the future, and that's where you want to be invested. Nearly all of the stocks in FDN have excellent earnings and growth potential.However, stocks in the Internet sector can be extremely volatile. While they have the potential to generate high returns, they can also see large losses quickly when their earnings miss Wall Street's expectations or one gets downgraded by a major firm. Having owned Google when it failed to meet Wall Street's views and got slaughtered, I understand as well as anyone the advantage of owning a diversified basket of stocks through an index fund or ETF. Matthew Forester, chief investment officer at CFG Asset Management in Newtown Square, Pa., with $277 million in assets: iShares Floating-Rate Note Fund (FLOT).With the Fed considering less bond purchasing, raising cash would be a better short-term move than buying bonds.FLOT will earn you 58 basis points in average yield-to-maturity and with annual management fees of 20 basis points. This rate beats most money market funds and short-term certificate of deposit rates. The bonds inside the fund have an average maturity of only 1.73 years. Floating-rate bonds (floaters) reset their coupons as interest rates rise. If bond rates were to continue their recent trajectory upward, floater coupons would actually increase.If markets behave as they did during the summer period after the first announcement of potential Fed tapering of bond purchases, then cash and cashlike options will prove tempting. During that period, almost all risk assets went down. Low-yielding but safe alternatives to cash like FLOT may give investors a slightly better way to hunker down for a temporary bout of market fluctuations.

142,CFG,"Citizens Financial Group (CFG  -  Free Report) recently launched a fresh digital service — Citizens Access — which will provide the bank’s consumers with a digital platform to directly avail its various banking products and services.  Citizens Financial plans to market its digital bank outside the company’s current market and operate it independently of the bank’s existing retail services.Stating the bank’s objective in developing this online platform, John Rosenfeld, president of Citizens Access, said, “Over the last several years, direct bank deposits have grown six times faster than deposits at traditional banks as consumers have sought innovative new ways to save money. To address these evolving customer needs, we designed Citizens Access to provide an exceptional digital experience where every task is intuitive and easily accomplished, even on a mobile phone.” He further spoke about the differentiated Certificate of Deposits (CD) that Citizens Access will offer its consumers for developing a better savings plan.Citizens Access offers a variety of banking products and services, which include Member FDIC-insured online savings and CD accounts with attractive rates and no fees. One of the key features of the platform is that its users will be able to open and fund a new account instantly, in less than five minutes, by following an easy five-step process. This service can be accessed through CitizensAccess.com.Further, the company described Citizens Access to be safe and secure which can be easily accessed through a mobile device or computer. The platform will also offer a savings tool to consumers that will help them save in different ways. For instance, one of its features will enable users to create a CD ladder which would provide the higher-rates advantage of long-term investments while maintaining liquidity at the same time. Also, consumers will receive electronic copies of all documents.Notably, Citizens Access offers higher deposit rates without charging any kind of fees from its customers, which differentiates it from other digital banks that charge consumers for providing even basic banking services.Rolling out the Citizens Access service is a commendable move by the bank to retain its digital savvy consumers as well as to bring in new ones.  Earlier in 2017 also, Citizens Financial launched various digital services for its consumers such as SpeciFi and Zelle. The bank’s strategy to expand its presence by investing in technology will bear fruit over the long term.Citizens Financial’s shares have gained around 9.6% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 6.2%. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are Banner Corporation (BANR  -  Free Report), First Defiance Financial Corp (FDEF  -  Free Report) and WSFS Financial Corporation (WSFS  -  Free Report).

143,CFG,"When considering valuation metrics, price-to-earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice as calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy. However, price-to-sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development, generating meager or no profits.While a loss-making company with a negative price-to-earnings ratio falls out of investor favor, price-to-sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business. This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company's growth is not overvalued.A stock’s price-to-sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company.If the price-to-sales ratio is 1, it means that investors are paying $1 for every $1 of revenues generated by the company. So, it goes without saying that a stock with a price-to-sales below 1 is a good bargain, as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar’s worth.  Thus, a stock with a lower price-to-sales ratio is a more suitable investment versus a stock with a high price-to-sales ratio.Price-to-sales is often preferred over price-to-earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures. However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable.However, one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low price-to-sales is not an ideal choice. The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point, leading to further share issuance and a rise in market cap and ultimately a higher price-to-sales ratio.In any case, the price-to-sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick. One should also analyze other ratios like Price/Earnings, Price/Book and Debt/Equity before arriving at any investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry: The lower the price-to-sales ratio, the better.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry: The lower, the better.Price to Book (common Equity) less than Median Price to Book for its Industry: This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock.Debt to Equity (Most Recent) less than Median Debt to Equity for its Industry: A company with less debt should have a stable price-to-sales ratio.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are seven of the 21 stocks that qualified the screening:MGM Growth Properties LLC (MGP  -  Free Report) engages in owning, acquiring, and leasing casino resort properties in the United States.

144,CFG,"U.S. markets extended their winning run into the fourth straight session on Wednesday. The primary catalyst for gains was bank stocks. This class of equities surged following a rise in U.S. bond yields. Yields closely mirrored the spike in their European counterparts, following indications that the ECB was preparing to wind down its stimulus program.The jump in U.S. bond yields was not unexpected. A spurt in GDP over the next few quarters is likely to raise inflation and consequently interest rates. A spike in rates increases the yield spread for banks, which in turn boosts their margins. Adding banking stocks to your portfolios looks like a smart option at this point.Bank Stocks Push Benchmarks Higher The Dow surged 300 points to close above 25,000 for the first time since mid-March. Though The Boeing Company’s (BA  -  Free Report) 3.2% increase was the primary reason for the blue-chip index’s gains, bank stocks also contributed their part. Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) increased by 2.3% and 1.7%, respectively.The S&P 500 also gained 0.9% with the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) emerging as the highest gaining sector, increasing 1.9%. Shares of Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) increased 3.2% and 2.2%, respectively. Further, the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) increased 2.1%, enjoying its best day of gains since Mar 26. European Yields Surge as ECB Hints at End of Stimulus On Wednesday, European bond yields spiked following comments from key ECB officials which indicated the central bank was preparing to wind down its asset purchase in the near term. ECB’s chief economist and board member Peter Praet said the bank will deliberate next week as to how to unravel its monthly bond purchases.Praet mentioned that the “underlying strength” of the Eurozone’s economy was providing him with the confidence to predict that inflation would soon near its targeted level. His hawkish colleague at the ECB and president of Bundesbank, Jens Weidmann, said market expectations that bond purchases would cease before the end of the year were “plausible.”Higher Growth to Boost Inflation, Bond YieldsConsequently, U.S. bond yields followed their European counterparts higher. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit 2.98%, marking its highest level since May 24. The increases were not unexpected, given that recent economic data has been more than encouraging. This in turn is likely to boost inflation and consequently, bond yields.Several analysts believe that a 3% pace of growth is already priced into yields. If growth nears 4%, yields are likely to pick up further. This in turn could lead to the Fed raising rates for the fourth time this year. Such an occurrence would not be unwelcome if it takes place against a backdrop of strong growth.Our ChoicesBank stocks have mopped up strong gains whenever yields have moved higher. A spike in European yields was the catalyst on the latest occasion. But domestic factors are also at play and a pickup in growth could spur inflation, boosting yields higher.Adding banking stocks to your portfolio looks like a profitable option at this time. This is because these are likely to benefit from the widening of the yield spread. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM Score.Old Second Bancorp, Inc.

146,CFG,"Warren Buffett once said, “It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.”  The strategy is very simple – find stocks that are trading below their inherent worth.Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. So, chances are high that these stocks will allow investors to book profits when the market trends upward.There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential. Each ratio helps an investor to understand a particular aspect of the company’s business. One such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking, if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis – the lower the number, the better.Why Price to Cash Flow?You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, one of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. Then again, cash flow is quite reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder-friendly moves. On the other hand, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 15 stocks that qualified the screening:Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), which develops, manufactures, and sells data storage devices and solutions, delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 6.2% in the trailing four quarters.

147,CFG,"Riding on higher revenues, Citizens Financial Group (CFG  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.6% in first-quarter 2018. Earnings per share of 78 cents topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents. Also, the reported figure compares favorably with adjusted earnings of 57 cents recorded in prior-year quarter.The company experienced continued expansion of margins and loan growth, which aided higher revenues. Also, higher deposits and lower provisions were some other positives. However, increase in expenses and lower fee income were the main undermining factors.The company reported net income of $388 million compared with $320 million recorded in year- ago quarter.Increase in NII Partially Offset by Higher Expenses and Lower Fee IncomeTotal revenues for the quarter were $1.46 billion, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.47 billion. However, revenues were up 6% year over year.Citizens Financial’s net interest income (NII) increased 9% year over year to $1.09 billion. The rise was primarily attributable to average loan growth and improved margin. In addition, net interest margin expanded 20 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.16%. This was mainly due to higher interest-earning asset yields given balance sheet optimization initiatives and improving loan mix, partly mitigated by increase in funding costs.Also, non-interest income declined 2% to $371 million. The fall was due to lower capital markets fees and other income, partially offset by higher mortgage banking fees, trust and investment services, and card fees.Non-interest expenses were up 3% year over year to $883 million. The increase reflects rise in almost all components, except other expenses.Efficiency ratio declined to 60% in the first quarter from 62% in the prior-year quarter. Generally, lower ratio is indicative of the bank’s improved efficiency.As of Mar 31, 2018, period end total loan and lease balances increased nearly 1% sequentially to $112.2 billion while total deposits increased marginally from the prior quarter to $115.7 billion.Credit Quality Improves As of Mar 31, 2018, net charge-offs for the quarter declined 20% year over year to $70 million. Provision for credit losses fell 19% to $78 million. Additionally, total non-performing loans and leases were down 17% to $868 million.However, allowance for loan and lease losses increased 2% to $1.25 billion on a year-over-year basis.Capital Position Citizens Financial remained well capitalized in the quarter. As of Mar 31, 2018, Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.2%, flat year over year. Further, Tier 1 leverage ratio came in at 10%, up 1 bp from the year-ago quarter.

Notably, including common stock dividends, the company returned $283 million to its shareholders.Our ViewpointResults highlight a decent quarter for Citizens Financial. We are optimistic as the company continues make investments in technology in order to improve its customers’ experience. Further, with a diversified traditional banking platform, Citizens Financial is well poised to benefit from the recovery of economies where it has footprint. However, decline in fee income and elevated expenses remain key concerns.Citizens Financial Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

148,CFG,"Value investing offers an opportunity to enter the market and grab stocks that have otherwise been overlooked by the majority of investors and are thus trading at cheap multiples.Though price to earnings (P/E) and price to sales (P/S) valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use metric for identifying bargain stocks with high-growth prospects.  The P/B ratio compares the market and book value of the company.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityWhat is Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. The higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median:A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median:The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1:PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are six of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:PCM, Inc.

149,CFG,"Value style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we would suggest Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio as one of the key metrics.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that make P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company’s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. On the other hand, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), which develops, manufactures, and sells data storage devices and solutions, delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 6.2% in the trailing four quarters.

150,CFG,"Citizens Financial Group (CFG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 20, before the market opens. The company is expected to witness year-over-year growth in revenues and earnings.Further, Citizens Financial boasts an impressive surprise history. It surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 9.7%.Citizens Financial Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Citizens Financial Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Citizens Financial Group, Inc. QuoteThe Providence, RI-based bank’s organic growth was reflected in fourth-quarter 2017 results, which witnessed continued rise in revenues and lower provisions. Also, the company recorded rise in deposits and improved credit quality.Citizens Financial’s first-quarter results are expected to benefit from rising interest income and balance sheet optimization initiatives. Also, the company’s expense control efforts might lend some support. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings of 76 cents indicates a 24.6% year-over-year improvement.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $1.47 billion for the to-be-reported quarter reflects an improvement of 5.9% from the prior-year quarter.However, the company’s price performance has not been very impressive. Its shares have lost 13.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 6.9%.Will the price performance improve post first-quarter earnings release? Let’s check which factors are expected to impact Citizens Financial’s Q1 earnings.Factors That Might Drive Q1 ResultsHigher Net Interest Income (NII): The first quarter was decent in terms of lending activities and higher interest rates, hence Citizens Financial’s NII is likely to increase. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII of $1.01 billion reflects 7.5% growth year over year.Moreover, estimates for average interest-earning assets of $139 billion reflect a 1.9% increase from the year-ago quarter.Controlled Expenses: Citizens Financial’s expenses are expected to continue declining due to its TOP IV efficiency initiative. Also, its self-funding revenue initiatives might help in lowering the efficiency ratio.Fee Income Might Remain Stable: The quarter witnessed rise in advisory and underwriting fees on the back of higher M&A activities and equity issuances. Nevertheless, debt originations remained low during the quarter and the related fees are expected to remain muted. The consensus estimate for Capital Market Fees of $40 million indicates a 16.7% decline.However, the trend of consumer spending was strong during the quarter, which is likely to provide some support to its top line. The consensus estimate for Trust & Investment Management Fees of $42 million indicates a 7.7% increase.Mortgage Banking Likely to Decline: With the rising interest rate environment, no major help is expected from the mortgage banking segment. As refinancing activities slowed down during the quarter, mortgage banking revenues are not expected to witness much improvement.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, we cannot conclusively predict an earnings beat for Citizens Financial in the upcoming results. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better for this to happen, which is not the case here as elaborated below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Citizens Financial is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: The stock carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.BOK Financial Corporation (BOKF  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.24% and a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). It is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.New York Community Bancorp (NYCB  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Apr 25.

The company is slated to release results on Apr 23.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

151,CFG,"Launched on 07/13/2009, the ProShares Large Cap Core Plus (CSM  -  Free Report) is a smart beta exchange traded fund offering broad exposure to the Hedge Fund ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market.Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor & IndexCSM is managed by Profunds Group, and this fund has amassed over $759.01 M, which makes it the largest ETF in the Hedge Fund ETFs. CSM seeks to match the performance of the Credit Suisse 130/30 Large Cap Index before fees and expenses.The Credit Suisse 130/30 Large-Cap Index is designed to replicate an investment strategy that establishes either long or short positions in certain of the 500 largest U.S. market cap equities by applying a rules-based ranking and weighting methodology detailed below. The design intends to provide an indexed representation of a quantitatively constructed 130/30 U.S. large-cap equity strategy.Cost & Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for CSM are 0.45%, which makes it the least expensive product in the space.It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 1.28%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk, but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.CSM's heaviest allocation is in the Information Technology sector, which is about 18.30% of the portfolio. Its Consumer Discretionary and Financials round out the top three.Performance and RiskCSM has lost about -0.02% so far this year, and as of 04/05/2018, is up about 15.78% in the last one year. In the past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $57.63 and $71.30.The fund has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 13.49% for the trailing three-year period. With about 335 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

152,CFG,"A stock’s Price-to-Sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company.If the Price-to-Sales ratio is 1, it means that investors are paying $1 for every $1 of revenues generated by the company. So, it goes without saying that a stock with Price-to-Sales below 1 is a good bargain, as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar’s worth.  Thus, a stock with a lower Price-to-Sales ratio is a more suitable investment versus a stock with a high Price-to-Sales ratio.When considering valuation metrics, Price-to-Earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice as calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy. However, Price-to-Sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development, generating meager or no profits.Price-to-Sales is often preferred over Price-to-Earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures. However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable.While a loss-making company with a negative Price-to-Earnings ratio falls out of investor favor, its Price-to-Sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business. This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company's growth is not overvalued.However, one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low Price-to-Sales is not an ideal choice. The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point, leading to further share issuance and a rise in market cap and ultimately a higher Price-to-Sales ratio.In any case, the Price-to-Sales ratio used in isolation can’t do the trick. One should also analyze other ratios like Price/Earnings, Price/Book and Debt/Equity before arriving at any investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry: The lower the Price-to-Sales ratio, the better.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry: The lower, the better.Price to Book (common Equity) less than Median Price to Book for its Industry: This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock.Debt to Equity (Most Recent) less than Median Debt to Equity for its Industry: A company with less debt should have a stable Price-to-Sales ratio.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score  less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are seven of the 17 stocks that qualified the screening:Kulicke and Soffa Industries Inc.

153,CFG,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (CFG  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 1.9% in the past month.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock’s next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Citizen Financial Q4 Earnings Beat, Expenses IncreaseRiding on higher revenues, Citizens Financial delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6% in fourth-quarter 2017. Adjusted earnings per share of 71 cents topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents. The figure excludes the impact of after-tax benefit from the sale of a Troubled Debt Restructuring portfolio and  tax reform. Also, the reported figure improved 29% year over year.Continued expansion of margins, which aided increase in revenues, was recorded. Higher deposits and lower provisions were other positives. However, elevated expenses were a headwind.After considering the benefits from notable items, Citizens Financial reported net income of $666 million.For full-year 2017, the company reported net income of $1.64 billion or $3.25 per share compared with $1.03 billion or $1.97 per share in 2016.Increase in Revenues Partially Offset by Higher ExpensesIn 2017, the company reported total revenues of $5.71 billion, which lagged the consensus estimate of $5.98 billion. However, it compares favorably with the year-ago figure of $5.26 billion.Total revenues for the quarter were $1.48 million that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45 million. Also, revenues were up 6.3% year over year.Citizens Financial’s net interest income increased 8.7% from the prior-year quarter to $1.08 billion. The rise was primarily attributable to average loan growth and improved margin. In addition, net interest margin expanded 18 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.08%. This was mainly due to higher interest-earning asset yields given balance sheet optimization initiatives and higher interest rates, partly mitigated by increase in funding costs.Also, non-interest income climbed 6.7% from the year-ago quarter to $404 million. The rise was driven by trust and investment services, capital markets and card fees, partially offset by lower mortgage banking fees.Non-interest expenses increased 5.7% year over year to $898 million. This increase reflects rise in almost all components.Efficiency ratio declined to 61% in the fourth quarter from 62% in the prior-year quarter. Generally, lower ratio is indicative of the bank’s improved efficiency.As of Dec 31, 2017, period end total loan and lease balances remained flat sequentially at $111.3 billion while total deposits increased 1.6% from the prior quarter to $115.1 billion.Credit Quality ImprovesAs of Dec 31, 2017, Aallowance for loan and lease losses remained flat year over year at $1.24 billion. Net charge-offs for the quarter declined 25% from the year-ago quarter to $78 million.Provision for credit losses fell 19% year over year to $83 million. Additionally, total non-performing loans and leases were down 17% year over year to $871 million.Capital Position WeakensCitizens Financial remained well capitalized in the quarter. As of Dec 31, 2017, Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.1% compared with 11.2% at the end of the prior-year quarter. Further, Tier 1 leverage ratio came in at 9.9%, flat with Dec 31, 2016 level. Total Capital ratio was 13.8% compared with 14% in the prior-year quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateAs part of its 2017 Capital Plan, the company repurchased 8.8 million shares during the quarter. Notably, including common stock dividends, it returned $315 million to shareholders. In 2017, it repurchased 22.4 million shares and returned $1.14 billion to common shareholders.Also, the board of directors announced a 22% hike in its common stock dividend to 22 cents per share. The new dividend is payable on Feb 15 to shareholders on record as of Feb 1.OutlookFirst-quarter 2018The company expects 1% sequential loan growth. Also, loan-to-deposit ratio is expected to be about 98%.NIM is expected to expand by five bps sequentially on the back of rate hike in December 2017. NII is likely to decline by $16 million from prior quarter due to day count impact.Non-interest income is anticipated to remain stable or rise modestly with the expectation of seasonal impacts to be offset by capital market strength.Management expects non-interest expenses to rise 3% from the prior-quarter level due to seasonal compensation impacts.Provision expenses are expected to be in the range of $85-$95 million.

154,CFG,"There are several different ways to find value stocks. Among these, the most popular are price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-sales ratio (P/S). However, investors often overlook the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), which though used less often, is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with great returns.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityWhat is Book Value?There are several ways by which book value can be defined. Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s share price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening:General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), a leading global automotive company, has a projected 3–5 year EPS growth rate of 8.37%.

155,CFG,"It’s not easy to find value stocks. Being aware of a company's key financial numbers like earnings per share and sales growth can help investors identify stocks that are trading for less than their worth. However, a proper analysis of the fundamentals with the help of a number of metrics is required to determine whether a stock is a good bargain or not. Though price to earnings (P/E) and price to sales (P/S) valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use metric for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospects.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityWhat is Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately.

156,CFG,"Citizens Financial Group (CFG  -  Free Report) currently displays solid top-line growth and a strong capital position. Also, rising loan and deposits balance acts as a tailwind. However, pending legal issues remain a concern.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 5.4%The Providence, RI-based company remains committed to revamping its profitability through ‘Tapping Our Potential’ (TOP) efficiency initiatives, which aim to enhance revenues and efficiency. In mid-2017 the company had introduced TOP IV Program, which is expected to achieve pre-tax benefit of $95-$110 million by the end of 2018.Further, the company’s capital strength is reflected in its involvement in inorganic growth activities. Recently, Citizens Financial entered into an agreement to acquire Franklin American Mortgage Company, with a motive to strengthen its mortgage banking business. On completion of the deal, the company expects itself to be positioned among the top-15 bank-owned, originators and servicers.Also, Citizens Financial’s capital deployment activities are impressive. It has a share repurchase program of up to $850 million underway. Moreover, the company raised the common stock dividend by 22% in January 2018. On the back of its favorable debt/equity and dividend payout ratios compared with the industry, we expect these activities to be sustainable.However, the company remains exposed to several pending legal hassles. Thus, it is likely to be impacted by high legal costs going forward.Nevertheless, the company has been able to gain analysts’ confidence, over the last 30 days. Its earnings estimates for the current year were revised slightly upward to $3.45.Shares of Citizens Financial have gained 2.9% over the past six months, outperforming the industry’s rally of 1.4%.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

157,CFG,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (CFG  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 1.5% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CFG due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Citizens Financial Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates, Costs UpRiding on higher revenues, Citizens Financial delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.6% in first-quarter 2018. Earnings per share of 78 cents topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents. Also, the reported figure compares favorably with adjusted earnings of 57 cents recorded in prior-year quarter.The company experienced continued expansion of margins and loan growth, which aided higher revenues. Also, higher deposits and lower provisions were some other positives. However, increase in expenses and lower fee income were the main undermining factors.The company reported net income of $388 million compared with $320 million recorded in year- ago quarter.Increase in NII Partially Offset by Higher Expenses and Lower Fee IncomeTotal revenues for the quarter were $1.46 billion, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.47 billion. However, revenues were up 6% year over year.Citizens Financial’s net interest income (NII) increased 9% year over year to $1.09 billion. The rise was primarily attributable to average loan growth and improved margin. In addition, net interest margin expanded 20 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.16%. This was mainly due to higher interest-earning asset yields, given balance sheet optimization initiatives and improving loan mix, partly mitigated by increase in funding costs.However, non-interest income declined 2% to $371 million. The fall was due to lower capital markets fees and other income, partially offset by higher mortgage banking fees, trust and investment services, and card fees.Non-interest expenses were up 3% year over year to $883 million. The increase reflects rise in almost all components, except other expenses.Efficiency ratio declined to 60% in the first quarter from 62% in the prior-year quarter. Generally, lower ratio is indicative of the bank’s improved efficiency.As of Mar 31, 2018, period-end total loan and lease balances increased nearly 1% sequentially to $112.2 billion while total deposits increased marginally to $115.7 billion.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAs of Mar 31, 2018, net charge-offs for the quarter declined 20% year over year to $70 million. Provision for credit losses fell 19% to $78 million. Additionally, total non-performing loans and leases were down 17% to $868 million.However, allowance for loan and lease losses increased 2% to $1.25 billion on a year-over-year basis.Capital Position Citizens Financial remained well capitalized in the quarter. As of Mar 31, 2018, Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.2%, flat year over year. Tier 1 leverage ratio came in at 10%, up 1 bp from the year-ago quarter. Total Capital ratio was 13.9% compared with 14% in the prior-year quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateAs part of its 2017 Capital Plan, the company repurchased 3.9 million shares during the quarter. Notably, including common stock dividends, the company returned $283 million to its shareholders.OutlookSecond-Quarter 2018The company expects 1.5% sequential average loan growth. Also, average loan-to-deposit ratio is expected to be about 98%.NIM is expected to expand modestly on a sequential basis on the back of higher interest rates, partially offset by modest curve flattening.Non-interest income is anticipated to increase 5% sequentially with benefit from rebound in capital markets.Management expects non-interest expenses to remain stable sequentially. It also expects to achieve positive operating leverage and improvement in efficiency ratio.Provision expenses are expected to be in the range of $80-$90 million. The tax rate is expected to be nearly 23%.Further, at the end of the first quarter, Basel III common equity tier 1 ratio is estimated to be 11.2%.Full-year 2018Average loans are expected to grow in the range of 4.5-5.5% while average deposit growth is expected to be between 4.5-6%.

158,CFG,"Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 57 cents beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents. The adjusted figure excludes the net positive impact of gains from the Vantiv merger with WorldPay and charges related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap and adjustment to litigation reserves.Results reflect increase in revenues along with significant decline in provisions. Expanding net interest margin and rising loans balance remain key positives. Strong capital position acted as a tailwind. However, increase in expenses was an undermining factor.Net income available to common shareholders came in at $689 million or 97 cents per share compared with $290 million or 38 cents per share as of Mar 31, 2017.Higher Revenues Partly Offset by Rise in Expenses Total adjusted revenues for the quarter came in at $1.55 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The reported figure was up 5.2% year over year.Fifth Third’s net interest income (tax equivalent) came in at $999 million, up 6% year over year. The rise was primarily driven by higher short-term market rates and an increase in investment portfolio balances.Net interest margin expanded 16 basis points (bps) to 3.18%, mainly due to improved short-term market rates.However, non-interest income increased 74% year over year to $909 million (including certain non-recurring items). Excluding significant items, non-interest income was up 3% to $553 million. Notably, the quarter witnessed a rise in corporate banking, card and processing fees and mortgage banking revenues.Also, non-interest expenses climbed 6% year over year to $1.05 billion. Higher compensation expenses, technology and equipment expenses were offset by lower card processing expenses.As of Mar 31, 2018, average loan and lease balances were almost stable sequentially at $92.3 billion. Average total deposits increased slightly from the previous quarter to $103.5 billion.Credit Quality ImprovesTotal non-performing assets, including loans held for sale, were $528 million, down 27.7% from the year-ago quarter. Further, total allowance for credit losses was $1.29 billion, down 7.7% from the prior-year quarter.Moreover, provision for loan and lease losses decreased 69% year over year to $23 million. Net losses charge-offs for the quarter came in at $81 million or 36 bps of average loans and leases on an annualized basis compared with $89 million or 40 bps in the prior-year quarter.Strong Capital PositionFifth Third remained well capitalized in the quarter. Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.95% compared with 11.90% at the end of the prior-year quarter. CET1 capital ratio (fully phased-in) was 10.82% compared with 10.76% at the end of the year-ago quarter. However, tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.11% compared with 10.15% in the prior-year quarter.Our ViewpointFifth Third’s first-quarter results were impressive. Its revenues continue to get support from growing easing pressure on NIM. Also, steady improvement in loan balance highlights its efficient organic growth strategy. Significant decline in provisions was another tailwind.Further, the company’s strong balance sheet might drive results in the upcoming quarters with support from lower tax rate and improving economic conditions. However, increasing expenses deter bottom-line growth to some extent.Fifth Third carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

160,CFG,"Investors always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks. But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless you are blessed with Midas touch.When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. So, the chance of outperformance is high when the market moves higher.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we would recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better.Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial HealthQuestions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.What’s the Optimum Strategy?However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account price-to-book, price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should give you even better results as they eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.  Here are four of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening:Cosan Limited (CZZ  -  Free Report) is engaged in fuel and natural gas distribution, logistics, lubricant, sugar and ethanol, and fuel businesses.

162,CFG,"Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 52 cents beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents. The adjusted figure excludes the impact of tax legislation, gain on the sale of Vantiv shares and charge related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap.Results reflect increase in net interest income with strong capital position as a tailwind. However, lower non-interest income and increase in provisions for loan losses were the undermining factors.After considering the impact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and non-recurring items, net income available to common shareholders came in at $486 million or 67 cents per share compared with $372 million or 49 cents per share as of Dec 31, 2016.For full-year 2017, Fifth third reported net income available to common shareholders of $2.1 billion or $2.83 per share compared with $1.5 billion or $1.93 per share as of Dec 31, 2016.Lower Non-Interest Income Hurts Revenues, Expenses RiseFor 2017, the company reported revenues of $7.05 billion, up 11% on a year-over-year basis. The top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.09 billion.Total adjusted revenues for the quarter came in at $1.55 billion, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.58 billion. However, the reported figure was up 1.4% year over year.Fifth Third’s net interest income (tax equivalent) came in at $963 million, up 6% year over year. The rise was primarily driven by higher short-term market rates.Net interest margin expanded 16 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.02%, mainly due to improved short-term market rates and a positive impact from the estimated card refund charge.However, non-interest income decreased 7% year over year to $577 million (including certain non-recurring items). Excluding significant items, non-interest income was down 3% year over year to $587 million. Notably, the quarter witnessed a fall in corporate and mortgage banking revenues.Also, non-interest expenses climbed 12% year over year to $1.07 billion. Higher salaries, wages and incentives were offset by lower other expenses.As of Dec 31, 2017, average loan and lease balances were almost stable sequentially at $92.3 billion. Average total deposits increased 1% from the previous quarter to $102.8 billion.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagTotal non-performing assets, including loans held for sale, were $495 million, down 34.1% from the year-ago quarter. Further, total allowance for credit losses was $1.34 billion, down 4% from the prior-year quarter.However, provision for loan and lease losses increased 24% year over year to $67 million. Net losses charge-offs for the quarter came in at $76 million or 33 bps of average loans and leases on an annualized basis compared with $73 million or 31 bps in the prior-year quarter.Strong Capital PositionFifth Third remained well capitalized in the quarter. Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.74% compared with 11.50% at the end of the prior-year quarter. CET1 capital ratio (fully phased-in) was 10.61% compared with 10.39% at the end of the year-ago quarter. Also, tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.01% compared with 9.90% in the prior-year quarter.Our ViewpointFifth Third’s fourth-quarter results were decent. Its revenues continue to get support from growing net interest income and easing pressure on NIM. Also, steady improvement in loan balance highlights its efficient organic growth strategy. Further, the company’s strong balance sheet might drive results in the upcoming quarters with support from lower tax rate and improving economic conditions.However, declining fee income due to poor mortgage banking activities remains a concern. Deteriorating credit quality is another headwind.Fifth Third carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

163,CFG,"When considering valuation metrics, Price-to-Earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice as calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy. However, Price-to-Sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development, generating meager or no profits.A stock’s Price-to-Sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company.If the Price-to-Sales ratio is 1, it means that investors are paying $1 for every $1 of revenues generated by the company. So, it goes without saying that a stock with Price-to-Sales below 1 is a good bargain, as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar’s worth.  Thus, a stock with a lower Price-to-Sales ratio is a more suitable investment versus a stock with a high Price-to-Sales ratio.Price-to-Sales is often preferred over Price-to-Earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures. However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable.While a loss-making company with a negative Price-to-Earnings ratio falls out of investor favor, its Price-to-Sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business. This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company's growth is not overvalued.However, one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low Price-to-Sales is not an ideal choice. The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point, leading to further share issuance and a rise in market cap and ultimately a higher Price-to-Sales ratio.In any case, the Price-to-Sales ratio used in isolation can’t do the trick. One should also analyze other ratios like Price/Earnings, Price/Book and Debt/Equity before arriving at any investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry: The lower the Price-to-Sales ratio, the better.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry: The lower, the better.Price to Book (common Equity) less than Median Price to Book for its Industry: This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock.Debt to Equity (Most Recent) less than Median Debt to Equity for its Industry: A company with less debt should have a stable Price-to-Sales ratio.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are seven of the 29 stocks that qualified the screening:Shoe Carnival Inc. (SCVL  -  Free Report) is a family footwear retailer in the United States.

164,CFG,"Shares of Webster Financial (WBS  -  Free Report) gained around 1% following its fourth-quarter 2017 earnings release. Adjusted earnings per share of 71 cents compared favorably with 60 cents earned in the prior-year quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings was 67 cents.Results reflected growth in revenues. Also, loan and deposit balances showed continued improvement along with a strong capital position. However, lower fee income and higher non-interest expenses were the undermining factors.After considering the net benefit of $7.8 million from tax legislation, net income available to shareholders for the fourth quarter came in at $69.9 million, up 21.2% year over year.For full-year 2017, Webster Financial reported net income available to common shareholders of $255.4 million or $2.67 per share compared with $198.4 million or $2.16 per share as of Dec 31, 2016.Revenue Growth Offsets Higher ExpensesWebster Financial’s total revenues in the quarter rose 5.9% from the prior-year quarter to $271 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $272 million.For 2017, the company reported revenues of $1.06 billion, up 7.4% on a year-over-year basis.Net interest income grew 10.6% year over year to $204.9 million. Moreover, net interest margin increased 22 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 3.33%.Non-interest income was around $66 million, down nearly 6.5% year over year. The decline was primarily prompted by a fall in mortgage banking activities along with other income. These were, however, partially offset by higher deposit service fees and wealth and investment fees.Non-interest expenses of $161.8 million climbed 3.7% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was mainly due to higher compensation and benefits expenses, technology and equipment along with other expenses, partially offset by a fall in marketing and occupancy costs.Efficiency ratio came in at 59.48% compared with 63.13% as of Dec 31, 2017. A lower ratio indicates improved profitability.   The company’s total loans and leases as of Dec 31, 2017 were $17.5 billion, up slightly sequentially. Further total deposits rose marginally from the prior month to $21 billion.  Credit Quality DeterioratesThe ratio of net charge-offs to annualized average loans came in at 0.34%, up 19 bps from the prior-year quarter.

166,CFG,"Friday, January 19, 2018For this column, even though there is a chance the U.S. government may shut down today, we will not wade into those waters at this time. Instead, we will let D.C. be D.C. After all, even if the government does shut down, it doesn’t take away the positive results we’ve seen overall so far in Q4 earnings season.Yesterday after the bell we saw good Q4 headlines from companies of diverse industries, from Big Tech play IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) to Transportation’s Canadian Pacific (CP  -  Free Report). Although the devil is in the details for IBM in the quarter just passed, we still see beats on the top and bottom lines and growth year over year.Another transportation firm, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), has this morning topped the Zacks consensus earnings estimate by 2 cents to $1.38 per share. The railway major narrowly missed the analyst consensus on quarterly revenues, however, to $660.4 million. Operation income was up in the quarter, though operating ratio was slightly down year over year.

168,CFG,"When considering valuation metrics, the obvious choice has always been Price-to-Earnings ratio as calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy. However, Price-to-Sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development, generating meager or no profits.Though a loss-making company with a negative Price-to-Earnings ratio falls out of investors’ favor, its Price-to-Sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business. This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company's growth is not overvalued.Price-to-Sales is often preferred over Price-to-Earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures. However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable.A stock’s Price-to-Sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company.If the Price-to-Sales ratio is 1, it means that investors are paying $1 for every $1 of revenues generated by the company. So it goes without saying that a stock with Price-to-Sales below 1 is a good bargain, as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar’s worth.   Thus, a stock with a lower Price-to-Sales ratio is more suitable for investment versus a stock with a high Price-to-Sales ratio.However, one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low Price-to-Sales is not an ideal choice. The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point, leading to further share issuance and a rise in market cap and ultimately a higher Price-to-Sales ratio.In any case, the Price-to-Sales ratio used in isolation can’t do the trick. One should also analyze other ratios like Price/Earnings, Price/Book, and Debt/Equity before arriving at any investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry: The lower the Price-to-Sales ratio, the better.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry: The lower, the better.Price to Book (common Equity) less than Median Price to Book for its Industry: This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock.Debt to Equity (Most Recent) less than Median Debt to Equity for its Industry: A company with less debt should have a stable Price-to-Sales ratio.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are seven of the 26 stocks that qualified the screening:Magna International Inc. (MGA  -  Free Report) is a leading manufacturer and supplier of automotive components.

169,CFG,"Given the run-up in stocks in the New Year, the importance of value investing has risen considerably. Value investors have, over the years, preferred price-to-earnings ratio or P/E as a means to identify value stocks. However, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), though used less often, is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with great returns.This article focuses on the Price-to-Book ratio for finding great stocks at great values.The P/B is simply the ratio of stock price to book valueIt is calculated as given below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityWhat is Book Value?There are several ways by which book value can be defined. Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s share price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Dean Foods Company (DF  -  Free Report), a leading processor and distributor of milk and other dairy products in the United States, has a Zacks Rank #2.

170,CFG,"Price-to-earnings (P/E), without a shadow of a doubt, is the most popular metric used by investors to handpick stocks that are trading at a discount. A widely favored approach by value investors is to chase for stocks that have a low P/E ratio. However, even this broadly used valuation multiple is not without its shortcomings.EV/EBITDA is a Better Approach, But Why?While P/E enjoys huge popularity in the value investing world, a more complicated metric called EV/EBITDA gains an upper hand as it offers a clearer image of a firm’s valuation and earnings potential. EV/EBITDA, also referred to as enterprise multiple, determines the total value of a firm while P/E just considers its equity portion.EV/EBITDA is the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company’s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents.EBITDA, the other component of the multiple, is a true reflection of a company’s profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings.Usually, the lower the EV/EBITDA ratio, the more enticing it is. A low EV/EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued.  EV/EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company’s balance sheet that P/E ratio does not. Given this reason, EV/EBITDA is typically used to value potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume. Stocks with a low EV/EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.Another downside of P/E is that it can’t be used to value a loss-making firm. Moreover, a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. In contrast, EV/EBITDA is less open to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are EBITDA-positive.EV/EBITDA is also a useful yardstick in assessing the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. It also can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.However, EV/EBITDA has its limitations too. It varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements.Hence, a strategy entirely based on EV/EBITDA might not fetch the desired results. But you can combine it with other major ratios such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to screen value stocks. Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for bargain stocks:EV/EBITDA 12 Months-Most Recent less than X-Industry Median: A lower EV/EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation.P/E using (F1) less than X-Industry Median: This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers.P/B less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued.P/S less than X-Industry Median: The lower the P/S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proven its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 13 stocks that passed the screen:Synnex Corporation (SNX  -  Free Report) is a business process services company, providing a range of distribution, logistics and integration services for the technology industry.

171,CFG,"Value style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we would suggest Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio as one of the key metrics.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that make P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company’s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. On the other hand, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are four of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening:Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), which develops, manufactures, and sells data storage devices and solutions, delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 6.4% in the trailing four quarters.

172,CFG,"A stock scaling a 52-week high level is considered a winner. The level works as an indicator for many investors for buying or selling the stock.More often than not, investors wonder if the high price range has made the stock overpriced. While the apprehensions are not completely groundless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily high-priced.In fact, in an attempt to avoid stocks that are trading near their 52-week high levels, an investor might miss out on top gainers.A stock can continue the momentum and keep scaling new highs with time. Hence a more informed approach for understanding if any further upside is left is beneficial in these cases.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks:Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on the catchphrase “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a time, stocks hitting 52-week high levels are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors, who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors’ special attention (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them achieve the level. But that doesn’t always mean an impending decline. The factors — robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions — that motivated investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Setting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring continuation of their rally for some time.Current Price/52 Week High >= .80This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.% Change Price – 4 Weeks > 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks > 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales <= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate <= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) >= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry.

174,CFG,"For this column, even though there is a chance the U.S. government may shut down today, we will not wade into those waters at this time. Instead, we will let D.C. be D.C. After all, even if the government does shut down, it doesn’t take away the positive results we’ve seen overall so far in Q4 earnings season.Yesterday after the bell we saw good Q4 headlines from companies of diverse industries, from Big Tech play IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) to Transportation’s Canadian Pacific (CP  -  Free Report). Although the devil is in the details for IBM in the quarter just passed, we still see beats on the top and bottom lines and growth year over year.Another transportation firm, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), has this morning topped the Zacks consensus earnings estimate by 2 cents to $1.38 per share. The railway major narrowly missed the analyst consensus on quarterly revenues, however, to $660.4 million. Operation income was up in the quarter, though operating ratio was slightly down year over year. For more on KSU’s earnings, click here.Oil services giant Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report) beat estimates on its top and bottom line ahead of today’s opening bell: 48 cents per share on $8.18 billion in revenues outpaced the 44 cents per share and $8.12 billion expected, respectively.

175,CFG,"Value investors have, over the years, preferred price-to-earnings ratio or P/E as a means to identify value stocks. However, in case of loss-making companies that have a negative Price-to-Earnings ratio, the Price-to-Sales or P/S ratio is considered in determining their true value.However, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), though used less often, is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with great returns.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityNow let us understand the concept of book value.What is Book Value?There are several ways by which book value can be defined. Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s share price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has a bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report), an automotive, financial services and mobility company, has a Zacks Rank #2.

176,CFG,"“It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.” – Warren Buffett. The strategy is very simple – find stocks that are trading below their inherent worth.Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. So chances are high that these stocks will allow investors to book profits when the market trends upward.There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential. Each ratio helps an investor to understand a particular aspect of the company’s business. One such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking, if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis – the lower the number, the better.Why Price to Cash Flow?You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, one of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. Then again, cash flow is quite reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder-friendly moves. On the other hand, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are four of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), which develops, manufactures, and sells data storage devices and solutions, delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 8.4% in the trailing four quarters.

177,CFG,"A stock hitting a 52-week high is perceived a winner. This works as an indicator for many investors for buying or selling the stock.More often than not, investors wonder if the high price range has made the stock highly expensive. Though the fears are not completely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not overpriced.In fact, a decision to avoid stocks that are trading near their 52-week high levels makes an investor miss out on most of the top gainers.A stock can continue the momentum and keep scaling new highs with time. So, one should take a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks:Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on the catchphrase “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a times, stocks hitting 52-week high levels are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors, who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks, as investors’ special attention (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them achieve the level. But that doesn’t always mean an impending decline. The factors — robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions — that motivated investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Setting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring continuation of their rally for some time.Current Price/52 Week High >= .80This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.% Change Price – 4 Weeks > 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks > 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales <= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate <= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) >= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank = 1No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market.

178,CFG,"Though Price-to-Earnings is the first thing to cross one’s mind while using valuation metrics, Price-to-Sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development, generating meager or no profits.While a loss-making company with a negative Price-to-Earnings ratio falls out of investor favor, its Price-to-Sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business. This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company's growth is not overvalued.A stock’s Price-to-Sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company.If the Price-to-Sales ratio is 1, it means that investors are paying $1 for every $1 of revenues generated by the company. So, it goes without saying that a stock with Price-to-Sales below 1 is a good bargain, as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar’s worth.  Thus, a stock with a lower Price-to-Sales ratio is more suitable for investment versus a stock with a high Price-to-Sales ratio.Price-to-Sales is often preferred over Price-to-Earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures. However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable.However, one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low Price-to-Sales is not an ideal choice. The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point, leading to further share issuance and a rise in market cap and ultimately a higher Price-to-Sales ratio.In any case, the Price-to-Sales ratio used in isolation can’t do the trick. One should also analyze other ratios like Price/Earnings, Price/Book and Debt/Equity before arriving at any investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry: The lower the Price-to-Sales ratio, the better.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry: The lower, the better.Price to Book (common Equity) less than Median Price to Book for its Industry: This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock.Debt to Equity (Most Recent) less than Median Debt to Equity for its Industry: A company with less debt should have a stable Price-to-Sales ratio.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are seven of the 26 stocks that qualified the screening:The Greenbrier Companies, Inc.

Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s economic net income surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, driven by a significant rise in revenues, which was partially offset by higher expenses.Blackstone also boasts an impressive earnings surprise history, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 12.1%.These, along with fundamentals, helped Blackstone’s shares gain nearly 27.7% year to date, outperforming the Zacks categorized Financial - Investment Management industry’s growth of 18.3%.The Blackstone Group L.P.

This will lead to stable or improving fee income for the company.Also, Blackstone continues to expand its investment activity to capitalize on public market dislocation and should report higher deployment of capital during the quarter.However, Blackstone’s activities during the quarter failed to win analysts’ confidence.

181,CFG,"Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20, after the market closes. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, a decline in non-interest income, an increase in provisions and higher expenses were responsible for Capital One lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, higher net interest income (NII) and easing margin pressure supported the results to quite an extent.Also, the company does not have an impressive earnings surprise history, as it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 4.9%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.90 for the to-be-reported quarter has also been revised more than 1% downward in the last 30 days.The price performance of the company has also been disappointing. Capital One’s shares fell 6.5% year to date compared with the Zacks categorized Financial - Consumer Loans industry’s decline of 4.6%.Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Capital One Financial Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, chances of Capital One beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter are quite low. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. But, this is not the case here as elaborated below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Capital One is -1.58%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.87 is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.90.Zacks Rank: Capital One currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which reduces the predictive power of ESP.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsStable Revenues: A decent increase in commercial and credit card loans in the quarter should led to a rise in Capital One’s net interest income. Also, higher rates are expected to support the company’s NII to some extent.However, as the performance of the auto industry remained relatively weak, the company may witness a slightly weaker demand for auto loans. Hence, overall revenues are likely to remain more or less stable.Marginal Increase in Expenses: With moderate improvement in loan balances, marketing expenses are anticipated to rise slightly.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

182,CFG,"SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 21, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Driven by an increase in revenues, SunTrust’s first-quarter earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, an increase in provision for credit losses and higher operating expenses were the undermining factors.However, the company’s business activities and prospects failed to encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates recently. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents for the just-concluded quarter remained stable over the last 30 days.Nevertheless, SunTrust boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 2.6%.The company’s price performance has not been very impressive though.

QuoteBefore delving deeper into the factors that are likely to impact the results, let’s check what our quantitative model predicts.A Positive Surprise in Store?According to our quantitative model, chances of SunTrust beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are high.

This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 99 cents is more than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents.Zacks Rank: SunTrust currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the chances of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsExpected Increase in Net Interest Income (NII): Rising interest rates along with a modest improvement in loan demand in the quarter might have lead to a marginal increase in NII. Especially, the company might have experienced a positive impact of the Mar 2017 rate hike on its margin. Some support is also expected from the June rate hike.The company expects net interest margin to increase 1–2 bps in second-quarter 2017.Modest Improvement in Non-Interest Income: SunTrust’s non-interest income should show some improvement, driven by better investment banking activities during the quarter.Expenses to Decline Slightly: The company’s initiatives to consolidate its branch networks should translate into marginal expense reduction.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

183,CFG,"Price-to-book ratio or P/B ratio is essentially the ratio of stock price to book value, i.e. how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share.In value investing, it is a common practice to pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally strong. There are a number of investment styles for finding great stocks at attractive values.While considering valuation metrics, though price-to-earnings and price-to-sales are the first choices, the P/B ratio is also emerging as a convenient tool for identifying low-priced stocks that have high-growth prospects.Here’s the formula of P/B ratio:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.What is Book Value?There are several ways by which book value can be defined. It is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this would equate to common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value.Understanding the P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s share price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has a bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five stocks that qualified the screening:Tower International, Inc. (TOWR  -  Free Report), a global manufacturer of engineered automotive structural metal, has a projected 3–5 year EPS growth rate of 10%.

184,CFG,"Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 48 cents in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The adjusted figure excludes the impact of gain on the sale of Vantiv shares and charge related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap.Results were driven by an increase in net interest income and lower provisions. Also, improved credit quality and stable expenses were the tailwinds. However, lower non-interest income was an undermining factor.After considering the non-recurring items, net income available to common shareholders came in at $999 million or $1.35 per share compared with $501 million or 65 cents per share as of Sep 30, 2016.Lower Non-Interest Income Hurts Revenues, Expenses FlatTotal adjusted revenues for the quarter came in at $1.55 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Fifth Third’s net interest income (tax equivalent) came in at $977 million, up 7% year over year. The rise was primarily driven by higher short-term market rates.Net interest margin expanded 19 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.07%, mainly due to improved short-term market rates.Non-interest income increased 86% year over year to $1.56 billion (including certain non-recurring items). Excluding significant items, non-interest income was down 4% year over year to $571 million. Notably, the quarter witnessed a fall in corporate banking revenues and service charges on deposits.However, non-interest expenses remained flat year over year at $975 million. Higher salaries, wages and incentives were offset by lower other expenses.As of Sep 30, 2017, average loan and lease balances were almost stable sequentially at $91.9 billion. Average total deposits declined 1% from the previous quarter to $101.8 billion.Credit Quality ImprovesProvision for loan and lease losses declined 16% year over year to $67 million. Net losses charge-offs for the quarter came in at $68 million or 29 bps of average loans and leases on an annualized basis compared with $107 million or 45 bps in the prior-year quarter.Total non-performing assets, including loans held for sale, were $575 million, down 28% from the year-ago quarter. Total allowance for credit losses was $1.36 billion, down 5% from the prior-year quarter.Strong Capital PositionFifth Third remained well capitalized in the quarter. Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.72% compared with 11.27% at the end of the prior-year quarter. CET1 capital ratio (fully phased-in) was 10.47% compared with 10.09% at the end of the year-ago quarter. Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.97% compared with 9.80% in the prior-year quarter.Our ViewpointFifth Third’s third-quarter results were decent. Its revenues continue to get support from growing net interest income and easing pressure on NIM. Also, steady improvement in loan balance highlights its efficient organic growth strategy. Further, the company’s improving credit quality and strong balance sheet might drive better results in the upcoming quarters.Fifth Third currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

186,CFG,"A stock’s Price-to-Sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company.If the Price-to-Sales ratio is 1, it means that investors are paying $1 for every $1 of revenues generated by the company. So, it goes without saying that a stock with Price-to-Sales below 1 is a good bargain, as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar’s worth.  Thus, a stock with a lower Price-to-Sales ratio is more suitable for investment versus a stock with a high Price-to-Sales ratio.When considering valuation metrics, the obvious choice has always been Price-to-Earnings ratio as calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy. However, Price-to-Sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development, generating meager or no profits.Price-to-Sales is often preferred over Price-to-Earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures. However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable.While a loss-making company with a negative Price-to-Earnings ratio falls out of investor favor, its Price-to-Sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business. This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company's growth is not overvalued.However, one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low Price-to-Sales is not an ideal choice. The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point, leading to further share issuance and a rise in market cap and ultimately a higher Price-to-Sales ratio.In any case, the Price-to-Sales ratio used in isolation can’t do the trick. One should also analyze other ratios like Price/Earnings, Price/Book and Debt/Equity before arriving at any investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry: The lower the Price-to-Sales ratio, the better.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry: The lower, the better.Price to Book (common Equity) less than Median Price to Book for its Industry: This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock.Debt to Equity (Most Recent) less than Median Debt to Equity for its Industry: A company with less debt should have a stable Price-to-Sales ratio.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are seven of the 25 stocks that qualified the screening:Del Frisco's Restaurant Group, Inc.

Price and EPS Surprise Citizens Financial Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Citizens Financial Group, Inc. QuoteWill the rally in stock price continue post second-quarter earnings release? It majorly depends on whether the firm is able to maintain its earnings beat trend.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Citizens Financial has the right combination of two key ingredients – positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better – to increase the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +1.70%. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Citizens Financial’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Drive Better-than-Expected ResultsLoan Growth: Though the quarter witnessed slow loan growth due to lack of any tangible progress on the regulatory reform front, slight growth in the loan balances can be expected due to the optimism prevailing in the market. Further, management expects loan growth to be modest on a sequential basis.Pressure on Net Interest Margin (NIM) Might Ease: The latest hike in interest rates might be successful in easing some margin pressure. However, the contraction in the three-month/10-year Treasury spread might offset some benefits.Controlled Expenses: Expenses in the second quarter are usually affected seasonally by personnel/benefits related expenses and variable compensation related to mortgage banking activity. However, it is likely that Citizens Financial’s cost base will remain controlled due to its TOP III Efficiency initiatives.Fee Income to Decline: Fee income might decline in the second quarter as a higher interest rate environment is likely to dampen mortgage banking business. However, improved capital markets are anticipated to be a favorable factor.Activities of Citizens Financial during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained unchanged at 59 cents over the last seven days.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.Lazard Ltd.

188,CFG,"KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, revenue synergies from the First Niagara deal (completed in Aug 2016) and lower provision for credit losses helped KeyCorp outpace the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, higher operating expenses were a headwind.Analysts seem to be optimistic about KeyCorp’s prospects as the company’s second-quarter earnings estimates increased 3% in the last 30 days. The company boasts a decent earnings surprise history, delivering an average beat of 2.1% in the trailing four quarters.KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise  KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise | KeyCorp QuoteDriven by the strong fundamentals, the company’s share price increased 5.4% in the three months ended Jun 30, 2017, outperforming the Zacks categorized Major Banks industry’s rally of 4%.Will the stock’s rally continue post second-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Our proven model doesn’t conclusively predict that KeyCorp will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate as it does not have right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for KeyCorp is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 34 cents.Zacks Rank: KeyCorp has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsImproving rates should support net interest income (NII) growth: During the quarter, loan demand improved moderately. Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the second quarter. Both commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans are anticipated to increase, while consumer loans might fall. This, coupled with higher interest rates should lead to NII growth.Modest non-interest income growth: We believe KeyCorp’s second-quarter non-interest income will be positively impacted by increasing investment banking income, driven by slightly higher debt placement fees. However, mortgage production is expected to be relatively weak during the quarter.Decline in expenses should support profitability: KeyCorp has been consistently streamlining operations, diversifying products and exiting unprofitable/non-core businesses. This is expected to keep overall expenses (excluding merger related charges) manageable. Also, management expects cost savings from the Fist Niagara deal to support bottom line marginally.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming announcements.Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

190,CFG,"You must have braced yourself for a rate hike, if you have followed the tide. As widely expected, the Federal Reserve raised the benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point for the third time this year to a range of 1.25-1.5%. This clearly signals that the economy is in good health with inflation gradually crawling toward the desired 2% target and job market remaining robust. Together, these have set the stage for a rate hike.The policy makers had trimmed the rate at a time when the economy had slipped into recession, and since then it has been treading cautiously and considering all the economic aspects before arriving at a decision over the rate hike. This is the fifth time that the Fed officials have raised the interest rate, since the financial crisis.The Fed, who have chalked out a detailed plan to shrink $4.5 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, continue to advocate three more hikes next year on expectations of strengthening job market. We noted that the U.S. economy added a robust 228,000 jobs in November, while the unemployment rate continues to hover around at its 17-year low rate of 4.1%.The Chairperson expects the unemployment rate to be around the current level at the end of 2017 but anticipates the same to dip 20 basis points to 3.9% in 2018. Industry experts believe that the labor market is likely to get a major boost from Trump’s tax reform policy. The new tax code once implemented will lower the burden of corporates, spur domestic investments and stimulate economic growth.Janet Yellen, whose term ends in February, pointed that any rational tax reform that triggers economic activities, helps create jobs and increase wages are always welcome. The Fed now envisions economy to grow at a rate of 2.5% in both 2017 and 2018, up from its previous forecast of 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively.Certainly, things are looking well placed at the very moment unless an unprecedented event disrupts the same. So, let’s focus on sectors that are likely to benefit from the move and pick some value-intrinsic stocks. Here we have highlighted four value stocks from consumer discretionary and financial sectors that have a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A or B.4 Prominent PicksWe suggest investing in Tailored Brands, Inc.

191,CFG,"Leverage, in particular financial leverage, is the amount of debt that an entity uses to buy more assets. In corporate finance, debt financing is a well-known term, which is used as a tool by companies to ensure smooth business operations. Since companies have limited funds, they need exogenous funding to boost their financial resources from time to time for expansion of operations.Even with the option for equity financing, companies prefer borrowing funds as these are easily and cheaply available. Moreover, using financial leverage rather than acquiring more equity capital is favored as equity financing reduces the earnings per share of existing shareholders.Yet the word “debt” is unnerving for many.  This is because while debt brings with it the capacity to spend a little bit more, it also carries the burden of repayment with additional interest in the future.  In fact, the related amount of interest expense may overwhelm the borrower if it does not earn sufficient returns to offset the interest expense. This is a particular problem when interest rates rise or the returns from assets decline.Also when theamount of debt a company bears becomes exorbitant, it poses greater risk. In fact, companies with high debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt.Considering this and the fact that analysts are currently estimating a hike in U.S. interest rates at the upcoming Fed meet this month, investors may feel shaky. Nevertheless, this does not indicate that one should totally dissuade from equity investment.What investors need now is tochoose stocks prudently, avoiding those with high debt loads. So the crux of safe investment lies in identifying low leverage stocks.And here comes the importance of leverage ratios, which have been constructed historically to safeguard investors from becoming victims of debt trap. Debt-to-equity ratio is one such measure, perhaps the most popular one, to evaluate a company’s credit worthiness, for potential equity investments.Analyzing Debt-to-EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business, thereby making it a better investment pick.As we approach the end of Q4, the growth picture seems to be improving compared to what we saw in the year-ago quarter. Naturally, this would entice investors to pour money in stocks exhibiting solid earnings growth.But in the uncertain world of investment, markets can trip anytime, particularly affecting companies with a higher degree of financial leverage. Therefore, blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth without considering their debt level might not be a wise move.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure safe returns.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy): Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 20 stocks that made it through the screen.Norbord Inc.

192,CFG,"Riding on higher revenues, Citizens Financial Group (CFG  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.3% in third-quarter 2017. Adjusted earnings per share of 68 cents topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents. The figure excludes the impact of after-tax benefit from the sale of a Troubled Debt Restructuring portfolio.

However, revenues were up 5% year over year.Citizens Financial’s net interest income increased 12% year over year to $1.06 billion. The rise is primarily attributable to average loan growth and improved margin. In addition, net interest margin expanded 21 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.05%, mainly due to enhanced loan yields and higher interest rates, partly mitigated by increase in funding costs.Also, non-interest income declined12% year over year to $381 million. The fall is reflected by lower mortgage banking fees along with foreign exchange and interest rate products income.Non-interest expenses were down 1% year over year to $858 million. The decrease reflects fall in outside services and other operating expenses.Efficiency ratio declined to 59% in the third quarter from 63% in the prior-year quarter. Generally, lower ratio is indicative of the bank’s improved efficiency.As of Sep 30, 2017, period end total loan and lease balances increased 1% from the prior quarter to $111.4 billion while total deposits remained flat sequentially at $113.2 billion.Credit Quality ImprovesAs of Sep 30, 2017, allowance for loan and lease losses decreased 1% year over year to $1.2 billion.

193,CFG,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (CFG  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Citizens Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16.97, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.28. While Citizens Financial’s current PE level puts it slightly above its midpoint of 16.04 over the past few years, it stands below the highs for the stock, indicating good scope for entry.The stock’s PE stands close to the Zacks Finance sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 16.77. At the very least, this indicates that the stock’s valuation is almost in line with its peers. We should also point out that Citizens Financial has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 15.99, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Citizens Financial stock in the near term too.P/CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn’t take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business. This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company’s management, and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company’s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. However, it is not commonly used for cross-industry comparison, as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry.In this case, Citizens Financial’s P/CF ratio of 11.95 is lower than the Zacks Finance-Savings industry average of 13.47, which indicates that the stock is somewhat undervalued in this respect.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Citizens Financial currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Citizens Financial a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Citizens Financial is 1.06, a level that is lower than the industry average of 2.00. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, CFG is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Citizens Financial might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of F. This gives CFG a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging. The current quarter and full year have seen five and seven estimates go higher in the past sixty days, respectively compared to no downward revisions.This has had a somewhat positive impact on the consensus estimate, as the full year consensus estimate has risen by nearly 2% in the past two months, while the current quarter estimate has remained unchanged. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:This somewhat bullish trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term.Citizens Financial Group, Inc. Price and Consensus  Citizens Financial Group, Inc. Price and Consensus | Citizens Financial Group, Inc. QuoteBottom LineCitizens Financial is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, this Zacks Rank #2 stock belongs to an industry which is ranked among the Top 31% out of more than 250 Zacks industries, which indicates that broader factors are favorable for the company.So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

194,CFG,"A stock’s Price-to-Sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company.If the Price-to-Sales ratio is 1, it means that investors are paying $1 for every $1 of revenues generated by the company. So it goes without saying that a stock with Price-to-Sales below 1 is a good bargain, as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar’s worth.Thus, a stock with a lower Price-to-Sales ratio is more suitable for investment versus a stock with a high Price-to-Sales ratio.Though Price-to-Earnings is the first thing to cross one’s mind while using valuation metrics, Price-to-Sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development, generating meager or no profits.While a loss-making company with a negative Price-to-Earnings ratio falls out of investor favor, its Price-to-Sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business. This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company's growth is not overvalued.Price-to-Sales is often preferred over Price-to-Earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures. However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable.However, one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low Price-to-Sales is not an ideal choice. The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point, leading to further share issuance and a rise in market cap and ultimately a higher Price-to-Sales ratio.In any case, the Price-to-Sales ratio used in isolation can’t do the trick. One should also analyze other ratios like Price/Earnings, Price/Book and Debt/Equity before arriving at any investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry: The lower the Price-to-Sales ratio, the better.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry: The lower, the better.Price to Book (common Equity) less than Median Price to Book for its Industry: This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock.Debt to Equity (Most Recent) less than Median Debt to Equity for its Industry: A company with less debt should have a stable Price-to-Sales ratio.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are seven of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:Universal Forest Products Inc.

196,CFG,"M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 19, before the opening bell. The company’s revenues and earnings are expected to show improvement over the year-ago quarter.M&T Bank has a mixed surprise history. It surpassed earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3.4%.In the previous quarter, the company easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 21 cents. Earnings were supported by improved loan and deposit balances. Further, eased margin pressure aided the top line. However, higher expenses and provisions were the headwinds.M&T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise M&T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | M&T Bank Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model shows that M&T Bank doesn’t have the right combination of two key ingredients – positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better – to increase the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for M&T Bank is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $2.28 matches the Zacks Consensus Estimate.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: M&T Bank’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Factors at PlayNet Interest Income Might Grow: Given a higher interest rate environment and rebound in average loan growth, net interest income is likely to show improvement in the second quarter.Pressure on Net Interest Margin (NIM) Might Ease: Though the prolonged low-rate environment has taken a toll on the bank’s margins over the past several quarters, the recent hike in interest rates should alleviate some pressure. However, lower treasury yields may curb the positive effect to some extent.Decline in Fee Income: Fee income might be affected by dismal global M&A activities in the quarter. Further, a higher interest rate environment might have affected its mortgage banking business.  Expenses to Trend Higher: Expenses might trend upward in the upcoming release due to digitization and investments in technology. Further, management expects nominal growth in expenses this year.Activities of M&T Bank during the quarter were adequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter increased slightly to $2.28, over the last seven days.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming reports.Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

197,CFG,"Navient Corporation (NAVI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 17, after the market closes. Both revenues and earnings are expected to decline on a year-over-year basis.A lawsuit was filed against Navient earlier this month, alleging it of conducting improper lending practices, costing billions of dollars to borrowers. Based on this news, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for to-be-reported quarter has been revised 2% downward to 48 cents over the last seven days, which reflects a year-over-year decline of 3.3%.Moreover, the company has a weak surprise history. Navient lagged earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 2.4%.Navient Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Navient Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Navient Corporation QuoteFactors to Influence Q3 ResultsHigher Legal Expenses: The company’s legal expenses will likely remain elevated due to the lawsuits filed against it in the current year.Increased Expenses From Investment in Technology: Navient acquired two technologically advanced companies in the to-be-reported quarter, in line with its aim to expand services outside the educational industry. These acquisitions should result in higher expenses.Easing Margin Pressure: Navient’s prime-indexed assets lag the rise in short-term rates by a quarter. As a result, pressure on net interest margin (NIM) will likely ease based on previous rate hikes.Moreover, with the acquisition of JPMorgan’s educational loan portfolio, consisting of federally guaranteed student loans and whole private education loans in the previous quarter, NIM is anticipated to be higher.Let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model doesn’t conclusively show that Navient will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around, as it does not have the right combination of two key components. Note that a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better has significantly higher chances of beating estimates.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Navient is -4.83%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Navient currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks worth considering in the finance space, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Sallie Mae (SLM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

199,CFG,"A stock’s Price-to-Sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company.If the Price-to-Sales ratio is 1, it means that investors are paying $1 for every $1 of revenues generated by the company. So it goes without saying that a stock with Price-to-Sales below 1 is a good bargain, as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar’s worth.  Thus, a stock with a lower Price-to-Sales ratio is more suitable for investment compared to a stock with a high Price-to-Sales ratio.While Price-to-Earnings is the first thing to cross one’s mind while using valuation metrics, Price-to-Sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development, generating meager or no profits.Though a loss-making company with a negative Price-to-Earnings ratio falls out of investors’ favor, its Price-to-Sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business. This underrated ratio is also used to identify recovery situation or ensure that a company's growth is not overvalued.Price-to-Sales is often preferred over Price-to-Earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures. However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable.Nonetheless, one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low Price-to-Sales is not an ideal choice. The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point, leading to further share issuance and a rise in market cap and ultimately a higher Price-to-Sales ratio.In any case, the Price-to-Sales ratio used in isolation can’t do the trick. One should also analyze other ratios like Price/Earnings, Price/Book, Debt/Equity before arriving at any investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry: The lower the Price-to-Sales ratio, the better.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry: The lower, the better.Price to Book (common Equity) less than Median Price to Book for its Industry: This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock.Debt to Equity (Most Recent) less than Median Debt to Equity for its Industry: A company with less debt should have a stable Price-to-Sales ratio.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are seven of the 21 stocks that qualified the screening:Hibbett Sports Inc.

200,CFG,"BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, BB&T’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Improvement in both net interest income and non-interest income drove the better-than-expected results. However, higher operating expenses remained a headwind.In fact, BB&T boasts a decent earnings surprise history, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 4.8%.However, the company’s activities in the second-quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings has remained stable at 77 cents.Moreover, despite an improving operating environment and increasing interest rates, BB&T’s price performance has not been impressive. The company’s shares have lost 4.5% year to date, as against the Zacks categorized Banks - Major Regional industry’s growth of 6%.BB&T Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  BB&T Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | BB&T Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersBefore we delve deeper into the factors that are likely to influence the results, let’s check what our quantitative model predicts.Our proven model does not conclusively predict that BB&T will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around.

However, we also need to have a positive Earnings ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsRising Rates to Boost Margin: With the improvement in the rate scenario, BB&T’s net interest margin might have improved in the quarter. The company expects the March rate hike to lead to an increase in core NIM by 2–4 basis points on a sequential basis.Revenues to Improve Slightly: There was a modest improvement in loan demand in the quarter. The company projects average loans to grow 1–3% sequentially, driven by improvement in commercial, specialized and retail loan portfolios. Higher loan balances might have supported net interest income growth to some extent.Notably, the company expects NII to improve in the range of 2–4%, given the improved margin assumption. Also, fee income is expected to be up 6–8% year over year.Expenses Might Increase Modestly: Excluding merger-related and restructuring charges, BB&T expects expenses to remain flat or increase slightly on a year over year basis.Asset Quality to Support Results: BB&T expects loan loss provision to match net charge-offs (NCOs) in the quarter. Also, management expects NCOs to remain in the range of 0.35–0.45%. Non-performing asset levels will likely remain stable sequentially.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

201,CFG,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20, before the market opens. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, BNY Mellon’s adjusted earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. A rise in revenues and provision benefits were offset by an increase in expenses and, lower foreign exchange and other trading revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents has remained stable over the last seven days in the absence of any estimate revisions.Also, BNY Mellon does not have a very impressive earnings surprise history. The company delivered positive surprises in only two of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 2.8%.Nevertheless, shares of the company has gained 12.6% year to date, outperforming the Zacks categorized Banks - Major Regional industry’s growth of 6%.Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) QuoteEarnings WhispersBefore delving deeper into the factors that are likely to influence the results, let’s check what our quantitative model predicts.Our proven model doesn’t conclusively predict if BNY Mellon will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around.

However, we also need to have a positive Earnings ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsWe believe that the Mar 2017 rate hike should have had a positive impact on BNY Mellon’s margin in the second quarter. Moreover, management was of the opinion that any future rate hikes will lead to further improvement in margin. Based on this expectation, we believe the June rate hike to have a slight positive impact on margin in the quarter.The company believes that improving margins will more than offset the impact of reduced size of balance sheet, thus a modest increase in net interest revenue is expected in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, the company expects NIR to increase nearly 2–4% on a sequential basis.On the expense front, management expects legal and professional expenses to be slightly higher in the quarter due to ongoing compliance costs. However, total costs are expected to remain flat on a year-over-year basis.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

202,CFG,"“It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.” – Warren Buffett. The strategy is very simple – find stocks that are trading below their inherent worth.Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. So chances are high that these stocks will allow investors to book profits when the market trends upward.There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential. Each ratio helps an investor to understand a particular aspect of the company’s business. One such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis – the lower the number, the better.Why Price to Cash Flow?You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, one of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. Then again, cash flow is quite reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder friendly moves. On the other hand, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of “A” or “B” to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are four of the seven stocks that qualified the screening:Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.

203,CFG,"Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Jul 21. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.The company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. It topped earnings in three of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 19.6%.In the last quarter, the company delivered in line earnings driven by increase in net interest income and lower provisions. However, lower non-interest income was an undermining factor.Looking at the price performance, Fifth Third’s shares have gained 3.7% year to date, outperforming the Zacks categorized Banks – Major Regional industry’s decline of 1.7%.Fifth Third Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise Fifth Third Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise | Fifth Third Bancorp QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?According to our proven model, Fifth Third has the right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +2.38%. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.Zacks Rank: Fifth Third’s Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Drive Better-than-Expected ResultsExpenses Might Remain Flat: Fifth Third’s ongoing strategic investments in several areas, including technology, will increase expenses. However, the company might be successful in offsetting these factors through its North Star initiatives.Sluggish Loan Growth: Impacted by uncertainties related to the proposed reforms by President Trump, overall loan growth is anticipated to be slow for the to-be-reported quarter. This might curb net interest income growth driven by improved interest rate scenario.Alleviated Pressure on Net Interest Margin: The interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve in Mar 2017, followed by another in Jun 2017, should ease some margin pressure. However, contraction in the three-month/10-year Treasury spread might offset some benefits.Fifth Third’s activities during the quarter were, however, inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at 42 cents, over the last seven days.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

204,CFG,"Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) CEO Tim Sloan announced plans to regain trust the bank has lost due to its involvement in several malpractices lately, at the global conference held by Barclays (BCS  -  Free Report) last Tuesday. Also, he disclosed that the bank is planning to achieve an additional $2 billion reduction in expenses by the end of 2019.The bank is in the process of achieving its previous savings goal of $2 billion by year-end 2018. It seeks to achieve the target majorly by streamlining human resource, marketing, technology and operations departments. Further, it aims to close about 450 branches by 2018.For 2017, the bank expects third party expenses, including those related to sales practices, to remain high in the third quarter, while decline in fourth quarter. Also, efficiency ratio is expected to be below last three-quarter level.Regarding lending activities, Sloan said the bank is expected to witness continued decline in auto loans along with run off of the junior lien mortgage portfolio. Further, the lending is to be impacted by a slow and increasingly competitive commercial and commercial real estate lending environment. The decline in loans is to be partially offset by growth in non-conforming residential first mortgage.The revelation of fake account scandal that marked the starting point for the several problems for the bank was followed by the disclosure of issues in auto insurance business and online bill pay services.Tim Sloan reiterated several structural and strategic remedial measures undertaken by the bank. Elimination of sales goals, a layer of management and introduction of training for retail bank managers on acceptable sales practices were some of the steps taken.We expect Wells Fargo’s focus on managing its business and efforts to remediate the wrong doings in the past to uplift its reputation. Also, its expense saving initiatives are likely to support its financials.Shares of Wells Fargo have lost 6.4% year to date, versus the industry’s rally of 4.1%.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the same space are State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) and Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

205,CFG,"The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 18, before the market opens. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue growth, primarily driven by an increase in equity market volatility, lower level of fee waivers and absence of provisions were among the positives. These were, however, offset by higher expenses.The company boasts a decent earnings surprise history, delivering an average beat of 2.1% in the trailing four quarters.Schwab’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 9% year to date, outperforming the Zacks categorized Investment-Brokers industry’s almost flat performance. The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteWill the stock’s rally continue post second-quarter earnings release?

These assets, along with improvement in the rate scenario, may have helped Schwab experience higher net interest revenue during the quarter.Decline in Fee Waivers: Following the rate hikes in December and March, Schwab witnessed a decline in almost all its fee waivers.

207,CFG,"While price-to-earnings and price-to-sales are the first to cross one’s mind while using valuation metrics, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also a convenient valuation metric.The P/B ratio measures how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock. It determines whether a company's asset value is comparable to the stock’s market price or not and hence can be useful for finding value stocksP/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.Understanding Book ValueBook value is usually denoted on a company's balance sheet as ""stockholder equity.There are several ways by which book value can be defined.  It is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this will equate to common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value.Explaining the P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s share price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has a bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the eight stocks that qualified the screening:Magellan Health, Inc.

208,CFG,"Investors always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks. But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless you are blessed with Midas touch.When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. So, the chance of outperformance is high when the market moves higher.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we would suggest considering Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better.Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial Health Questions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. On the other hand, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.What’s the Optimum Strategy?However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account price-to-book, price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should give you even better results as they eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Magellan Health, Inc.

The company originated nearly $397 million of debt and equity commitments to new and existing portfolio companies in the first half of 2017. Such robust loan originations position it well for growth.Further, Hercules Capital’s steady capital deployment activities continue to enhance investors’ confidence. Back in 2009, its board of directors adopted a policy to distribute four quarterly dividends in an amount approximating 90-100% of the company’s taxable income. Also, management revisits its dividend policy at the end of every quarter in order to ensure if any special dividend needs to be paid or not. Moreover, the company’s favorable debt/equity ratio when compared to the broader industry makes these activities sustainable.Higher Costs a DragHowever, increasing operating expenses is a matter of concern for the company. Costs have risen at a CAGR of 7.5% over the last four years (ended 2016). Continued increase in compensation costs is mainly attributable to this rise. Also, the company’s aim to expand originations is likely to keep expenses elevated in the near term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report), Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

210,CFG,"Recently, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) marked its presence in the U.K. consumer lending market by making an investment of £100 million in Neyber, a start-up loan provider. The loans the company provides are repaid through the borrowers’ salaries. The news was reported by Financial Times.Brief on NeyberFounded in 2014, by two former employees of Goldman Sachs, Neyber collaborates with companies in order to offer loans at rates lower than other lenders. Per the article, Neyber is in business with companies such as City Airport, Anglian Water, Bupa, some National Health Service trusts and is also in talks with some of the retailers and professional services firms.The company remains confident of its structure and expects low default rate, as the repayments are made directly out of salaries of the borrowers. Neyber is said to have provided about 7000 loans of up to £25,000 each, and has faced nearly 30 defaulters as of now. Further, it claims to have saved borrowers nearly £14 million in interest payments.Goldman Sachs Investment in NeyberGoldman Sachs provided £100 million of debt and equity financing to Neyber through its private capital unit, which seeks to finance medium-sized companies. This resulted in Goldman Sachs becoming a minority investor in Neyber.Other Venture Plans in UKGoldman Sachs is planning to expand throughout the U.K. by launching an online deposit business in mid-2018. The investment banker views this expansion as an opportunity to counter the current unstable economic environment and bolster revenue growth.Shares of Goldman Sachs have gained 32.4% over the past 12 months, outperforming the 28.3% rally for the industry.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report), Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

However, pending legal issues remain a concern.The company maintained its earnings beat streak in the last reported quarter. The results reflected higher revenues and lower provisions for loan losses. However, higher expenses offset the positives.Further, the company’s capital strength is reflected in its involvement in inorganic growth activities.

212,CFG,"Riding on higher revenues, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (CFG  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.8% in second-quarter 2017. Earnings per share of 63 cents topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents. Also, the reported figure improved 37% year over year.Continued growth in loan and deposit balances, aiding higher revenues, was recorded. Eased margin pressure and lower provisions were the positives.

However, revenues were up 9% year over year.Citizens Financial’s net interest income increased 11% year over year to $1.03 billion. The rise is primarily attributable to average loan growth and improved margin. In addition, net interest margin expanded 13 basis points (bps) year over year to 2.97%, mainly due to enhanced loan yields and higher interest rates, partly mitigated by securities portfolio growth, and elevated deposit and funding costs.Also, non-interest income climbed 4% year over year to $370 million. The rise was driven by strength in almost all components of income, partially offset by reduced net securities gains and other income.Non-interest expenses were up 4% year over year to $864 million. The increase reflects rise in all categories of expenses except equipment-related costs.Efficiency ratio declined to 62% in the second quarter from 65% in the prior-year quarter. Generally, lower ratio is indicative of the bank’s improved efficiency.As of Jun 30, 2017, period end total loan and lease balances increased 1% sequentially to $109.8 billion while total deposits rose 1% from the previous quarter to $113.6 billion.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAs of Jun 30, 2017, allowance for loan and lease losses increased 2% year over year to $1.2 billion.

Notably, including common stock dividends, the company returned $957 million to shareholders as of Jun 30, 2017.Outlook 2017The company’s Tapping Our Potential (TOP) initiatives remain on track. In 2016, TOP II recorded about $105 million of annual pre-tax benefits. Further, TOP III is expected to result in pre-tax revenue and expense run-rate benefits of $110 million, including $20 million of tax benefits in 2017.Further, TOP IV initiatives are expected to deliver $90–$105 million of run-rate pre-tax revenue and expense benefits by the end of 2018. These initiatives are expected to help drive continued positive operating leverage and fund investments for future growth.Our ViewpointResults highlight a decent quarter for Citizen Financial.

214,CFG,"Industrial goods manufacturer Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 21. In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 2%, beating estimates on three occasions. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors in the Second QuarterDuring the quarter, Honeywell pledged its support yet again for eco-friendly products with the announcement of the start of commercial operations in its new manufacturing plant in Geismar, LA. The facility will manufacture HFO-1234yf, sold commercially as Solstice yf, to meet the increasing demand for this environment friendly air conditioning refrigerant for the auto industry. Honeywell has invested significantly to build this state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Louisiana, which is likely to become the world’s largest producer of Solstice yf. In the process, the company also created several jobs in the area to boost the economic development of the region. With a ramp up in production, 40 million cars are expected to use Solstice yf by the end of 2017, up from its present tally of 20 million. Higher adoption of this refrigerant across the globe is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions produced by over 30 million cars. With such state-of-the-art products, Honeywell aims to gain a competitive edge over its rivals and augment its revenues.Also, the company inked a definitive agreement to acquire Nextnine, a privately held security management solutions provider for industrial cyber security, for an undisclosed amount. The transaction is likely to augment Honeywell’s cyber security portfolio with complementary products and services. Nextnine’s comprehensive portfolio will also be utilized in Honeywell Connected Plant that facilitates connected plant operations to improve plant availability, safety and reliability quotients.However, Honeywell expects a tepid demand pattern for its business jets and mobile scanners in 2017 due to sluggish global growth, volatility in crude oil prices and a tempered Chinese economy. Consequently, the company projects 2017 revenues to be down 1% to up 2% year over year.Although the company’s proactive restructuring initiatives have positioned it better than many of its peers, it is yet to witness signs of stabilization in a number of its major end markets. A change in the U.S. government’s defense and aerospace funding could also adversely impact sales of Aerospace’s defense and space-related products and services. The high research and development costs could also be a drag on the Aerospace segment margin and affect its profitability.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Honeywell is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is  0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the consensus estimate are both pegged at $1.78. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Honeywell International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Honeywell International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Honeywell International Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: Honeywell has a Zacks Rank #3. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Citizens Financial Group, Inc (CFG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.70% and a Zacks Rank #2.

However, the contraction in the three-month/10-year Treasury spread might offset some benefits.Growth in Average Loan Balance: Comerica’s average loans are likely to increase given a seasonal rebound in the mortgage banker finance. Further, clearing of some uncertainties related to Trump’s policies and a slightly better lending scenario was witnessed in the second quarter.Lower Fee income: Owing to the decline in M&As and equity issuance activities in the quarter, Comerica’s fee income might witness some pressure.Effective Cost Saving Initiatives: Expenses might trend downward in the upcoming release due to the company’s GEAR Up expense savings initiatives.Activities of Comerica during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence.

The company’s earnings and revenues are expected to grow on a year-over-year basis.The company topped earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 2.3%.In the last quarter, the company lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to elevated expenses and higher provision for credit losses.

It majorly depends on whether the firm is able to impress the market with the results.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?According to our proven model, Huntington has the right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +4.35%.

There are synergies of the FirstMerit acquisition to support.Alleviated Margin Pressure: The latest hike in interest rates might be successful in easing margin pressure to some extent. However, the contraction in the three-month/10-year Treasury spread might offset some benefits.Loan Growth: Though the quarter witnessed slow loan growth due to the lack of any tangible progress on the regulatory reform front, slight growth in loan balances can be witnessed due to the optimism prevailing in the market. Management expects loan growth to be in the range of 4–6% in 2017.Manageable Expenses: Though management remains focused on controlling expenses, we are apprehensive about the company’s continued investments. Huntington anticipates implementing cost savings related to the acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation. Also, there were no major outflows related to legal settlements that might impact the firm’s earnings unusually in the to-be-reported quarter.Huntington’s activities during the quarter, however, failed to win analysts’ confidence.
